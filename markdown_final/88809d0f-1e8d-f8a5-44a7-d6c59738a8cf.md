## Question

A patient with metastatic colorectal cancer ineligible for intensive therapy previously experienced severe capecitabine-associated hand–foot syndrome. Based on SOLSTICE, which bevacizumab-based doublet would you favor and why?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which bevacizumab-based doublet to favor for a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer who is ineligible for intensive therapy and previously had severe capecitabine-associated hand-foot syndrome, with the decision anchored to SOLSTICE. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the key toxicity constraint. Then, I should verify the SOLSTICE trial design, endpoints, and efficacy results. Next, I will examine safety signals, especially hand-foot syndrome and hematologic toxicity. After that, I should review guideline positions and how they interpret SOLSTICE. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation with monitoring and dose-modification considerations, and I will double-check for any conflicting data or caveats before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and the toxicity constraint. The patient has metastatic colorectal cancer and is ineligible for intensive cytotoxic therapy, and there is a history of severe capecitabine-associated hand-foot syndrome, which is a pivotal safety consideration that could recur or worsen with re-exposure to capecitabine, potentially limiting adherence and quality of life [^113Xt1Y8] [^113rb97R].

> I need to check the SOLSTICE trial details to anchor the comparison. SOLSTICE was a phase 3, open-label, randomized study comparing trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab versus capecitabine plus bevacizumab as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable mCRC ineligible for intensive therapy, with progression-free survival as the primary endpoint and safety as a key secondary endpoint, and it enrolled 856 patients across 25 countries [^1178nVuH] [^114B5qQL].

> Now, I should verify the efficacy results. Wait, let me verify the median PFS and hazard ratio precisely. The median PFS was 9.4 months with trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab versus 9.3 months with capecitabine plus bevacizumab, with a hazard ratio of 0.87 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.75 to 1.02; importantly, the protocol-defined significance threshold of p less than 0.021 was not met, so trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab was not superior to capecitabine plus bevacizumab for PFS, indicating similar efficacy between arms [^1178nVuH] [^114B5qQL].

> Next, I should review safety, especially hand-foot syndrome, because that is the decisive toxicity here. Hold on, I should verify the exact grade 3 or higher rates. In SOLSTICE, grade 3 or higher hand-foot syndrome occurred in 0% of patients receiving trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab versus 15% of patients receiving capecitabine plus bevacizumab, which is a striking difference and directly relevant to this patient's prior severe HFS; conversely, trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab had more hematologic toxicity, with grade 3 or higher neutropenia in 52% versus 1% with capecitabine plus bevacizumab, and anemia in 14% versus 4%, respectively, without new safety signals overall [^1178nVuH] [^114B5qQL].

> I should confirm how guidelines interpret these data. The NCCN Panel notes that while SOLSTICE and TASCO1 show similar OS and PFS between trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab and capecitabine plus bevacizumab, concerns about hematologic and financial toxicity lead them not to recommend trifluridine/tipiracil, with or without bevacizumab, as first-line therapy; however, this recommendation is not absolute and must be balanced against patient-specific toxicity risks, such as severe prior HFS, which can materially alter the risk-benefit calculus in favor of avoiding capecitabine [^114R6Z7p] [^116dwLpE].

> Let me consider practical implications and monitoring. If trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab is chosen, I need to ensure proactive management of myelosuppression with baseline and periodic CBCs, dose holds for grade 3 neutropenia, and consideration of growth factor support per institutional policy; conversely, if capecitabine were reconsidered despite prior severe HFS, I should confirm a strict HFS mitigation plan with early dose interruption, dose reduction, and supportive care, recognizing the 15% grade 3 HFS signal in SOLSTICE and the patient's prior severity, which elevates recurrence risk and may impair adherence [^1178nVuH] [^113Xt1Y8].

> But wait, what if I am overstating the HFS advantage of trifluridine/tipiracil. I should double-check corroborating data. The phase II TASCO1 trial similarly showed markedly less grade 3 HFS with trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab compared with capecitabine plus bevacizumab, reinforcing the safety signal seen in SOLSTICE, which strengthens the case for avoiding capecitabine in patients with a history of severe HFS when efficacy is comparable [^1131z2pL].

> Synthesis and recommendation: Given similar efficacy in SOLSTICE and the dramatic reduction in grade 3 hand-foot syndrome with trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab, I would favor trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab for this patient, balancing the trade-off of increased hematologic toxicity with vigilant monitoring and supportive care; I would explicitly avoid re-exposing the patient to capecitabine given the prior severe HFS and the 15% grade 3 HFS rate in the capecitabine arm, and I would document shared decision-making around costs, pill burden, and blood count surveillance [^1178nVuH] [^114R6Z7p].

---

I would choose **trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab** for this patient because SOLSTICE showed similar efficacy to capecitabine plus bevacizumab but with **no grade 3 hand-foot syndrome** [^1178nVuH] and a different, manageable hematologic toxicity profile [^114B5qQL]. Given the prior severe capecitabine-associated hand-foot syndrome, avoiding capecitabine is prudent; trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab is a guideline-supported alternative for patients ineligible for intensive therapy [^notfound].

---

## Efficacy comparison from SOLSTICE

SOLSTICE directly compared trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab versus capecitabine plus bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ineligible for intensive therapy [^1178nVuH]. The results showed **similar efficacy** between the two regimens:

- **Progression-free survival (PFS)**: Median PFS was 9.4 months with trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab versus 9.3 months with capecitabine plus bevacizumab (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75–1.02; p = 0.0464, not meeting the protocol-defined significance threshold of p = 0.021) [^1178nVuH].

- **Overall survival (OS)**: Median OS was 19.74 months with trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab versus 18.59 months with capecitabine plus bevacizumab, with similar survival probabilities at various time points [^113n82m2].

- **Response rates**: Objective response rates were comparable between the two arms, indicating similar antitumor activity [^114B5qQL].

---

## Safety profiles and toxicity considerations

The safety profiles of the two regimens differ significantly, particularly regarding **hand-foot syndrome (HFS)** [^1178nVuH]:

| **Toxicity** | **Trifluridine/tipiracil + bevacizumab** | **Capecitabine + bevacizumab** |
|-|-|-|
| Grade 3 hand-foot syndrome | 0% | 15% |
| Grade 3 neutropenia | 52% | 1% |
| Grade 3 anemia | 14% | 4% |
| Grade 3 diarrhea | 1% | 8% |

---

Trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab was associated with **significantly higher rates of hematologic toxicities**, particularly neutropenia and anemia, but notably had no cases of grade 3 hand-foot syndrome, compared with 15% in the capecitabine arm [^1178nVuH]. This is a critical consideration for patients with a history of severe capecitabine-associated hand-foot syndrome.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines acknowledge the findings of SOLSTICE and provide recommendations for patients ineligible for intensive therapy. The NCCN guidelines state that while trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab showed similar efficacy to capecitabine plus bevacizumab, concerns regarding hematologic toxicity and cost limit its routine first-line use [^115ZrsxK]. However, in patients with a history of severe hand-foot syndrome or other capecitabine-related toxicities, **trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab is a reasonable alternative** [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision-making

Several patient-specific factors should be considered in this scenario:

- **Prior severe hand-foot syndrome**: The patient's history of severe capecitabine-associated hand-foot syndrome significantly increases the risk of recurrence or worsening toxicity with re-exposure to capecitabine [^notfound].

- **Performance status and comorbidities**: The patient is ineligible for intensive therapy, suggesting a need for a regimen with manageable toxicity and acceptable quality of life.

- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making should incorporate patient preferences regarding treatment schedule, route of administration, and potential side effects [^116dwLpE].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's history of severe capecitabine-associated hand-foot syndrome and the similar efficacy demonstrated in SOLSTICE, **trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab is the preferred bevacizumab-based doublet**. This regimen avoids the risk of recurrent severe hand-foot syndrome while providing comparable efficacy. Although hematologic toxicity is higher, it is generally manageable with appropriate monitoring and supportive care.

The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Background

Trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab has shown efficacy in previous phase 2 studies including patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer. We aimed to investigate first-line trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab versus capecitabine plus bevacizumab in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer ineligible for intensive treatment.

Methods

In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 study, we enrolled patients aged 18 years and older with histologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer, ineligible for full-dose doublet or triplet chemotherapy and curative resection across 25 countries and regions. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab or capecitabine plus bevacizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity using an interactive web response system, stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), primary tumour location (right vs left colon), and the main reason for not being a candidate for intensive therapy (clinical condition vs non-clinical condition). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomisation to radiological progression or death from any cause, in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients having taken at least one dose of the study drug. The trial is ongoing, findings presented here are those of the primary analysis of progression-free survival, conducted after 629 events had occurred. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03869892.

Findings

Between March 21, 2019, and Sept 14, 2020, 856 patients (54% male, 46% female) were randomly assigned to trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab (n = 426) or capecitabine plus bevacizumab (n = 430). After a median follow-up of 16.6 months (95% CI 16.5–17.1), the hazard ratio for progression-free survival for trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab versus capecitabine plus bevacizumab was 0.87 (0.75–1.02; p = 0.0464; protocol-defined significance level of p = 0.021 not met). Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 9.4 months (95% CI 9.1–10.9) with trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab versus 9.3 months (8.9–9.8) with capecitabine plus bevacizumab. The most common grade 3 and higher treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia (220 [52%] of 423 patients in the trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab group vs six [1%] of 427 in the capecitabine plus bevacizumab group), decreased neutrophil count (78 [18%] vs four [< 1%]), anaemia (60 [14%] vs 16 [4%]), and hand-foot syndrome (none vs 61 [15%]). Nine deaths (five in the trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab group and four in the capecitabine plus bevacizumab group) were treatment related.

Interpretation

First-line trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab was not superior to capecitabine plus bevacizumab in this population. As expected, the safety profile differed between the two treatments, but there were no new safety concerns. Trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab represents a feasible alternative to capecitabine plus bevacizumab in this population.

### Bevacizumab plus capecitabine versus capecitabine alone in elderly patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer (AVEX): an open-label, randomised phase 3 trial [^116qszcU]. The Lancet: Oncology (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Elderly patients are often under-represented in clinical trials of metastatic colorectal cancer. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab plus capecitabine compared with capecitabine alone in elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

Methods

For this open-label, randomised phase 3 trial, patients aged 70 years and older with previously untreated, unresectable, metastatic colorectal cancer, who were not deemed to be candidates for oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimens, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio via an interactive voice-response system, stratified by performance status and geographical region. Treatment consisted of capecitabine (1000 mg/m² orally twice a day on days 1–14) alone or with bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg intravenously on day 1), given every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent. Efficacy analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00484939.

Findings

From July 9, 2007, to Dec 14, 2010, 280 patients with a median age of 76 years (range 70–87) were recruited from 40 sites across ten countries. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either bevacizumab plus capecitabine (n = 140) or capecitabine only (n = 140). Progression-free survival was significantly longer with bevacizumab and capecitabine than with capecitabine alone (median 9.1 months [95% CI 7.3–11.4] vs 5.1 months [4.2–6.3]; hazard ratio 0.53 [0.41–0.69]; p < 0.0001). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 53 (40%) patients in the combination group and 30 (22%) in the capecitabine group, and treatment-related serious adverse events in 19 (14%) and 11 (8%) patients. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events of special interest for bevacizumab or chemotherapy were hand-foot syndrome (21 [16%] vs nine [7%]), diarrhoea (nine [7%] vs nine [7%]), and venous thromboembolic events (11 [8%] vs six [4%]). Treatment-related deaths occurred in five patients in the combination group and four in the capecitabine group. The most common any-grade adverse event of special interest for bevacizumab was haemorrhage (34 [25%] vs nine [7%]).

Interpretation

The combination of bevacizumab and capecitabine is an effective and well-tolerated regimen for elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

### Bevacizumab in combination with biweekly capecitabine and irinotecan, as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer [^114KESpF]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment protocol

Patients were treated with BV 5 mg/kg on day 1, followed by irinotecan 175 mg/m² as a 30-min intravenous (i.v.) infusion on day 1 and capecitabine 1000 mg/m² orally twice daily; from day 2 to 8. All patients received 5-HT 3 inhibitors for emesis prophylaxis. Treatment was administered every 2 weeks and continued until disease progression, patient refusal, unacceptable toxicity or death.

Appropriate dose interruptions/reductions were implemented in the event of specific toxicities, depending on their nature and intensity. The next course of treatment only began when the neutrophil count was > 1.5 × 10⁹, the platelet count was > 100 × 10⁹, and any other treatment-related toxicities were less than or equal to grade 1; otherwise, treatment was withheld for up to 2 weeks. If adverse events did not improve to grade 0 or 1 after 3 weeks, patients were discontinued from study. For grade 2–3 hand–foot syndrome, the capecitabine treatment was withheld until a resolution to less than or equal to grade 1, the second time this toxicity occurs treatment was restarted with a 25% dose reduction.

Study assessments

A screening assessment including medical history, physical examination and a chest X-ray was conducted within 2 weeks before starting the treatment. Within 7 days before starting the treatment, further assessments included vital signs, ECOG performance status and laboratory tests (haematology; blood chemistry including liver and renal function test; and urinalysis). A computerised tomography scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis was completed within 4 weeks of starting the treatment. The assessment of response was based on investigator reported measurements according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours guidelines. CR or PR patients were required to undergo a confirmatory disease assessment at least 4 weeks later.

### Adjuvant capecitabine plus bevacizumab versus capecitabine alone in patients with colorectal cancer (QUASAR 2): an open-label, randomised phase 3 trial [^112S8xED]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Antiangiogenic agents have established efficacy in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. We investigated whether bevacizumab could improve disease-free survival in the adjuvant setting after resection of the primary tumour.

Methods

For the open-label, randomised, controlled QUASAR 2 trial, which was done at 170 hospitals in seven countries, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older with WHO performance status scores of 0 or 1 who had undergone potentially curative surgery for histologically proven stage III or high-risk stage II colorectal cancer. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive eight 3-week cycles of oral capecitabine alone (1250 mg/m² twice daily for 14 days followed by a break for 7 days) or the same regimen of oral capecitabine plus 16 cycles of 7.5 mg/kg bevacizumab by intravenous infusion over 90 min on day 1 of each cycle. Randomisation was done by a computer-generated schedule with use of minimisation with a random element stratified by age, disease stage, tumour site, and country. The study was open label and no-one was masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Toxic effects were assessed in patients who received at least one dose of randomised treatment. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN45133151.

Findings

Between April 25, 2005, and Oct 12, 2010, 1952 eligible patients were enrolled, of whom 1941 had assessable data (968 in the capecitabine alone group and 973 in the capecitabine and bevacizumab group). Median follow-up was 4.92 years (IQR 4.00–5.16). Disease-free survival at 3 years did not differ between the groups (75.4%, 95% CI 72.5–78.0 in the capecitabine and bevacizumab group vs 78.4%, 75.7–80.9 in the capecitabine alone group; hazard ratio 1.06, 95% CI 0.89–1.25, p = 0.54). The most common grade 3–4 adverse events were hand-foot syndrome (201 [21%] of 963 in the capecitabine alone group vs 257 [27%] of 959 in the capecitabine and bevacizumab group) and diarrhoea (102 [11%] vs 104 [11%]), and, with the addition of bevacizumab, expected increases were recorded in all-grade hypertension (320 [33%] vs 75 [8%]), proteinuria (197 [21%] vs 49 [5%]), and wound healing problems (30 [3%] vs 17 [2%]). 571 serious adverse events were reported (221 with capecitabine alone and 350 with capecitabine and bevacizumab). Most of these were gastrointestinal (n = 245) or cardiovascular (n = 169). 23 deaths within 6 months of randomisation were classified as being related to treatment, eight in the capecitabine alone group and 15 in the capecitabine and bevacizumab group.

Interpretation

The addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine in the adjuvant setting for colorectal cancer yielded no benefit in the treatment of an unselected population and should not be used.

### Maintenance treatment with capecitabine and bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer (CAIRO3): a phase 3 randomised controlled trial of the Dutch colorectal cancer group [^114atzAy]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimum duration of first-line treatment with chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is unknown. The CAIRO3 study was designed to determine the efficacy of maintenance treatment with capecitabine plus bevacizumab versus observation.

Methods

In this open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients in 64 hospitals in the Netherlands. We included patients older than 18 years with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer, with stable disease or better after induction treatment with six 3-weekly cycles of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab (CAPOX-B), WHO performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either maintenance treatment with capecitabine and bevacizumab (maintenance group) or observation (observation group). Randomisation was done centrally by minimisation, with stratification according to previous adjuvant chemotherapy, response to induction treatment, WHO performance status, serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration, and treatment centre. Both patients and investigators were aware of treatment assignment. We assessed disease status every 9 weeks. On first progression (defined as PFS1), patients in both groups were to receive the induction regimen of CAPOX-B until second progression (PFS2), which was the study's primary endpoint. All endpoints were calculated from the time of randomisation. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00442637.

Findings

Between May 30, 2007, and Oct 15, 2012, we randomly assigned 558 patients to either the maintenance group (n = 279) or the observation group (n = 279). Median follow-up was 48 months (IQR 36–57). The primary endpoint of median PFS2 was significantly improved in patients on maintenance treatment, and was 8.5 months in the observation group and 11.7 months in the maintenance group (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.56–0.81, p < 0.0001). This difference remained significant when any treatment after PFS1 was considered. Maintenance treatment was well tolerated, although the incidence of hand-foot syndrome was increased (64 [23%] patients with hand-foot skin reaction during maintenance). The global quality of life did not deteriorate during maintenance treatment and was clinically not different between treatment groups.

Interpretation

Maintenance treatment with capecitabine plus bevacizumab after six cycles of CAPOX-B in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is effective and does not compromise quality of life.

### First-line XELOX plus bevacizumab followed by XELOX plus bevacizumab or single-agent bevacizumab as maintenance therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: the phase III MACRO TTD study [^111JLeey]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this phase III trial was to compare the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab alone with those of bevacizumab and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) as maintenance treatment following induction chemotherapy with XELOX plus bevacizumab in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

Patients and Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of bevacizumab, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin every 3 weeks followed by XELOX plus bevacizumab or bevacizumab alone until progression. The primary endpoint was the progression-free survival (PFS) interval; secondary endpoints were the overall survival (OS) time, objective response rate (RR), time to response, duration of response, and safety.

Results

The intent-to-treat population comprised 480 patients (XELOX plus bevacizumab, n = 239; bevacizumab, n = 241); there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. The median follow-up was 29.0 months (range, 0–53.2 months). There were no statistically significant differences in the median PFS or OS times or in the RR between the two arms. The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicities in the XELOX plus bevacizumab versus bevacizumab arms were diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome, and neuropathy.

Conclusion

Although the noninferiority of bevacizumab versus XELOX plus bevacizumab cannot be confirmed, we can reliably exclude a median PFS detriment > 3 weeks. This study suggests that maintenance therapy with single-agent bevacizumab may be an appropriate option following induction XELOX plus bevacizumab in mCRC patients.

### Trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab versus capecitabine plus bevacizumab as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ineligible for intensive therapy (SOLSTICE): a randomised, open-label phase 3 study [^114B5qQL]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

The study SOLSTICE (colorectal cancer) was published by Thierry André and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol. This study is related to the following diseases: Colon cancer and Rectal cancer. In the SOLSTICE (colorectal cancer) study, the trial question was: is first-line trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab superior to capecitabine plus bevacizumab in patients with metastatic CRC ineligible for intensive therapy? In the SOLSTICE (colorectal cancer) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SOLSTICE (colorectal cancer) study, the population was: 856 patients (394 female, 462 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with histologically confirmed metastatic CRC, ineligible for full-dose doublet or triplet chemotherapy and curative resection. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; symptomatic CNS metastases; major surgery within 4 weeks prior to randomization; allergy/contraindication to study drugs. In the SOLSTICE (colorectal cancer) study, the interventions were: n = 426 trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab (oral trifluridine-tipiracil 35 mg/m² BID on days 1–5 and 8–12 plus 5 mg/kg bevacizumab IV on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle) n = 430 capecitabine plus bevacizumab (oral capecitabine 1,250 mg/m² BID on days 1–15 of each cycle plus 7.5 mg/kg intravenous bevacizumab on day 1 of each 21-day cycle). In the SOLSTICE (colorectal cancer) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in progression-free survival (9.4 months vs. 9.3 months; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.02). In the SOLSTICE (colorectal cancer) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in overall response rate (36% vs. 42%; RR 0.86, 95% CI -0.14 to 1.86) No significant difference in disease control rates (86% vs. 85%; RR 1.01, 95% CI -2.9 to 4.92). In the SOLSTICE (colorectal cancer) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in treatment-related deaths. significant differences in ≥ grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (52% vs. 1%), decreased neutrophil count (18% vs. < 1%), anemia (14% vs. 4%), hand-foot syndrome (0% vs. 15%). In the SOLSTICE (colorectal cancer) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with histologically confirmed metastatic CRC, ineligible for full-dose doublet or triplet chemotherapy and curative resection, trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab was not superior to capecitabine plus bevacizumab with respect to a progression-free survival.

### Randomized phase III study of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin compared with fluorouracil / folinic acid plus oxaliplatin as first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer [^114VRkdX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate whether capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) is noninferior to fluorouracil. folinic acid, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) as first-line therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC).

Patients and Methods

The initial design of this trial was a randomized, two-arm, noninferiority, phase III comparison of XELOX versus FOLFOX-4. After patient accrual had begun, the trial design was amended in 2003 after bevacizumab phase III data became available. The resulting 2 x 2 factorial design randomly assigned patients to XELOX versus FOLFOX-4, and then to also receive either bevacizumab or placebo. We report here the results of the analysis of the XELOX versus FOLFOX-4 arms. The analysis of bevacizumab versus placebo with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is reported separately. The prespecified primary end point for the noninferiority analysis was progression-free survival.

Results

The intent-to-treat population comprised 634 patients from the original two-arm portion of the study, plus an additional 1,400 patients after the start of the amended 2 x 2 design, for a total of 2,034 patients. The median PFS was 8.0 months in the pooled XELOX-containing arms versus 8.5 months in the FOLFOX-4-containing arms (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 97.5% CI, 0.93 to 1.16). The median overall survival was 19.8 months with XELOX versus 19.6 months with FOLFOX-4 (HR, 0.99; 97.5% CI, 0.88 to 1.12). FOLFOX-4 was associated with more grade 3/4 neutropenia/granulocytopenia and febrile neutropenia than XELOX, and XELOX with more grade 3 diarrhea and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome than FOLFOX-4.

Conclusion

XELOX is noninferior to FOLFOX-4 as a first-line treatment for MCRC, and may be considered as a routine treatment option for appropriate patients.

### A randomized, phase II trial of standard triweekly compared with dose-dense biweekly capecitabine plus oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer: XELOX-A-DVS (dense versus standard) [^115naZbD]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Capecitabine administered for 7 days biweekly with oxaliplatin (XELOX) biweekly has been reported to have activity and safety profiles similar to those of standard capecitabine given for 14 days triweekly. Multiple studies have shown that the addition of bevacizumab to 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy is active and well tolerated.

Methods

Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) were randomized to XELOX plus bevacizumab using a standard triweekly cycle (Q3W) or a dose-dense biweekly cycle (Q2W) schedule. The primary endpoint was the progression-free survival (PFS) interval. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier, NCT00159432).

Results

In total, 435 U.S. patients were randomized. The median PFS intervals were 9.6 months in the Q3W group and 9.1 months in the Q2W group. The median overall survival times were 28.4 months and 22.1 months and the median times to treatment failure were 5.5 months and 3.4 months, respectively. Overall, gastrointestinal disorders were the most common (93%) adverse event (AE). Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred in 75% and 81% of patients in the Q3W and Q2W groups, respectively. Treatment discontinuation as a result of diarrhea (5% versus 10%) and hand-foot syndrome (2% versus 9%) was less common in the Q3W group than in the Q2W group, respectively.

Conclusions

Based on these results, the first-line treatment of U.S. patients with mCRC using a biweekly combination of XELOX and bevacizumab at the doses studied cannot be recommended. XELOX Q3W remains the preferred schedule for the management of mCRC.

### Capecitabine and bevacizumab as first-line treatment in elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer [^117M22PE]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Background:

The efficacy and safety of capecitabine and bevacizumab in elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) considered unsuitable for receiving first-line chemotherapy with an irinotecan or oxaliplatin-based combination were assessed in a phase II, open, multicentre, uncontrolled study.

Methods:

Treatment consisted of capecitabine 1250 mg/m² (or 950 mg/m² for patients with a creatinine clearance of 30–50 mL/min) twice daily on days 1–14 and bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg) on day 1 every 3 weeks.

Results:

A total of 59 patients aged ⩾70 years with mCRC were enrolled. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the overall response rate was 34%, with 71% of patients achieving disease control. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 10.8 months and 18 months, respectively. In all, 32 patients (54%) had grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs), the most common being hand–foot syndrome (19%), diarrhoea (9%) and deep venous thrombosis (7%). Four patients died because of treatment-related AEs. A relationship was detected between creatinine clearance ≤ 50 mL min −1 and the development of non-bevacizumab-related grade 3/4 AEs. The incidence of bevacizumab-associated AEs (hypertension, thromboembolic events and proteinuria) was consistent with that of previous reports in elderly patients.

Conclusion:

Bevacizumab combined with capecitabine represents a valid therapeutic alternative in elderly patients considered to be unsuitable for receiving polychemotherapy.

Maintenance therapy after first-line CAPEOX/bevacizumab in mCRC — the open-label, phase III, multicenter RCT CAIRO3 assessed capecitabine/bevacizumab maintenance versus observation in 558 patients with mCRC and with stable disease or better after first-line CAPEOX/bevacizumab; following first progression, both groups were to receive CAPEOX/bevacizumab again until second progression (PFS2). After a median follow-up of 48 months, PFS2 was significantly better in the maintenance arm (8.5 vs. 11.7 months; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.56–0.81; P < .0001), with 54% of patients overall receiving CAPEOX/bevacizumab the second time; quality of life was not affected by maintenance therapy, although 23% of patients in the maintenance group developed hand-foot syndrome during the maintenance period. A non-significant trend towards improved OS was seen in the maintenance arm (18.1 vs. 21.6 months; adjusted HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.68–1.01; P = 0.06), and a molecular subgroup analysis showed effectiveness across all mutational subgroups (RAS/BRAF wild-type, RAS mutant, and BRAF V600E).

### Capecitabine and bevacizumab as first-line treatment in elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer [^112gdZVt]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy and safety of capecitabine and bevacizumab in elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) considered unsuitable for receiving first-line chemotherapy with an irinotecan or oxaliplatin-based combination were assessed in a phase II, open, multicentre, uncontrolled study.

Methods

Treatment consisted of capecitabine 1250 mg/m² (or 950 mg/m² for patients with a creatinine clearance of 30–50 mL/min) twice daily on days 1–14 and bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg) on day 1 every 3 weeks.

Results

A total of 59 patients aged ≥ 70 years with mCRC were enrolled. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the overall response rate was 34%, with 71% of patients achieving disease control. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 10.8 months and 18 months, respectively. In all, 32 patients (54%) had grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs), the most common being hand-foot syndrome (19%), diarrhoea (9%) and deep venous thrombosis (7%). Four patients died because of treatment-related AEs. A relationship was detected between creatinine clearance ≤ 50 mL min(-1) and the development of non-bevacizumab-related grade 3/4 AEs. The incidence of bevacizumab-associated AEs (hypertension, thromboembolic events and proteinuria) was consistent with that of previous reports in elderly patients.

Conclusion

Bevacizumab combined with capecitabine represents a valid therapeutic alternative in elderly patients considered to be unsuitable for receiving polychemotherapy.

### Trifluridine / tipiracil plus bevacizumab in patients with untreated metastatic colorectal cancer ineligible for intensive therapy: the randomized TASCO1 study [^1131z2pL]. Annals of Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

We designed an open-label, noncomparative phase II study to assess the safety and efficacy of first-line treatment with trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab (TT-B) and capecitabine plus bevacizumab (C-B) in untreated patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who were not candidates for combination with cytotoxic chemotherapies.

Patients and Methods

From 29 April 2016 to 29 March 2017, 153 patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either TT-B (N = 77) or C-B (N = 76). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). The primary PFS analysis was performed after 100 events (radiological progression or death) were observed. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), quality of life (QoL; QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR29 questionnaires), and safety.

Results

Median (range) duration of treatment was 7.8 (6.0–9.7) months and 6.2 (4.1–9.1) months in the TT-B and C-B groups, respectively. Median (range) PFS was 9.2 (7.6–11.6) and 7.8 (5.5–10.1) months, respectively. Median (range) OS was 18 (15.2 to NA) and 16.2 (12.5 to NA) months, respectively. QoL questionnaires showed no relevant changes over time for either treatment. Therapies were well tolerated. Patients receiving TT-B had more grade ≥ 3 neutropenia (47% versus 5% with C-B). Patients receiving C-B had more grade ≥ 3 hand-foot syndrome (12% versus 0% with TT-B) and grade ≥ 3 diarrhea (8% versus 1% with TT-B), consistent with the known safety profiles of these agents.

Conclusion

TT-B treatment showed promising clinical activity in untreated patients with unresectable mCRC ineligible for intensive therapy, with an acceptable safety profile and no clinically relevant changes in QoL.

### First-line trifluridine / tipiracil + bevacizumab in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer: final survival analysis in the TASCO1 study [^114ec6GQ]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Standard first-line treatment for patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is a doublet or triplet chemotherapy regimen consisting of a fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine, or infusional 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin) in combination with oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan. Additionally, a biological agent targeted against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; e.g. bevacizumab) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; e.g. cetuximab or panitumumab for the RAS wild-type subpopulation) should also be given, unless contraindicated. With such intensive first-line regimens, overall survival (OS) times of ~30 months have been achieved in clinical trials through the implementation of a treatment plan that typically consists of sequential lines of therapy tailored to patient and disease characteristics, as well as treatment history.

However, patients with untreated, unresectable mCRC are often considered ineligible for intensive chemotherapy because of their age or frailty, performance status, comorbidities, low unresectable tumour burden or other factors; additionally, some patients decline intensive chemotherapy because of concerns about toxicity. Some estimates suggest that, in practice, 50–60% of patients are not eligible for intensive treatment. Ineligible patients are often under-represented in clinical trials, and innovative, evidence-based treatment options in such patients are therefore more limited. In this setting, recommended first-line treatment often consists of fluoropyrimidine in combination with bevacizumab. In a recent meta-analysis, the median OS associated with such treatment was 20.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.3–24.8 months) in patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy because of age or frailty. There is therefore a need to expand the range of treatment options for this patient population.

### A phase I / II study of capecitabine given on a week on / week off schedule combined with bevacizumab and oxaliplatin for patients with untreated advanced colorectal cancer [^1171afg5]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A week on/week off capecitabine schedule with oxaliplatin/bevacizumab was evaluated in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

Patients and Methods

Forty patients were required. The projected median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12 months (81% power, 1-sided level 0.1 log-rank test). Capecitabine dose was 2500 mg/m²/day on days 1–7 (n = 11) and was increased to 3000 mg/m²/day (n = 29) in combination with oxaliplatin (85 mg/m²) and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg). Cycles were repeated every 2 weeks.

Results

Patient characteristics included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 (n = 24) or 1 (n = 15); median age of 62 years (range, 38–81 years). Median cycles administered were 7 (range, 125), corresponding to 3.5 months' treatment duration. Pertinent grade 3/4 toxicities seen were diarrhea (18%), hand-foot syndrome (10%), and peripheral neuropathy (10%). Bowel perforation in 1 patient (3%) and 1 death due to a cerebral hemorrhage (3%) were noted. Response rate (RR) was 38% (1 complete and 14 partial responses). Median PFS was 8.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.7–10.2 months). Median overall survival was 17.2 months (95% CI, 10.4–24.2 months).

Conclusion

The first US experience of capecitabine to our knowledge (3000 mg/m(2) on days 1–7) in combination with oxaliplatin/bevacizumab in mCRC does not appear to have advantages compared with current standard first-line mCRC treatment regimens.

### Bevacizumab-based therapies in the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer [^113VwYv4]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

Since its approval for the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), bevacizumab has become a standard treatment option in combination with chemotherapy for patients with mCRC. Bevacizumab has demonstrated efficacy in combination with a number of different backbone chemotherapy regimens, and its widespread use has introduced several important questions regarding the selection and optimization of bevacizumab-based treatment regimens, its use in various patient populations, and the identification of associated adverse events. This review discusses the results of several phase II and phase III clinical trials, as well as large observational studies, to address the use of bevacizumab in the treatment of patients with mCRC in the first-line setting.

Primary composite co-criterion

According to the decisions rules, both efficacy and safety objectives for BEV were reached: 23 patients met the efficacy co-criterion (50.0% [90% CI: 37.1–62.9]) and 28 patients met the safety co-criterion (60.9% [90% CI: 47.7–73.0]). BEV arm was considered efficient and well-tolerated (Table 2). A trend of a better tumor control in BEV arm but more QoL degradation, more unexpected hospitalization and more grade 3–4 cardiovascular toxicity is observed. An exploratory analysis did not found differences for composite criterion according the type of doublet regimen (supplementary Table S2, available at Annals of Oncology online). Indeed, there is small number on each group and no definitive conclusion could be drawn.

### Trifluridine / tipiracil plus bevacizumab for vulnerable patients with pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer: a retrospective study (WJOG14520G) [^114jzyTb]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

The present study excluded patients who were ineligible for intensive therapy because of a low tumor burden or patient preference, with such individuals tending to have a good prognosis, although the SOLSTICE trial included these patients. In the Japanese treatment guidelines", vulnerable patients" are defined as those who are considered intolerant of first-line combination therapy with oxaliplatin or irinotecan. The inclusion criteria for the present study were established on the basis of this definition. Some vulnerable patients might receive FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab after first-line treatment with a less intensive regimen, whereas others might become vulnerable after progression on first-line intensive therapy with oxaliplatin or irinotecan. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab for vulnerable patients with pretreated mCRC, we adopted criteria that excluded patients with a history of having received all key cytotoxic agents (a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) but which included those intolerant of intensive therapy as a result of medical condition. Despite the worse background of patients in our study compared with those in the first-line SOLSTICE trial and the second-line TRUSTY trial, the present study showed a good efficacy and acceptable safety profile for FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab. These findings suggest that FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab can be a preferred regimen in second or later lines of treatment for vulnerable patients with mCRC.

Our study has several limitations. First, it was retrospective in design and included a relatively small number of patients. Given that the vulnerable patients were highly heterogeneous, it might also have been affected by selection bias. Furthermore, the patients were treated with various drug doses and treatment schedules for the FTD/TPI and bevacizumab combination therapy. Second, the impact of subsequent chemotherapies including doublet regimens on the OS could not be evaluated because of the luck of sufficient data. Third, it was difficult to evaluate the efficacy of FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab for the vulnerable patients with previously treated mCRC in our study because of the lack of appropriate reference data, such as outcome of chemotherapy or best supportive care in such patients. We conducted our multicenter retrospective survey and previously reported the reference data to address this deficiency. Prospective comparative studies will be needed to fully resolve this issue. Finally, all patients enrolled in the present study were Japanese. However, no ethnic differences in the efficacy or safety of FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab between Japanese and Western patients have been described previously.

### First-line trifluridine / tipiracil + bevacizumab in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer: final survival analysis in the TASCO1 study [^113Y2Roa]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

The fact that these very similar survival results were obtained in separate clinical trials published over a period of 14 years illustrates the general lack of progress in this therapeutic area, and underscores the need for treatment options that improve survival. The phase II TASCO1 trial was designed to investigate the potential of TT-B as first-line treatment in patients with mCRC for whom treatment options are limited. In the time since TASCO1 was initiated, clinical trials have confirmed that TT-B has the potential to improve outcomes in patients with treatment-refractory mCRC. Phase III comparative trials of TT-B are now underway in both the first-line (SOLSTICE; NCT03869892; vs C-B) and treatment-refractory (SUNLIGHT; NCT04737187) settings. In terms of trial populations, interventions and endpoints, the SOLSTICE trial is very similar to TASCO1. However, the planned sample size of 854 patients in SOLSTICE will allow for statistical comparisons to be made between TT-B and C-B on the primary endpoint of PFS. Additionally, stratification in SOLSTICE is by tumour localisation (right vs left) and reason for ineligibility for intensive therapy (clinical vs non-clinical), as well as by ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2); in contrast to TASCO1, patients are not stratified by RAS mutation status or country. OS is a key secondary endpoint, and the trial will also provide data on response rates, quality of life, safety and tolerability.

We have also presented an updated analysis of TEAEs reported during the TASCO1 trial. These safety results are consistent with those previously reported, and there were no new safety signals or unexpected findings. Gastrointestinal adverse effects, such as diarrhoea, occurred commonly with both treatments and were mostly mild or moderate in intensity. As expected, TT-B was associated with a higher incidence of haematological abnormalities than C-B, whereas C-B was frequently associated with palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia.

Our trial has several limitations, as previously described. The lack of standardised criteria that clearly define eligibility for intensive treatment may have led to inconsistencies between study centres in patient enrolment. Additionally, patients were not stratified by reason for ineligibility (e.g. age, ECOG performance status or comorbidities); although we included this variable in the subgroup analysis, the results must be interpreted with caution due to the small numbers of patients in some subgroups.

### Effect of bevacizumab in combination with standard oxaliplatin-based regimens in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized clinical trial [^117MamWr]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does sequential scheduling of bevacizumab administration in combination with chemotherapy improve treatment efficacy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in keeping with the tumor vascular normalization hypothesis?

Findings

In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial of 230 patients, the primary end point objective response rate did not significantly differ between the sequential and the concomitant schedule of bevacizumab administration in combination with standard oxaliplatin-based regimens. However, the sequential schedule of bevacizumab administration was associated with longer overall survival, fewer adverse effects, and better health-related quality of life.

Meaning

Sequential bevacizumab scheduling plus chemotherapy might be relevant to optimize therapeutic efficacy and to explore antiangiogenic combination treatments with innovative perspectives.

### A phase I / II study of XELIRI plus bevacizumab as second-line chemotherapy for Japanese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (BIX study) [^116SmSuV]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Capecitabine is used mainly with oxaliplatin to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Results from capecitabine plus irinotecan (XELIRI) with or without bevacizumab (BV) have been reported in Europe but not in Japan. Consequently, the safety and efficacy of XELIRI plus BV in Japanese patients with mCRC were assessed in a single-arm phase II study.

Methods

Eligible patients had had prior chemotherapy containing BV for mCRC and wild-type or heterozygous UGT1A1. Therapy in each 21-day treatment cycle consisted of capecitabine (800 mg/m² twice daily on days 1–15), irinotecan (200 mg/m² on day 1), and BV (7.5 mg/kg on day 1). The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicity in phase I and progression-free survival (PFS) in phase II.

Results

A total of 34 patients (6 in phase I, 28 in phase II) were enrolled from May 2010 to June 2011. Baseline characteristics included a median age of 60 years (range: 22–74 years) for 24 men and 10 women. No dose-limiting toxicities appeared in phase I. Median PFS was 240 days (95% confidence interval: 179–311 days). Overall response rate was 18.1%, and the disease-control rate was 90.9%. The incidence of adverse events frequently associated with irinotecan and capecitabine were neutropenia (any grade, 55.9%; grade 3 or 4, 11.8%), diarrhea (any grade, 50%; grade 3 or 4, 5.9%), and hand-foot syndrome (any grade, 61.8%; grade 3 or 4, 5.9%).

Conclusion

Our results suggest that XELIRI plus BV is well tolerated and effective as a second-line treatment for mCRC in Japanese patients. This regimen could be especially appropriate for patients resistant to oxaliplatin-based regimens.

### Bevacizumab + chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in elderly patients with untreated metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized phase II trial-PRODIGE 20 study results [^1125GLce]. Annals of Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Our PFS results are in favor of BEV but are of less magnitude compared with the results of the two previous studies that have compared bevacizumab plus capecitabine with capecitabine monotherapy (HR = 0.53 [7] and 0.52 [8]). It must be pointed out that the median age was 80 years in our study but 76 [7] and 78 [8] in the previous studies. Others studies already suggested that the benefit for PFS of treatment intensification was mainly observed in patients of 70–80 rather than > 80.

None previous study demonstrated a significant OS benefit of bevacizumab combined with CT compared with CT alone in elderly patients. Our OS results are consistent with previous observations in phase III randomized study that have addressed elderly patients.

It must be pointed out that there is a trend in favor of BEV for usual end point as PFS and OS. At the contrary, QoL, unexpected hospitalization, cardiovascular toxicity and in result the primary safety co-criterion seems to be in favor of CT. This observation suggests that bevacizumab was associated with more toxicity even mild but is worthwhile given the longer PFS and OS.

We evaluated bevacizumab both in combination with FU monotherapy or with doublet CT which was never evaluated in previous randomized studies. The investigators were allowed to choose between monotherapy or doublet according their evaluation of the patient. This pragmatic design minimizes patient selection to enter the trial. Moreover, ∼50% of patients received FU monotherapy or doublet, this proportion is close to those observed in a national cohort of elderly patient treated in front line for mCRC in France. Nevertheless, we could not rule out a part of patient selection for enter in a clinical trial. In our study, the effect of bevacizumab was similar whatever the doublet regimen delivered. It must be point out that doublet CT was not associated with an increase of PFS or OS in subgroup analyses that raise the question of the need for doublet therapy in front line. Nevertheless, our results confirm the possibility to combine bevacizumab with several CT regimens in elderly patients.

All patients in the evidence base received anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab in addition to doublet or triplet chemotherapy, and shared decision making is recommended given that while survival and recurrence outcomes are improved, grade 3 or greater adverse events are more frequent with triplet than with doublet chemotherapy. In a meta-analysis of randomized trials, outcomes favored triplet versus doublet for overall survival (OS; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.91), progression-free survival (PFS; HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.82), and objective response rate (ORR; odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.29 to 1.91); adverse events including diarrhea, neurotoxicity, and neutropenia were significantly more likely with triplet, although a subgroup analysis found no difference in neurotoxicity between FOLFOXIRI and FOLFOX.

### Effect of bevacizumab in combination with standard oxaliplatin-based regimens in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized clinical trial [^115en3i8]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this randomized clinical trial failed to show an improvement of the primary end point ORR from the sequential administration of bevacizumab in combination with standard oxaliplatin-based regimens in unselected patients with RAS mutations and mCRC. However, although hypothesis generating, the OS advantage, fewer adverse effects, and better health-related QOL observed in the sequential scheduling of bevacizumab administration compared with concomitant administration warrant consideration for additional clinical studies. Indeed, sequential bevacizumab administration plus chemotherapy might be relevant to optimize therapeutic efficacy and to explore antiangiogenic combination treatments with an innovative perspective.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed cancer type and the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The standard of care for first- and second-line treatment of unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has been a doublet (or triplet) chemotherapy regimen consisting of a fluoropyrimidine and either oxaliplatin or irinotecan (or all these cytotoxic agents) plus a molecularly targeted agent. However, a substantial proportion of patients is unsuitable for full-dose standard chemotherapy as a result of various factors including an older age, the presence of comorbidities, a poor performance status, a low tumor burden, and patient preference. Several clinical trials have been conducted for first-line treatment of patients who are not candidates for intensive therapy. In the case of elderly patients with previously untreated mCRC, a survival benefit has been demonstrated for the addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine, whereas the addition of oxaliplatin or irinotecan to a fluoropyrimidine was not associated with survival prolongation. For individuals with tumors wild-type for RAS who are frail or elderly (or both), single-arm phase II studies have detected a clinical benefit of monotherapy with an antibody to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). On the basis of these findings, Japanese guidelines as well as the guidelines of the European Society for Medical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend a fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab, or anti-EGFR monotherapy in the case of tumors wild-type for RAS, as first-line treatment for patients who are unable to tolerate full-dose combination therapy with a fluoropyrimidine plus oxaliplatin or irinotecan (so-called "vulnerable patients"). However, little is known about second or later lines of treatment for vulnerable patients, some of whom may have become intolerant of intensive therapy after first-line treatment.

ASCO metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) first-line chemotherapy backbones — Doublet (folinic acid, fluorouracil [FU], and oxaliplatin [FOLFOX], or folinic acid, FU, and irinotecan [FOLFIRI]) backbone chemotherapy should be offered as first-line therapy to patients with initially unresectable microsatellite stable (MSS) or proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) mCRC (Type: Evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Strong). Treatment with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin may be substituted for folinic acid, FU, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) at the clinical discretion of the treating provider, and in shared decision making with the patient. Triplet (folinic acid, FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan [FOLFOXIRI]) backbone chemotherapy may be offered as first-line therapy to selected patients with initially unresectable MSS or pMMR mCRC (Type: Evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Weak). All patients included in the evidence-base for Recommendations 1.1 and 1.2 received anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab in addition to doublet or triplet chemotherapy backbone, and shared decision making is recommended, including a discussion of the potential for benefit and risk of harm; while survival and recurrence outcomes are improved, number of grade 3 or greater adverse events are more frequent with triplet chemotherapy, compared with doublet chemotherapy.

### Trifluridine / tipiracil plus bevacizumab for vulnerable patients with pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer: a retrospective study (WJOG14520G) [^111hd1ea]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) is an orally administered combination of a thymidine-based nucleic acid analog (trifluridine) and a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (tipiracil hydrochloride). A phase III study (RECOURSE) revealed a significant survival benefit of FTD/TPI compared with placebo for patients with refractory mCRC. The efficacy and safety of adding bevacizumab to FTD/TPI were subsequently demonstrated in several phase II studies in this setting. The SUNLIGHT phase III trial recently showed the superiority of FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab over FTD/TPI alone in patients previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, offering a new standard therapy for this population. Given its relatively low frequency of nonhematologic toxicities, the efficacy and safety of the combination of FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab have also been evaluated in patients unsuitable for intensive therapy. The SOLSTICE phase III trial was thus designed to examine the superiority of FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab over capecitabine plus bevacizumab as first-line treatment for these patients. Although FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab failed to achieve superiority, this regimen showed similar efficacy to capecitabine plus bevacizumab with no new safety concerns, suggesting that FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab might be a feasible option for subsequent treatment of this population. Given the lack of data addressing this clinical question, we have now retrospectively investigated the efficacy and safety of FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab for vulnerable patients with previously treated mCRC in the clinical practice setting.

### Maintenance strategies after first-line oxaliplatin plus fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (AIO 0207): a randomised, non-inferiority, open-label, phase 3 trial [^112adZTB]. The Lancet: Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The definition of a best maintenance strategy following combination chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer is unclear. We investigated whether no continuation of therapy or bevacizumab alone are non-inferior to fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab, following induction treatment with a fluoropyrimidine plus oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab.

Methods

In this open-label, non-inferiority, randomised phase 3 trial, we included patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed, previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–2, adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function, no pre-existing neuropathy greater than grade 1, and measurable disease, from 55 hospitals and 51 private practices in Germany. After 24 weeks of induction therapy with either fluorouracil plus leucovorin plus oxaliplatin or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin, both with bevacizumab, patients without disease progression were randomly assigned centrally by fax (1:1:1) to standard maintenance treatment with a fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab, bevacizumab alone, or no treatment. Both patients and investigators were aware of treatment assignment. Stratification criteria were response status, termination of oxaliplatin, previous adjuvant treatment with oxaliplatin, and ECOG performance status. At first progression, re-induction with all drugs of the induction treatment was a planned part of the protocol. Time to failure of strategy was the primary endpoint, defined as time from randomisation to second progression after maintenance (and if applicable re-induction), death, or initiation of further treatment including a new drug. Time to failure of strategy was equivalent to time to first progression for patients who did not receive re-induction (for any reason). The boundary for assessment of non-inferiority was upper limit of the one-sided 98.8% CI 1.43. Analyses were done by intention to treat. The study has completed recruitment, but follow-up of participants is ongoing. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00973609.

Findings

Between Sept 17, 2009, and Feb 21, 2013, 837 patients were enrolled and 472 randomised; 158 were randomly assigned to receive fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab, 156 to receive bevacizumab monotherapy, and 158 to receive no treatment. Median follow-up from randomisation is 17.0 months (IQR 9.5–25.4). Median time to failure of strategy was 6.9 months (95% CI 6.1–8.5) for the fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab group, 6.1 months (5.3–7.4) for the bevacizumab alone group, and 6.4 months (4.8–7.6) for the no treatment group. Bevacizumab alone was non-inferior to standard fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08 [95% CI 0.85–1.37]; p = 0.53; upper limit of the one-sided 99.8% CI 1.42), whereas no treatment was not (HR 1.26 [0.99–1.60]; p = 0.056; upper limit of the one-sided 99.8% CI 1.65). The protocol-defined re-induction after first progression was rarely done (30 [19%] patients in the fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab group, 67 [43%] in the bevacizumab monotherapy group, and 73 [46%] in the no treatment group. The most common grade 3 adverse event was sensory neuropathy (21 [13%] of 158 patients in the fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab group, 22 [14%] of 156 patients in the bevacizumab alone group, and 12 [8%] of 158 patients in the no treatment group).

Interpretation

Although non-inferiority for bevacizumab alone was demonstrated for the primary endpoint, maintenance treatment with a fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab may be the preferable option for patients following an induction treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab, as it allows the planned discontinuation of the initial combination without compromising time with controlled disease. Only a few patients were exposed to re-induction treatment, thus deeming the primary endpoint time to failure of strategy non-informative and clinically irrelevant. Progression-free survival and overall survival should be considered primary endpoints in future trials exploring maintenance strategies.

### Toxic effects and their management: daily clinical challenges in the treatment of colorectal cancer [^114opXSw]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

Among the many chemotherapeutic options for metastatic colorectal cancer, none has shown clear superiority in efficacy. All pharmacologic agents in current use have been associated with adverse events. Frequently reported adverse events associated with the chemotherapeutic agents oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and capecitabine include acute and chronic neuropathy, hypersensitivity reactions, diarrhea, neutropenia, and hand-foot syndrome. Although biologic agents are seemingly less toxic, toxic effects can also arise with their use; antiangiogenic agents result in hypertension, and EGFR inhibitors can cause severe hypersensitivity, paronychial infections, and more commonly, dermatologic rash. Furthermore, a correlation has been reported for the efficacy of anti-EGFR agents and development of rash. Data indicate that elderly patients with colorectal cancer who have adequate function and performance status, who may previously have been dissuaded from pursuing active therapy solely on the basis of age, should receive the same treatment as younger patients. To enhance the survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, many therapies are administered. Recognition of treatment-emergent toxic effects will, therefore, aid the design and implementation of management strategies that minimize treatment interruption and/or discontinuation, and enhance quality of life for patients.

Practically, findings from these subgroup analyses may have important implications when treating patients with BEV–CAP. The development of HFS may help motivate patients to continue their oral therapy, while applying appropriate treatment interruptions and dose modifications to achieve an optimal tolerability/efficacy balance. Early occurrence of HFS and its severity might help to guide treatment modifications and increase compliance with oral chemotherapy. Detection of biomarkers for HFS could strengthen this approach. The search for more individualised treatment and personalised health-care remains a high priority, while analyses such as our findings may help in monitoring and managing patients receiving BEV–CAP therapy for HER2-negative LR/mBC.

### First-line trifluridine / tipiracil + bevacizumab in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer: final survival analysis in the TASCO1 study [^117ALGY7]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Trifluridine/tipiracil may be used in patients with mCRC who have been previously treated with, or are not considered candidates for, standard antineoplastic treatment options. Unlike the mechanism of action of fluoropyrimidines, trifluridine undergoes intracellular, stepwise phosphorylation and subsequent incorporation into DNA, resulting in DNA dysfunction. Animal CRC xenograft studies have shown that intracellular concentrations of active (phosphorylated) trifluridine are augmented when it is co-administered with bevacizumab; thus, there is a pharmacological rationale for combining trifluridine/tipiracil with bevacizumab in patients with mCRC.

Encouraging results in preclinical studies and in patients with refractory mCRC have led to the study of trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab (TT-B) as a first-line treatment in patients with mCRC who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. The ongoing phase III SOLSTICE trial (NCT03869892) is investigating the efficacy and safety of TT-B versus capecitabine plus bevacizumab (C-B) in this setting. SOLSTICE follows on from the phase II TASCO1 (TAS -102 in CO lorectal cancer 1) trial. The main findings of TASCO1 were reported in 2020: median (range) PFS was 9.2 (7.6–11.6) months in the TT-B group and 7.8 (5.5–10.1) months in the C-B group. Median (range) OS was 18 (15.2–NA) and 16.2 (12.5–NA) months, respectively. The purpose of this article is to present the final OS analysis of the TASCO1 trial, performed after the last patient had withdrawn from the study.

### Clinicopathological factors influencing outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with fluoropyrimidine and bevacizumab maintenance treatment vs observation: an individual patient data meta-analysis of two phase 3 trials [^11627Eog]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Study treatments

In the CAIRO3 study, maintenance treatment consisted of capecitabine 625 mg/m² orally twice daily continuously, plus bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks. Patients with progressive disease in either the observation or maintenance arm were to receive reintroduction of the induction treatment regimen, that is, CAPOX-B. Reintroduced CAPOX-B was to be continued until progression, death, or an unacceptable adverse event, whichever occurred first. If CAPOX-B reintroduction was not possible after all due to persisting sensory neuropathy (grade ⩾2) or any other reason, the treatment choice was left to the local investigator's discretion.

In the AIO 0207 study, randomised patients received either continuation of a fluoropyrimidine (infusional every 2 weeks, or capecitabine every 3 weeks in standard dosages; the fluoropyrimidine could be switched between induction and maintenance treatment) plus bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks), or bevacizumab monotherapy (same dosage), or no treatment. Maintenance treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, surgical resection, other ablative treatment, at patient's request, or local investigator's decision. If either the fluoropyrimidine or bevacizumab was discontinued before progression, the remaining drug was continued as monotherapy in the fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab arm. At first progression, all patients were to receive reintroduction of the induction treatment regimen (i.e. any fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab) according to protocol. Reintroduction included all drug components of the induction treatment, except for those that could not be used due to persistent toxicity or contraindications. If reintroduction of the induction treatment regimen was not possible for any reason, the choice of treatment was at the local investigator's discretion.

### First-line trifluridine / tipiracil + bevacizumab in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer: final survival analysis in the TASCO1 study [^115Jj1kk]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

The results of TASCO1 are notable because of the scarcity of evidence from randomised trials to inform treatment choices in this setting. They are also encouraging, because most patients enrolled in TASCO1 were less fit (i.e. due to older age, worse performance status, comorbidities or other factors), and would therefore be expected to have poorer outcomes than those eligible for intensive treatment. However, median OS times in TASCO1 were not dissimilar to those achieved in earlier phase III randomised trials of first-line FOLFOX or CAPOX with or without bevacizumab (19.6–21.3 months). More recently, median OS times of > 25 months have been achieved in trials of FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab and FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab, underlining the need for more effective treatments for patients considered ineligible for these intensive regimens.

Discussion

This is the first complete phase II study that analyses the efficacy and tolerability of bevacizumab combined with capecitabine chemotherapy in the elderly with mCRC. The efficacy of this regimen was noteworthy, with a 34% ORR, a disease control achievement in 71% of the patients and a median PFS and median OS of 10.8 and 18 months, respectively. These results seem to be better than those reported with the 5-FU–LV–bevacizumab regimen (ORR 26%, median PFS: 9.2 months and median OS: 16.6 months;). Furthermore, they substantiate the results of a recent underpowered study byin 16 elderly subjects with mCRC treated with biweekly bevacizumab–capecitabine, in which a 25% ORR, a median PFS of 9.5 months and a median OS of 21 months were achieved. It should be noted that a 24% ORR and a median PFS of 7 months were achieved in a previous study conducted by our group in elderly subjects treated with capecitabine monotherapy. Thus, bearing in mind the need for caution when results from different studies are compared, the current results support the beneficial effect of adding bevacizumab to first-line chemotherapy or capecitabine monotherapy for mCRC.

These results should be considered within the context of the elderly population studied and should be extrapolated with caution to the unfit geriatric population not included in clinical trials. In our study, a specific criterion to be eligible was the unsuitability to receive polychemotherapy because of the greater susceptibility of this patient population to treatment-related AEs. In fact, our patients often had some form of associated co-morbidity or a suboptimal IADL or ADL score. Nevertheless, there were also a number of patients not fulfilling any of these characteristics included, as they were not considered to be optimal for polychemotherapy merely on the basis of physician's subjective criteria. Furthermore, although unsuitability for receiving combination chemotherapy was an inclusion criterion, a few patients received these agents as second-line treatment according to clinician judgment in view of their good co-morbidity status at baseline and their good tolerability to the study drugs. Similar to other authors, we consider that these patients, despite their unfavourable characteristics, may benefit from less-aggressive therapeutic alternatives. In this respect, a recent phase III randomised study in relatively elderly patients with unresecable mCRC previously untreated also found that the addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine significantly improved PFS without either significant toxicity or impairment in their quality of life.

Overall survival

Kaplan–Meier estimates of OS probability are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Median OS was 22.3 (95% CI: 18.0–23.7) months in the TT-B arm, and 17.7 (95% CI: 12.6–19.8) months in the C-B arm (adjusted HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.55–1.10). The delta for median OS (i.e. the difference between the TT-B and C-B arms) was 4.6 months. These results were consistent with estimated OS probabilities at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months (Table 1).

Methods

Study design and participants

The design and methodology of the TASCO1 trial have been described in detail previously. Briefly, this was a multinational, open-label, randomised, non-comparative phase II trial conducted at 52 participating centres in several European countries plus Australia and Brazil. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number NCT02743221).

The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at each participating centre, and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent to participate. An independent data safety monitoring board provided frequent oversight of the study.

Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged ≥ 18 years, had a recent diagnosis of unresectable mCRC, had known RAS status and had not received systemic anticancer therapy. Patients had to be deemed ineligible for standard first-line intensive chemotherapy containing irinotecan or oxaliplatin on the basis of age, low tumour burden, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, comorbidities or other factors.

Patients were randomised (1:1) using an interactive web response system to receive either TT-B or C-B, with cycles repeated every 4 weeks or 3 weeks, respectively, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal, or death (Fig. 1). Dosages were as follows: trifluridine/tipiracil 35 mg/m² orally twice daily on days 1–5 and 8–12 of each 28-day TT-B cycle; and capecitabine 1250 mg/m² orally twice daily on days 1–14 of each 21-day C-B cycle (a starting dose for capecitabine of 1000 mg/m² was allowed). Bevacizumab was administered intravenously at a dosage of 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks on days 1 and 15 of each cycle in the TT-B arm and at a dosage of 7.5 mg/kg on day 1 of each 21-day cycle in the C-B arm. Haematological support was provided according to general clinical practice. Patients were stratified at randomisation by RAS status (mutant vs wild-type), ECOG performance status (0, 1 or 2), and country.

Outcomes

Response and progression were evaluated at least every 3 cycles by the investigator using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Among patients who discontinued treatment for reasons other than disease progression, tumor assessments were performed every 12 weeks or as clinically indicated. Adverse events (AEs) were continuously assessed. Blood and archival tumor tissue samples were collected for biomarker analysis. The primary end point was unconfirmed investigator-assessed PFS, defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause. Patients who were alive and without documentation of disease progression were censored at the last tumor assessment. Patients who were alive and had no postbaseline tumor measurement were censored for PFS at day 1 after randomization. A sensitivity analysis for the primary end point was performed, in which PFS was also censored at the last tumor assessment before initiation of new anticancer therapy or withdrawal from clinical follow-up. Secondary end points were ORR, OS, and toxic effects. Objective response rate was defined as the number of patients achieving (unconfirmed) partial or complete response per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, criteria divided by the total number of patients in the modified intention-to-treat population. Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Patients who were alive were censored for OS at the last follow-up. Adverse events were assessed by the investigator using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, to determine possible relationship to study treatments. Immune-related AEs of grade 3 or higher that were at least possibly related to study treatments were reported.

### Adverse events of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy predict survival outcomes in locally advanced colorectal cancer: a pooled analysis of Japanese clinical trials [^114KgKRB]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and deadly malignancies worldwide. Surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is a standard treatment for locally advanced CRC. Despite advancements in adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, approximately 20–30% of patients with advanced CRC develop recurrence, which is often incurable. Accurate assessment of recurrence risk during treatment is essential to guide treatment decisions and optimise therapeutic strategies.

Emerging evidence suggests that chemotherapy-related adverse events may serve as prognostic markers for CRC treatment efficacy. While adverse events often lead to dose reductions and treatment interruptions, which may negatively impact prognosis, some studies have reported a paradoxical association between adverse events and improved outcomes in metastatic CRC. A meta-analysis showed that the occurrence of skin rash during systemic chemotherapy with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor drugs represents a better prognosis in metastatic CRC. Similarly, clinical studies have reported that hand-foot syndrome during capecitabine-based chemotherapy was associated with improved prognosis in metastatic CRC treated with capecitabine-based systemic chemotherapy. Despite these findings, the association between adverse events and prognosis in patients with advanced CRC who receive adjuvant chemotherapy remains unclear. Therefore, we hypothesised that the severity of adverse events during adjuvant chemotherapy for advanced CRC is associated with prognosis.

To test this hypothesis, we leveraged resources from four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the prognostic impact of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with advanced CRC. Our findings may help refine adjuvant chemotherapy selection by incorporating adverse event severity into treatment decision-making.

Regorafenib — adverse events and toxicity — was associated with grade 3 or higher events including hand-foot skin reaction (17%), fatigue (10%), hypertension (7%), diarrhea (7%), and rash/desquamation (6%), and severe and fatal liver toxicity occurred in 3.0% of 1100 patients across trials. A meta-analysis of four studies including 1078 patients found all-grade and high-grade hand-foot skin reaction incidences of 60.5% and 20.4%, respectively; in a subset of 500 patients with CRC, all-grade incidence was 46.6%.

NCCN Colon Cancer — capecitabine/irinotecan in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC): In the American BICC-C trial, capecitabine/irinotecan showed worse PFS than FOLFIRI (5.8 vs. 7.6 months; P = 0.015) and was considerably more toxic with higher rates of severe vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration; the capecitabine/irinotecan arm was discontinued, and the EORTC study 40015 was discontinued after enrollment of only 85 patients because seven deaths were determined to be treatment-related (five in the capecitabine/irinotecan arm). Although European studies reported a manageable toxicity profile for capecitabine/irinotecan plus bevacizumab, a randomized phase III HeCOG trial found no significant differences in efficacy between capecitabine/irinotecan plus bevacizumab and FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab, and an AIO randomized phase II comparison reported similar 6-month PFS; because of toxicity concerns, the Panel does not recommend capecitabine/irinotecan or capecitabine/irinotecan plus bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of mCRC.

### Trifluridine / tipiracil plus bevacizumab for vulnerable patients with pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer: a retrospective study (WJOG14520G) [^114ouSWE]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

This was a multicenter retrospective study to evaluate efficacy and safety of trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) plus bevacizumab for patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who were intolerant of intensive therapy (vulnerable). Based on phase III studies, FTD/TPI plus bevacizumab has been a standard therapy for patients previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, and a feasible alternative to capecitabine plus bevacizumab for previously untreated patients who are ineligible for intensive therapy. Results indicate this regimen is a possible treatment option for vulnerable patients with pretreated mCRC.

### Decreased gastrointestinal toxicity associated with a novel capecitabine schedule (7 days on and 7 days off): a systematic review [^112MeBKx]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Hand-foot syndrome, or PPE, also significantly limits capecitabine delivery. Exploration of this symptom was not the primary end point of this review; however, given the significance of this toxicity clinically, it has also been highlighted. Six of the patients who discontinued therapy for toxicity that was possibly related to capecitabine did so for PPE. There was no grade 4 PPE, and the rates of grade 2 and 3 PPE (40% and 15%, respectively) are similar to prior data — Miller et al. reported 36–42% grade 2 and 24–28% grade 3 PPE, while Geyer et al. reported 26–32% grade 2 and 7–11% grade 3 PPE.

While the efficacy of this approach has to be determined, the improved gastrointestinal tolerability of this novel regimen does not appear to be at the cost of disease control. The median progression-free survival of the phase I study was not reported; however, in the phase II studies it was 8.0 and 9.4 months when combined with bevacizumab and lapatinib, respectively. Although it is not possible to make cross-trial comparisons, this is reasonable in the context of previous data. The median progression-free survival of the phase III studies of capecitabine with bevacizumab and lapatinib was 4.87 monthsand 8.4 months, respectively.

Acknowledging the limitations of this retrospective systematic review of prospectively collected data, our study provides an encouraging signal about the tolerability of this novel dose and schedule. The favorable gastrointestinal toxicity profile demonstrated may facilitate prolonged drug delivery with reasonable quality of life. We propose that this novel dose and schedule of capecitabine optimizes the therapeutic index. As noted, the efficacy of this novel approach is the subject of an ongoing phase III clinical trial.

The potential for this dose and schedule to decrease toxicity and increase drug compliance has wide-reaching public health implications given the broad use of this drug worldwide in breast and gastrointestinal cancers. In addition, it has the potential to reduce drug cost: in this novel schedule, patients receive capecitabine for 14 days out of every 28, as opposed to 14 out of every 21 in conventional scheduling.

### Trends in use and perceptions about triplet chemotherapy plus bevacizumab for metastatic colorectal cancer [^1168aQXX]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

In the past 2 decades, the choice of first-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has become more complex because of the increased availability of treatment options. A novel first-line systemic treatment option for fit patients, who are candidates for intensive chemotherapy, is fluorouracil, folinic acid, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan plus bevacizumab (FOLFOXIRI-B). The efficacy and safety of FOLFOXIRI-B have been assessed by several studies, including 2 phase 3 randomized clinical trials. In the TRIBE (Combination Chemotherapy and Bevacizumab as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer) trial, FOLFOXIRI-B was compared with fluorouracil, folinic acid, irinotecan, and bevacizumab (FOLFIRI-B), showing an improvement in progression-free survival of 2.6 months and, as a secondary end point, improved overall survival of 4 months. Since publication of the TRIBE trial in 2014, the triplet regimen plus bevacizumab has been incorporated into national and international guidelines.,

Additional evidence for FOLFOXIRI-B was recently provided by the TRIBE2 (Upfront FOLFOXIRI Plus Bevacizumab and Reintroduction After Progression Versus mFOLFOX6 Plus Bevacizumab Followed by FOLFIRI Plus Bevacizumab in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer) trial in 2020, which demonstrated that upfront FOLFOXIRI-B, followed by reintroduction after first disease progression, was superior to sequential administration of fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and folinic acid plus bevacizumab (FOLFOX-B) and FOLFIRI-B (statistically significant benefit in progression-free survival 2 of 2.8 months and, as a secondary end point, in overall survival of 4.9 months). The efficacy of this regimen was confirmed in a meta-analysisthat included all available data from randomized clinical trials. This regimen was subsequently approved in 2020 by Dutch health care authorities. No subgroup has been identified for which no benefit is expected, although efficacy may be compromised in patients previously treated with oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Because FOLFOXIRI-B has not been prospectively compared to doublet chemotherapy plus an antibody to the epidermal growth factor receptor in patients with left-sided primary and RAS (OMIM, and) /BRAF V600 (OMIM) wild-type tumors, its benefit in this subgroup is uncertain.

### Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer: ASCO guideline [^117PiRoZ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO mCRC targeted therapy, anti–EGFR use — Anti–epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy plus doublet chemotherapy should be offered as first-line therapy to patients with MSS or pMMR left-sided RAS wild-type mCRC (Type: Evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Strong). Anti-EGFR therapy is not recommended as first-line therapy for patients with right-sided RAS wild-type mCRC, and consistent with the qualifying statements to Recommendation 1.1 and 1.2, these patients should be offered chemotherapy and anti-VEGF therapy. Anti-EGFR therapy is not recommended for patients with RAS-mutant mCRC, and anti-EGFR therapy with triplet chemotherapy is not recommended. Although anti-EGFR therapy is preferred, anti-VEGF therapy remains an active treatment option for patients with left-sided treatment-naive RAS wild-type mCRC in the first-line setting. Shared decision making is recommended, including a discussion of potential for benefit and risk of harms, such as the increased risk of treatment-related rash with anti-EGFR agents.

### Clinicopathological factors influencing outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with fluoropyrimidine and bevacizumab maintenance treatment vs observation: an individual patient data meta-analysis of two phase 3 trials [^116ZPAZG]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

In the three-armed AIO 0207 study, eligible patients were registered prior to the start of a 24-week induction treatment with a fluoropyrimidine (infusional fluoropyrimidine or capecitabine), oxaliplatin and bevacizumab. The choice of a standard protocol (i.e. FOLFOX, CAPOX-B) was left to the local investigator's discretion. Patients with stable disease or better and without option for metastasectomy after 24 weeks of induction treatment were randomised (1:1:1) to either maintenance treatment with any fluoropyrimidine and bevacizumab, bevacizumab monotherapy, or observation. Preliminary discontinuation of oxaliplatin or other drugs (for example, due to toxicity) during induction treatment was allowed. Randomisation was stratified by response to induction treatment (stable disease vs complete or partial response), treatment with oxaliplatin (stopped before termination of induction treatment vs ongoing until end of induction phase), previous adjuvant therapy (with oxaliplatin vs without oxaliplatin vs no adjuvant treatment), and WHO/ECOG PS (0–1 vs 2). Patients from the bevacizumab monotherapy arm were excluded from the present analysis. All patients in both trials provided written informed consent.

### First-line trifluridine / tipiracil + bevacizumab in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer: final survival analysis in the TASCO1 study [^11422nAt]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Therapeutic options are limited in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. The use of trifluridine/tipiracil plus bevacizumab (TT-B) in this setting was evaluated in the TASCO1 trial; here, we present the final overall survival (OS) results.

Methods

TASCO1 was an open-label, non-comparative phase II trial. Patients (n = 153) were randomised 1:1 to TT-B (trifluridine/tipiracil 35mg/m 2 orally twice daily on days 1–5 and 8–12, and bevacizumab intravenously 5mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle) or capecitabine plus bevacizumab (C-B; capecitabine, 1250mg/m 2 orally twice daily on days 1–14 and bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg intravenously on day 1 of each 21-day cycle). Final OS was analysed when all patients had either died or withdrawn from the study. Adjusted multivariate regression was used to investigate the effects of pre-specified variables on OS.

Results

At 1 September 2020, median OS was 22.3 months (95% CI: 18.0–23.7) with TT-B and 17.7 months (95% CI: 12.6–19.8) with C-B (adjusted HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.55–1.10). No variables negatively affected OS with TT-B. Safety results were consistent with prior findings.

Conclusions

TT-B is a promising therapeutic regimen in mCRC patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.

### Antiangiogenic therapy in colorectal cancer: where are we 5 years later? [^1147RMMV]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

The past 5 years mark a watershed period in the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). During this time, results from several clinical trials proved that targeting tumor-mediated angiogenesis improves overall survival for patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) when used in combination with first-line and second-line chemotherapy regimens, data that do not simply serve as "proof of principle" for antiangiogenic therapy but that will drive much of the research agenda in CRC for the coming years. Despite the demonstrated gains in survival when antiangiogenic therapy is used for patients with metastatic disease, however, results from the first trial to test the addition of bevacizumab to adjuvant chemotherapy have been disappointing. The expense of agents in the targeted therapy category has been the cause of much discussion on their appropriate use and puts particular emphasis on the need for suitable markers that will allow for the appropriate selection of patients. Although antiangiogenic therapy has demonstrated clear benefit in the treatment of patients with mCRC, limitations in efficacy, duration of therapy, role of maintenance therapy, potential toxicities, and predictive markers for optimal patient selection are subjects of ongoing research. Herein, we present a review of the recent advances in antiangiogenic therapy in CRC and provide insights into several promising upcoming studies.

### Chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer [^114eQTgf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2005). Low credibility.

The past decade has seen a significant survival improvement for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, fueled in large part by the arrival of active novel chemotherapeutic drugs and their incorporation into combination regimens. Several randomized trials have successfully integrated oxaliplatin and irinotecan into previously existing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based regimens for advanced colorectal cancer, resulting in median survivals that have risen from 9 months to almost 2 years. Even as the ideal combinations and sequences of these regimens are elucidated, targeted therapies such as recently approved bevacizumab and cetuximab have been added to treatment protocols, with favorable consequences. We review the evolution of primary chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer, focusing on the trials that have led to the new standard first-line treatments. We also review the data on newer targeted therapies, especially in combination with cytotoxic therapy.

Capecitabine toxicity and monitoring — the Panel noted that patients with diminished creatinine clearance may require dose modification, that the incidence of hand-foot syndrome was increased for patients receiving capecitabine-containing regimens versus either bolus or infusional regimens of 5-FU/LV, and that patients of North American descent may experience a higher incidence of adverse events with certain doses compared with other countries. These toxicities may necessitate modifications in the dosing of capecitabine, and patients on capecitabine should be monitored closely so that dose adjustments can be made at the earliest signs of side effects such as hand-foot syndrome. An analysis of patients from the AIO's KRK-0104 and Mannheim rectal cancer trials found that capecitabine-related hand-foot skin reactions were associated with an improved overall survival (75.8 vs. 41.0 months; P = 0.001; HR, 0.56).

### Overall survival results for trifluridine / tipiracil plus bevacizumab vs capecitabine plus bevacizumab: results from the phase 3 SOLSTICE study… [^113n82m2]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract 3512 Background: SOLSTICE, a phase 3 study, tested trifluridine/tipiracil+bevacizumab vs capecitabine+bevacizumab in first-line for patients with unresectable metastaic CRC who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Methods: From 21 Mar 2019 to 14 Sep 2020, 856 patients were randomized to either FTD/TPI+bev or cape+bev. Stratification factors were: ECOG performance status, reason for non-eligibility for intensive therapy and tumor localization. Results: 426 patients were randomly assigned to FTD/TPI+bev and 430 to cape+bev. The median OS was 19. 74 months with FTD/TPI+bev and
18. 59 months with cape+bev with survival probabilies for FTD/TPI+bev vs cape+bev comparable at different timepoints.

In the multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with higher OS in the whole population were age < 70 years, left location of the primary disease, surgical resection of the primary tumor, number of metastatic sites, absence of liver metastasis, neutrophils lymphocyte ratio < 3, Charlson score 0 vs 1–2, and ECOG PS 1 vs 2. Conclusions: This was the largest phase 3 study that explored two treatment regimens in a population ineligible for intensive therapy. FTD/TPI+bev was not superior to cape+bev in terms of PFS and OS. The risk of death was similar in both treatment arms. With a different and manageable safety profile, FTD/TPI+bev represents a feasible alternative to cape+bev in this population. Clinical trial information: NCT03869892.

### Effect of reduced-dose capecitabine plus cetuximab as maintenance therapy for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase 2 clinical trial [^112ZdMCG]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Therefore, oral administration of capecitabine combined with the EGFR-targeted drug cetuximab as maintenance therapy could be an alternative choice after induction chemotherapy combined with cetuximab for patients with RAS or BRAF wild-type mCRC. However, there have been concerns about the safety of this approach after studies, reported AEs, including diarrhea, rash acneiform, and hand-foot syndrome. To evaluate the biological activity and safety of capecitabine plus cetuximab as a novel maintenance therapy for RAS wild-type mCRC, we performed a phase 2 prospective clinical trial. We aimed to test whether this maintenance therapy combination would result in expected outcomes, have only tolerable nonserious AEs, and provide evidence for future phase 3 clinical trials.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: rectal cancer, version 3.2024 [^116okSvn]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Bevacizumab for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) being treated with intent to convert to resectability shows regimen-specific findings and cautious use: data seem to suggest that bevacizumab modestly improves the response rate to irinotecan-based regimens, and when such a regimen is chosen the use of bevacizumab would seem to be an appropriate consideration. For oxaliplatin-based therapy, evidence is mixed; a 1400-patient randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of CAPEOX or FOLFOX with or without bevacizumab showed no benefit in response rate or tumor regression, whereas the randomized BECOME trial of 241 patients showed improved resectability, response rates, and survival with mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab; R0 resection rates were 22.3% versus 5.8% (P < .01). Because it is not known in advance whether resectability will be achieved, the use of bevacizumab with oxaliplatin-based therapy in this setting is acceptable. A pooled analysis of TRIBE and TRIBE2 found that benefits of upfront FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab versus chemotherapy doublets were retained in oligometastatic disease, and the authors conclude that FOLFOXIRI provides a benefit for oligometastatic CRC when used as upfront treatment in conjunction with locoregional treatments, such as resection.

Metastatic colorectal cancer — fruquintinib (FRESCO and FRESCO-2) demonstrates survival benefits in heavily pretreated disease and is recommended by the NCCN Panel as a treatment option. In FRESCO, 416 patients were randomized and fruquintinib improved median overall survival (OS) versus placebo (9.3 vs. 6.6 months; HR, 0.65; P < .001) and median progression-free survival (PFS) (3.7 vs. 1.8 months; HR, 0.26; P < .001). FRESCO-2 enrolled 691 patients with extensive prior therapy (median 4 lines; 73% > 3 lines; 97% prior VEGF inhibitor) and showed median OS 7.4 months with fruquintinib versus 4.8 months with placebo (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55–0.80; P < .0001). In FRESCO-2, treatment duration was a median 3.1 months and 20% discontinued due to toxicities; grade ≥ 3 adverse events occurred in 63% with fruquintinib versus 50% with placebo, most commonly hypertension (14%), asthenia (8%), and hand-foot syndrome (6%). The NCCN Panel recommends fruquintinib as a treatment option for mCRC that has progressed through all other available regimens and notes it can be given before or after trifluridine-tipiracil or regorafenib; no data inform the best order.

Study AVF2107g

The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab was evaluated in a double-blind, active-controlled study [AVF2107g (NCT00109070)] in 923 patients with previously untreated mCRC who were randomized (1:1:1) to placebo with bolus-IFL (irinotecan 125 mg/m², fluorouracil 500 mg/m², and leucovorin 20 mg/m² given once weekly for 4 weeks every 6 weeks), bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with bolus-IFL, or bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with fluorouracil and leucovorin. Enrollment to the bevacizumab with fluorouracil and leucovorin arm was discontinued after enrollment of 110 patients in accordance with the protocol-specified adaptive design. Bevacizumab was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or for a maximum of 96 weeks. The main outcome measure was overall survival (OS).

The median age was 60 years; 60% were male, 79% were White, 57% had an ECOG performance status of 0, 21% had a rectal primary and 28% received prior adjuvant chemotherapy. The dominant site of disease was extra-abdominal in 56% of patients and was the liver in 38% of patients.

### Sorafenib and irinotecan (NEXIRI) as second-or later-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and KRAS-mutated tumours: a multicentre phase I / II trial [^115U5A3a]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this Phase I/II trial confirmed the feasibility of combining sorafenib and irinotecan in extensively pretreated patients with mCRC and KRAS mutation. In the Phase I part of the trial, dose escalation of irinotecan was achieved without any DLT, and the recommended Phase II dose was irinotecan 180 mg/m² once every 2 weeks with fixed-dose sorafenib 400 mg b.d. Principal toxicities included hand-foot syndrome, diarrhoea, asthenia and neutropenia. This treatment combination led to a DCR of 65% (95% CI, 51–77%). Median PFS and OS were 3.7 months and 8.0 months, respectively.

When compared with previously published data in the same kind of heavily pretreated mCRC population with KRAS mutation, our results appear promising. Two Phase III trials assessed the use of the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab alone in patients who failed on standard chemotherapy. Both of these studies reported median PFS and OS of 1.9 months and ∼5 months in KRAS -mutated patients, respectively. More recently, the multitarget drug regorafenib has been evaluated in a randomized Phase III trial as second- or later-line treatment of mCRC with KRAS -mutated or wild-type tumours. A total of 760 patients were to receive best supportive care with either oral regorafenib (160 mg daily) or placebo. In this study, 48% of patients had been pretreated by four or more lines for metastatic disease, all had received bevacizumab and 54% had KRAS mutation. The DCR was 41% vs 15% (P < 0.001), median PFS was 1.9 vs 1.7 months (HR = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.42–0.58, P < 0.001) and median OS was 6.4 vs 5 months (HR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64–0.94, P = 0.0052) in the regorafenib arm as compared with placebo, respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed that, among patients treated by regorafenib, KRAS wild-type patients seem to have longer OS than those with KRAS -mutated tumours (HR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48–0.90 vs HR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.67–1.12; P = 0.0038, respectively). However, subsequent analysis demonstrated that there is no statistically significant interaction between OS and KRAS status.

### A phase 1B study of dulanermin in combination with modified FOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer [^113TBRQt]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The study objectives were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of multiple doses of dulanermin in combination with modified FOLFOX6 and bevacizumab in previously untreated patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic colorectal cancer.

Patients and Methods

A total of 23 patients received dulanermin at dosages of 4.5 or 9 mg/kg/d given on days 1 to 3 of each 14-day cycle along with standard dosing of modified FOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab. Dose-limiting toxicities, adverse events (AEs), maximum tolerated dose, and response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors were assessed.

Results

In the first cohort (3 patients given dulanermin at 4.5 mg/kg/d) and second cohort (6 patients given dulanermin at 9 mg/kg/day), no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The subsequent 14 patients were treated with a dulanermin dosage of 9 mg/kg/d. Patients (N = 23) received 2 to 42 cycles of dulanermin (median 15). The most common grade 3 or 4 AEs were neutropenia (39%), hypertension (17%), peripheral neuropathy (17%), hand-foot syndrome (13%), and pulmonary embolism (13%). Three patients (13%) discontinued the study because of serious AEs. Overall, a best response of partial response was observed in 13 patients (57%) (9 confirmed, 4 unconfirmed), stable disease was observed in 7 patients (30%), and disease progression was observed in 3 patients (13%). The median progression-free survival was 9.9 months (95% confidence interval, 7.0–12.7).

Conclusions

Overall, the addition of dulanermin to first-line FOLFOX plus bevacizumab was well tolerated in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, with similar AEs that would be expected from FOLFOX plus bevacizumab. A randomized study is required to assess the clinical efficacy of dulanermin in this patient population.

### Predictive role of hand-foot syndrome in patients receiving first-line capecitabine plus bevacizumab for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer [^112AMGxH]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Post hoc exploratory analyses suggested differing treatment effects on OS according to clinical risk factors. In the subgroup of patients with low-risk hormone receptor-positive disease (defined as one or none of the following risk factors: disease-free interval ≤ 24 months; visceral metastases; prior anthracycline and/or taxane; or ⩾3 metastatic organ sites), there was a nonsignificant trend in OS favouring BEV–CAP. In the absence of a predictive biomarker for efficacy of either CAP or BEV, this risk factor index based on clinical characteristics may help in selecting patients for initial BEV–CAP therapy, balancing tolerability, patient preference, and efficacy. Several reports in the literature suggest that hand–foot syndrome (HFS) – a well-known side effect of CAP – may also be of interest in predicting the efficacy of CAP-containing therapy. An exploratory analysis of a small single-arm Japanese study suggested that HFS occurrence in CAP-treated patients may be associated with improved efficacy. Similar observations were reported from two retrospective studies, each including almost 100 patients receiving various CAP-containing regimens for metastatic breast cancer (mBC). A relationship between HFS development and efficacy was also noted in the larger single-arm prospective MONICA trial evaluating first-line CAP monotherapy for mBC. Median time to disease progression (TTP) was 9.4 months in patients developing HFS vs 4.7 months in those without (P = 0.0542); median OS was 22.9 and 14.2 months, respectively (P = 0.0209). HFS was an independent prognostic factor for TTP and OS in univariate and multivariate analyses. However, a major limitation of these analyses, as well as their retrospective nature, is the bias introduced by the association between treatment duration and likelihood of developing HFS. HFS is a cumulative toxicity with a reported median time to onset of almost 8 months in a meta-analysis of more than 4700 patients receiving CAP-based therapy for various tumour types. Patients whose disease is controlled with CAP tend to have longer treatment exposure and consequently an increased likelihood of developing HFS, whereas patients who die or experience progression very early are less likely to develop HFS. This is illustrated by the previously mentioned analysis of the TURANDOT trial according to a simple prognostic factor index. In patients with low-risk hormone receptor-positive disease, who appeared to derive the greatest benefit from BEV–CAP, the incidence of grade 3 HFS was 28% compared with 14% in those with high-risk hormone receptor-positive disease and 12% in those with triple-negative breast cancer. Corresponding median durations of CAP exposure were 8.3, 7.4, and 5.7 months, respectively. Clearly, a simple comparison of PFS and OS curves between patients with and without HFS during study treatment is likely to lead to an overestimation of the effect of HFS on efficacy.

Subsequent treatment

Of those who stopped randomised treatment because of TEAEs, progressive disease or another reason, 77 (50.3%) received at least one subsequent line of treatment (Table 2). More patients received subsequent treatments in the TT-B arm (59.7%) compared with the C-B arm (40.8%). The most commonly used subsequent agents were 5-fluorouracil (30.7%), irinotecan (28.8%) and oxaliplatin (27.5%). Seventeen patients (22.1%) in the TT-B arm subsequently received capecitabine, while only five patients (6.6%) in the C-B arm subsequently received trifluridine/tipiracil.

### Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) versus 5-fluorouracil / folinic acid plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) as second-line therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized phase III noninferiority study [^1127U4AU]. Annals of Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

To demonstrate the noninferiority of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) versus 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer after prior irinotecan-based chemotherapy.

Patients and Methods

A total of 627 patients were randomly assigned to receive XELOX (n = 313) or FOLFOX-4 (n = 314) following disease progression/recurrence or intolerance to irinotecan-based chemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).

Results

PFS for XELOX was noninferior to FOLFOX-4 [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83–1.14] in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Median PFS was 4.7 months with XELOX versus 4.8 months with FOLFOX-4. The robustness of the primary analysis was supported by multivariate and subgroup analyses. Median overall survival in the ITT population was 11.9 months with XELOX versus 12.5 months with FOLFOX-4 (HR = 1.02; 95% CI 0.86–1.21). Treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 50% of XELOX- and 65% of FOLFOX-4-treated patients. Whereas grade 3/4 neutropenia (35% versus 5% with XELOX) and febrile neutropenia (4% versus < 1%) were more common with FOLFOX-4, grade 3/4 diarrhea (19% versus 5% with FOLFOX-4) and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (4% versus < 1%) were more common with XELOX.

Conclusion

XELOX is noninferior to FOLFOX-4 when administered as second-line treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

### Continuation of bevacizumab vs cetuximab plus chemotherapy after first progression in KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: the UNICANCER PRODIGE18 randomized clinical trial [^1139RxET]. JAMA Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Second-line treatment with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab or cetuximab is a valid option for metastatic colorectal cancer.

Objective

To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 4 months with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab vs cetuximab for patients with progression of metastatic colorectal cancer after bevacizumab plus chemotherapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized phase 2 trial was conducted from December 14, 2010, to May 5, 2015. The main eligibility criterion was disease progression after bevacizumab plus fluorouracil with irinotecan or oxaliplatin in patients with wild-type KRAS exon 2 metastatic colorectal cancer. All analyses were performed on the modified intent-to-treat population.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to arm A (FOLFIRI [fluorouracil and folinic acid combined with irinotecan] or modified FOLFOX6 [fluorouracil and folinic acid combined with oxaliplatin] plus bevacizumab) or arm B (FOLFIRI or modified FOLFOX6 plus cetuximab); the second-line chemotherapy regimen was chosen according to first-line treatment (crossover).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the 4-month PFS rate. Secondary end points included safety, objective response rate, overall survival, and PFS.

Results

A total of 132 patients (47 women and 85 men; median age, 63.0 years [range, 33.0–84.0 years]; 74 patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 54 patients with a performance status of 1, and 4 patients with unknown performance status) were included at 25 sites. The 4-month PFS rate was 80.3% (95% CI, 68.0%-88.3%) in arm A and 66.7% (95% CI, 53.6%-76.8%) in arm B. The median PFS was 7.1 months (95% CI, 5.7–8.2 months) in arm A and 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.2–6.5 months) in arm B (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.50–1.02; P = 0.06), and the median overall survival was 15.8 months (95% CI, 9.5–22.3 months) in arm A and 10.4 months (95% CI, 7.0–16.2 months) in arm B (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.46–1.04; P = 0.08). A central analysis of KRAS (exons 2, 3, and 4), NRAS (exons 2, 3, and 4), and BRAF (V600) was performed for 95 tumor samples. Eighty-one patients had wild-type KRAS and wild-type NRAS tumors.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of the PRODIGE18 (Partenariat de Recherche en Oncologie DIGEstive) study showed a nonsignificant difference but favored continuation of bevacizumab with chemotherapy crossover for patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer that progressed with first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy.

### Small bowel adenocarcinoma, version 1.2020, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114s8uXh]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma — initial systemic therapy for metastatic disease: Data supporting systemic therapy for advanced small bowel adenocarcinoma have been largely retrospective with several small phase II trials; based on these studies, several systemic therapy regimens are recommended for treatment of metastatic SBA and participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged. As initial therapy where intensive therapy is recommended, the Panel recommends a choice of combination chemotherapy regimens: FOLFOX, CAPEOX, FOLFIRI (infusional 5-FU plus irinotecan), or FOLFOXIRI (infusional 5-FU, LV, oxaliplatin, irinotecan); any of which may be combined with bevacizumab. For patients for whom intensive therapy is not recommended, 5-FU/LV or capecitabine with or without bevacizumab are recommended as first-line therapy. For both intensive and non-intensive therapy, the checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab or nivolumab, with or without ipilimumab, are recommended as initial therapy options for tumors that are dMMR/MSI-H.

### Upfront FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab and reintroduction after progression versus mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab followed by FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (TRIBE2): a multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised, controlled trial [^114KfLiB]. The Lancet: Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Background

The triplet FOLFOXIRI (fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) plus bevacizumab showed improved outcomes for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, compared with FOLFIRI (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan) plus bevacizumab. However, the actual benefit of the upfront exposure to the three cytotoxic drugs compared with a preplanned sequential strategy of doublets was not clear, and neither was the feasibility or efficacy of therapies after disease progression. We aimed to compare a preplanned strategy of upfront FOLFOXIRI followed by the reintroduction of the same regimen after disease progression versus a sequence of mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) and FOLFIRI doublets, in combination with bevacizumab.

Methods

TRIBE2 was an open-label, phase 3, randomised study of patients aged 18–75 years with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2, with unresectable, previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer, recruited from 58 Italian oncology units. Patients were stratified according to centre, ECOG performance status, primary tumour location, and previous adjuvant chemotherapy. A randomisation system incorporating a minimisation algorithm was used to randomly assign patients (1:1) via a masked web-based allocation procedure to two different treatment strategies. In the control group, patients received first-line mFOLFOX6 (85 mg/m² of intravenous oxaliplatin concurrently with 200 mg/m² of leucovorin over 120 min; 400 mg/m² intravenous bolus of fluorouracil; 2400 mg/m² continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 48 h) plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg intravenously over 30 min) followed by FOLFIRI (180 mg/m² of intravenous irinotecan over 120 min concurrently with 200 mg/m² of leucovorin; 400 mg/m² intravenous bolus of fluorouracil; 2400 mg/m² continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 48 h) plus bevacizumab after disease progression. In the experimental group, patients received FOLFOXIRI (165 mg/m² of intravenous irinotecan over 60 min; 85 mg/m² intravenous oxaliplatin concurrently with 200 mg/m² of leucovorin over 120 min; 3200 mg/m² continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 48 h) plus bevacizumab followed by the reintroduction of the same regimen after disease progression. Combination treatments were repeated every 14 days for up to eight cycles followed by fluorouracil and leucovorin (at the same dose administered at the last induction cycle) plus bevacizumab maintenance until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, or consent withdrawal. Patients and investigators were not masked. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival 2, defined as the time from randomisation to disease progression on any treatment given after first disease progression, or death, analysed by intention to treat. Safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of their assigned treatment. Study recruitment is complete and follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02339116.

Findings

Between Feb 26, 2015, and May 15, 2017, 679 patients were randomly assigned and received treatment (340 in the control group and 339 in the experimental group). At data cut-off (July 30, 2019) median follow-up was 35.9 months (IQR 30.1–41.4). Median progression-free survival 2 was 19.2 months (95% CI 17.3–21.4) in the experimental group and 16.4 months (15.1–17.5) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.63–0.88; p = 0.0005). During the first-line treatment, the most frequent of all-cause grade 3–4 events were diarrhoea (57 [17%] vs 18 [5%]), neutropenia (168 [50%] vs 71 [21%]), and arterial hypertension (25 [7%] vs 35 [10%]) in the experimental group compared with the control group. Serious adverse events occurred in 84 (25%) patients in the experimental group and in 56 (17%) patients in the control group. Eight treatment-related deaths were reported in the experimental group (two intestinal occlusions, two intestinal perforations, two sepsis, one myocardial infarction, and one bleeding) and four in the control group (two occlusions, one perforation, and one pulmonary embolism). After first disease progression, no substantial differences in the incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported between the control and experimental groups, with the exception of neurotoxicity, which was only reported in the experimental group (six [5%] of 132 patients). Serious adverse events after disease progression occurred in 20 (15%) patients in the experimental group and 25 (12%) in the control group. Three treatment-related deaths after first disease progression were reported in the experimental group (two intestinal occlusions and one sepsis) and four in the control group (one intestinal occlusion, one intestinal perforation, one cerebrovascular event, and one sepsis).

Interpretation

Upfront FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab followed by the reintroduction of the same regimen after disease progression seems to be a preferable therapeutic strategy to sequential administration of chemotherapy doublets, in combination with bevacizumab, for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer selected according to the study criteria.

Results

Patient disposition and baseline characteristics

Between 29 April 2016 and 29 March 2017, a total of 153 patients were enrolled and randomised, 77 to the TT-B arm and 76 to the C-B arm. At the cut-off date of 1 September 2020, 132 patients (86.3%; n = 66 in each treatment arm) had died and 21 patients (13.7%; 11 in the TT-B arm and 10 in the C-B arm) were still alive and censored for the OS analysis. The median number of cycles was 8.0 in the TT-B arm and 9.0 in the C-B arm, and the median treatment duration was 34.6 weeks and 25.6 weeks, respectively.

Baseline characteristics of the study population have been described previously. Briefly, patients had a median age of 75.0 years (range: 33.0–91.0 years) and more than half were male (n = 88; 57%) and white (n = 144; 97%). The majority had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (n = 129; 84%), mutated RAS (n = 87; 57%) and ≥ 3 metastatic sites (n = 111; 73%). In the TT-B arm, the most common reasons for ineligibility for intensive treatment were older age (n = 28; 36%), low tumour burden (n = 15; 20%) and ECOG performance status (n = 14; 18%). In the C-B arm, more patients were ineligible because of their age (n = 42; 55%), but fewer were ineligible because of their performance status (n = 2; 3%).

### Predictive role of hand-foot syndrome in patients receiving first-line capecitabine plus bevacizumab for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer [^112bcSSG]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Reports in the literature have also suggested a potential correlation between hypertension and clinical outcome with anti-angiogenic therapy in breast cancer and other tumour types. However, in a meta-analysis of individual patient data from almost 6500 patients treated in seven phase III trials of BEV-containing therapy, including two trials in LR/mBC, early treatment-related hypertension was neither prognostic nor predictive for PFS and OS. On the basis of these findings, as well as the relatively small number of patients developing hypertension, we did not perform post hoc analyses of hypertension in the TURANDOT trial to explore a potential correlation further.

The greater use of post-study taxane therapy in the non-HFS subgroup than in the HFS subgroup is interesting, and may suggest that investigators chose more intensive second-line chemotherapy for these patients with shorter PFS and OS. Similarly, the higher proportion of patients in the non-HFS subgroup who received second-line chemotherapy after discontinuing BEV–CAP may suggest more intensive treatment, balancing against a slightly higher proportion of patients receiving endocrine therapy in the HFS subgroup. These observations are consistent with clinical practice: if patients have prolonged disease control on BEV–CAP, physicians may switch to endocrine maintenance therapy, despite the lack of clinical evidence to support such a strategy. In contrast, for patients with rapid progression on BEV–CAP, physicians may select more intensive chemotherapy, such as a taxane-based regimen, to gain rapid disease control. This hypothesis is also consistent with the more aggressive baseline disease characteristics in the non-HFS subgroup. Alternatively, the greater prevalence of hormone receptor-negative disease among the non-HFS subgroup may explain the more frequent use of chemotherapy in these patients. The higher proportion of patients in the non-HFS group who had experienced a PFS event at the time of data cutoff may also contribute to the imbalance in second-line chemotherapy administration, as more patients in the non-HFS group had the opportunity to receive further lines of therapy. Finally, the greater attrition in later chemotherapy lines in the non-HFS subgroup is consistent with the shorter OS in these patients.

### Safety and efficacy of bevacizumab plus standard-of-care treatment beyond disease progression in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer: the avaALL randomized clinical trial [^1144RRhr]. JAMA Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Bevacizumab treatment beyond progression has been investigated in breast and metastatic colorectal cancers. Avastin in All Lines Lung (AvaALL) is the first randomized phase 3 study of bevacizumab across multiple lines of treatment beyond progression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of continuous bevacizumab treatment beyond first progression in NSCLC.

Design, Setting, and Participants

AvaALL was a randomized, open-label, phase 3b trial, conducted from 2011 to 2015 in 123 centers worldwide. Patients with nonsquamous NSCLC previously treated with first-line bevacizumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy and at least 2 cycles of bevacizumab maintenance were randomized (1:1) at first progression to receive bevacizumab plus standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone.

Interventions

Patients received bevacizumab (7.5 or 15 mg/kg intravenously every 21 days) and/or investigator's choice of SOC. For subsequent lines, patients treated with bevacizumab received SOC with or without bevacizumab; the SOC arm received SOC only.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included progression-free survival from first to second (PFS2) and third progression (PFS3), time to second (TTP2) and third progression (TTP3), and safety.

Results

Between June 2011 and January 2015, 485 patients (median age, 63.0 years [range, 26–84 years]; 293 [60.4%] male) were randomized. Median OS was not significantly longer with bevacizumab plus SOC vs SOC alone: 11.9 (90% CI, 10.2–13.7) vs 10.2 (90% CI, 8.6–11.9) months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 90% CI, 0.71–1.00; P = 0.104). Median PFS2 was numerically longer with bevacizumab plus SOC vs SOC alone: 5.5 (90% CI, 4.2–5.7) vs 4.0 (90% CI, 3.4–4.3) months (HR, 0.83; 90% CI, 0.70–0.98; P = 0.06). Median PFS3 appeared longer with bevacizumab plus SOC vs SOC alone: 4.0 (90% CI, 2.9–4.5) vs 2.6 (90% CI, 2.3–2.9) months (HR, 0.63; 90% CI, 0.49–0.83), as did TTP2 and TTP3. Grade 3/4 adverse events were more frequent with bevacizumab plus SOC (186 [76.5%]) vs SOC alone (140 [60.3%]). No new safety signals were observed.

Conclusions and Relevance

The primary end point was not met; however, OS was underpowered according to initial statistical assumptions. Continued therapy beyond first progression led to improved PFS3 (but not PFS2), TTP2, and TTP3. Although a result with P = 0.06 for PFS2 would conventionally be considered significant at a specified 2-sided α of .10, in the absence of adjustments for multiplicity, this result could be a chance finding. No new safety signals were identified with bevacizumab treatment beyond progression.

### First-line trifluridine / tipiracil + bevacizumab in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer: final survival analysis in the TASCO1 study [^112iiYJW]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this report, we present the final OS results of the multicentre TASCO1 study, in which TT-B was investigated as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable mCRC who were considered ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.

Few evidence-based treatment options are available for this patient population. Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend the use of a fluoropyrimidine, with or without bevacizumab, or for patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type tumours and left-sided disease, an anti-EGFR antibody. When designing the TASCO1 study, we selected C-B as the 'reference' treatment because of the positive findings of the AVEX trial (see below).

Median OS in TASCO1 was 22.3 months (95% CI: 18.0–23.7) in patients randomised to receive TT-B and 17.7 months (95% CI: 12.6–19.8) in those randomised to receive C-B. We found the effects of randomised treatment on OS to be generally consistent across subgroups of patients defined by age, RAS mutation status, ECOG performance status and primary tumour site (left- vs right-sided). In women and patients without prior surgical resection, however, there was a difference between the treatments in favour of TT-B. These findings were consistent with those of the earlier analysis of OS in TASCO1. The final median OS in the C-B group remains slightly lower than those reported in AVEX (17.7 months versus 21 months), which can be explained by the fact that our study was targeting a different population of patients (higher proportion of ECOG PS2 in TASCO1 15% compared with AVEX 7%).

Fruquintinib for previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) — randomized trials and NCCN recommendation: In FRESCO, fruquintinib improved median overall survival (OS) versus placebo (9.3 vs. 6.6 months; HR, 0.65; P < .001) and median progression-free survival (PFS) (3.7 vs. 1.8 months; HR, 0.26; P < .001) among 416 patients with mCRC after at least 2 lines of chemotherapy who had not received VEGFR inhibitor therapy. In FRESCO-2, patients had received a median of 4 prior systemic therapy lines and 73% had received > 3 lines; OS was 7.4 months with fruquintinib versus 4.8 months with placebo (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55–0.80; P < .0001), grade ≥ 3 adverse events occurred in 63% versus 50%, the most common were hypertension (14%), asthenia (8%), and hand-foot syndrome (6%), and treatment duration was a median of 3.1 months with fruquintinib versus 1.8 months with placebo with 20% discontinuing due to toxicities. Based on these data, the NCCN Panel recommends fruquintinib as a treatment option for mCRC that has progressed through all other available regimens and states it can be given before or after trifluridine-tipiracil or regorafenib; no data inform the best order of these therapies.

NCCN Colon Cancer — second-line bevacizumab continuation and evidence: The Panel added the continuation of bevacizumab to the second-line treatment options and it may be added to any regimen that does not contain another targeted agent. When an angiogenic agent is used in second-line therapy, bevacizumab is preferred over ziv-aflibercept and ramucirumab, based on toxicity and/or cost. It may also be appropriate to consider using bevacizumab with second-line therapy after progression on a first-line regimen that did not contain bevacizumab; however, there are no data to support adding bevacizumab to a regimen after progression on that same regimen. In the randomized phase III ECOG E3200 second-line trial, median overall survival (OS) was 12.9 months for patients receiving FOLFOX plus bevacizumab compared with 10.8 months for patients treated with FOLFOX alone (P = 0.0011). Use of single-agent bevacizumab is not recommended because it was shown to have inferior efficacy compared with the FOLFOX alone or FOLFOX plus bevacizumab treatment arms. Beyond the second-line setting, bevacizumab may be combined with trifluridine-tipiracil (TAS-102).

### Capecitabine in combination with irinotecan (XELIRI), administered as a 2-weekly schedule, as first-line chemotherapy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase II study of the Spanish GOTI group [^11234ZHH]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Although a comparison of results from different phase II studies can be only speculative, the efficacy of our schedule is in line with that obtained by the other groups who have also published response data in phase II trials testing capecitabine–irinotecan combination regimens (Table 3). Indeed, our median TTP and OS are among the highest of those published to date with this combination. Moreover, the time-to-event results in this study compare favourably with those reported from recent phase III trials of the FOLFIRI regimen: median TTP (9.0 vs progression-free survival of 8.0 and 8.5 months) and median OS (19.2 vs 21.5 months).

It is noteworthy that the regimen tested in this study shows good tolerability (dose reductions were required in only 7% of cycles), with predominantly mild or moderate adverse events only. Importantly, there were no treatment-related deaths during our study. No grade 4 non-haematological toxicities were reported and only one case (3%) of non-complicated grade 4 neutropenia was documented. As expected with this combination, diarrhoea was the main adverse event, but with a low rate of grade 3 events (15% of patients) and no grade 4 events. Hand–foot syndrome, a well-documented capecitabine-associated event, was only reported in seven patients and all cases were grade 1 or 2. In Table 3, which summarises the main grade 3–4 toxicities per patient reported in previous phase II studies testing the combination of capecitabine and irinotecan, the improved tolerability of the 2-weekly regimen is notable: grade 3–4 neutropenia and diarrhoea ranged between 5–28 and 8–34% in other phase II studies, respectively, compared with respective rates of 6 and 15% in this study. Unlike the current study, grade 3–4 hand–foot syndrome was reported in most of those studies. Our regimen also appears to be associated with a lower rate of grade 3–4 neutropenia (6 vs 24–23%) and a similar rate of grade 3–4 diarrhoea (15 vs 14–11%) compared with FOLFIRI.

### TAS-102 with or without bevacizumab in patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer: an investigator-initiated, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial [^117UGdPc]. The Lancet: Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Background

TAS-102 (trifluridine-tipiracil) has shown a significant overall survival benefit compared with placebo in patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Inspired by the encouraging results of a small phase 1–2 study, C-TASK FORCE, which evaluated the combination of TAS-102 plus bevacizumab in patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer, we aimed to compare the efficacy of TAS-102 plus bevacizumab versus TAS-102 monotherapy in patients receiving refractory therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.

Methods

This investigator-initiated, open-label, randomised, phase 2 study enrolled patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with metastatic colorectal from four cancer centres in Denmark. The main inclusion criteria were histopathologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer refractory or intolerant to a fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and cetuximab or panitumumab (only for RAS wild-type), and WHO performance status of 0 or 1. Previous therapy with bevacizumab, aflibercept, ramucirumab, or regorafenib was allowed but not mandatory. Participants were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) in block sizes of two, four, or six by a web-based tool to receive oral TAS-102 (35 mg/m 2 twice daily on days 1–5 and 8–12 every 28 days) alone or combined with intravenous bevacizumab (5 mg/kg on days 1 and 15) until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient decision to withdraw. Treatment assignment was not masked, and randomisation was stratified by institution and RAS mutation status. The primary endpoint was investigator-evaluated progression-free survival. All analyses were based on intention to treat. This trial is registered with EudraCT, 2016-005241-23.

Findings

From Aug 24, 2017, to Oct 31, 2018, 93 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to TAS-102 (n = 47) or TAS-102 plus bevacizumab (n = 46). The clinical cut-off date was Feb 15, 2019, after a median follow-up of 10.0 months (IQR 6.8–14.0). Median progression-free survival was 2.6 months (95% CI 1.6–3.5) in the TAS-102 group versus 4.6 months (3.5–6.5) in the TAS-102 plus bevacizumab group (hazard ratio 0.45 [95% CI 0.29–0.72]; p = 0.0015). The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse event was neutropenia (18 [38%] of 47 in the TAS-102 monotherapy group vs 31 [67%] of 46 in the TAS-102 plus bevacizumab group). Serious adverse events were observed in 21 (45%) patients in the TAS-102 group and 19 (41%) in the TAS-102 plus bevacizumab group. No deaths were deemed treatment related.

Interpretation

In patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer, TAS-102 plus bevacizumab, as compared with TAS-102 monotherapy, was associated with a significant and clinically relevant improvement in progression-free survival with tolerable toxicity. The combination of TAS-102 plus bevacizumab could be a new treatment option for patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer and could be a practice-changing development.
