## Question

Medical intervention for headache reaction to immune globulin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medical interventions for headache reactions to immune globulin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and how common headaches are with IVIG. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis of headache after IVIG, including aseptic meningitis. Next, I will review nonpharmacologic strategies, followed by pharmacologic prophylaxis and treatment. After that, I should consider product and dosing modifications, including switching to SCIG. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight special populations and monitoring needs, making sure I anchor each step to the best available evidence and cite appropriately.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and baseline risk. Headache is the most common adverse effect of IVIG across indications, with reported frequencies ranging from roughly 10–30% in many series and up to 50% or more in some cohorts, and it is typically mild to moderate and self-limited, though severe headaches can signal aseptic meningitis or other complications, so I need to keep that in mind as I proceed [^6e2cafd9] [^c4f6cef6] [^18ed769b] [^10bebf18].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the differential when the headache is severe or atypical. Aseptic meningitis presents within hours to 1–2 days after IVIG with severe headache, photophobia, nuchal rigidity, nausea/vomiting, and CSF pleocytosis with negative cultures; it is more likely with high total doses and rapid infusion, and patients with migraine history appear more susceptible, so I need to check for red flags and consider lumbar puncture if meningitic features are present [^8c33ba22] [^249d8739] [^e8454f71]. I should also remember posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome as a rare but serious cause of headache with IVIG, particularly in vulnerable patients, so blood pressure and neurologic status must be monitored carefully [^99ae494f].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic strategies because they are foundational and often effective. Slowing the infusion rate is the first-line maneuver and reduces headache incidence and severity; starting slow and titrating to tolerance is prudent, and in higher-risk patients or those with prior headaches, extending total infusion time can be helpful, though the exact "optimal" rate varies by product and patient tolerance [^ba3f47b9] [^f52ffd5a]. I need to ensure adequate prehydration, especially in patients with any renal risk or when using sucrose-containing products, because dehydration and osmotic load can worsen headaches and renal outcomes; a reasonable approach is 500–1000 mL of isotonic fluid before infusion, adjusted to comorbidities [^f52ffd5a] [^15ebfd4f]. Let me also consider product selection; while head-to-head superiority data are limited, some clinicians prefer lower-sucrose or lower-osmolality preparations in patients with recurrent headaches, acknowledging that this is based on mechanistic plausibility and observational experience rather than randomized trials [^f52ffd5a] [^9661af7d].

> I will now examine pharmacologic prophylaxis for mild to moderate headaches. Acetaminophen or NSAIDs given 30–60 minutes pre-infusion are commonly used and reasonable, though high-quality randomized data are sparse; given their favorable risk profile, they are appropriate first-line prophylaxis in most patients without contraindications [^d751a9c1] [^ba3f47b9]. Wait, let me verify the role of corticosteroids; low-dose IV steroids such as methylprednisolone 0.5–1 mg/kg pre-infusion can reduce infusion-related symptoms including headache in some patients, particularly those with prior reactions or high-dose regimens, but I should avoid routine steroid use given long-term risks and reserve it for select cases or when other measures fail [^d59f28f9] [^120b7d94]. Antihistamines like diphenhydramine are sometimes used for general infusion reactions, but evidence for preventing headache specifically is limited; I should not rely on them for headache prophylaxis alone [^d751a9c1].

> For acute treatment of a headache that occurs during or after infusion, I should confirm that simple analgesics remain first-line. Acetaminophen or NSAIDs are appropriate, and if pain is severe, short-acting opioids may be considered rarely in exceptional circumstances, though I need to weigh risks and avoid reinforcing dependence; most patients respond to non-opioid therapy when combined with rate reduction and hydration [^d751a9c1] [^f52ffd5a]. But wait, what if the headache is migrainous or refractory? In patients with a known migraine phenotype or severe unresponsive headaches, triptans or dihydroergotamine can be considered case-by-case, recognizing the evidence base is limited to case reports and small series; I should document rationale and monitor closely [^d751a9c1].

> Let me consider product and dosing modifications when headaches persist despite optimization. Switching to an alternative IVIG brand is a reasonable next step, as excipients and manufacturing differences may influence tolerability; while randomized switching data are lacking, case series and clinical experience support trialing a different preparation, ideally avoiding sucrose in those with prior reactions or renal risk, and some patients report improved tolerability after switching [^d751a9c1] [^8cc367f8] [^9661af7d]. I should double-check the dose as well; lower total dose or divided dosing can reduce adverse effects, and in some conditions, lower-dose regimens have been associated with fewer adverse events, though efficacy must be balanced carefully and individualized to the indication and response [^c0a27ecc] [^442f1eec].

> Now, I need to evaluate route-switching strategies for refractory cases. Subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) markedly reduces systemic adverse effects, including headache, compared with IVIG, with meta-analytic data suggesting roughly a 28% relative reduction in moderate to severe systemic adverse events and substantially lower headache rates in many studies; this is a strong option for patients with recurrent IVIG headaches or those desiring home therapy and fewer systemic reactions [^3c7f5f6e]. Hold on, I should verify facilitated SCIG (fSCIG) as well; fSCIG with recombinant hyaluronidase enables larger volumes per site and less frequent dosing, and observational cohorts show low systemic adverse event rates with headache around 7–25% and high patient satisfaction, supporting its use when available and appropriate [^f6832c17] [^b34afb73] [^82e87424].

> Next, I should review special populations and risk modifiers. Children have a high frequency of delayed headaches after IVIG, so anticipatory guidance and proactive strategies are important; parents should be counseled to treat early and escalate evaluation if severe or meningitic features develop [^738a74b4]. Patients with a history of migraine are at increased risk of aseptic meningitis and severe headache with IVIG, so I should maintain a lower threshold to slow infusion, premedicate, and consider SCIG if headaches recur [^6e2cafd9] [^249d8739]. For patients with renal impairment or diabetes, I need to ensure aggressive hydration, avoid sucrose-containing products when possible, and monitor renal function closely given the risk of osmotic nephropathy and hyperviscosity-related complications [^f52ffd5a] [^9661af7d].

> I should confirm a practical, stepwise algorithm and make sure it aligns with the evidence. First, optimize infusion rate and ensure prehydration; second, add premedication with acetaminophen or NSAID; third, if headaches persist, consider adding low-dose IV steroid for high-risk patients or those on high-dose regimens; fourth, if still refractory, switch IVIG brand and consider dose reduction or divided dosing; fifth, if headaches remain problematic, transition to SCIG or fSCIG; throughout, monitor for red flags suggesting aseptic meningitis or other serious complications and adjust accordingly [^d751a9c1] [^ba3f47b9] [^3c7f5f6e]. Hold on, I should verify that this sequence balances efficacy and safety; yes, it prioritizes nonpharmacologic and low-risk strategies first, escalates thoughtfully, and incorporates route-switching for durable improvement when needed.

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and follow-up are not overlooked. I should record headache characteristics, timing relative to infusion, severity, associated symptoms, and response to interventions; this helps identify patterns and guide future prophylaxis. For patients with recurrent or severe headaches, I should discuss the possibility of aseptic meningitis, review warning signs, and provide a clear action plan, including when to seek urgent care for neurologic symptoms or meningeal signs [^8c33ba22] [^249d8739].

Headache from immune globulin is common but usually mild and self-limited [^6e2cafd9]; **slow the infusion rate** and ensure **adequate hydration** are first-line measures [^ba3f47b9] [^f52ffd5a]. Premedicate with **acetaminophen or NSAIDs** [^d751a9c1]; consider antihistamines or corticosteroids if headaches persist [^ba3f47b9]. For recurrent or severe headaches, **switch to SCIG** [^3c7f5f6e] or try a different IVIG product [^d751a9c1]. Severe or atypical headaches warrant evaluation for aseptic meningitis [^8c33ba22] or thrombosis [^d4af377f]. Most headaches resolve with these steps, and **preventive strategies** are effective in reducing recurrence [^d751a9c1].

---

## Incidence and clinical characteristics

- **Incidence**: Headache is the most common adverse effect of IVIG, occurring in 10–50% of infusions depending on dose, rate, and patient factors [^6e2cafd9] [^c4f6cef6].

- **Timing**: Headaches typically occur during or within 24–72 hours after infusion [^6e2cafd9] [^738a74b4].

- **Severity**: Most are mild to moderate, but severe headaches can occur, especially with high-dose or rapid infusions [^6e2cafd9] [^8c33ba22].

- **Risk factors**: Higher doses (≥ 2 g/kg), rapid infusion, first infusion, female sex, younger age, and migraine history increase risk [^6e2cafd9] [^af7bd546].

---

## Pathophysiology

The **exact mechanism** is not fully understood; proposed mechanisms include:

- **Cerebral vasodilation**: from nitric oxide release causing vascular headaches [^notfound].

- **Increased intracranial pressure**: from osmotic shifts or volume expansion [^notfound].

- **Immune-mediated inflammation**: including aseptic meningitis [^8c33ba22].

- **Patient-specific factors**: such as migraine susceptibility or IgA deficiency [^249d8739].

---

## Preventive strategies

### Infusion-related modifications

- **Slow infusion rate**: Start slow (e.g. 0.5–1 mg/kg/min) and titrate to tolerance; slower rates reduce headache incidence [^ba3f47b9] [^f52ffd5a].

- **Hydration**: Ensure adequate pre- and post-infusion hydration to reduce osmotic effects [^f52ffd5a] [^15ebfd4f].

- **Dose adjustment**: Consider lower, divided doses or longer intervals if headaches recur [^c0a27ecc] [^442f1eec].

---

### Premedication

- **Acetaminophen or NSAIDs**: Give 30–60 minutes pre-infusion; effective for mild headaches [^d751a9c1] [^ba3f47b9].

- **Antihistamines**: Diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine may help, especially with other infusion reactions [^ba3f47b9] [^cde42b82].

- **Corticosteroids**: Low-dose IV steroids (e.g. methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg) for moderate-severe or recurrent headaches [^d59d28f9] [^120b7d94].

---

## Management of acute headaches

- **Stop or slow infusion**: Pause or reduce rate immediately when headache begins [^f52ffd5a] [^6e2cafd9].

- **Analgesics**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs are first-line for mild headaches [^d751a9c1] [^ba3f47b9].

- **Opioids**: Reserve for severe refractory cases; use cautiously due to sedation and respiratory risk [^d751a9c1].

- **Supportive care**: Provide hydration, rest, and monitoring until symptoms resolve [^f52ffd5a] [^15ebfd4f].

---

## Long-term management and alternative therapies

- **Switch to SCIG**: SCIG has lower systemic adverse effects, including fewer headaches, and is preferred for recurrent IVIG headaches [^3c7f5f6e] [^e3374abc].

- **Alternative IVIG products**: Try a different brand or formulation if headaches persist despite optimization [^d751a9c1] [^8cc367f8].

- **Preventive medications**: Consider beta-blockers or anticonvulsants for patients with migraine phenotypes or frequent headaches [^d751a9c1].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Assess headache frequency, severity, and response to interventions at each infusion. Maintain vigilance for **severe or atypical headaches** to detect aseptic meningitis or thrombosis early [^8c33ba22] [^d4af377f]. Educate patients to report severe, persistent, or neurologically accompanied headaches promptly [^8c33ba22].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Effectiveness** |
|-|-|-|
| Slow infusion rate | All patients | High |
| Hydration | All patients | High |
| Acetaminophen/NSAIDs | Mild headaches | High |
| Antihistamines | Moderate headaches | Moderate |
| Corticosteroids | Severe/recurrent headaches | Moderate |
| Switch to SCIG | Recurrent IVIG headaches | High |
| Alternative IVIG products | Persistent headaches | Moderate |

### Evidence-based strategies to reduce intravenous immunoglobulin-induced headaches [^d751a9c1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature evaluating pharmacotherapeutic and nonpharmacotherapeutic options available to reduce migraines or headaches associated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE (1946 to February 2015) and other secondary resources was performed using the terms immunoglobulin, immune globulin, intravenous immunoglobulins, migraine, and headache. Other relevant articles referenced from the MEDLINE search were also utilized.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Data sources were limited to English language clinical trials and case studies. In all, 6 clinical studies and 2 case reports met the criteria.

Data Synthesis

Headaches or migraines are common adverse effects associated with the administration of IVIG. We evaluated 6 clinical studies and 2 case reports discussing this adverse event in patients treated with IVIG. Strategies used were hydration, switching to an alternate IVIG product, decreased infusion rates, or treating with oral analgesics, opioids, propranolol, sumatriptan, or dihydroergotamines before, during, or after the IVIG infusion. Overall, the majority of patients experienced improvement in headache symptoms, suggesting benefit, after using the various strategies discussed. However, the evidence is limited to case reports and clinical studies with small sample sizes that do not directly measure cause and effect of headache resolution and therapy given in those treated with IVIG.

Conclusions

An individualized treatment plan consisting of a pharmacotherapy or nonpharmacotherapy strategy used in the literature should be recommended after careful consideration of the patient's condition, specific IVIG product used, history of migraine, and previously failed and successful therapies.

### Management of adverse events in the treatment of patients with immunoglobulin therapy: a review of evidence [^39ffa414]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin (IG) therapy is actually used for a broad range of diseases including primary and secondary immunodeficiency disorders, and autoimmune diseases. This therapy is available for intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration. The efficacy of the IG therapy has been demonstrated in numerous studies and across different diseases. Generally, IG infusions are well tolerated; however some well-known adverse reactions, ranging from mild to severe, are associated with the therapy. The most common adverse reactions including headache, nausea, myalgia, fever, chills, chest discomfort, skin and anaphylactic reactions, could arise immediately during or after the infusion. Delayed events could be more severe and include migraine headaches, aseptic meningitis, haemolysis renal impairment and thrombotic events. This paper reviews all the potential adverse events related to IG therapy and establishes a comprehensive guideline for the management of these events. Moreover it resumes the opinions and clinical experience of expert endorsers on the utilization of the treatment. Published data were classified into levels of evidence and the strength of the recommendation was given for each intervention according to the GRADE system.

### Adverse effects of IgG therapy [^ba3f47b9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

IgG is widely used for patients with immune deficiencies and in a broad range of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Up to 40% of intravenous infusions of IgG may be associated with adverse effects (AEs), which are mostly uncomfortable or unpleasant but often are not serious. The most common infusion-related AE is headache. More serious reactions, including true anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions, occur less frequently. Most reactions are related to the rate of infusion and can be prevented or treated just by slowing the infusion rate. Medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistamines, or corticosteroids also may be helpful in preventing or treating these common AEs. IgA deficiency with the potential of IgG or IgE antibodies against IgA increases the risk of some AEs but should not be viewed as a contraindication if IgG therapy is needed. Potentially serious AEs include renal dysfunction and/or failure, thromboembolic events, and acute hemolysis. These events usually are multifactorial, related to combinations of constituents in the IgG product as well as risk factors for the recipient. Awareness of these factors should allow minimization of the risks and consequences of these AEs. Subcutaneous IgG is absorbed more slowly into the circulation and has a lower incidence of AEs, but awareness and diligence are necessary whenever IgG is administered.

Infusion-Related Reactions

These are usually minor, occurring in not more than 10% of the patients and include mild to moderate headache that responds to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, fever, chills, myalgia, chest or back pain, and temporary rise in blood pressure during the first hours of the infusion; they usually respond by stopping the infusion for 30 min and resuming it at a slower rate. Post-infusion fatigue, fever, or nausea may also occur lasting for 24–48 h. Skin reactions can develop 2–5 days after the infusions, may last up to 30 days, and include urticaria, lichenoid cutaneous lesions, pruritus of the palms, and petechiae of the extremities. Skin reactions, associated with various IVIg lots, occurred in seven of 120 patients we had initially treated. In a large retrospective evidence-based study of all trials performed in neurological disorders, headaches occurred in 16.6%, fever 6.6%, hypertension 4.6%, chills 3.3%, and nausea in 3.2%. Some patients develop severe headache due to aseptic meningitis as first reported in several of our patients, being unrelated to the proprietary product, rate of infusion, or underlying disease; prophylaxis with intravenous steroids can be occasionally helpful, but symptoms respond to strong analgesia and subside in 24–48 h. Additional diagnostic testing is rarely necessary. IVIg therapy may also trigger a migraine attack in patients with prior history; aseptic meningitis is also higher in migrainous patients.

There is a remote potential for a severe anaphylactic reaction due to absence or severe deficiency of IgA in patients who also have anti-IgA antibodies. This rarity occurs in patients with common variable immunodeficiency. IgA deficiency is common in the general population (prevalence about 1:1000), but it is not a risk factor by itself; about 29% of these individuals have anti-IgA antibodies, but their presence does not necessarily predict the development of allergic reaction from IVIg.

### Intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIg) for treatment of CIDP and related immune-mediated neuropathies [^f4948a64]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) is considered an effective and safe treatment for autoimmune neuropathies, especially in comparison to the alternative treatments such as corticosteroids, chemotherapy, and plasmapheresis. Patients are frequently given a standard induction dose of 2 g/kg, which may be followed by maintenance therapy as needed. Mild infusion-related reactions are frequent but these can often be controlled by slowing the infusion rate or by symptomatic medications. Serious adverse effects are rare and can include thromboembolic events, renal failure, anaphylaxis, or septic meningitis. Patients with IgA deficiency are at risk for anaphylaxis. Immobility, increased serum viscosity, and preexisting vascular disease can increase the risk for thromboembolic events. Preexisting renal insufficiency or the use of sucrose-containing IVIg preparations can increase the risk for renal failure, and patients with migraine are at risk for development of aseptic meningitis. Screening patients for risk factors that predispose to development of adverse events may reduce the incidence of complications.

### Safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy [^15ebfd4f]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is administered both for the treatment of immunodeficiencies and for an expanding list of autoimmune diseases. Most adverse effects are mild and transient including headaches, flushing, fever, chills, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, blood pressure changes and tachycardia. IgA deficiency-related anaphylactic reactions are largely preventable. Late adverse events are rare and include acute renal failure and thromboembolic events. Acute renal failure, usually oliguric and transient, occurs generally in insufficiently hydrated patients and with sucrose-stabilized products due to osmotic injury. Thromboembolic complications occur due to hyperviscosity especially in patients having risk factors including advanced age, previous thromboembolic events, immobilization, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia or those receiving high-dose IVIg in a rapid infusion rate or excessive dose. Slow infusion rate and good hydration may prevent renal failure, thromboembolic events and aseptic meningitis. In our experience in more than 200 patients receiving IVIg for different autoimmune diseases and near 10000 infusions for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients, the occurrence of adverse effects was 24–36% after high dose IVIg, most were headaches and all were mild adverse events. We conclude that IVIg is a safe therapy when given in a slow infusion rate in well-hydrated patients, better avoiding patients with known risk factors.

### A multicentric clinical study to evaluate pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of immune globulin subcutaneous 20% weekly / biweekly dosing in treatment-experienced patients and loading / weekly maintenance dosing in treatment-Naïve patients with primary immunodeficiency [^5122e61b]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion is routinely used to treat patients with defective antibody production related to primary immunodeficiencies (PI) in order to prevent infections. Intravenous (IV) administration of immunoglobulin (IG) was the standard route for many years. Descriptions of an alternative route, subcutaneous (SC) administration, were originally published in the 1980 s, and after many years of use primarily in Scandinavia, a subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) product was approved in the US in 2006. Since that time the use of SCIG has expanded significantly and there are currently seven SCIG products approved in the US.

Selection of SCIG or IVIG should be guided by the patient's clinical characteristics, patient preference, care location (hospital, outpatient, community office, or home-based), availability, and pharmacoeconomics. SCIG may benefit patients with poor venous access or at risk for systemic adverse events (AEs). While some countries offer training for home administration of IVIG, SCIG offers wider possibilities for home administration, which translates to greater ease of use, enhanced independence, and eventually improved quality of life.

SCIG has a long history as a safe and effective treatment of PI. Well-controlled clinical trials on transitioning from IVIG to SCIG administration illustrate that SCIG preserved efficacy against severe bacterial infections (SBIs). PI patients more prone to systemic adverse reactions with repeated IVIG infusions (e.g. headaches, fever, chills, and myalgia) may benefit from diminished systemic adverse reactions with SCIG. Moreover, SCIG can be appropriate in pediatric patients whose venous access is typically difficult, which can impede IVIG therapy.

Pharmacokinetic (PK) non-inferiority is a prerequisite for US regulatory approval of SCIG for PI. PK non-inferiority is based on the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) for total immunoglobulin G (IgG) which is achieved using a dose adjustment factor (DAF) for the transition from IV to SC. In the US, the initial approval of Xembify ® (IGSC 20%) was based on bioequivalence with IVIG using a DAF of 1.37, with similar efficacy and tolerability in Phase 3 study GTI1502.

### Adverse effects of treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins for neurological diseases [^652dcd1d]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Therapy with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) is considered to be a safe treatment for a number of immune-mediated neurological diseases. Published data about prevalence of adverse effects range from 11 to 81%. The purpose of our study was to preserve a representative view on adverse effects by analysis of a large cohort of patients treated by IVIg. A recent prospective study reported 42.7% adverse events. The majority of patients presented with minor adverse effects, mostly asymptomatic laboratory changes. Rash or mild headache occurred especially when IVIg was administered with an infusion flow higher than 10 g/h. Severe complications like deep vein thrombosis or others are rare. In addition to its efficacy, IVIg therapy appears to be a safe therapy in immune-mediated neurological diseases. Most patients show no or minor adverse effects. Patients with pre-existent disorders like heart or renal insufficiency or immobilized patients, however, may be at higher risk for complications.

### The role of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in rheumatology [^b525e9d9]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

For many years, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, steroids and immunosuppressive drugs have been the mainstay of treatment for rheumatological disorders. Over the last few years, the emergence of biologic treatments has dramatically changed the management of numerous rheumatological diseases. However, immunoglobulin treatment has been used for decades and its use has still not been superseded in certain rheumatological diseases. In fact, despite the introduction of newer immunomodulatory drugs, there has been an ever-increasing number of clinical indications for which intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been tried. Immunoglobulins are plasma proteins secreted by plasma cells, forming a major component of the adaptive immune system. IVIG is a blood product prepared from plasma, each batch prepared from a pool of 10,000–20,000 donations. Multiple purification steps during the manufacturing process aim to eliminate all known transmissible pathogens, but cannot completely exclude the risk from unknown pathogens. It should be noted that there has been the transmission of hepatitis C in one batch of immunoglobulin, reported in 1994, resulting in more than 200 patients in the USA and Europe being affected. Nevertheless, IVIG remains relatively safe compared with other immunosuppressive drugs. Headaches and fatigue are common side effects but fortunately the more severe problems such as aseptic meningitis, venous thromboembolism and acute renal failure remain rare. High-dose immunoglobulin when administered i.v. has immunomodulatory properties. The precise mechanism of action of IVIG is complex and not yet fully understood.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin in immunodeficiency states: state of the art [^e3b8fb20]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been used successfully for hypogammaglobulinemic states for more than 20 yr. In both primary and secondary situations when hypogammaglobulinemia is of clinical significance, IVIg should be the first line of treatment. In most cases, 400 mg/kg infused every 3 to 4 wk will lead to a trough level higher than 500 mg/dL, which in most cases provides good protection against bacterial infections. Higher doses may be needed in patients with known lung damage. Side effects include headache, nausea, chills, and fever but can be minimized by lowering the infusion speed rate. Rarely, aseptic meningitis may develop but it is always reversible. Although all products have been shown to be beneficial, differences among the various products have still been reported. In this regard, all products should be standardized according to common accepted international parameters. The route of immunoglobulin G replacement (intravenously vs subcutaneously) was reported to be of similar benefit. However, guidelines for usage and choice of route should be established and might be of help.

### Can low-dose intravenous immunoglobulin be an alternative to high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c0a27ecc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

As for safety, Kato et al.16 enrolled 748 patients treated with IVIg for different diseases and found adverse events were recorded in 8.5% of patients received higher doses of IVIg while only 0.8% of patients received lower doses experienced adverse events. Our results showed the pooled AR of the HD-IVIg group was nearly double the LD-IVIg group, indicating the risks may be dose-related and mostly associated with high-dose administration.

Furthermore, IVIg-associated adverse events were mainly divided into immediate and delayed adverse reactions. The most common immediate adverse reactions were mild influenza-like symptoms such as fever, flush, headache, fatigue and dizziness. Delayed adverse reactions were severe and rare, such as thrombosis, aseptic meningitis, hemolysis, renal failure, and nervous system diseases. In our study, most of reported adverse reactions were mild, which could be alleviated by slowing down the infusion speed, discontinuing infusion or symptomatic treatment.

Although a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing 1 g/kg and 2 g/kg has been already published in 2010 (OR: 1.00, 95%CI: 0.61–1.63), some apparent flaws such as insufficient literature search and incomplete evaluation of the effect of low-dose IVIg existed. In this study, we have performed a comprehensive search, pooled the effective rate, and performed the subgroup analysis based on different low-dose schemes. Our results may provide more information for selecting an appropriate dosage of IVIg, which may ultimately lead to a reduction in medical costs.

However, there are some limitations in this current study. First, all the studies were from China. Most of the included RCTs did not describe the blinding and allocation concealment methods in detail and the potential confounding factors were not controlled in the cohort studies, which limited the quality of our results. Second, only a few studies used 0.6 or 0.8 g/kg IVIg and the sample sizes were small, which might lead to uncertain estimation of their efficacy. Third, there was a lack of long-term follow-up in the included studies, so we failed to assess whether low-dose IVIg can reduce the likelihood of developing chronic ITP.

### Safety of intravenous immune globulin in an outpatient setting for patients with neuromuscular disease [^af7bd546]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) is used to treat patients in the outpatient setting, there is limited documentation addressing the safety of this practice.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of 438 patients with neuromuscular diseases receiving IVIg in an outpatient setting.

Results

Adverse events (AE) overall occurred in 16.9% of patients. Headache was the most common AE, noted in 11.6% of patients. Serious AEs occurred in 0.91% of patients; aseptic meningitis was the only one noted. Multivariate analyses identified the following risk factors for AEs: first-lifetime course of IVIg, higher dose per course of IVIg, diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, women, and younger age.

Discussion

Intravenous immune globulin is generally safe to administer in an outpatient setting. Women, myasthenia gravis patients, and those receiving their first course or a higher total dose of IVIg are at an increased risk of experiencing an AE.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin for immune-mediated skin disease: current view [^d59f28f9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIgs) exert a variety of immunomodulating activities and are, therefore, increasingly being used for the treatment of immune-mediated as well as autoimmune diseases. There is also accumulating evidence that high-dose IVIg (hdIVIg) is highly efficacious in the treatment of skin diseases, despite the lack of evidence from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. A major advantage of hdIVIg in comparison with other commonly used immunomodulating therapeutic strategies is the excellent safety profile. Accordingly, IVIgs have been used successfully for the treatment of bullous autoimmune diseases such as pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid, dermatomyositis, scleroderma, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and erythema exudativum multiforme. In most cases, hdIVIg is effective only in combination with other immunomodulating strategies and allows for the reduction of adjuvants. Adverse effects of hdIVIg are generally mild and self-limiting. These include headache, myalgia, flush, fever, nausea or vomiting, chills, lower backache, changes in blood pressure, and tachycardia. To avoid infusion-related rigors, headaches, and other adverse events, pre-treatment with analgesics, NSAIDs, antihistamines, or low-dose intravenous corticosteroids may be beneficial. Controlled, double-blind, long-term clinical trials and a better understanding of the complex immunomodulating mechanism of IVIg are required to ultimately optimize dose, frequency, duration, and mode of IVIg administration.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin: adverse effects and safe administration [^f52ffd5a]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is administered for various indications and generally considered a safe therapy. Most of the adverse effects (AEs) associated with IVIg administration are mild and transient. The immediate AEs include headache, flushing, malaise, chest tightness, fever, chills, myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea, back pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blood pressure changes, tachycardia, and anaphylactic reactions, especially in IgA-deficient patients. Late AEs are rare and include acute renal failure, thromboembolic events, aseptic meningitis, neutropenia, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, skin reactions, and rare events of arthritis. Pseudohyponatremia following IVIg is important to be recognized. Renal failure, usually oliguric and transient, occurs mostly on using sucrose-containing products owing to osmotic injury. Among high-risk patients who have a previous renal disease, dehydration, diabetes mellitus, advanced age, hypertension, hyperviscosity, or are treated by other nephrotoxic medications, administration of a non-sucrose-containing IVIg product after accomplishing hydration, in a low concentration and a slow infusion rate while supervising urine output and kidney function, is recommended. Thromboembolic complications occur because of hyperviscosity especially in patients having risk factors including advanced age, previous thromboembolic diseases, being bedridden, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or those receiving high-dose IVIg in a rapid infusion rate. Immediate AEs can be treated by the slowing or temporary discontinuation of the infusion and symptomatic therapy with analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistamines, and glucocorticoids in more severe reactions. Slow infusion rate of low concentration of IVIg products and hydration, especially in high-risk patients, may prevent renal failure, thromboembolic events, and aseptic meningitis.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin in neurological disease: a specialist review [^abbb8e86]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment of neurological disorders with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is an increasing feature of our practice for an expanding range of indications. For some there is evidence of benefit from randomised controlled trials, whereas for others evidence is anecdotal. The relative rarity of some of the disorders means that good randomised control trials will be difficult to deliver. Meanwhile, the treatment is costly and pressure to "do something" in often distressing disorders considerable. This review follows a 1 day meeting of the authors in November 2000 and examines current evidence for the use of IVIg in neurological conditions and comments on mechanisms of action, delivery, safety and tolerability, and health economic issues. Evidence of efficacy has been classified into levels for healthcare interventions (tables 1 and 2).

Adverse effects — intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) safety profile: Side effects of IVIG are usually minor and include headache, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, myalgias, arthralgias, flushing, rash, fevers, chills, and other flu-like symptoms, though incidence and severity vary by brand, rate of infusion, dose, and prior infusion history, and patients with SFN and POTS may be more prone to adverse effects and may require adjusted dosing regimens. Less commonly, major complications occur; thrombotic events have a reported incidence of 1 to 13% and include deep venous thrombosis, PE, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. In a retrospective study of inflammatory neuropathy, among 62 patients who received a total of 616 IVIG infusions, thrombotic events occurred in 7 patients, 5 within 14 days, with an overall incidence of 1% per infusion; risk factors included prior thromboses, coronary disease, immobility, and doses of ≥ 35 gm per day. A proposed mechanism is an acute increase in plasma viscosity, with one study demonstrating an 11% increase within the first 25 h among 15 patients receiving 2 gm/kg; other major side effects reported include renal failure, hypotension, aseptic meningitis, elevated transaminases, transient hematologic abnormalities, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.

3 DISCUSSION

IVIgs are therapeutic preparations containing pooled human IgG from thousands of donors. To meet the high quality and safety standards required by the regulatory authorities, these formulations undergo a sophisticated manufacturing process that achieves a highly purified product while preserving structure and function of the IgG antibodies. This complex multistep workflow starts with epidemiological donor screening and plasma collection, followed by product quarantine and validated virus elimination techniques, as well as minimization of IgA concentration. Commercially available IVIg formulations achieve a purity of at least 95% but vary in terms of the excipient composition comprising IgA, IgM, stabilizing agents, salts, as well as traces of buffers, solvents, and detergents. The most common stabilizing agents include sugars such as sucrose, glucose, maltose, D‐sorbitol, and proteins such as L‐proline or glycine.

IVIgs are used to treat a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions such as primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, primary immune thrombocytopenia, Kawasaki disease, and neuromuscular conditions. IVIgs have proven to be particularly effective for dermatological diseases such as dermatomyositis, lupus erythematosus, systemic vasculitis, scleromyxedema, and autoimmune blistering diseases. IVIgs have proven effective in severe cases of PV that have failed standard therapy and can be regarded as a secondary or tertiary treatment option with a high efficacy, high level of evidence, and overall good tolerability. Rare side effects include thromboembolic events, hemolytic anemia, renal insufficiency, and aseptic meningitis. In addition, anaphylactic reactions may occur but can be controlled with appropriate medication. The most common side effects are headache, fatigue, nausea, flushing, and fever, which are described in about 10% of patients. These may be controlled by adjusting the infusion rate, increasing fluid intake, or a premedication with painkillers, antipyretics, antihistamines, or corticosteroids. Nevertheless, side effects reduce quality of life, differ between patients, and may be associated with different IVIg preparations.

Adverse reaction rate of LD-IVIg and HD-IVIg treatment

The pooled AR rate of LD-IVIg group was 3% (95%CI: 1–4%; I² = 19.76%) (Fig. 10 A), which was markedly lower than that of HD-IVIg group (6%; 95%CI: 3–9%; I² = 55.91%) (Fig. 10 B). The results of sensitivity analysis were shown in supplemental Fig. 24. Funnel plots (Supplemental Fig. 25) and Egger's test (LD-IVIg group: P = 0.0004; HD-IVIg group: P < 0.0001) found publication bias across the 13 studies.

In addition, the most common adverse reaction reported in the included studies was fever (42%). Other reactions such as flushing (11%), skin rash (7%), phlebitis (8%), allergy (17%), headache and dizziness (8%), nausea and vomiting (9%) occurred much less frequently.

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy — IVIG maintenance dosing and efficacy: In a Class I randomized crossover study involving 22 IVIG‑dependent patients, more frequent lower dosing IVIG versus conventional high‑dose, low‑frequency treatment showed no difference in the primary endpoint of handgrip strength and did not result in higher IgG trough levels or reduced adverse effects. In the Progress in CIDP (ProCID) Class I RCT, 142 patients were randomized to receive seven maintenance doses of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 g/kg of IVIG every 3 weeks after an induction dose of 2 g/m/kg; response rates were 22/34 patients (95% CI: 48–79%) in the 0.5 g/m/kg group, 55/69 (95% CI: 69–88%) in the 1.0 g/kg group, and 33/36 (95% CI: 79–97%) in the 2.0 g/m/kg group. Although a dose-dependent response was suggested, the only between‑group difference was seen between the 0.5 and 2.0 g/m/kg groups; adverse effects were similar, with a dose effect on headache incidence, highest at 24% in the 2 g/m/kg group.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Serious adverse reactions observed in clinical trial subjects receiving BIVIGAM were vomiting and dehydration in one subject.

The most common adverse reactions to BIVIGAM (reported in ≥ 5% of clinical study subjects) were headache, fatigue, infusion site reaction, nausea, sinusitis, blood pressure increased, diarrhea, dizziness, and lethargy.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another product and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

In a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized clinical trial, 63 subjects with PI, on regular IGIV replacement therapy, received doses of BIVIGAM ranging from 254 to 1029 mg/kg (median dose 462.8 mg/kg) every 3 weeks or 4 weeks for up to 12 months (mean 317.3 days; range 66–386 days) (see Clinical Studies [14]). The use of pre-medication was discouraged; however, if subjects required pre-medication (antipyretic, antihistamine, or antiemetic agent) for recurrent reactions to immune globulins, they were allowed to continue those medications for this trial. Of the 746 infusions administered, 41 (65%) subjects received premedication prior to 415 (56%) infusions.

Fifty-nine subjects (94%) had an adverse reaction at some time during the study. The proportion of subjects who had at least one adverse reaction was the same for both the 3- and 4-week cycles. The most common adverse reactions observed in this clinical trial were headache (32 subjects, 51%), sinusitis (24 subjects, 38%), fatigue (18 subjects, 29%), upper respiratory tract infection (16 subjects, 25%), diarrhea (13 subjects, 21%), cough (14 subjects, 22%), bronchitis (12 subjects, 19%), pyrexia (12 subjects, 19%), and nausea (9 subjects, 14%).

### Redimune NF liquid, a ready-to-use, high-concentration intravenous immunoglobulin therapy preparation, is safe and typically well tolerated in the routine clinical management of a broad range of conditions [^18ed769b]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) is used in the management of a wide variety of medical conditions. Observational studies examining IVIG use in routine clinical practice are therefore an important means of validating findings from more strictly randomized controlled trials of patients with specific conditions. In this observational study, we examined the tolerability of a high-concentration (12%) ready-to-use liquid IVIG (Redimune NF Liquid) when used in the standard management of a diverse range of conditions (including primary immunodeficiency diseases, neurology conditions, oncology conditions and immune thrombocytopaenic purpura). IVIG regimen and dose were selected by the physician based on the summary of product characteristics. During the study, 193 infusions were administered to 51 patients in 153 infusion cycles (per infusion cycle: one to five infusions; mean dose, 347.6 mg/kg; mean duration, 202.4 min). The mean maximum infusion rate per cycle was 2.9 mg/kg/min, demonstrating that the infusion rate was often higher than that recommended in the summary of product characteristics. Redimune NF Liquid was well tolerated: there were 36 adverse reactions (at least probably associated with IVIG) in 10 patients (19.6% of sample, 0.24 per infusion cycle, 0.19 per infusion). The most common adverse reaction was headache (50% of reactions), followed by chills (13.8%). Most reactions (69%) were mild and there were no serious or unexpected reactions. In conclusion, in routine clinical practice involving patients with many different conditions, Redimune NF Liquid was well tolerated by the majority of patients.

### Case report: a novel high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin preparation for the treatment of severe pemphigus vulgaris failing standard therapy [^8cc367f8]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a severe autoimmune bullous dermatosis that is characterized by autoantibodies against epidermal adhesion proteins causing painful mucosal and skin blistering. Standard treatments for PV include corticosteroids, steroid-sparing immunosuppressants, or intravenous monoclonal anti-CD20-antibody therapy. The European guidelines suggest high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy as a promising approach for severe or treatment-resistant cases. We report on a 65-year-old woman with severe and recurrent disease who achieved long-term disease stabilization with IVIg treatment. Because of recurrent fatigue and headache, the patient was switched to an alternative IVIg preparation with a novel manufacturing process, thus ensuring high purity and better tolerability. We observed excellent efficacy, yet side effects remained largely unchanged. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of this new IVIg preparation.

3.4 Safety Outcomes

Overall, 60 AEs were reported in 14 patients (70.0%), with event rates of 0.15 per infusion and 3.00 per patient (Table 3). Treatment‐related AEs occurred in 11 patients (55.0%), with 2 patients (10.0%) experiencing a severe event (headache reported by one patient and pain in the body, arms, legs, and joints reported by one patient). The most frequently reported AEs (> 5% of patients) were headache (40.0%) and pyrexia (10.0%). No patients experienced local AEs, and no patients reported serious AEs or AEs leading to study drug withdrawal or early discontinuation. No deaths were reported during the study. Overall, 389 infusions were administered, of which less than 1% had the infusion rate reduced or the infusion interrupted or stopped owing to intolerability.

### IVMP + IVIG raises platelet counts faster than IVIG alone: results of a randomized, blinded trial in childhood ITP [^39d743c4]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) rarely suffer from life-threatening bleeds (eg, intracranial hemorrhage). In such settings, the combination of IV methylprednisolone (IVMP) with IV immune globulin (IVIG) is used to rapidly increase platelet counts (PCs). However, there are no controlled data to support using combination therapy over IVIG alone. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the rapidity of the PC increment and associated adverse events (AEs) between 2 regimens: A (IV placebo) and B (IVMP 30 mg/kg), both given over 1 hour, followed in both cases by IVIG (Gamunex 10%) 1 g/kg over 2–3 hours in children 1–17 years old with primary ITP and PCs < 20 × 109/L in whom physicians had decided to treat with IVIG. Thirty-two children (ages: median, 8 years; range, 1.2–17.5 years) with a mean baseline PC of 9.2 × 109/L participated. Eighteen were randomized to regimen A and 14 to regimen B. By 8 hours after initiating therapy, 55% of all children had a PC ≥ 20 × 109/L (no group difference). By 24 hours, mean PCs were 76.9 × 109/L (B) vs 55 × 109/L (A) (P = 0.06; P = 0.035 when adjusted for intergroup differences in patient ages). No patient experienced severe bleeding/unexpected severe AEs. There were statistically fewer IVIG-related headaches in the group receiving combination therapy (P = 0.046). Our findings show a rapid response to IVIG with/without steroids and provide evidence to support the use of IVMP+IVIG in life-threatening situations. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00376077.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) — IVIG efficacy and comparisons: In a Class I randomized controlled trial, 51 patients with worsening weakness were randomized to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 gm/kg divided over 2 days or placebo, yielding a change in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score at 14 days of −2.54 versus −0.89 (p = .047), with benefit significant in moderate to severe disease. A Class I dose-optimization study for MG exacerbation randomized 173 patients to 2 gm/kg over 2 days versus 1 gm/kg on day 1 then placebo, showing mean improvement at 2 weeks of 19.3 points (95% CI 15.82 to 22.85) versus 15.49 points (95% CI 12.09 to 18.09) and headache 22.7% versus 13.1%. In a Class I comparison with plasma exchange (PLEX), 84 patients with QMG score > 10.5 received IVIG 2 gm/kg over 2 days or PLEX with 5% albumin every other day for 5 days, with responders 51% versus 57% (p = .5) and 20% (10 vs 8) requiring additional treatment. In corticosteroid-dependent MG, 60 patients were randomized to IVIG 2 gm/kg followed by 12 maintenance doses of 1 gm/kg every 3 weeks or placebo, with a 50% reduction at week 39 achieved by 60% versus 63% and only 38 patients (63%) completing; a 2012 Cochrane analysis concluded IVIG was beneficial in MG exacerbation with comparable efficacy to PLEX but with insufficient evidence in stable MG; overall, there is Class I evidence that IVIG is effective in treating MG exacerbation especially in those with moderate to severe disease.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: challenges and best practices [^0ff7886f]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is characterized by a reduction in platelet count that may be associated with severe bleeding in some patients. 1 The disease may have a substantial impact on the patient's quality of life, resulting, at least in part, from significant treatment burden. Indeed, health‐related quality of life for patients with ITP may be worse than that of patients with many other chronic conditions, including hypertension and arthritis. 2

First‐line treatments for ITP include corticosteroids (prednisone, dexamethasone), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and anti‐D (Rh0) immunoglobulin. 3 These therapies are used as upfront treatment in newly diagnosed patients and also as rescue therapies in patients with established ITP, with the goal of rapidly elevating platelet counts and preventing or controlling bleeding events. 4 While corticosteroids and immunoglobulins produce an initial response in most patients (60%‐70% and 90%, respectively), the response is usually transient (< 6 months and 2–4 weeks, respectively) and the medications must be readministered if the patient's platelet count does not stabilize. 5 Repeated or prolonged administration of first‐line therapies is typically not suitable due to significant adverse effects (eg, osteoporosis, diabetes, cataracts, weight gain, infections) with corticosteroids and high cost, inconvenience of frequent infusions, and debilitating post‐infusion headache with immunoglobulins. 4, 6, 7

Spontaneous remissions in patients who have never received treatment are uncommon in adults with ITP (9%). In many patients, the disease becomes persistent (3–12 months duration) or chronic (> 12 months duration), and second‐line treatment may be needed. 3, 8, 9

TAAE = temporally-associated adverse event; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event

Three participants experienced seven TEAEs that were assessed as related to the study drug, including procedural headache (two participants experiencing three events), fatigue, and headache (each with one participant experiencing two events). Treatment-related procedural headache and fatigue were only reported with the 3-week regimen, whereas treatment-related headaches were only reported with the 4-week regimen.

Overall, most reported TEAEs were moderate (41/74 events) or mild (32/74 events) in intensity (Online Resource: Table S2), and only one TEAE (hemiparesis reported as left-side weakness in a 15-year-old male in the 3-week infusion regimen group) was deemed severe during the study. This event was reported as a serious adverse event (SAE), but it resolved on the following day, did not require a dose change, and was assessed as not related to the study drug. Alternative etiology was reported with possible psychological component, including conversion disorder or neuro-immune presentation related to common variable immune deficiency. No severe TEAEs/SAEs occurred in the 4-week infusion regimen group. Across the sample, the highest TEAE intensity was mild in four participants, moderate in eight participants, and severe in one participant. No TEAEs leading to discontinuation or death, no adverse events of special interest, and no infusion site reactions occurred during the study period.

### Case report: a novel high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin preparation for the treatment of severe pemphigus vulgaris failing standard therapy [^a4dfeb57]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a severe autoimmune bullous dermatosis that is characterized by autoantibodies against epidermal adhesion proteins causing painful mucosal and skin blistering. Standard treatments for PV include corticosteroids, steroid‐sparing immunosuppressants, or intravenous monoclonal anti–CD20‐antibody therapy. The European guidelines suggest high‐dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy as a promising approach for severe or treatment‐resistant cases. We report on a 65‐year‐old woman with severe and recurrent disease who achieved long‐term disease stabilization with IVIg treatment. Because of recurrent fatigue and headache, the patient was switched to an alternative IVIg preparation with a novel manufacturing process, thus ensuring high purity and better tolerability. We observed excellent efficacy, yet side effects remained largely unchanged. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the long‐term efficacy and tolerability of this new IVIg preparation.

### Side effects of intravenous immunoglobulins in neurological autoimmune disorders – a prospective study [^10bebf18]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

The increased use of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) in the treatment of neurological autoimmune diseases has led to more awareness of adverse reactions. We studied prospectively the side effects of IVIg during 84 treatment courses with a total of 341 infusions under routine clinical conditions. Mild reactions were common. Headache was noted most often, occurring during 30% of treatment courses. There were three severe adverse events (3.6% of all treatment courses) that led to discontinuation of the treatment, namely thrombosis of the jugular vein, allergic reaction and retrosternal pressure. Significant changes in laboratory findings were seen for leucocytes, erythrocytes, haematocrit, haemoglobin, ALAT and ASAT. None of these changes were clinically relevant. The elevation of liver enzymes was dependent on the IVIg preparation used, while there was no association with the underlying disease, age, or gender of the patient. In conclusion, this prospective study confirms the high frequency of mild, self-limited side effects of IVIg. Elevation of liver enzymes may possibly be associated with certain IVIg preparations. Bearing these complications in mind, this prospective study supports the notion that IVIg can generally be regarded as safe, leading to severe adverse events during only 3 (0.9%) of 341 infusions (or 3 of 84 treatment courses, 3.6%). However, careful monitoring for severe side effects remains mandatory, and we propose that laboratory findings like full blood count, renal and liver function should be monitored routinely.

### A prospective study of the immediate and delayed adverse events following intravenous immunoglobulin infusions [^738a74b4]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2006). Low credibility.

Aim

To document the incidence of immediate and delayed adverse events (AE) following intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion in children.

Methods

Immediate and delayed adverse events were prospectively recorded for 345 infusions in 58 children receiving IVIG for immunodeficiency (n = 33) or immunomodulation (n = 25). For each infusion adverse events were documented during the infusion and by follow up interview 4–7 days later.

Results

Immediate adverse events occurred in 10.3% and delayed adverse events in 41.4% of children treated during the study period. Three and a half per cent of the infusions were associated with immediate AE and 20.9% with delayed adverse events. Headache was the most common delayed AE, occurring in 24.1% of patients and 12.8% of infusions.

Conclusions

Delayed adverse events to IVIG infusions are common in children. They occur more frequently than immediate adverse events and are the cause of significant morbidity. Recognition of the high frequency of delayed adverse events is important in the care of children receiving IVIG therapy.

Methods

Data Sources and Search Strategy

This review was recorded in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews with the code PROSPERO CRD42023445798 and was conducted in agreement with the 2020 edition of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. The data sources utilized were Excerpta Medica, the US National Library of Medicine, and Web of Sciences, without any limitation. The search strategy employed the following terms entered in separate pairs: (Intravenous immunoglobulin OR IVIG OR gamma globulin) AND (meningitis OR cerebrospinal inflammation). Relevant articles cited in the retrieved records, reports available in Google Scholar, and reports previously known to the authors were also considered for inclusion. The search was carried out in June 2023 and repeated prior to submission (November 8, 2023).

Eligibility

Eligible were individually documented cases with the clinical (increased body temperature, nausea, vomiting, headache, neck stiffness, and seizures) and laboratory (white cell pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid) features of acute aseptic meningitis temporally associated with intravenous polyclonal immunoglobulin therapy, negative microbiological studies, and absence of any other explanation for the pleocytosis including meningitis directly induced by an underlying autoimmune disease. From each case of aseptic meningitis associated with a polyclonal immunoglobulin therapy, we extracted following information: (1) demographics; (2) underlying medical condition; (3) dose and type of employed immunoglobulin product; (4) symptoms and signs consistent with a meningitis; (5) signs and symptoms consistent with an anaphylactic reaction (acute onset skin and mucosal lesions together with respiratory, cardiovascular, and intestinal involvement) or a serum sickness (skin rash and joint pain) and impression that meningitis may have been facilitated by a rapid drug administration of polyclonal immunoglobulin; (6) results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis; (7) time latency between initiating immunoglobulin therapy and development of acute meningitis; (8) time required for recovery after discontinuing immunoglobulin therapy and possible sequelae; and (9) recurrent episodes of meningitis and sequelae. Eligible were also case series and pharmacovigilance studies addressing the issue of acute meningitis syndrome temporally associated with polyclonal immunoglobulin therapy.

### Transverse sinus thrombosis and IVIg treatment: a case report and discussion of risk-benefit assessment for immunoglobulin treatment [^3429f137]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

A 54 year old woman presented with symptoms resulting from a thrombosis of the lateral transverse and sagittal sinuses the day after an infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) replacement treatment. She had previously suffered a milder episode after IVIg. Following recurrent bacterial chest infections and sinusitis for more than 40 years, a diagnosis of IgG1 deficiency had been made two years earlier, after exclusion of other causes. She made a good recovery from the thrombosis but high platelet counts were investigated and primary thrombocythaemia was diagnosed. Investigation of humoral immunity revealed protective amounts of IgG antibodies to pathogens, and because the previous IgG1 deficiency had resolved IVIg infusions were not restarted. She made a good response to treatment with hydroxyurea, with improvement of the headaches and lowering of the platelet counts. Prophylactic antibiotics reduced the number of bacterial chest infections and nasal corticosteroids improved the chronic sinusitis. This case is presented to highlight the need to look for other contributing factors for severe recurrent headaches after IVIg treatment, and to consider the risk of thrombosis even when replacement doses of IVIg are used. It is also important to emphasise the need to ensure that an isolated IgG subclass deficiency is not transient; that failure to produce specific IgG antibodies to immunisation and/or exposure antigens is confirmed, thus meeting the criteria for the diagnosis of primary antibody deficiency. A thorough risk-benefit assessment is essential before blood product treatment is started.

### Insights into patient experiences with facilitated subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy in primary immune deficiency: a prospective observational cohort [^f6832c17]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immunoglobulin Replacement Therapy (IgRT) stands as the primary pharmacological intervention for a diverse spectrum of Primary Immunodeficiency (PID) disorders, boasting a history of over six decades. Currently, IgRT offers two administration routes: intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC).

Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement therapy requires IV access, administration, and monitoring by healthcare professionals. It may entail systemic adverse reactions, including headaches, nausea, vomiting, rare thromboembolic events, and hypersensitivity reactions. Conversely, Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin (SCIG) replacement therapy has gained increasing popularity, emerging as a viable alternative to IVIG. SCIG is recognized as equally effective as IVIG but triggers fewer systemic reactions, making it a crucial option for patients intolerant to IV infusion or lacking reliable venous access. The subcutaneous administration route allows for self-infusion at home, a practice widely acknowledged for its positive impact on health-related quality of life. However, a primary limitation of SCIG therapy lies in the inherent resistance of the extracellular matrix (ECM), constraining the volume that can be infused at a single site. Consequently, multiple infusion sites must be utilized on a weekly or biweekly basis instead of the monthly IV infusion.

There are currently various methods for Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin (SCIG) application: the conventional 10% (pump-assisted or rapid-push method), pump-assisted concentrated 20% and the facilitated SCIG infusions. Facilitated Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin (fSCIG) is a combination of two components: recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) and 10% human normal immunoglobulin G (IgG). rHuPH20 acts to break down hyaluronan, thereby increasing the permeability of subcutaneous tissue, which allows for the infusion of larger volumes of IgG compared to conventional subcutaneous immunoglobulin. Consequently, fSCIG can be self-administered at home every 2 to 4 weeks using a single infusion site. At the current time, the fSCIG option is specifically designed to combine the advantages of intravenous and subcutaneous immune globulin therapies. It allows for the administration of larger volumes of medication at a single subcutaneous site, while requiring less frequent dosing compared to other SCIG products. fSCIG reduces dosing frequency while maintaining the comfort of home administration and avoiding the need for intravenous infusion. The present study investigates the 12-month experience with fSCIG in a prospective observational cohort from five PID centers. The aim is to discern patients' administration practices in real-life experience, assess the effectiveness and safety, evaluate patient satisfaction, and measure the impact on the quality of life (QoL) among individuals with PID receiving fSCIG.

### A multicentre study on the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of iqYmune ®, a highly purified 10% liquid intravenous immunoglobulin, in patients with primary immune deficiency [^f9bfc8ff]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are a heterogeneous group of inherited diseases predisposing individuals to increased risk of infection. To date, more than 200 types of PIDs have been reported in the literature, but less than 10 of them account for more than 60% of all PID cases. Most types of PIDs are associated with a hypogammaglobulinemia due to impaired antibody production. Chronic or recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and otitis media are the most common infections, while severe bacterial infections (SBIs) such as sepsis, meningitis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis can also occur. In the absence of early diagnosis and appropriate therapy, recurrent respiratory infections eventually lead to the development of bronchiectases and other chronic pulmonary diseases.

Immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement is the mainstay of therapy for PID patients with hypo- or agammaglobulinemia. Its efficacy in preventing severe infections is widely demonstrated. X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) and common variable immune deficiency (CVID) are the most common forms of PIDs requiring Ig replacement therapy.

Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is generally well tolerated. Headache, chills, fever, and myalgia are the most common adverse reactions, usually mild in intensity. Severe complications are rare and include acute renal failure, mainly associated with sucrose when used as a stabilizer, haemolysis caused by the presence of red blood cell IgG alloantibodies in Ig preparations, thromboembolic events mainly due to the increased blood viscosity early after Ig administration and/or the presence of pro-coagulant contaminants in Ig preparations, and severe allergic reactions, particularly in IgA-deficient patients.

IqYmune® is a highly purified 10% liquid preparation of human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous administration obtained from thousands of healthy donors. The manufacturing process consists of cold ethanol and caprylic acid fractionation steps followed by purification steps including an anion exchange chromatography for IgA and IgM clearance and an affinity chromatography ensuring a low anti-A and anti-B haemaglutinin content. The inactivation/removal process of potential blood-borne pathogens is mainly based on a solvent/detergent treatment followed by a 20-nm nanofiltration.

The present study investigated the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety of IqYmune® in paediatric and adult patients with XLA or CVID.

5.5 Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS)

AMS may occur infrequently with IGIV treatments including BIVIGAM. AMS usually begins within several hours to 2 days following IGIV treatment. Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae.7,8,9

AMS is characterized by the following signs and symptoms: severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, nausea, and vomiting (see Patient Counseling Information [17.3]). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies frequently reveal pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cubic millimeter, predominantly from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dL, but negative culture results. Conduct a thorough neurological examination on patients exhibiting such signs and symptoms, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis.

AMS may occur more frequently in association with high doses (2 g/kg) and/or rapid infusion of IGIV.

5.6 Hemolysis

IGIV products, including BIVIGAM, may contain blood group antibodies that can act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells (RBCs) with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and, rarely, hemolysis.10,11,12Delayed hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration,13and acute hemolysis, consistent with intravascular hemolysis, has been reported.

Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis (see Patient Counseling Information [17.4]). If these are present after BIVIGAM infusion, perform appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing. If transfusion is indicated for patients who develop hemolysis with clinically compromising anemia after receiving IGIV, perform adequate cross-matching to avoid exacerbating on-going hemolysis.

5.7 Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)

Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema may occur in patients following IGIV treatment14including BIVIGAM. TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever. Symptoms typically appear within 1 to 6 hours following treatment.

Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions. If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and the patient's serum (see Patient Counseling Information [17.5]).

TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support.

Adverse effects

Sixty-five percent (20/31) of patients reported adverse effects, most commonly headaches and vomiting (Table 4). Many adverse effects were limited to the 48–72 h period immediately following the infusion. Treatments were individualized to each patient to minimize adverse effects by prescribing pre-infusion anti-pyretic (ibuprofen 10 mg/kg oral; PO), steroids (solumedrol 1 mg/kg intravaneous; IV), fluids (~ 20 ml/kg ½ normal saline over 1 h), anti-emetics (ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg IV), anti-histamine (diphenhydramine 0.5 mg/kg IV/PO) and/or post infusion fluids. These pretreatments were prescribed in 84%, 81%, 32%, 26%, 19%, and 6%, respectively. Three patients were prescribed anti-emetics up to 72 h post infusion. One patient with baseline idiopathic hypertension was given aggressive hydration pre and post infusion to prevent fluctuation in blood pressure.

SAE serious adverse event

Fifty-nine patients (93.7%) reported at least one adverse event. Of these, 40 patients (63.5%) were judged to have experienced an AE that was related to study product. Mild AEs occurred in 11 (17.5%) patients, moderate AEs occurred in 21 (33.3%) patients and severe AEs were reported in 8 (12.7%) patients. The most frequent severe, drug-related AEs were headache (3 patients, 4.8%), migraine and fatigue (2 patients, 3.2% each).

Eleven serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 7 (11.1%) patients. Two of the SAEs (vomiting, mild in severity and dehydration, moderate in severity) leading to hospitalization in 1 patient were considered as related to study product. None of the SAEs resulted in a dose change, dose interruption or discontinuation from the study and all the SAEs resolved. There were no deaths.

There were 431 temporally associated AEs (TAAEs) in 47 (74.6%) patients. Most TAAEs (335, 78%) occurred during and within the first 24 h after infusion in 36 (57.1%) patients. The proportion of infusions with ≥ 1 temporally associated AEs, regardless of relationship to study product, was 27.7% with an upper one-sided 95% confidence limit of ≤ 30.6%. This is significantly below the upper one-sided 95% confidence limit of 40% for TAAEs recommended by FDA. The most frequent TAAE reported was headache (occurred with 115 infusions in 27 patients) followed by fatigue (59 infusions in 15 patients) (Table III).

### Immune globulin — Octagam immune globulin — human [^8818d03c]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

Adverse Drug Reaction Overview

The most serious adverse reactions observed with Octagam 5% Liquid treatment have been immediate anaphylactic reactions, aseptic meningitis, and hemolytic anemia.

The most common adverse reactions observed with Octagam 5% Liquid treatment during clinical trial (> 5%) were headache and nausea.

Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a product cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another product and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The clinical trial database includes a multi-center, open-label, single arm study in 46 children and adults with PI. Subjects participated in the study for a mean of 346 days and received 300 to 450 mg/kg every 21 days or 400 to 600 mg/kg every 28 days. Infusions were initiated at a rate of 30 mg/kg/hour for the first 30 minutes, and, if tolerated, could be advanced to a maximum tolerated rate not exceeding 200 mg/kg/hour. Over half of the subjects were male (n = 28; 61%), and more than half were on the 28-day infusion schedule (n = 27; 59%). The mean age of subjects was 31.5 years.

Six subjects experienced a total of 12 SAEs (abdominal pain (2 occurrences), cardiac arrest, pneumonia, cellulitis, coxsackie viral infection, renal calculus (2 occurrences), blood culture positive, ketonuria, gastroenteritis, and colitis pseudomembranosus). Eleven of the 12 SAEs were not suspected to be related to study drug; the other SAE was noted before the subject began receiving the next scheduled infusion, and it was not temporally related to the previous infusion.

### Safety and tolerability of a novel chromatography-based intravenous immunoglobulin when administered at a high infusion rate in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura [^af32a691]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IGIV) therapy is generally considered to be a safe and effective treatment for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The usual initial treatment dose is 1–2 g/kg body weight, which results in an extended infusion time, significantly impacting patients' day-to-day activities. Two crossover studies assessed the safety and tolerability of a novel IGIV preparation (IGIV-C; Gamunex, 10%) when infused at rates ranging from 0.08 mL/kg/min (the standard maximum licensed rate) to 0.14 mL/kg/min in patients with ITP. The first study included 28 patients and 3 infusion rates; 0.08, 0.11, and 0.14 mL/kg/min. The second study included 8 patients and 2 infusion rates; 0.08 and 0.14 mL/kg/min were evaluated. The incidence of infusion-related adverse events was similar for all infusion rates. Headache was the most commonly reported infusion-related adverse event. The incidence, combined for Studies 1 and 2, was 14.7% (n = 34), 18.2% (n = 22), and 19.4% (n = 31) of patients, for each infusion rate of 0.08, 0.11, and 0.14 mL/kg/min, respectively. The majority were mild in severity. None of the other drug-related, treatment-emergent events were serious; most were mild, in spite of the higher rate of fluid loading over a shorter period of time for patients infused at 0.14 mL/kg/min. There were no clinically important changes in parameters that distinguished between infusion rates; there were no signs of hemolysis. The results suggest that IGIV-C infused at rates up to 0.14 mL/kg/min in patients with ITP is well tolerated.

### Efficacy, safety and tolerability of a new 10% liquid intravenous immune globulin [IGIV 10%] in patients with primary immunodeficiency [^f87b5ee4]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

The present clinical study was designed to evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety of a new 10% liquid intravenous immune globulin in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases. Sixty-one adults and children with primary immuno-deficiency diseases received doses of 300–600 mg/kg body weight every 21–28 days for 12 months. No validated acute serious bacterial infections were reported. The 95% confidence interval for the annualized rate of acute serious bacterial infections (primary endpoint) was 0–0.060. A total of four predefined validated other bacterial infections commonly occurring in primary immunodeficiency disease subjects were observed; none were serious, severe or resulted in hospitalization. The median elimination half-life of IgG was 35 days. Median total IgG trough levels varied from 9.6 to 11.2 g/L. Temporally associated adverse experiences were determined for 72 h after each infusion and the most common adverse experience was headache, which was associated with 6.9% of infusions. The study met the primary endpoint for efficacy and demonstrated excellent tolerability of the new 10% liquid intravenous imunoglobulin preparation.

### A multicentre study on the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of iqYmune ®, a highly purified 10% liquid intravenous immunoglobulin, in patients with primary immune deficiency [^c409319d]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

IqYmune® was well tolerated. The observed types, severity, and frequency of TEAEs did not differ from those commonly reported with other IVIg preparations. Approximately 99% of the TEAEs were assessed as mild or moderate in severity and the three severe TEAEs were judged as not related to the study drug. As reported in recent studies, both in adults and children, the most frequent TEAE was headache. The rate of infusions with TAAEs of 15.5% was significantly below the safety threshold of 40% required by the FDA and compares favourably with the range of 20.1 to 27.7% recently reported with other IVIg products. Due to the initiation of the IVIg treatment or the switch to a new IVIg preparation, the first infusion was associated with more TAAEs than the subsequent ones. The rate of infusions with at least one TAAE then decreased even though a rebound was observed at the time of the 4th infusion, when maximal infusion rate up to 8 mL/kg/h was first allowed. For the whole study period, the maximum infusion rate was not correlated with the risk of TAAEs (17.5, 11.7, and 13.9% of the infusions with a maximum flow rate of ≤ 4, 4–6, and > 6 mL/kg/h, respectively), showing a good adaptation of the patients to high infusion rates.

### Vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (human) (Cnj-016) [^482d3099]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Hemolysis

VIGIV may contain blood group antibodies which may act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells with immune globulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and hemolysis. Acute hemolysis, consistent with intravascular hemolysis, has been reported and hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced red blood cell sequestration.

The following risk factors may be associated with the development of hemolysis following Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV) products: high doses, given either as a single administration or divided over several days, and non-O blood group (1). Other individual patient factors, such as an underlying inflammatory state (as may be reflected by, for example, elevated C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate), have been hypothesized to increase the risk of hemolysis following administration of IGIV (2), but their role is uncertain. Closely monitor VIGIV recipients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis, particularly patients with risk factors noted above. Consider appropriate laboratory testing in higher risk patients, including measurement of hemoglobin or hematocrit prior to infusion and within approximately 36 to 96 hours post infusion. If signs and/or symptoms of hemolysis or a significant drop in hemoglobin or hematocrit have been observed after VIGIV infusion, perform additional confirmatory laboratory testing. If transfusion is indicated for patients who develop hemolysis with clinically compromising anemia after receiving VIGIV, perform adequate cross-matching to avoid exacerbating on-going hemolysis.

5.6 Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS)

AMS may occur in association with IGIV administration. AMS usually begins within several hours to two days following IGIV treatment. Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae.

AMS is characterized by the following symptoms and signs: severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, and nausea and vomiting. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cubic millimeter, predominately from the granulocytic series, and with elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dL, but negative culture results. Conduct a thorough neurological examination in patients exhibiting such symptoms and signs, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis.

AMS may occur more frequently in association with high total doses (2 g/kg) of IGIV treatment. For VIGIV, at the recommended dosage of 6000 Units per kg, a patient may be exposed to up to 0.18 g/kg protein after VIGIV administration.

5 SAFETY PROFILE

5.1 Systemic adverse events

Similar to other plasma‐derived IgG products marketed in the United States, SCIg carries a US FDA‐mandated "black box" class warning for thrombosis. IVIg is associated with rare but potentially serious AEs, such as thromboembolic events (TEEs), aseptic meningitis, hemolysis, and renal dysfunction. Although less common, these serious AEs can also still occur with SCIg. IVIg is also associated with systemic AEs such as headache, nausea, and flu‐like symptoms, which may be due to the high infusion volumes required and rapid rise in IgG concentration following infusion. Many patients require premedication to tolerate IVIg infusions. In contrast, SCIg administration is associated with a lower rate of systemic AEs and less need for premedication. The Racosta et al. meta‐analysis demonstrated a 28% reduction in relative risk of moderate and / or systemic AEs with SCIg versus IVIg. Van Schaik et al. reported that the rate of headaches was low for SCIg (7%) and this was maintained during the OLE study (5%). In comparison, headaches associated with IVIg have been reported in other studies as ranging between 32% and 62% of patients. Performing an early assessment of patient risk factors for IVIg‐associated AEs can help determine if switching to SCIg would be beneficial.

5.2 Local‐site reactions

Local‐site reactions tend to be the most common AE reported by patients receiving SCIg. Local‐site reactions are usually mild to moderate in intensity and have been reported to significantly decrease with subsequent infusions. The decline in local‐site reactions is potentially a result of improving patient self‐administration technique and habituation to subcutaneous infusions. Local site reactions are rarely reported with IVIg infusions, although bruising can occur at the site of infusion.

5.3 Venous access

Another important difference of SCIg is that it does not require venous access. The majority of patients with CIDP are over 60 y of age and may need treatment for many years. The ability to establish peripheral venous access that remains viable throughout the infusion can become progressively more difficult, and a central venous line may need to be inserted, carrying additional risks.SCIg should always be considered before resorting to a port. Eliminating the need for venous access with SCIg therapy may also provide more treatment flexibility as patients are able to self‐administer at a variety of locations at their own convenience, which may be even more beneficial in the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic.

### Acute aseptic meningitis temporally associated with intravenous polyclonal immunoglobulin therapy: a systematic review [^44e7f6fd]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The term acute aseptic meningitis syndrome denotes a sudden onset condition characterized by symptoms and signs consistent with a meningitis, an elevated white cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid with negative microbiological studies, followed by a typically spontaneous, rapid, and positive course. This syndrome was originally described a century ago by the pediatrician Arvid Wallgren (1883–1973) in individuals with a benign illness resembling viral meningitis. However, its usage has expanded to encompass a wide range of infectious and noninfectious causes.

Several drugs, including some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and antimicrobials like aminopenicillins or sulfonamides, have been temporally associated with aseptic meningitis.

Intravenous polyclonal human immunoglobulins are the cornerstone in the treatment of an array of disorders. However, these preparations have also been temporally associated with headaches, fever, flu-like symptoms, nausea, flushing, rash, joint pain, allergic reactions, anemia, and the development of aseptic meningitis.

To make informed decisions regarding the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, healthcare providers need a thorough understanding of the incidence, risk factors, clinical presentation, prevention, management, and outcome of aseptic meningitis temporally associated with this treatment. Therefore, we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature on this subject.

### Effect of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in therapy-resistant chronic spontaneous urticaria [^3c63d708]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) lasting more than 6 weeks is one of the most disabling types of urticaria and often results in severely impaired quality of life. Patients with CSU are often unsatisfied with the standard treatment. Another treatment option recommended for patients with so-called nonresponding CSU according to the newest guidelines is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of high-dose IVIG as a treatment option in patients with therapy-resistant CSU.

Methods

Six patients with severe CSU unresponsive to other treatment options according to the newest guidelines for several weeks were treated with high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg every 4–6 weeks). The response to treatment was observed on the basis of clinical signs and reduction of co-medications using a special treatment score. Patients were studied during the treatment period and were followed up for an average of 16 months. Adverse events were assessed.

Results

Patients showed an improvement in symptoms and a reduction in co-medication use just after the first cycle. Symptoms such as itching, wheals, and edema were reduced after the first or second cycle of IVIG treatment. Four of 6 patients had complete remission after 2 to 4 cycles. One patient needed a longer continuation of treatment to reach a stable state of improvement, and another patient had a slight relapse after the seventh cycle. Adverse effects, such as headache and increased blood pressure, were observed only at the beginning of treatment.

Conclusion

High-dose IVIG represents an important therapeutic option in patients with severe CSU.

### Effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin for management of neuropathic pain: a narrative review [^6143bfe2]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Others

One prospective observational study evaluated the effectiveness of IVIG for controlling pain from various neurological disorders. In 2002, Goebel et al(prospective observational study) recruited 11 patients with CRPS, five patients with postherpetic neuralgia, six patients with trigeminal neuralgia, 12 patients with posttraumatic or unknown etiology neuropathic pain, three patients with phantom limb pain, and 21 patients with spinal pain. Of 58 patients, 14 (24.1%) showed more than 70% reduction in the initial pain while 11 (19.0%) showed 25–75% reduction in the initial pain.

Adverse Effects

No major adverse effects were observed after IVIG treatment in any study included in our review. However, a few minor adverse effects were reported. Goebel et alreported adverse effects of IVIG as headache, nausea, light-headedness, tiredness, pain elevation, and infusion site reaction. However, of the nine severe adverse events in that study, four occurred after IVIG and five occurred after saline administration. Jann et alalso reported a few adverse effects of IVIG. In that study, however, one patient developed mild dermatitis psoriasiform in the treatment arm while one patient from the placebo group developed mild "influenza". These studies included in our review suggest that there are no significant side effects of IVIG.

### Functional and cutaneous treatment outcomes with intravenous immunoglobulin for eosinophilic fasciitis: a retrospective study [^93053beb]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is a rare subtype of deep morphea with an elevated risk of functional impairment. No treatment algorithm has been established for adults with EF refractory to traditional corticosteroid or immunomodulatory treatments. Research on cutaneous and functional outcomes of alternative therapies, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), remains scarce.&nbsp; Objective: To describe the functional and cutaneous outcomes associated with IVIG in adults with treatment-refractory EF at a tertiary referral center.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of 18 consecutive patients with EF identified through a billing code search seen within the UCSF Department of Dermatology between 2015 and 2022.&nbsp; Results: Seven patients (41.2%) underwent at least one course of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) during the study period. Of 6 patients with available follow-up data, 5 patients (83.3%) achieved both sustained cutaneous and functional improvement. In the IVIG cohort, 1 patient (16.7%) achieved complete response with relapse, 4 (66.7%) were partial responders, and 1 (16.7%) was a non-responder who required treatment with mepolizumab.

Conclusion

Adverse effects of IVIG included headaches in 1 patient (14.3%) and rash in 2 patients (28.6%). There were no reported veno-occlusive or thromboembolic events associated with IVIG.&nbsp; J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(4):8017.&nbsp; &nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.8017e.

### Results of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of anti-zika virus immunoglobulin [^f7e54a0e]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Igs are normal constituents of blood, and they are used at physiological levels without creating pharmacological and toxicological active metabolites. The safety profile for Ig products is well established as a result of a long history of their use in clinical practice for a range of medical conditions. The most common types of AEs related to IV Ig and hyperimmune products are non-anaphylactic infusion reactions (self-limiting), such as abdominal or back pain, fever, headache, chills, rash, fatigue, nausea, or vomiting. The incidence of adverse reactions associated with IV Ig's is in the range of 1% to 15%, but is typically ≤ 5%. AESI such as hypersensitivity reactions, renal dysfunction/failure, aseptic meningitis syndrome, hemolysis, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and thrombotic events have been reported infrequently with IV Ig. ZIKV-Ig was safe and well tolerated in healthy adult subjects with blood types O+ and O–. Related AEs that were reported more frequently in the ZIKV-Ig group compared with the placebo group included headaches. These were reported only in ZIKV-Ig group, which is an expected type of related AE (i.e. adverse drug reaction) for a human IV Ig product. There were no AESI reported in the 19 subjects administered ZIKV-Ig in our study, suggesting a similar safety profile to other IV Ig products.

### Immune globulin — Octagam immune globulin — human [^249d8739]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

Aseptic meningitis syndrome

Aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) has been reported to occur infrequently in association with IGIV treatment. Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae. The syndrome usually begins within several hours to two days following IGIV treatment and rapid infusion. It is characterized by symptoms and signs including severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, nausea and vomiting. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cu mm, predominantly from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dl. Patients exhibiting such symptoms and signs should receive a thorough neurological examination, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis. It appears that patients with a history of migraine may be more susceptible. [7] (See Patient Counselling Information [17]).

Hemolysis

IGIV products can contain blood group antibodies which may act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and, rarely, hemolysis [8]. Hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration [See ADVERSE REACTIONS] [9]. IGIV recipients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis. If signs and/or symptoms of hemolysis are present after IGIV infusion, appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing should be done (See Patient Counseling Information [17]).

Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)

There have been reports of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema [Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)] in patients administered IGIV [10]. TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever and typically occurs within 1–6 hours after transfusion. Patients with TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support.

IGIV recipients should be monitored for pulmonary adverse reactions (See Patient Counseling Information [17]). If TRALI is suspected, appropriate tests should be performed for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient serum.

### Efficacy and safety of a new 20% immunoglobulin preparation for subcutaneous administration, igPro20, in patients with primary immunodeficiency [^e3374abc]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The safety profile of IgPro20 is indistinguishable from that of other immunoglobulin products, with nature, frequency, and relatedness of AEs typical of disease and treatment. Overall, the rate of infusion-related AEs other than local reactions was only 0.043 per infusion. No hemolysis was observed after IgPro20 administration. The frequency of typical, temporally associated AEs such as headache, fatigue, and nausea (Table 6) was less common with IgPro20 than with some recently tested IVIG preparations. Headache, fatigue, and nausea were reported by 36.1%, 16.4%, and 9.8% of patients treated with Gammagard Liquid and by 43.8%, 16.3%, and 12.5% of patients treated with Privigen. The remaining AEs observed with IgPro20 did not differ from AEs known to be typical for this therapy, and no new AE syndromes were observed. Immunologists treating adult patients with IVIG are often concerned over the potential risk of cardiac or thromboembolic AEs during the extreme IgG peak after infusion. SCIG may provide additional safety in this respect.

### Update on intravenous immunoglobulin in neurology: modulating neuro-autoimmunity, evolving factors on efficacy and dosing and challenges on stopping chronic IVIg therapy [^32635d26]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Maintenance Therapy: is IVIg a Forever Therapy?

CIDP, being the most common chronic neurological disease for which IVIg has been approved, has generated major challenges on how long to treat and at what doses. Although maintenance dose was tested only up to 48 weeks in both, the ICE trial with 1 gm/kg IVIg every 3 weeks and the PATH study with weekly subcutaneous IgG, the optimal chronic maintenance regimen beyond that time-frame remains empirical, ranging among practitioners from 0.4 to 2 g/kg every 2–6 weeks for IVIg and 0.2–0.4 g/kg per week for subcutaneous IgG. The means of monitoring long-term efficacy or determining its necessity have also become quite variable, many times driven not by objective measures of dependency but by the patients' assessment on how they subjectively perceive disease stability, weakness, pains, and fatigue. Evidence-based data and experience suggest that after the first 6–12 months of treatment, the need for continuing therapy should be based on dependency test utilizing the same objective measures used to determine initial efficacy, taking into account that patients' anxiety in stopping IVIg may be a confounding factor. Apart from patients with continuing active disease who clearly improve after each infusion and worsen before the next, in our experience — shared also by others — many patients after 3–5 years have reached a long-term stability status of non-worsening (not necessarily remission) and may not need IVIg anymore; several patients have become convinced however that monthly IVIg is needed in ensuring stability and would have been worse without it. In a small placebo-controlled crossover trial in IVIg-dependent patients, more frequent lower dosing was not superior to low frequent high dosage in both efficacy and tolerance while serum IgG levels were irrelevant in determining the need for maintenance therapy. Most enlightening about the necessity of IVIg in such patients is the data from 3 blinded controlled trials, where 40% of CIDP patients, being stable on monthly IVIg, did not relapse for 48 weeks when switched to placebo. The major challenges of stopping therapy in chronic IVIg recipients, not only with CIDP but also with other diseases, are elaborated later.

### Vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (human) (Cnj-016) [^8ce3d848]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Discuss the risks and benefits of VIGIV with the patient before prescribing or administration.

Inform patients of the potential for hypersensitivity reactions, especially in individuals with previous reactions to human immune globulin and in individuals deficient in IgA [see 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS and 5.1 Hypersensitivity]. Advise patients to be aware of the following symptoms associated with allergic reactions: hives, rash, chest tightness, wheezing, shortness of breath, or feeling light headed or dizzy when they stand. Caution patients to seek medical attention immediately should they experience any one or more of the above mentioned symptoms, as well as other side effects including injection site pain, chills, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and joint pain.
Advise patients that the maltose contained in VIGIV can interfere with some types of blood glucose monitoring systems. Patients must use testing systems that are glucose-specific for monitoring blood glucose levels as the interference of maltose could result in falsely elevated glucose readings, which could lead to untreated hypoglycemia or to inappropriate insulin administration, resulting in life-threatening hypoglycemia [see 5.3 Blood Glucose Monitoring].
Advise patients that VIGIV may impair the effectiveness of certain live virus vaccines such as measles, rubella (i.e. German measles), mumps, and varicella (i.e. chickenpox). Patients recently vaccinated must notify their treating physician [see 7.1 Live, Attenuated Vaccines].
Inform patients that VIGIV is prepared from human plasma. Products made from human plasma may contain infectious agents such as viruses that can cause disease. The risk that such products will transmit an infectious agent has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing for the presence of certain current virus infections, and by inactivating and/or removing certain viruses during manufacturing. Despite these measures, such products can still potentially transmit disease. There is also the possibility that unknown infectious agents may be present in such products [see 5.8 Transmissible Infectious Agents].

### Updated recommendations for use of variZIG – United States, 2013 [^0d0b5018]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Medium credibility.

VariZIG administration and monitoring specify that VariZIG is supplied in 125-IU vials and should be administered intramuscularly as directed by the manufacturer, with a recommended dose of 125 IU/10 kg of body weight up to a maximum of 625 IU (five vials). The minimum dose is 62.5 IU (0.5 vial) for patients weighing ≤ 2.0 kg and 125 IU (one vial) for patients weighing 2.1–10.0 kg. For patients who become eligible for vaccination, varicella vaccine should be administered ≥ 5 months after VariZIG administration. Because varicella zoster immune globulin might prolong the incubation period by ≥ 1 week, any patient who receives VariZIG should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of varicella for 28 days after exposure, and antiviral therapy should be instituted immediately if signs or symptoms occur. Reported adverse reactions were pain at injection site (2%) and headache (2%), and contraindications include a history of anaphylactic or severe systemic reactions to human immune globulins and IgA‑deficient patients with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity.

### Clinical performance measures for neurocritical care: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^519ce632]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Immunomodulatory treatment for Guillain-Barré syndrome — performance measure specifies the percentage of nonambulatory patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome who receive immunosuppressive therapy with plasma exchange (PE) or intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and are not prescribed corticosteroids; the numerator is nonambulatory patients who receive plasma exchange or intravenous immune globulin and are not prescribed corticosteroids, and the denominator includes all nonambulatory patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Denominator exclusions include < 18 years of age and length of stay > 120 days; contraindications to both PE and IVIG include for plasma exchange being septic or hemodynamically unstable, allergy to fresh frozen plasma, albumin, or heparin, greater than 4 weeks from symptom onset, and for intravenous immune globulin a history of anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to human immune globulin, IgA-deficient patients with antibodies to IgA and a history of hypersensitivity, greater than 2 weeks from symptom onset; additional exclusions include documentation of a condition for which corticosteroids may be indicated, enrollment in a clinical trial in which corticosteroids are part of the investigational regimen, and patient refusal. The period of assessment is from Emergency Department arrival until acute care hospital discharge. The rationale notes an estimated incidence of 1–2 cases per 100,000 people per year, that plasma exchange has been shown to improve outcomes compared to supportive care, that intravenous immune globulin has been shown to be as effective as plasma exchange, and that corticosteroids are not recommended for the treatment of patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome due to a lack of supportive data.

### Insights into patient experiences with facilitated subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy in primary immune deficiency: a prospective observational cohort [^b34afb73]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Safety

We conducted a comprehensive survey to assess the occurrence of adverse events following fSCIG treatment, specifically focusing on hypotension, fever, urticaria, and anaphylaxis. Notably, none of these adverse events were observed (refer to Table 2 for details). However, local adverse reactions were documented, revealing the following distribution: swelling was observed in 79% (n = 23) of the applications, erythema in 59% (n = 85), pain during application in 42% (n = 60), itching in 24% (n = 34), and ecchymosis in 8% (n = 12). Local adverse reactions, with all instances, resolved spontaneously within 48–72 h. The mild systemic adverse reactions encompassed headache (25%), fatigue (15%), myalgia (8%), and nausea or vomiting (6%). Interestingly, in patients experiencing both local and systemic effects, there was a mild but not discernible tendency for a decrease in adverse reactions as the number of applications increased during the observation period (Fig. 1). Statistical analysis involved the use of the Friedman test, followed by post-hoc analyses using the Durbin-Conover method and significant differences were not detected in subsequent dosing cycles among local and systemic adverse reactions related to fSCIG. When evaluating local and systemic effects by age groups, no significant difference was found in the adverse reactions exhibited by the different age groups (0–6, > 6 and ≤ 12, > 12 and < 18 years, and adults).

Among the patients, four had a history of headaches following IVIG administration. Upon transitioning to fSCIG, two individuals persisted in experiencing headaches, managed effectively with acetaminophen premedication before infusion. In contrast, the remaining two subjects no longer reported headaches with fSCIG. Furthermore, one patient previously described vomiting and fever following IVIG infusion. Upon switching to fSCIG, these complaints subside, eliminating the necessity for premedication.

### Efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of a new 10% liquid intravenous immunoglobulin containing high titer neutralizing antibody to RSV and other respiratory viruses in subjects with primary immunodeficiency disease [^e300f113]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

The efficacy of RI-002 is likely the result of the maintenance of stable IgG trough levels as well as specific antibody levels throughout the study conferring the expected protective effects of IG therapy. The pharmacokinetic properties of RI-002 were comparable to previous reports of IVIG preparations. All subjects maintained average trough levels of serum Ig of approximately 1000 mg/kg. There were significant post-infusion increases in all of the specific antibody titers measured with a greater than 6-fold increase seen in the concentration of RSV-neutralizing antibody immediately post-infusion in patients receiving greater than 500 mg/kg of IG.

There were no acute serious bacterial infections reported. The single infection that required hospitalization was believed to be secondary to a cat scratch that infected a recovering, post-operative, shoulder joint repair wound. That subject was non-compliant and missed his regularly scheduled dose of RI-002.

RI-002 was safe and well tolerated. The rates of temporally associated and treatment associated adverse events were well within the FDA guidance and comparable to the rates of adverse events that have occurred in studies of other IVIG products. Infusions were completed without interruption, discontinuation or rate reduction in 790 of 793 (99.6%) infusions.

Two subjects each reported one SAE (post-operative wound infection and migraine) during this study, and neither was associated with study drug. The subject with the post-operative wound infection SAE discontinued from the study whereas the subject with SAE of migraine completed the study. One subject had an adverse drug reaction and discontinued from the study. Three other discontinuations were due to other causes (one subject became pregnant, one subject was relocated, and 1 was discontinued due to sponsor because of subject non-compliance).

### Efficacy and safety of human intravenous immunoglobulin 10% (panzyga ®) in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases: a two-stage, multicenter, prospective, open-label study [^eb135f08]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

In the present study, the proportion of patients who experienced infections other than SBIs was greater and the rate of URTIs was higher in the 3-weekly group than in the 4-weekly group. This could have been a chance occurrence that may have taken place in any random grouping of patients, as the patients continued with their treatment schedule and dose that they had received before enrolment into this study. Alternatively, it is possible that patients who were placed on a 3-weekly schedule for IVIG treatment were likely to have a more compromised immune system and, therefore, be at greater risk of developing such infections.

The majority of AEs were assessed as mild; none led to study withdrawal or death. None of the patients in the study exhibited signs of hemolysis. As expected, the most frequent related AE observed was headache. The tolerability and safety profile was excellent at high infusion rates. Indeed, panzyga® could be safely administered at infusion speeds that were equal or considerably higher than used in most clinical trials treating antibody-deficient patients with IVIG, exceeding the maximum approved rates for most IVIG preparations. Most patients (> 90%) in the extension study tolerated the highest infusion speed of 0.14 mL/kg/min (840 mg/kg/h), without any associated increase in rates of AEs. In fact, there was a decrease in the related AE rate from 31.4% in the main study to 19.0% in the extension study.

The strengths of the study include its multicenter, international design, and the wide age range of the patients, which makes the results applicable to an extended population. The high proportion of patients (96%) completing the study without any major protocol violation is an additional strength. Limitations of the study include the lack of a comparator group and a lack of blinding, although it should be noted that this study was designed in accordance with the study design recommendations of the FDA and the EMA for studies of IVIG in the treatment of PID.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^146dc3cc]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Immune Modulation

Some evidence (level 2) suggests that very early initiation (after trauma) of steroid treatment (approximately 30 mg/day for 2–12 weeks, followed by a taper) may be effective. A systematic review evaluated one of these trials and found it to be low quality. Given the data, a short course of steroids may be indicated in early CRPS with prominent inflammation, but longer courses are unproven and there are numerous, serious contraindications to chronic steroid use In persistent CRPS, intermediate-dose steroids (1 g orally in total, taken over 2 weeks) are rarely effective and this treatment often causes side effects. High-dose pulsed treatment (3x1g iv) as used in autoimmune conditions has not been evaluated. A single intrathecal steroid injection was shown ineffective.

A randomized controlled trial (level 2) of low-dose (0.5 g/kg) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment for persistent CRPS indicated efficacy. However, a subsequent larger trial was negative Although there is some anecdotal evidence for the efficacy of high-dose IVIG this has not been formally tested. The TNF-alpha blocker, infliximab, was ineffective in a preliminary RCT (level 3) which was stopped early. Treatment with lenalidomide which has strong anti-TNF activity was also not effective, having been assessed in one of the largest RCTs (level 2) in persistent CRPS conducted to date. A small, open-label randomized trial (level 3) of mycophenolate (1.5 g BID) suggested efficacy but a larger trial would be needed to confirm these findings. Plasma exchange has been reported effective (level 4) in several case series and consequently CRPS has been added to the list of possible indications by the international plasma exchange society (ASFA). In our clinical experience (level 4), plasma exchange treatment, although providing pain improvement in some cases, requires use of long repeat-exchange cycles (e.g. eight exchange treatments over 4 weeks) and is unfortunately complicated regularly by pain increase at the venous access site. A trial of low-dose naltrexone, an opioid-antagonist drug that has potential immune modulatory properties is currently recruiting (clinicaltrials.gov). Finally, in a small, preliminary trial (level 3), 4/7 included patients with CRPS appeared to have pain reduction after treatment with the epidermal growth factor inhibitor Cetuximab (2/7 had pain relief after placebo).

### Comparison of intravenous immune globulin and high dose anti-D immune globulin as initial therapy for childhood immune thrombocytopenic purpura [^5c05c077]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

This report documents our experience with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) (1 g/kg, iv) and high-dose, anti-D immune globulin (anti-D) (75 microg/kg) as initial treatment for childhood immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The medical records of children diagnosed with ITP at a single institution between January 2003 and May 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Participants received either IVIG or high-dose anti-D immune globulin as their initial treatment for ITP. For the 53 patients included for analysis, there was no statistical difference in efficacy between each group; however, patients who received anti-D experienced a higher rate of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), particularly chills and rigours, and 2 of 24 patients in the anti-D group developed severe anaemia requiring medical intervention. Patients who presented with mucosal bleeding had higher rates of treatment failure (32%) compared to those who presented with dry purpura (6%), regardless of treatment. Both IVIG and high-dose anti-D are effective first-line therapies for childhood ITP. However, we observed increased ADRs in the high-dose anti-D group in contrast to previously published reports. Further studies are needed to evaluate safety and premedications for high-dose anti-D and to determine the utility of using the presence of mucosal bleeding to predict treatment failure.

### Updated recommendations for use of variZIG – United States, 2013 [^85d8a7d2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

VariZIG Administration

VariZIG is supplied in 125-IU vials and should be administered intramuscularly as directed by the manufacturer. The recommended dose is 125 IU/10 kg of body weight, up to a maximum of 625 IU (five vials). The minimum dose is 62.5 IU (0.5 vial) for patients weighing ≤ 2.0 kg and 125 IU (one vial) for patients weighing 2.1–10.0 kg.

Unchanged from previous recommendations, for patients who become eligible for vaccination, varicella vaccine should be administered ≥ 5 months after VariZIG administration. Because varicella zoster immune globulin might prolong the incubation period by ≥ 1 week, any patient who receives VariZIG should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of varicella for 28 days after exposure. Antiviral therapy should be instituted immediately if signs or symptoms of varicella occur. Most common adverse reactions following VariZIG administration were pain at injection site (2%) and headache (2%). Contraindications for VariZIG administration include a history of anaphylactic or severe systemic reactions to human immune globulins and IgA-deficient patients with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity.

### Human immune globulin 10% with recombinant human hyaluronidase in multifocal motor neuropathy [^a176ecb4]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is an immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathy characterized by asymmetric muscle weakness, predominantly of the upper limbs. Men are more commonly affected as woman with a ratio of 2.6:1. In most patients, the first symptoms occur between age 20 and 50 years. Various trials have shown a beneficial effect of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) on muscle strength in MMN and a comparable effect of subcutaneous immunoglobulins (SCIg).

Although a large number of studies have demonstrated that IVIg treatment is well tolerated, various systemic adverse events have been reported: the majority, such as headache, malaise and chills, are transient and relatively mild, but some rare adverse events, such as anaphylactic and skin reactions, are serious. Moreover, repeated venous access and administration in hospital or at home, in the presence of a nurse, is a burden for the patient. SCIg treatment is considered a good alternative as it can be administered by the patient or informal caregiver and produces fewer systemic adverse reactions. However, limitations of subcutaneous infusion volumes and reduced bioavailability require more frequent infusion and an increase in dose in approximately 50% of the patients.

A relatively new treatment that overcomes the disadvantages of the conventional SCIg is human immune globulin 10% with recombinant human hyaluronidase (fSCIg). Subcutaneous administration of hyaluronidase increases SCIg dispersion and absorption and, therefore, provides higher doses of SCIg with less frequent infusion and with the benefit of a higher bio-availability. Treatment with fSCIg has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for primary immunodeficiency (PID), but not for inflammatory neuropathies including MMN. This study explores the safety and treatment satisfaction of fSCIg compared to IVIg in patients with MMN.

### Thromboembolic risk with IVIg: incidence and risk factors in patients with inflammatory neuropathy [^d4af377f]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune-mediated neuropathies are commonly managed with long-term IV immunoglobulin (IVIg). Adverse events associated with IVIg are usually mild and transient and include changes in blood pressure, tachycardia, mild flu-like symptoms, and headache. More serious adverse events are rare and include acute renal failure, aseptic meningitis, acute anaphylactic reactions, and hemolytic anaemia. An association between IVIg and either arterial or venous thromboembolic events (TEE) was suggested as long ago as 1986. Since then, studies looking at the incidence of IVIg-associated TEE have provided a wide range of rates from 3% to 11.2%.

There are a number of pathogenic changes that occur following IVIg administration that could theoretically predispose to an increased TEE risk including an increase in serum viscosity, vasospasm, the release of vasoactive cytokines and clotting factors, sudden intravascular compartment expansion, and changes in venous compliance resulting in reduced capillary blood flow. However, the underlying characteristics of the individual and the disease being treated are likely to contribute and might explain some of the variation in observed rates.

A study looking specifically at inflammatory neuropathy patients receiving IVIg found that 11.3% of patients had a thromboembolic event over a 2-year period. Those who had an event were more likely to have a history of coronary artery disease, poor mobility, and cardiovascular risk factors than those who had no events. A dose of greater than 35 g/d was also associated with an increased risk of an event, although the total dose of IVIg per course was not. Clinically based studies tend to suggest an increased TEE risk but are limited by small numbers. The larger, prescription database studies are potentially biased by underreporting and are difficult to validate. Analysis of such data from the US health insurance records suggests a lower rate of thromboembolic events in otherwise high vascular risk individuals receiving IVIg and that IVIg may be protective due to its anti-inflammatory effects.

Given this discrepancy, the risk of TEE events in patients on long-term IVIg remains uncertain and there are no guidelines about how the risk can be mitigated. In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning for thrombosis related to human immunoglobulin products. They also suggest care should be taken in patients deemed to be at high risk of TEE to ensure adequate hydration and suggest monitoring baseline viscosity in patients at risk of hyperviscosity. There are inadequate epidemiologic and scientific data to support this advice.

### Acute aseptic meningitis temporally associated with intravenous polyclonal immunoglobulin therapy: a systematic review [^e8454f71]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis can be summarized as follows: (1) acute aseptic meningitis temporally associated with high-dose intravenous polyclonal immunoglobulin therapy mostly occurs in individuals, who are affected by an autoimmune disease. The estimated incidence is approximately one case per 200 treatments; (2) nausea, vomiting, headache, neck stiffness, and fever develop within 3 days after receiving a total immunoglobulin dose of 4 g or less. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals an otherwise unexplained white cell pleocytosis, which, in most cases, is predominantly neutrophilic. An eosinophilic pleocytosis is occasionally observed; (3) all cases remit without sequelae within 7 days after discontinuing the polyclonal immunoglobulin, with children experiencing a shorter recovery period compared to adults; and (4) there is no clear relationship with a specific polyclonal immunoglobulin product.

### Insights into patient experiences with facilitated subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy in primary immune deficiency: a prospective observational cohort [^220b24a7]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients had serum IgG levels above the targeted IgG levels both before and during fSCIG, and no severe infections were observed. While there was no significant change in the frequency of major infections before and after fSCIG treatment in our cohort, in line with other studies. We observed a reduction in the frequency of upper respiratory tract infections following the initiation of fSCIG which may be due to reduction in fluctuations leading the control of minor infections. In accordance, the decrease in the number of minor infections was also reported to be in relation with maintaining a more stable Ig level which may contribute to controlling minor infections. Additionally, to our experience, there was a significant reduction in school/workdays missed among patients receiving fSCIG treatment which was related to ability for patients to receive treatment at home facilitated treatment planning.

Patients received the treatment safely, and no severe systemic adverse reactions were observed during the applications. The most common local adverse reaction in patients was swelling, with no decrease observed in repeated applications. Despite prevalent local reactions, none of the patients preferred treatment modification due to local adverse reactions. In terms of systemic adverse reactions, the most common were headache and one patient opted for a treatment modification due to headache and nausea, one patient due to fatigue. The absence of severe systemic reactions and the most common systemic adverse reaction of headache are consistent with the literature in which the frequency of local reactions has been reported to decrease with repeated administrations.

Safety

Frequencies of adverse events, adverse events per year and adverse events per patient are shown for IVIg and fSCIg in Table 2. The frequency of systemic adverse events was lower in fSCIg (n = 87 on IVIg vs. n = 35 on fSCIg, p = 0.04); headache and general malaise occurred less often in fSCIg (p < 0.01; p < 0.01), while cramps and local reactions at the injection site occurred more often (p = 0.03; p < 0.01). Neither of the patients developed hemolytic anemia, nor did any develop rHuPH20-binding antibodies after initiation of fSCIg treatment.

Table 2
Safety profile of IVIg and fSCIg

Frequency, absolute frequency of adverse events, in brackets are the unique patients; rate, number of adverse events/per person-year; P value, comparison of absolute frequency of adverse events with IVIg and fSCIg; fSCIg, human immune globulin 10% with recombinant human hyaluronidase; IVIg, intravenous immunoglobulins

During the study, three serious adverse events (coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke and diabetes mellitus) occurred in two patients (Table 2). Thrombosis is a rare adverse event of immunoglobulin treatment. However, all serious adverse events were considered unrelated to fSCIg treatment. The first patient reported angina pectoris at visit 4, during fSCIg treatment, but, in retrospect, this complaint had already been present 3 months before the start of the study (during treatment with IVIg), and had not been reported at visits 1–3. After cardiological evaluation, coronary artery disease was diagnosed. The cardiovascular risk profile of this patient consisted of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) treated with carotid endarterectomy and smoking. Between visits 6 and 7 (during IVIg treatment), the same patient had been admitted to hospital because of new-onset diabetes mellitus. The second patient reported headache and visual complaints, i.e. spots in the left visual field, after only one low dose of fSCIg (10 g) combined with a regular high dose of IVIg (40 g). MRI cerebrum showed a small occipital lobe infarction. After extensive workup performed by a neurovascular specialist, a combination of cardiovascular risk factors (hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and smoking) was deemed to be the most likely cause. During follow-up, this patient made a full recovery. Recovery of the visual field was confirmed by a normal perimetry examination performed by an ophthalmologist.

For jaundiced neonates with antibody‐mediated HDN and severe hyperbilirubinaemia who do not respond to intensive PT, IVIG is sometimes administered with the goal of avoiding ET and decreasing neonatal morbidity. Studies with moderate certainty of evidence of effects suggest that early administration of IVIG (within a few hours of birth) as a preventative measure is not effective in reducing the need for ET, RBC transfusions or hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates with Rh isoimmunization. In these studies, intensive PT may have treated the bilirubin rise early, and the use of IVIG may not have led to additional benefits. Currently, no studies with high certainty of evidence of effects have assessed the value of IVIG to avoid ET for ABO‐mediated HDN; fortunately, ABO HDN rarely leads to severe HDN or the need for an ET, RBC transfusions or severe jaundice. Studies assessing treatment strategies for antibody‐mediated HDN when hyperbilirubinaemia is severe and ET requirement is emergent were not available for recommendation development. If the diagnosis of severe jaundice is delayed or HDN occurs in remote hospitals or low‐resource countries where intensive PT is not immediately available, IVIG may be considered, if ET is not readily available.

The benefit of using IVIG needs to balance risks. IVIG is a fractionated blood product manufactured from multiple donors. Previous literature has reported immediate (10%) and delayed (41%) adverse events following IVIG infusion in children, including headaches, haemolysisand aseptic meningitis. For neonates, published reports of adverse events are limited and include apnoea, haemolysisand a higher incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis. In addition, although fractionation leads to a virally inactivated product, the risk of viral transmission is not completely negligible.

### Systematic review of immune and symptomatic treatments for stiff-person syndrome [^62b274e5]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diazepam demonstrated various efficacies across studies, with mRS score improvements from 3.7 to 1.3 in all three evaluated patients of a cohort, whereas a case series of four patients treated with Diazepam reported symptom improvement only in one patient (25%).

3.9 Quality of Life

Five studies reported significant improvement in quality of life scores, assessed via a survey questionnaire, following treatment with IVIg, Rituximab and HSCT. Interestingly, a placebo‐controlled randomised trial of rituximab showed that the quality of life scores improved significantly (p < 0.01) at 3 months in both groups, but not at 6 months, denoting a strong early placebo effect.

No data on quality study is available for symptomatic therapies.

3.10 Concomitant Treatments

Marked reduction in the required dosage of concomitant therapies, including corticosteroids, diazepam and baclofen, was reported through several studies following regimes of IVIg, HSCT and BTA.

3.11 Anti‐Antibody Levels

Anti‐GAD65 antibody titre reduction has been observed in patients treated with IVIg, TPE, Rituximab, HSCT, Efgartigimod and Tacrolimus. RCT showed that the decline in anti‐GAD antibody levels was statistically significant following IVIg therapy (p = 0.05), but not after placebo administration, nor after treatment with Rituximab. There was no correlation between anti‐GAD65 antibody titre changes and clinical improvement.

3.12 Adverse Events Related to Treatment

Overall, 22 (61%) studies reported information on adverse events potentially related to treatment. Immunomodulatory treatments such as IVIg, SCIg and Rituximab frequently led to infusion site reactions, headaches and nausea. More severe reactions, including fever, blistering rashes, and infections, were also reported. TPE was associated with hypotension, catheter‐related infections, and mild citrate toxicity but was otherwise well tolerated. HSCT was associated with the highest burden of adverse events, including metabolic disturbances, infections, and hematologic complications.

Efgartigimod, Eculizumab, Milacemide and BTA had relatively mild side effect profiles, such as flu‐like symptoms, headaches or sedation. Baclofen therapy was associated with the risk of adverse effects due to the procedure of intrathecal infusion.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin as adjunct therapy for refractory pyoderma gangrenosum: systematic review of cases and case series [^cfbc90d8]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis. Treatment regimens for refractory cases are nonstandardized. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is an emerging treatment with reported success, but the efficacy of IVIG for PG is unknown. In this systematic review of cases and case series, we assessed the efficacy of IVIG for the treatment of PG, as observed at our institution and reported in the literature. A retrospective chart review at two tertiary care hospitals between 2000 and 2015, and literature searches in PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science from all years were conducted. In total, there were 49 patients, including 43 patients from 26 articles and six institutional cases. There was complete or partial response in 43 (88%) patients and complete response in 26 (53%) patients. The mean time to initial response to treatment and treatment length were 3·5 (SD 3·3) weeks and 5·9 (SD 7·8) months, respectively. On average, 2·6 treatments had been trialled before IVIG initiation. IVIG was administered with systemic steroids in 43 (88%) cases. Mild adverse events, especially nausea and headache, were reported in 12 (24·5%) patients. Our systematic review suggests a potential role for IVIG as adjuvant therapy for refractory PG. Prospective clinical trials testing the efficacy of IVIG for refractory PG are needed to validate these findings.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in patients with painful idiopathic small fiber neuropathy [^fb685170]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first randomized placebo-controlled study that investigated the efficacy of IVIG in patients with painful I-SFN. The results of this study showed no significant effect of IVIG compared to placebo in patients with painful I-SFN. No significant differences were found in 1-point and 2-point responders on pain, PGIC, overall disability, autonomic symptoms, and pain relief. Statistically significant differences were found in maximum night pain, daily sleep interference, intense and hot pain, and some domains of the quality of life; however they were not in a consistent pattern and were not considered to be of meaningful clinical relevance in the treatment goal of this highly expensive drug. Six SAEs occurred, 5 of them in the IVIG group, and all patients in the IVIG group experienced at least 1 adverse event, of which headache, nausea, vomiting, and rash occurred significantly more frequently compared to the placebo group. All of these are adverse events of IVIG that are known to occur at rates > 10%. It can therefore be concluded that IVIG has no place in the standard treatment of painful I-SFN.

### Recalcitrant, delayed pressure urticaria treated with long-term intravenous immunoglobulin [^439d485b]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 42-year old white woman presented with a 22-year history of DPU, which was treated with IVIG for 12 years. Her symptoms were generalized and, prior to IVIG therapy, included erythematous, edematous plaques, consistent with DPU, and dermatographism on the face, lips, abdomen, hands, and feet. Furthermore, she often experienced postprandial gastrointestinal upset and feelings of malaise during episodes of DPU. When uncontrolled, symptoms of her condition have made it difficult to complete daily activities such as standing for extended periods or cooking meals. She reported remission of urticarial symptoms with pregnancy and breastfeeding. Pathology found a mild degree of perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate throughout the dermis, an unremarkable epidermis, and many eosinophils. This finding was consistent with urticaria. Complete blood counts with differential, antinuclear antibody, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroid antibodies, cryoglobulins, complement levels, and serum tryptase results were within normal limits.

Currently, at 12-week intervals, the patient receives 1 g/kg actual body weight IVIG every day for 3 consecutive days through an Infusaport (C.R. Bard, Cranston, RI) because of difficult vascular access. The patient receives a 3-day course of oral prednisone before receiving IVIG and is premedicated with meperidine, promethazine, and hydrocodone-paracetamol as needed for infusion headaches. The patient's adverse events have been limited to intermittent, mild headaches surrounding IVIG infusions.

During the patient's 3 pregnancies, she was treated with IVIG. During the initial pregnancy, she received 2 courses of IVIG at 18 weeks and 37 weeks, and she delivered via normal vaginal delivery without complications. Each course was a cumulative dose of 2 g/kg IVIG over 5 days. During her later pregnancies, she delivered via cesarean section because of failure to progress. All newborns were healthy at birth. It is important to note that a multidisciplinary team, including dermatology and maternal fetal medicine, followed the patient very closely during each pregnancy.

Prior treatments include topical corticosteroids for symptomatic relief, high-dose antihistamines, ketotifen, montelukast sodium, cromolyn, sodium, psoralen and ultraviolet-A, methotrexate, oral prednisone, and an experimental trial of omalizumab. None were successful.

### Efficacy and safety associated with the infusion speed of intravenous immunoglobulin for the treatment of Kawasaki disease: a randomized controlled trial [^5acd4ba0]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

When a patient' s axillary temperature was greater than 37.5 °C at 48 h after the initiation of the initial IVIG treatment, they were defined as IVIG resistant and an additional dose of IVIG 2 g/kg was administered as a second-line treatment at the same infusion speed as the initial IVIG. Relapse was defined in cases of recurrent fever, despite defervescence after the initial IVIG treatment. Patients who had persistent fever after the first and second IVIG treatments received a third-line treatment according to the treatment protocol of each institution.

The risk score of IVIG non-responders was calculated using the risk scoring system by Kobayashi et al. which consists of 11 points based on five blood examinations and two patient characteristics. Laboratory testing (white blood cell count, percentage of neutrophils, platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase, sodium, C-reactive protein, and serum level of immunoglobulin G (IgG)) was performed at the time of enrollment (study day 0), 48 h after initial IVIG (day 2), and 7 days after initial IVIG (day 7). Echocardiograms were obtained at each institution on day 0 (before the initial treatment) and on days 2, 7, and 30 after the initial IVIG administration. The absolute diameters of the right coronary artery, left main coronary artery, left anterior descending artery, and left circumflex artery were measured. Patients were diagnosed with CAAs according to the Japanese Ministry of Health criteria, which is based on absolute values (> 3 mm in children < 5 years old and > 4 mm in children ≥ 5 years old) or relative increase (≥ 1.5 times greater than adjacent segments) of the internal diameter of the coronary arteries. Echocardiography was performed by pediatricians at each facility. Patients, treatment physicians, and echocardiography assessments were not blinded to the assignment. An adverse event was defined as any unintended clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory values observed after initial IVIG administration: fever, headache, skin rash, nausea, vomiting, neutropenia, liver dysfunction, renal dysfunction, lung edema, heart failure, shock, meningitis, and thrombosis. A severe adverse event was defined as any requiring additional treatment or extension of hospital stay.

Twenty-three (47%) patients in the corticosteroid group and 14 (67%) patients in the IVIg group underwent additional therapies after a median of 1.4 months (range 0.3–13) (table 2). Of the patients in the treatment groups (corticosteroids 23, IVIg 7) with long-term follow-up (≥ 24 months), there were no significant differences in any of our outcomes (table 2). Corticosteroid adverse effects (eg, insomnia, mood disturbance and weight gain) were noted in 23 patients (47%), and IVIg adverse effects (eg, headache, rash, and fatigue) were seen in 5 patients (24%) and were not statistically significantly different (p = 0.11).

### Severe statin-induced autoimmune myopathy successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin [^349757e2]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Treatment

Atorvastatin was stopped but the patient's muscle weakness deteriorated in his legs and also spread to his arms making immune-modulating treatment necessary. It is normally recommended to start the therapy with oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg body weight) and to combine it with an immunosuppressive agent-like methotrexate, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil.

However, due to potential side effects of glucocorticoids on the patient's diabetes mellitus, an alternative approach was considered in this case. Since a positive outcome with first-line therapy IVIg (gamunex 10%) treatment was already reported for three diabetic patients, we decided for monotherapy with IVIg for the patient. A total dose of 155 g IVIg, equivalent to 1.6 g/kg of body weight, was administered over 3 days. He received 55 g on the first day and 50 g on the second and third day. After the first administration, he developed a headache but he tolerated the second and third infusion and all subsequent infusions without side effects. He was 'feeling stronger' despite initial headaches and a lack of significant improvement of the CK. Nonetheless, since CK improvement was not expected before two or three treatment courses with IVIg, the treatment was continued every 6 weeks while slightly reducing the dose to 150 g because of the headache. After the third course of treatment, the CK in serum drastically fell to a mildly elevated level. Following the fourth administration, CK was stable around 500 U/L and weakness in his limbs had been greatly improved.

There were no SAEs reported during the trial attributable to the study drug. Two serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported, one instance each of post-operative wound infection and migraine. Neither SAE was associated with the study drug; each event was experienced as a single occurrence in a single subject.

There was a low incidence of adverse infusion reactions, with a total of 31 events experienced by 18 subjects (30.5%) during 29 infusions (3.7%). The most frequently reported events included headache and myalgia. A total of four infusion site reactions were reported in this study in two subjects. The infusion site reactions reported included infusion site extravasation and infusion site pain. There was no evidence of a trend towards significant changes in any of the laboratory assessments during treatment with study medication. End of study laboratory assessments were generally similar to screening assessments, with no trends noted. There was no laboratory evidence of any instances of a thrombotic event, acute renal failure, hemolysis event, viral transmission, aseptic meningitis, or transfusion-related acute lung injury.

Introduction: Intravenous Immunoglobulin(IVIg) is recommended as a treatment for refractory JDM, but side effects are common, particularly headache, which can be severe.

Objectives: We report our experience of using Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin(SCIg) as an alternative treatment for patients with JDM, particularly those who developed severe headaches associated with Intravenous Immunoglobulin(IVIg).

Methods: All patients who had received SCIG as treatment for JDM at our hospital since 2012 were identified. Clinical details were outlined by retrospective case review. Patients and their families were asked for their opinion on SCIG, including tolerability, side effects, ease of administration and overall impression.

Results: 3 patients were included. All had typical JDM rash, raised muscle enzymes and MRI findings in keeping with myositis. 2 were female. 2 patients had skin disease refractory to standard first line treatment using steroids and methotrexate with time from diagnosis to starting IVIg of 22 and 48 months respectively. A third patient started IVIg during his initial admission at diagnosis alongside steroids and Methotrexate as treatment for severe, ulcerative skin disease in the context of MDA5 positive antibody and hyperferritinaemia. All patients received IVIg 2g/kg monthly for a minimum of two months (2–12 months) prior to SCIg. All reported debilitating headaches following IVIg. Starting dose of SCIg was 0.2–0.3g/kg/wk. Families were trained to give SCIg by a nurse specialist and equipment for home administration was obtained. After switching to SCIg all patients reported improved tolerability and significant reduction or cessation of headache following treatment. No loss of efficacy was seen and all subsequently achieved clinically inactive disease. All reported improved tolerability and satisfaction with SCIg. One patient stopped SCIg on 2 separate occasions due to inactive disease state but on both occasions JDM rash subsequently flared and SCIg was restarted with positive clinical effect. The other 2 patients both achieved clinically inactive disease and have successfully stopped SCIg.

### Adverse reactions of prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin infusions in Iranian patients with primary immunodeficiency [^23dd450a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Although long-term intravenous immunoglobulin infusion is an effective treatment for children with antibody deficiencies, it can be complicated by systemic adverse reactions.

Objective

To evaluate the adverse reactions of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in patients with primary immunodeficiency.

Methods

Seventy-one immunodeficient patients receiving intravenous immunoglobulin were evaluated during a 7-year period (1995–2002) at Children's Medical Center in Tehran, Iran. Immunological diagnoses were as follows: common variable immunodeficiency (31 patients), X-linked agammaglobulinemia (25 patients), IgG subclass deficiency (5 patients), hyper-IgM syndrome (2 patients), and ataxia-telangiectasia (8 patients).

Results

One hundred fifty-two cases (12.35%) of adverse reactions occurred following 1,231 infusions in 35 patients. The most frequent immediate adverse reactions were mild reactions (131 infusions), including chills, fever, flushing, muscle pains, nausea, headache, and anxiety. Moderate reactions, such as vomiting, chest pain, and wheezing, occurred in 19 infusions. Two patients experienced severe adverse reactions. The highest proportion (23.06%) of reaction to injection was in patients with common variable immunodeficiency.

Conclusions

Intravenous immunoglobulin is a well tolerated medical agent for patients with antibody deficiency. However, to prevent occurrence of immediate adverse reactions during infusion in these patients, physicians should perform a detailed history and proper physical examination and check the titer of anti-IgA.

Adverse Reactions During Chronic Use

Rare cases of thromboembolic events such as strokes, pulmonary embolism, or myocardial infarction have occurred after IVIg treatment. One causative factor may be the increase in serum viscosity, especially in patients with risk factors, such as cryoglobulinemia, hypercholesterolemia, or hypergammaglobulinemia. Patients with recent deep vein thrombosis, or immobilized patients who may have a subclinical thrombosis, may be at higher risk. If IVIg is highly efficacious and is needed to ensure adequate physical functioning, it can be given to patients on anticoagulants, under close supervision and special adjustment of anticoagulant therapy. Acute renal tubular necrosis, mostly reversible, occurs rarely with IVIg therapy in patients who have pre-existing kidney disease and volume depletion, especially the elderly and those with diabetes or poor hydration. It is usually reversible, but very rare serious events have been noted. Serum creatinine may rise 1–10 days of the infusion but returns to baseline within 2–60 days of discontinuation. This complication has been more often associated with the high concentration of sucrose in some proprietary IVIg products. Osmotically induced tubular injury and vacuolization have been noted on renal biopsy. In patients with pre-existing kidney disease, close monitoring of creatinine and BUN is therefore essential while slowing the rate of infusion or selecting low osmolality products minimizes the risk. Among the various IVIg preparations on the market, there is no documented evidence that one is more efficacious than the other for a given disorder. Some products may however be preferable for certain high-risk patients if low osmolality, low-sodium, or low-sucrose deem essential. Overall, IVIg is considered safe for long-term administration, as used in autoimmune neuromuscular diseases, but need to be mindful for emerging comorbidities.

Laboratory Abnormalities

After IVIg therapy, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate increases sixfold due to enhanced rouleaux formation and reduced surface area caused by the infused gamma globulin. This false increase can persist for 2 to 3 weeks and should not be considered a sign of a developing autoimmune inflammatory process. Hyponatremia, as low as 130 mg/l (normal, 135–145 mg/l), after IVIg therapy can be also detected due to the assay method used to measure Na + that requires additional dilution of the sample owing to the high serum protein concentration after IVIg infusion. A mild and inconsequential leucopenia can be also observed. IVIg contains natural autoantibodies, as mentioned earlier, which can be detected up to 30 days after the infusion requiring increased awareness not to misdiagnose autoimmunity especially if the initial treatment was empirical.

Stopping Chronic IVIg Maintenance Therapy: a Challenging Issue When IVIg is Perceived as a "Forever" Treatment

In the 3 largest placebo-controlled CIDP trials, ICE, PATH, and FORCIDP, 40% of patients receiving chronic IVIg for disease stability did not relapse over a 24-week period when randomized to placebo, concluding that placebo is an important variable in patients on chronic maintenance therapy, especially older patients with residual deficit. We are observing similar responses in some SPS and MG where IVIg is extensively used "off-label" for chronic maintenance therapy. It has now become clear that in several of these patients, the chronic "stability status" expressed as "non-worsening" attributed to monthly IVIg is not IVIg-related but rather a conditioning effect, learned response and expectation, that collectively account for a placebo/nocebo phenomenon, often observed with chronic intravenous therapies. We witnessed similar effects in the placebo-controlled trial with rituximab in SPS, where quality of life assessments after 6 months were statistically significant in both, the rituximab and placebo-randomized patients, leading to a negative trial. One of the main challenges in these patients is how to interpret the IVIg-dependency test we all perform by either prolonging infusion intervals, reducing monthly dose or stopping therapy; apart from around 60% of patients who demonstrate objective signs of worsening while off IVIg, about 40% of patients remain unchanged on objective neurological assessments but express subjective symptoms of increased fatigue, pains, spasms, and various heightened bodily attentions collectively communicated as being less able to perform daily tasks due to "disease worsening". Such patients strongly wish to return to their previous schedule, becoming often upset when IVIg is altered; they are justifiably fearful however, when recall events of their original illness several years back, like GBS paralytic events, MG crises, and severe spastic events in SPS and believe that monthly IVIg protects them from such recurrences. This is not a placebo effect but a combination of conditioning, fear, effects of various psychological, environmental, emotional, or aging factors and uncertainties of present life events that collectively built the conviction that monthly IVIg ensures stability. It is like the biopsychosocial model discussed for the functional neurologic disorders. How do we approach such a conditioning/learned effect? Although there is no answer, it is prudent to advice new patients from the outset that: (a) will try IVIg for 3 months; if no meaningful or objective benefit will stop; (b) if there is benefit, we will continue at half the dose to objectively assess maintenance dose and infusion intervals; (c) IVIg is not a forever therapy and periodic dependency tests are needed to objectively document disease worsening if IVIg is reduced or stopped; d) reassure the patients that re-stabilization is always effective after resuming the previous schedule, if objective signs of worsening; and e) there is no scientific evidence justifying a forever IVIg therapy especially when emerging age-related co-morbidities raise safety concerns. A survey of 100 US community neurologists treating CIDP showed that one out of 3 do not discuss weaning off IVIg; only 39% inform their patients that will discontinue it at some point, while 1 of 10 said will give IVIg for life; they believe however that 38% of their patients can be weaned off IVIg.

### 7th international immunoglobulin conference: neurology [^737abcc2]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Data presented demonstrate the versatility of immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy for a variety of neurological disorders with different pathogenesis and presentations. In indications where the efficacy of Ig is well established, the neurology community is striving to improve the use of this valuable and limited resource by perfecting best practice guidelines, individualizing dosing schemes and investigating combination therapies to enhance treatment benefit. The data showing the efficacy of Ig therapy in conditions such as chronic pain and autoimmune encephalitis are promising. Future challenges for Ig use in neurological disorders were also outlined. Ongoing and upcoming randomized controlled trials will be pivotal to the use of Ig in the future, by identifying responder groups and elucidating the most effective administration practices. As our understanding and use of the therapy increases, it is essential that we collect data on the effects of long-term Ig treatment in neurological conditions, of which very little currently exists.

### 7th international immunoglobulin conference: neurology [^904ba4c9]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy has been used and studied as a treatment for a variety of neurological conditions for decades. In some of these disorders Ig therapy has a significant role as a first-line treatment. This session explores the use of Ig therapy in immune-mediated peripheral neuropathies and various central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Informative practice points relating to the management and treatment of these diseases are discussed. Potential future neurological indications for Ig therapy, as well as data on efficacy and possible mechanisms of action, are also presented. In peripheral immune-mediated neuropathies, data show good response rates to Ig therapy and it is often used as a first-line treatment. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) are both well tolerated, but dose and dosing frequency should be based on individual clinical responses. In Alzheimer's disease, although clinical data show no significant differences between IVIg and placebo, biomarker studies indicate that plasma-derived antibodies may be involved in clearance of amyloid aggregates from the brain. Data suggest that the use of high IVIg doses in early-stage Alzheimer's treatment may warrant further investigation. Ig therapy is considered a valuable option for autoimmune encephalitis, an antibody-mediated CNS disease. Combination treatment with IVIg and corticosteroids shows promising results and is proposed as a first-line treatment in these disorders. Until recently, very little was understood about the pathogenesis of chronic pain disorders. Data now indicate that perpetuation of the pain response may be underpinned by central immune activation. Some data suggest that Ig therapy may mitigate this effect, with good response rates in a number of studies, but these data need confirmation.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Within IVIg: Cross-Reactivities with Pre-pandemic Seasonal Coronaviruses

Some IVIg preparations from pre-pandemic healthy donors exhibit cross reactivities with SARS-CoV-2 S1 antigens, with some preparations having clinically significant antibody titers as high as those seen in COVID-19-infected patients. These observations highlight that the respective healthy IVIg donors had either natural autoantibodies or cross-reactive antibodies against antigenic protein fragments conserved among the other "common cold"–related coronaviruses, similar to the cross-reactivity observed for T-cells and B cells from COVID19-unexposed donors. Whether these antibodies have any protective or therapeutic effects in COVID-19-exposed neurological patients with autoimmune diseases, currently receiving monthly IVIg maintenance therapy, is unclear. IVIg has been however effective in COVID-19-immune inflammatory syndrome resembling Kawasaki's disease, while a randomized placebo-controlled trial has demonstrated that in severe COVID-19-infected patients, the in-hospital mortality rate was significantly lower in the IVIg-treated group compared to controls. Apart from any potential benefit that remains still unproven until ongoing randomized trials are completed, the information that IVIg preparations contain such antibodies is important when assessing SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence or vaccination-triggered antibodies to dissect whether SARS-CoV-2-antibodies detected in the sera of IVIg-treated patients are derived from IVIg or from acquired antiviral humoral immunity.

Adverse events

Four patients experienced a serious adverse event during treatment. One patient with severe cardiovascular comorbidity suffered a myocardial infarction during the second cycle of IVIg infusions (IVMP had not yet been administered during that course), after which he refused further treatment. One patient developed a diverticulitis with secondary perforation, requiring surgery. IVMP was temporarily stopped to prevent poor wound control after surgery. It was later restarted but stopped again due to nausea and headache after IVMP infusions. Another patient developed a pulmonary embolism 1 week after first treatment. One patient who improved by 18 weeks had a relapse after 2 months and was treated with IVIg and IVMP. This patient died of unknown cause 3 months after last CIDP treatment. In one patient, the last course of IVIg was not administered due to toxicodermia, which was considered a moderate adverse event (Table 3).
