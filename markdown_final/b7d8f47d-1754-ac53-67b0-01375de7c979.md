## Question

What's the best antiemetic to give an hospitalized patient to her on QT interval

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antiemetic is the best choice for a hospitalized patient with a prolonged QT interval, and how to choose and monitor it safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and baseline QT risk. Then, I should verify which antiemetic classes and specific agents carry the most and least QT liability. Next, I will weigh efficacy against cardiac safety, including drug–drug interactions. After that, I should outline a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with dosing and monitoring. Finally, I will consider special populations and summarize a bottom-line answer with caveats and documentation needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: in hospitalized patients, QT prolongation is common and multifactorial, driven by electrolyte disturbances, comorbidities, and polypharmacy, with antiemetics themselves independently associated with QT prolongation in observational geriatric cohorts, so I need to ensure any choice minimizes additive risk while preserving efficacy [^1121nhTF] [^113c3sf2].

> Next, I should review which antiemetics have the highest QT liability. Droperidol carries an FDA black box warning and is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected QT prolongation, with multiple guidelines advising avoidance or strict ECG monitoring if used at all, so I should not default to droperidol here [^114jWWoz] [^116QNgwR]. Ondansetron has a class warning for dose-dependent QT prolongation and is implicated in rare torsades cases, particularly with IV dosing and risk factors, so I need to be cautious even though many studies show modest mean QT changes [^111BFkMa] [^115Vq7s6]. Dolasetron has been withdrawn in some markets due to QT concerns, reinforcing that first-generation 5-HT3 antagonists vary in risk, and I should avoid dolasetron in this setting [^11611fYZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should identify lower-risk options. Palonosetron, a second-generation 5-HT3 antagonist, shows no clinically meaningful QT prolongation in thorough QT studies even at supratherapeutic doses, and is favored in oncology safety comparisons, which supports choosing it when QT risk is a priority [^114JfjMh] [^112U1sj1]. Amisulpride at PONV doses (5–10 mg IV) did not produce clinically significant QTc changes in healthy-volunteer studies, including when combined with ondansetron, suggesting a favorable cardiac profile at therapeutic doses, though I should confirm real-world applicability in sick inpatients [^115egx6f] [^1173KESS]. Metoclopramide has minimal QT signal at standard doses and is often reasonable when dopamine blockade is acceptable, though I must watch for extrapyramidal effects, especially in older adults.

> I need to check comparative efficacy so I don't sacrifice symptom control for safety. Granisetron and palonosetron have comparable or superior antiemetic efficacy to ondansetron in PONV and CINV settings, and palonosetron's long half-life may reduce delayed nausea, which is clinically useful in postoperative or chemotherapy contexts [^11611fYZ] [^113tpb79]. Amisulpride 10 mg IV is effective for rescue PONV and has a favorable QT profile in controlled data, supporting its role when QT risk is salient [^1173KESS].

> Let me consider drug–drug interactions and cumulative risk. Combining two QT-prolonging antiemetics, such as droperidol with ondansetron, produces additive QT effects in controlled studies, so I should avoid stacking agents in patients with prolonged QT or multiple risk factors, and I should also screen for other QT-prolonging co-medications like macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and certain antipsychotics before choosing therapy [^115gNrLG] [^116uDiUJ]. But wait, what if the patient already has electrolyte derangements or bradycardia? Those amplify torsades risk, so I should correct potassium and magnesium and reassess rhythm risk before exposing the patient to any QT-active antiemetic [^116uDiUJ].

> I should double-check monitoring guidance. Routine ECG is not universally required for single-dose ondansetron in low-risk patients, but in those with baseline QTc > 450–470 ms, electrolyte abnormalities, heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs, obtaining a baseline and post-dose ECG is prudent, and this risk-stratified approach is echoed by FDA labeling and emergency medicine guidance [^111BFkMa] [^112GSeKt]. For palonosetron, the absence of meaningful QT effect in thorough QT studies supports use without routine ECG in otherwise low-risk patients, though vigilance for interactions remains necessary [^114JfjMh].

> Now, I will translate this into a practical recommendation. For a hospitalized patient with prolonged QT, my first-line choice is palonosetron 0.075 mg IV once, given its strong efficacy and negligible QT effect in controlled studies, with no routine ECG required if baseline QTc is borderline and electrolytes are normal, though I should still avoid stacking with other QT-prolonging drugs and monitor if risk factors cluster [^114JfjMh] [^114aHGcd]. If palonosetron is unavailable or contraindicated, amisulpride 10 mg IV is a reasonable alternative with reassuring QT data at therapeutic doses, again avoiding combination with other QT-prolonging agents and ensuring electrolytes are corrected [^115egx6f] [^1173KESS]. If neither is suitable, metoclopramide 10 mg IV can be considered for prokinetic antiemesis with minimal QT signal, balancing the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms in susceptible patients.

> Wait, let me verify the role of ondansetron. I initially thought to avoid ondansetron entirely in prolonged QT, but I should correct that nuance: in patients with mild QT prolongation and no other major risk factors, a single 4 mg IV dose with electrolyte optimization and selective ECG monitoring may be acceptable, acknowledging mean QT increases around 7–20 ms and rare torsades reports in high-risk contexts; however, given safer alternatives exist, I should prefer palonosetron or amisulpride when QT risk is the dominant concern [^115PRXBM] [^115iR6QT] [^115Vq7s6]. I need to ensure I document rationale, risk counseling, and monitoring if I proceed with ondansetron in this scenario.

> I should confirm special populations. In pediatrics, oral ondansetron is commonly used for gastroenteritis with low observed QT signal in healthy children, but ICU cohorts show that electrolyte disturbances and organ dysfunction markedly increase the risk of significant QT prolongation, so I must individualize and correct modifiable risks before dosing [^115ET9kZ] [^111HHuFM]. In older adults, polypharmacy and baseline QT prolongation are common, so I should favor palonosetron or metoclopramide and avoid droperidol or combinations of QT-active agents when possible [^113c3sf2] [^114JfjMh].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. The best antiemetic for a hospitalized patient with prolonged QT is palonosetron 0.075 mg IV once, given its robust antiemetic efficacy and lack of clinically meaningful QT prolongation in thorough QT studies, with amisulpride 10 mg IV as a close alternative when palonosetron is not suitable, and metoclopramide 10 mg IV as a third-line option with minimal QT signal but watch for EPS. I should avoid droperidol and dolasetron, avoid combining QT-prolonging antiemetics, correct potassium and magnesium, and use ECG monitoring selectively based on baseline QT, comorbidities, and co-medications [^114JfjMh] [^115egx6f] [^114jWWoz] [^11611fYZ] [^116uDiUJ].

For hospitalized patients with prolonged QT, **palonosetron is the preferred antiemetic** because it does not meaningfully prolong QT at therapeutic doses [^114JfjMh] and is supported by FDA labeling and clinical data [^111DX4Sd]. If palonosetron is unavailable, **metoclopramide is a reasonable alternative** at standard doses (10 mg IV/IM/PO) given its minimal QT effect and low arrhythmia risk. Avoid **ondansetron, droperidol, and dolasetron** due to their QT-prolonging potential, especially with electrolyte abnormalities or other QT-prolonging drugs [^111BFkMa] [^114jWWoz] [^11611fYZ]. Always correct electrolytes and monitor ECG if using any QT-prolonging agent.

Comparison of two patients' groups (prolonged QT vs. normal QT intervals) concerning diagnoses and QT-prolonging medications

✱ p values were calculated using chi-square tests

Row-wise percentages were calculated

In logistic regression (Table 6), univariate analysis demonstrates a significant association of QT prolongation with various categories of potential DDIs 6–10 (OR = 2; 95% CI = 1.1–3.6; p = 0.03), 11–15 (OR = 2.9; 95% CI = 1.5–5.4; p = 0.001), > 15 (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.4–4.2; p = 0.001), ischemic heart disease (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.1–2.5; p = 0.02), myocardial infarction (OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.1–2.9; p = 0.01), antimicrobials (OR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.4–1; p = 0.04) and antiemetics (OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.1–2.6; p = 0.01). The overall fit of the logistic regression model was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, which yielded a chi-square value of 9.9 with 8 degrees of freedom (p = 0.273), indicating no significant discrepancy between observed and predicted outcomes and thus a good model fit. The − 2 Log Likelihood value for the model was 453.025, reflecting appropriate model convergence. Additionally, the model explained approximately 13–18% of the variance in QT interval prolongation, as indicated by the Cox & Snell R² (0.13) and Nagelkerke R² (0.18) values. Together, these findings suggest that the logistic regression model demonstrated an adequate fit and reasonable explanatory power in identifying predictors of QT interval prolongation in this patient population. The multivariate analysis illustrates that potential DDIs 11–15 (OR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.1–5.4; p = 0.03) and antiemetics (OR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.1–3.8; p = 0.02) were independently associated with QT prolongation at a statistically significant level.

### The QT interval prolongation potential of anticancer and supportive drugs: a comprehensive overview [^112Ny4s1]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Patients with cancer are prone to prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) due to the use of anticancer drugs with QTc-prolonging potential in combination with electrolyte imbalances caused by, for example, gastrointestinal side-effects. However, most anticancer drugs were approved with little information on their QTc-prolonging potential and the added risk of torsade de pointes. The absence of this information on the drug label poses a considerable challenge to clinicians regarding the measures that need to be taken to safely start anticancer treatment. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence for the QTc-prolonging properties of 205 anticancer drugs and 14 antiemetic drugs available from drug labels, assessment reports, and published studies. We classify the drugs as low-risk, moderate-risk, or high-risk for QTc prolongation. We also discuss the clinical relevance of these findings and include practical recommendations to guide clinicians to select the drugs with the least QTc-prolonging properties and to adequately monitor susceptible patients.

### Droperidol, QT prolongation, and sudden death: what is the evidence? [^113hz32S]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Droperidol is a butyrophenone commonly used as an antiemetic and antipsychotic in the United States since US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 1970. Its labeling has recently been revised, with a black box warning for cases of QT prolongation leading to torsades de pointes and death. A black box warning is applied when serious adverse drug reactions are uncovered for medications. We sought to examine the evidence of a causal association suggested by the black box warning to aid clinicians in their risk-benefit analyses regarding further use of droperidol.

Methods

A literature search was undertaken to determine the evidence regarding the association between droperidol and QT prolongation or torsades de pointes. The evidence was then evaluated by using evidence-based medicine principles. In addition, a review of the FDA regulatory process is presented.

Results

Three clinical studies, 1 published abstract, and 7 case reports were reviewed. Available postmarketing surveillance data (MedWatch reports) were also reviewed. Applying the criteria of evidence-based medicine and Hill's criteria, the evidence is not convincing for a causal relationship between therapeutic droperidol administration and life-threatening cardiac events.

Conclusion

The recent black box warning appears to have originated from postmarketing surveillance data rather than data reported in the peer-reviewed medical literature. Ongoing monitoring of drug safety and more definitive study appear appropriate.

Ondansetron — an antiemetic selective 5‑HT3 antagonist — has the following profile: "Mechanism not fully characterized; selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist; binds to 5-HT3 receptors both in periphery and in CNS, with primary effects in GI tract. Has no effect on dopamine receptors and therefore does not cause extrapyramidal symptoms". Indications are "For the management of nausea or vomiting". The note states "EKG monitoring is recommended in patients who have electrolyte abnormalities, CHF, or bradyarrhythmias or who are also receiving other medications that cause QT prolongation". Contraindications are "Hypersensitivity, coadministration with apomorphine; combination reported to cause profound hypotension and loss of consciousness". The warning is "May cause dose-dependent QT prolongation, avoid in patients with congenital long QT syndrome".

### Prevalence of the QT interval prolongation and its risk factors in hospitalized geriatric patients: findings of a single center cross-sectional study in Pakistan [^113cY5TV]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

There are not many studies that concentrate on figuring out how prevalent potential QT DDIs are in clinical settings. We found that 23.2% of the study population had potential QT DDIs. Among these, the most common drug interacting pair comprised of Metoclopramide - Ondansetron and Azithromycin - Metoclopramide. While research indicates that using the highest risk QTc lengthening medication concurrently with any other QTc prolonging medication must be circumvented due to the significant increase in the danger for fatal toxicities, such as the onset of TdP or other severe ventricular tachyarrhythmias of considerable severity. Apart from this, many previous studies considered only certain drug classes in their analysis, whereas, we used a broader strategy that took into account all medication classes that were prescribed to hospitalized geriatric patients. Our study found that diuretics, antimicrobials, antiemetics, proton pump inhibitors, and analgesics were the most commonly involved drug classes in QT prolongation. In our investigation, we found 228 cases of diuretics, indicating a significant prevalence. However, diuretics were commonly used by hospitalized patients, and our results align with the results of the earlier research done on older individuals. Among diuretics, furosemide was the most commonly used, constituting 20.5% of the prescriptions. The second most commonly prescribed group was antimicrobials, with 202 instances. Metoclopramide emerged as the most frequently used antiemetic, representing 13.7% of the prescriptions. Another study also reported a similar proportion where its use was documented in 11.1% of cases. The possible negative effects of QT-prolonging medications were disregarded, despite their widespread use.

### Prevalence of the QT interval prolongation and its risk factors in hospitalized geriatric patients: findings of a single center cross-sectional study in Pakistan [^112RZdUV]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In our study, potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) were found to be significantly associated with QT interval prolongation among hospitalized geriatric patients. However, due to cross-sectional design of our study, these findings represent associations observed at a single point in time and do not establish causality. Therefore, while potential DDIs appear to be an important risk factor QT prolongation, further prospective studies are needed to determine causal relationships. Similar findings were recorded in other literature as well indicating that pharmacotherapy, which includes drug-drug interactions (DDIs), was a primary cause of QT prolongation. A recent study showed that QTc prolonging is linked to increased mortality and longer hospital stays, even though Torsades de Pointes is the most hazardous and well-known adverse consequence associated with it. It is found in our study that QT prolongation has a significant connection with myocardial infarction, which is in agreement with already existing data. Our study demonstrated a significant alliance of QT prolongation with ischemic heart disease. A similar trend is seen in previous studies as well. Findings in our study suggest a statistically significant relationship between QT prolongation with triglycerides which is by the data published in previous studies. A significant acquaintance of antiemetics with QT prolongation was found in our study, which is consistent with the findings of a previous study. This study demonstrated a significant affiliation of QT prolongation with antimicrobials, a similar result was also evident from other studies. We also identified a significant association of QT prolongation with analgesics, shedding light on the possibility of QT prolongation brought on by medications often used to alleviate pain which is consistency with the findings of a previous study.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112PvgK8]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

From this study, we conclude that most 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists alone or combined with steroids decrease the occurrence of nausea and/or vomiting. Most 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists were relatively safe when compared with each other, yet none of the studies compared active treatment with placebo for harms. Dolasetron + dexamethasone may prolong the QTc compared to ondansetron + dexamethasone. Additional studies are needed to characterize the cardiac and cognitive safety of these treatments. Until then, it would be prudent for clinicians to obtain baseline electrocardiographic tracings before prescribing these common, effective antiemetics to any patients who are undergoing chemotherapy.

### Antiemetic prophylaxis with droperidol in morphine-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia: a propensity score matched cohort study [^111VyEbg]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The addition of droperidol to morphine-based IV-PCA was associated with lower rates of PONV and the need for antiemetic medications. No additional risk of unintentional sedation attributable to droperidol was found in this single-center matched cohort. The antiemetic benefit of droperidol was especially significant within 36 h after surgery and attenuated thereafter. Our results suggest that the addition of droperidol to IV-PCA is effective in the prophylaxis of PONV, and that it does not affect sedation risk, opioid requirements, or pain intensity. We suggest the following issues for future studies: the prophylactic role of droperidol against PONV in low-risk patients, the optimal concentration of droperidol in morphine-based IV-PCA in terms of antiemesis and sedation, and the efficacy and cost of combination antiemetic regimens compared to droperidol alone. Lastly, droperidol should be used cautiously in patients with preexisting QT prolongation or the concomitant use of drugs that potentially prolong the QT interval.

### Antiemetic therapy for nausea and vomiting in the emergency department [^114ccnA9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Antiemetic agents are among the most frequently prescribed medications in the emergency department (ED). Nevertheless, there are no widely accepted evidence-based guidelines to optimize the use of these medications for nausea or vomiting in this setting.

Objective

The objective of this article is to briefly review the evidence supporting the use of antiemetic agents for the treatment of nausea or vomiting for adults in the ED, and to provide recommendations to help guide therapy.

Discussion

The antiemetic agents studied include droperidol, promethazine, prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, and ondansetron. Droperidol was commonly used in the past, and is more effective than prochlorperazine or metoclopramide, but due to the US Food and Drug Administration black box warning regarding the potential for QT prolongation with this drug, its use is limited to refractory cases. Promethazine is more sedating than other comparative agents, and also has the potential for vascular damage upon intravenous administration. It may be a suitable option when sedation is desirable. Patients given prochlorperazine or metoclopramide must be monitored for akathisia that can develop at any time over 48 h post administration. Decreasing the infusion rate can reduce the incidence of this adverse effect, and the effect can be treated with intravenous diphenhydramine. Ondansetron is as effective as promethazine, and is not associated with sedation or akathisia.

Conclusion

Based on the safety and efficacy of ondansetron, it may be used as a first-line agent for relief of nausea or vomiting for most patient populations in the ED.

### Intravenous amisulpride does not meaningfully prolong the QTc interval at doses effective for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^115egx6f]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are significant issues in surgical patients, and additional treatment options are needed. Dopaminergic antiemetics have been popular for their efficacy, but their use has been limited by safety concerns, especially the potential for torsade de pointes arising from QT interval prolongation. Intravenous (IV) amisulpride, a dopamine D2 and D3 antagonist shown to be effective at preventing and treating PONV at doses of 5 and 10 mg, respectively, has a dose-dependent effect on QT but at 5 mg is not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval. This study was designed to evaluate the QT effect of a 10-mg dose of amisulpride, alone and when simultaneously coadministered with ondansetron, an antiemetic of a different class, also known to prolong the QT interval.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period, crossover study, healthy male and female volunteers 18–65 years of age received IV, in a random sequence: (1) amisulpride 10 mg given twice, 2 hours apart; (2) amisulpride 10 mg and ondansetron 4 mg, given simultaneously; and (3) placebo.

Results

Thirty subjects were enrolled, and 29 completed all 3 treatment periods. The largest mean placebo-corrected change-from-baseline QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) (ΔΔQTcF) after the first and second amisulpride dose was 5.2 milliseconds (90% confidence interval [CI] 3.53–6.96 milliseconds) and 8.0 milliseconds (90% CI, 5.49–10.58 milliseconds), respectively. After coadministration of amisulpride and ondansetron, the largest mean ΔΔQTcF was 7.3 milliseconds (90% CI, 5.48–9.16 milliseconds). The slope of the amisulpride concentration-change-from-baseline QTcF (ΔQTcF) relationship was 0.006 ms/ng/mL (90% CI, 0.0020–0.0098). No QTc outliers (absolute QTcF value > 480 milliseconds or increase from baseline > 30 milliseconds) were seen in any period.

Conclusions

A 10-mg dose of IV amisulpride, given alone or in combination with ondansetron, does not have a clinically significant effect on the QT interval.

### Emergency department approach to QTc prolongation [^112HXEEA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

QTc prolongation has been associated with increased risk of developing ventricular tachydysrhythmias, particularly Torsades de Pointes (TdP). QTc prolongation is influenced by many factors including congenital causes, heart rate, metabolic imbalances, and pharmacotherapy. Several commonly used medications in the emergency department (ED), such as antipsychotics and antiemetics, are known to prolong the QT interval. In addition, ED patients may present with conditions that may predispose them to QTc prolongation, such as drug overdose or hypokalemia, which can further complicate management. ED providers should not only be aware of which medications have these effects, but must also thoroughly investigate any pertinent patient history that may contribute to QTc prolongation. This review discusses commonly encountered medications that are associated with QTc prolongation, the mechanisms by which they prolong the QTc interval, and other factors that may influence ED medication administration and management.

### Which QT correction formulae to use for QT monitoring? [^113zR1WA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The QT interval is a measure of the duration of ventricular repolarization. It approximates the time interval between the start of depolarization and the end of repolarization of the ventricular myocardium. 1 QT prolongation is associated with a risk for cardiac arrhythmias given that it can result in early after depolarizations, provoke Torsades des Pointes, and lead to ventricular fibrillation, causing sudden cardiac death. 2 The risk assessment for QT prolongation of in‐hospital patients is based on their medication profile, demographic risk factors, electrolyte disturbances, and monitoring of the corrected QT (QTc) interval. 3, 4 Large population studies have shown a relation between QTc and all‐cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and sudden cardiac death. 5, 6, 7

For correct interpretation, the QT interval should undergo adequate rate correction (QTc) to compare measurements at different time points and at different heart rates. To perform optimal risk stratification, this rate correction has to be reliable. The current clinical standard is the most widely used Bazett formula, but with this formula, there is a known overcorrection at high heart rates and undercorrection at lower heart rates. 8

In developing an automated patient‐specific drug safety algorithm applicable in the electronic medical record, QTc together with clinical, biochemical, and pharmacological risk factors should be included. We wanted to determine which QT correction formula would be the best to use in such an automated algorithm. We first compared the heart rate correction performance of 5 commonly studied QT correction formulae. Second, we aimed to study the impact of the implementation of different QT correction formulae on risk assessment for mortality. To rule out a potential effect of the normal range or reference value for QTc in our population, we determined the reference values of the different formula in a healthy subset. We used this reference value to study the risk stratification for mortality for each QT correction formula separately. Finally, we investigated whether implementation of these different formulae would influence clinical decision making in a retrospective analysis of patients receiving haloperidol.

### Droperidol in the emergency department: is it safe? [^113iNWPp]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Droperidol is an antipsychotic and antiemetic drug that has been used extensively by emergency physicians, psychiatrists, and anesthesiologists worldwide since 1967. It also has been used effectively for other diverse conditions, such as treatment of headache and vertigo. As of January 2001, Droperidol was no longer available in Europe after its founder, Janssen-Cilag Pharmaceuticals, discontinued its distribution. In December 2001, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a black box warning on the use of Droperidol in response to an association between Droperidol and fatal cardiac dysrhythmias, such as torsade de pointes, resulting from prolongation of the QT interval. In this review we closely examine the pharmacology, indications, use, and complications associated with Droperidol, and speculate on its future use in the Emergency Department.

### Droperidol (Inapsine) [^114jWWoz]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

INAPSINE is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected QT prolongation (i.e. QTc interval greater than 440 msec for males or 450 msec for females). This would include patients with congenital long QT syndrome.

INAPSINE (droperidol) is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug.

INAPSINE is not recommended for any use other than for the treatment of perioperative nausea and vomiting in patients for whom other treatments are ineffective or inappropriate (see WARNINGS).

### The effect of antiemetics and antihistamines on the QTc interval in emergent dialysis patients with baseline QTc prolongation [^115CWAQX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Unfunded patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who do not have routinely scheduled hemodialysis often receive medications known to prolong the QTc interval for their uremic symptoms even though they may have pre-existing QTc prolongation.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of these medications on the QTc interval in these patients.

Methods

Unfunded patients with ESRD presenting to the emergency department (ED) for emergent hemodialysis (HD) with QTc prolongation on their initial electrocardiogram (ECG) were recruited. Approximately 2 hours after receiving an antihistamine or antiemetic, a second ECG was ordered and the QTc was measured. The patients were followed-up 1 week later.

Results

Twenty-nine percent (44/152) of the unfunded patients with ESRD presenting for HD at a county hospital had QT prolongation and were included with 107 total ED visits during the 4-week study period. The mean QTc was 483.7 msec on presentation to the ED, and the mean QTc measured 2 hours after receiving an antihistamine or antiemetic was 483.8 msec. None of the patients were admitted for life-threatening dysrhythmias. Thirty-six percent (16/44) of the recruited patients had QTc intervals > 500 msec with a combined total of 31 patient visits, of which only 25.8% (8/31) had an increase in the QTc interval after an antihistamine or antiemetic medication was given. None of these patients had adverse outcomes, such a dysrhythmia or death, at 1-week follow-up.

Conclusion

This study shows that medications known to cause QTc prolongation are safe to use in therapeutic doses in patients with ESRD who have pre-existing QT prolongation. Few patients in this cohort had significantly prolonged QTc intervals at baseline.

### A model for evaluating droperidol's effect on the median QTc interval [^11175YPn]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Controversy surrounds the use of the antiemetic droperidol, because of the Food and Drug Administration-imposed "black box" warning alleging that even small doses of the drug can lead to serious (even fatal) arrhythmias when it is used for antiemetic prophylaxis during the perioperative period. We used mathematical modeling of electrocardiographic QT interval data published in a peer-reviewed manuscript to evaluate the relationship between the dose of droperidol (0.1–0.25 mg/kg i.v.) and QT(c) prolongation. In comparing the calculated QT(c) values based on the logarithm model (27–63 ms), the linear model (27–67 ms) and the square-root model (36–57 ms) to the actual measured QT(c) values (37–59 ms), the square-root model provided the best simulation of the experimental findings. Other models that we evaluated included the polynomial model and various exponent models (e.g., quartic-root model, cubic-root model, square model, and cubic model). The estimated median prolongation of the median QT(c) interval produced by droperidol 0.625–1.25 mg i.v. would vary from 9 ± 3 to 18 ± 3 ms. Therefore, this regression analysis suggests that small "antiemetic" doses of droperidol (≤ 1.25 mg) would be unlikely to produce proarrhythmogenic effects in the perioperative period.

Implications

Using a square-root curve fit model to evaluate the relationship between the dose of droperidol and QT(c) prolongation, small-dose droperidol (0.625–1.25 mg i.v.) would be expected to produce < 30-ms prolongation of the QT(c) interval. Therefore, small "antiemetic" doses of droperidol would not be expected to produce proarrhythmogenic effects when used for prophylaxis in surgical patients.

The frequencies of QT-prolonging medications

A total of 970 QT-prolonging medications were identified in this study. The most commonly given category of QT lengthening medications was diuretics, accounting for 228 instances. Among diuretics, furosemide was the most commonly used, constituting 20.5% of the prescriptions. The second most commonly prescribed group was antimicrobials, with 202 instances. Within this category, metronidazole was the most frequently used (5.2%), followed by piperacillin-tazobactam (4.4%) and azithromycin (4.2%). Antiemetics were also commonly prescribed, with 178 instances noted. Metoclopramide emerged as the most frequently used antiemetic, representing 13.7% of the prescriptions. Proton pump inhibitors constituted another significant class of drugs, with 163 instances recorded. Omeprazole was the predominant drug in this category, comprising 16.5% of the prescriptions. Among analgesics, which accounted for 84 instances, tramadol was the most widely prescribed, representing 8.7% of the analgesic prescriptions, as illustrated by Table 2.

Evaluation of efficacy and safety

The primary efficacy endpoint was complete response (CR: no emesis, no rescue antiemetics) during the acute phase (0–24 h after the start of the administration of the first [most] emetogenic chemotherapeutic agent). The key secondary endpoint was CR rates during the delayed (24–120 h) phase. Additional secondary endpoints were the overall CR rates (0–120 h) after administration of chemotherapy, the proportion of patients with complete control (defined as CR and no more than mild nausea), without emetic episodes, without nausea, and without rescue medication, as well as the severity of nausea (four-point Likert scale: none, mild, moderate, severe), the time to first emetic episode, and patient global satisfaction with antiemetic therapy. These parameters were assessed and reported at various intervals during 0–120 h, as acute, delayed, and overall phases. Safety was assessed based on occurrence of adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and laboratory parameters. For all ECGs, PR, QRS, QT, QTcB, and QTcF intervals, and heart rate were analyzed.

### The effect of intravenous ondansetron on QT interval in the emergency department [^115PRXBM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ondansetron, a 5HT3 receptor antagonist, is commonly used in emergency departments to treat nausea and vomiting. In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that this medicine may cause QT prolongation, potentially leading to deadly arrhythmias. The objective of this study was to characterize the QT interval prolongation associated with ondansetron use in the Emergency Department.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational cohort study of adult patients who presented to the emergency department during a one-year period and were treated with intravenous ondansetron. We investigated the QT prolongation associated with dosages. ECGs were obtained before the medication and 5, 15, and 30 minutes after IV drug administration. Every QT measurement was recorded and compared to the zero point. The severity of drug-induced QT prolongation was determined according to the recommendations of the International Conference on Compliance (ICH). QTc prolongation was categorized as 'negligible' (< 5 ms), 'significant' (> 20 ms), 'potential concern' (> 30 ms), or 'definitely worrying' (> 60 ms).

Results

Of the 435 patients enrolled in the study, 60% (261 patients) were female and the mean age was 39 (± 18). The QT prolongation peaked at the fifth minute and remained consistent at the fifteenth and thirty-first minutes. The maximum prolongation of the mean QT duration occured at the fifth minute (7.9 ± 18.1 ms). No patient revealed any problems with cardiac conduction. The prolonged QT interval was not related to the dose of ondansetron, but QT measurements were higher in the 30th minute in patients treated with 8 mg of ondansetron. The effect of ondansetron administration on QT prolongation was found to be above the 'negligible' but below the 'significant' value, according to the ICH recommendations.

Discussion

In this study, QT prolongation due to ondansetron administration was below the 'important' value according to the recommendations of the ICH. No cases of cardiac arrhythmia were reported in any of the partients. Thus, routine ECG monitoring in patients given ondansetron due to the risk of QTc prolongation does not seem cost-effective when evaluated together with additional factors such as its negative impact on emergency patient flow, waste of personnel and time, and increase in healthcare costs. In the absence of a known risk of cardiac arrhythmia, IV administration of 4 mg and 8 mg of ondansetron doses no risk of QT prolongation in the emergency population.

### The effect of oral ondansetron on QT interval in children with acute gastroenteritis; a retrospective observational study [^1148P5X8]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is one of the most common diseases of children, with 1.3 million deaths worldwide annually and about 500,000 deaths of children under 5 years old. The World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended oral rehydration therapy (ORT) as initial treatment in mildly to moderately dehydrated children. Successful treatment with ORT reduces the need for intravenous (IV) fluid therapy and can reduce the duration of hospital stay and prevent unnecessary use of medical resources. Vomiting control is pivotal in the treatment of mildly to moderately dehydrated children with AGE. In the emergency department (ED), vomiting is a major obstacle to the use of ORT. Recent studies have recommended the use of oral ondansetron as an antiemetic.

Ondansetron is an antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 and may cause QT prolongation due to its mechanism of action. Many studies have reported that ondansetron can enable the successful use of ORT by suppressing vomiting. Ondansetron has also been safely and effectively used in patients with cancer and postoperative patients. However, the US Food and Drug Administration reported in 2011 that IV ondansetron possibly caused fatal arrhythmias in patients with prolonged QT interval. On the other hand, recent studies found that IV ondansetron did not cause QT prolongation or increase the risk of fatal arrhythmias in mildly to moderately dehydrated pediatric patients with AGE.

For convenience, oral ondansetron has been preferred to IV ondansetron to treat children with vomiting while receiving ORT. Most previous studies have focused on the safety of IV ondansetron, and there have been no studies of changes in QT interval after oral administration of ondansetron. Therefore, we conducted a study to investigate the effect of oral ondansetron on QT interval in mildly to moderately dehydrated children with AGE.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113tpb79]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

We conducted a systematic review and NMA on 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Our results suggest that all treatments are relatively safe, but we were unable to conduct an NMA on sudden cardiac death, prolonged QRS interval, or delirium because of a dearth of data. Future RCTs to examine the safety of these treatments should include these important outcomes. As well, the studies included in our NMAs of arrhythmia, QTc prolongation, and mortality did not have a placebo comparator, and we are therefore unable to comment on the safety of these treatments relative to placebo.

Overall, our results suggest that all of these treatments are effective for reducing nausea and vomiting experienced by patients undergoing chemotherapy. According to the rank-heat plot, the treatment that is most likely the safest and most effective is palonosetron + steroid. Our findings can be used by patients and their clinicians to tailor their choice of treatments. For example, if a patient is most concerned about CINV during the first 24 h after chemotherapy, then ramosetron + steroid may be the best choice. Across the effectiveness outcomes, the following treatments ranked as most superior on three effectiveness outcomes during the first 24 h after chemotherapy for adults: ondansetron + steroid, palonosetron + steroid, granisetron + steroid, and ramosetron + steroid. If a patient is most concerned about CINV occurring more than 24 h after chemotherapy, then ramosetron given on day 1 and at least one subsequent day, tropisetron + steroid given on day 1 and at least one subsequent day, or palonosetron given on day 1 + steroid given on day 1 and at least one subsequent day are potentially effective options.

### Benefit-risk assessment of off-label drug use in children: the bravo framework [^113FsTzT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

TRADE‐OFFS: BALANCING BENEFITS AND RISKS OF ONDANSETRON

The assessment has been reviewed by the multidisciplinary editorial board of the DPF consisting of pediatricians, pharmacists, and clinical pharmacologists.

Benefits clinically relevant?

Improved efficacy of oral rehydration preventing hospital admission is considered clinically relevant. Drug therapy should only be considered if the child is at high risk for dehydration and oral rehydration is not successful.

Residual risks acceptable?

The multidisciplinary board discussed if pre‐emptive ECG testing is indicated for use in gastroenteritis. Daily practice is quite pragmatic: parents are asked for their family history of cardiac events and comedications. If negative, ondansetron is prescribed without ECG. Domperidone may also induce a prolonged QT interval. For domperidone, an ECG is only recommended when listed risk factors (hypokalemia/ poor renal function/ diabetes mellitus/ QT prolonging or comedication resulting in increased blood levels/ high doses/ pre‐existent prolonged QT time or long QT syndrome) are present. The same approach is considered acceptable to mitigate the risk of QT prolongation in ondansetron. Caution is needed in infants < 3 months old, as clinical monitoring of the drug effect is indicated.

Comparison with alternatives

Metoclopramide and domperidone are contraindicated due to the high risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, especially in infants. Hence, domperidone and metoclopramide are still considered to be unsuitable. Ondansetron is considered a safer alternative.

Conclusion on balance

The benefits only outweigh the risks when oral rehydration therapy alone is insufficient and the child is at risk of dehydration. Ondansetron should not be used to treat nausea and vomiting symptoms without (imminent) dehydration.

Introduction

Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a distressing and debilitating side effect of chemotherapeutic regimens that can profoundly affect quality of life. Different agents, including metoclopramide and corticosteroids, have been historically used to help patients control side effects but with limited efficacy. At present, 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists (RAs) are considered to be a central part of an effective prophylactic regimen against CINV. Combination regimens including 5-HT 3 RAs are currently recommended to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by highly and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.

The 5-HT 3 RAs dolasetron, ondansetron, and granisetron are also indicated for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV); 5-HT 3 RAs are administered at the end of surgery conducted under total anesthesia. Indeed, the combination of a 5-HT 3 RA with dexamethasone and droperidol is sometimes used in high-risk PONV patients.

Antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g. amiodarone, quinidine, and sotalol) but also noncardiac medications from a variety of therapeutic classes, including 5-HT 3 RAs, have been associated with prolongation of cardiac repolarization as measured by the corrected QT (QTc) interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). These drugs have the potential to influence the I kr cardiac potassium channel, thereby resulting in increased repolarization time. To date, the primary clinical implication of repolarization changes is the increased risk of possible fatal cardiac events, i.e. torsades de pointes. Therefore, there is a regulatory mandate to define the potential of QTc interval prolongation induced by noncardiac drugs. The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E14 Guidelines, effective from November 2005, was developed to help drive adequate trials in healthy volunteers in order to ascertain the effects on QTc interval prolongation of new nonantiarrhythmic medications.

### Antiemetic prophylaxis with droperidol in morphine-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia: a propensity score matched cohort study [^1132ux6V]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In December 2001, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning indicating an association between droperidol, QT prolongation, and torsades de pointes, although high-quality clinical trials did not support this hypothesis. Consequently, droperidol was rapidly replaced by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, neurokinin blockers, and atypical antipsychotics. Experts argued that the warning about droperidol was primarily based on nine case reports without solid evidence of causation. Several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that the QT prolongation related to droperidol was transient, dose-dependent and did not develop into serious ventricular arrhythmias or cardiac arrest at therapeutic doses (0.625–1.25 mg). In 2015, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine stated that the evidence supporting the black box warning was inadequate, and supported the use of droperidol in an emergency setting. In February 2019, droperidol was reintroduced to the United States drug market by American Regent, Inc. (Shirley, NY, USA), still with the black box warning. To date, no study has investigated the changes in baseline rates of PONV before and after the black box warning. Further studies and real-world data are needed to evaluate the actual impact of the reintroduction of droperidol on the incidence of PONV.

### Comparative safety of serotonin (5-HT ₃) receptor antagonists in patients undergoing surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116jugqj]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Serotonin (5-HT 3) receptor antagonists are a class of antiemetics recommended for patients undergoing surgery who are at risk for nausea and vomiting. Serotonin (5-HT 3) receptor antagonists reduce nausea and vomiting by inhibiting vagal nerves in the central nervous system and intestinal mucosa. However, some evidence suggests that 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists can increase the risk of cardiac harm in children undergoing chemotherapy. Adverse events associated with these medications include a decrease in heart rate and prolongation of the QT interval. We were commissioned by Health Canada, a department of the federal government, to determine the comparative safety of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists for patients of all ages undergoing surgery due to safety concerns regarding the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists.

### Drug-specific risk of severe QT prolongation following acute drug overdose [^113FNQJk]. Clinical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Severe QT prolongation (SQTP) has been identified as a strong predictor of adverse cardiovascular events in acute drug overdose, but drug-specific causes of SQTP in the setting of acute drug overdose remain unclear. We aimed to perform the most definitive study to date describing drug-specific risk of SQTP following acute drug overdose. Methods: This was a prospective multicenter cohort study at > 50 hospital sites across the US using the ToxIC Registry between 2015 and 2018. Inclusion criteria were adults (≥ 18 years) receiving medical toxicology consultation for acute drug overdose. The primary outcome was SQTP, which was defined using the computer automated Bazett QT correction (QTc) on the ECG with the previously validated cut point of 500 milliseconds. Mean difference in QTc was also calculated for specific drugs. Drugs associated with SQTP were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression to control for known confounders of QT risk (age, sex, race, cardiac disease). Results: From 25,303 patients screened, 6473 met inclusion criteria with SQTP occurring in 825 (13%). Drugs associated with increased adjusted odds of SQTP included Class III antidysrhythmics (sotalol), sodium channel blockers (amitriptyline, diphenhydramine, doxepin, imipramine, nortriptyline), antidepressants (bupropion, citalopram, escitalopram, trazodone), antipsychotics (haloperidol, quetiapine), and the antiemetic serotonin antagonist ondansetron. Conclusions: This large US cohort describes drug-specific risk of SQTP following acute drug overdose. Healthcare providers caring for acute drug overdoses from any of these implicated drugs should pay close attention to cardiac monitoring for occurrence of SQTP.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Prognostic and management value of preoperative ECG — The prognostic significance of several electrocardiographic abnormalities has been identified in observational studies, including arrhythmias, significant pathologic Q-waves, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, ST-segment depressions, QT prolongation, and bundle branch blocks, yet most studies report little to no added prognostication beyond clinical risk assessment. Notable abnormalities that may prompt further information, consultation, or testing include significant Q-waves, LV hypertrophy, ST-segment elevation, ST depression, T-wave inversion, Mobitz type II or higher block, bundle branch blocks, atrial fibrillation (AF), or QT interval prolongation; the likelihood of abnormalities increases with age and risk factors, but a standard age or risk factor cutoff has not been defined, and the optimal time interval between obtaining a 12-lead ECG and elective NCS is unknown. In general, an abnormal preoperative ECG may not substantially alter perioperative management, except for second-degree Mobitz type II or higher atrioventricular block, and recognition of a prolonged QT interval may inform selection of anesthetics, postoperative antiemetics, or antibiotic therapy. Clinical risk assessment using validated tools is more useful to guide management than a single resting ECG; in low-risk patients, a routine preoperative ECG has little effect and should be omitted from standard preoperative evaluation, with one study of 89 892 patients showing cancellation of 13 (0.004%) treatments in low-risk patients (11 with new AF and 2 with ischemia or previous infarction), only 1 subsequent abnormal cardiac workup, and the remaining 11 ultimately undergoing NCS without complications.

### Benefit-risk assessment of off-label drug use in children: the bravo framework [^1167wWvB]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

IDENTIFIED BENEFITS AND RISKS

Benefits

Ondansetron improves success of oral rehydration therapy and prevents hospitalization. Appropriate dose selection is possible.

Risks

Infants up to 3 months of age have a greater risk for toxicity as exposure to ondansetron may be increased due to reduced clearance in this population. At the same time, when correcting based on reduced clearance only, these children are at risk for underexposure due to the higher Vd. Dose‐dependent prolongation of the QT interval may occur especially in children with congenital long QT interval syndrome. Prolongation of the QT interval is dose dependent. Use of ondansetron has a limited effect on cessation of vomiting.

### QT prolongation, torsades des pointes, and cardiac arrest after 4 mg of IV ondansetron [^115Vq7s6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Ondansetron is a commonly used antiemetic in the emergency department despite a 2011 FDA warning regarding dose-related QTc prolongation and torsades des pointes (TdP). Cases of TdP from small ondansetron doses administered in the emergency department are lacking. A 41-year-old-woman with alcohol use disorder on no medications or supplements presented to an emergency department with one day of nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain. Examination revealed a pulse of 77 beats/min and epigastric tenderness. The patient received 4 mg IV ondansetron, 30 mg IV ketorolac, and was placed on cardiac monitoring. ECG obtained one minute after ondansetron demonstrated premature ventricular contractions with QTc = 653 ms. Thirteen minutes after receiving ondansetron she suffered TdP and cardiac arrest. She received immediate CPR and IV epinephrine with successful defibrillation at one minute. She then received IV magnesium. Post-arrest ECGs demonstrated persistent QTc prolongation immediately and at three hours post-arrest. Laboratory studies, drawn prior to arrest, demonstrated hypokalemia (3.2 mEq/L), hypomagnesemia (1.3 mg/dL), and elevated lipase (4918 IU/L). She received no additional QT-prolonging agents. Transthoracic echocardiogram and troponins were normal; ECG intervals completely normalized within 12 h and she was discharged neurologically intact. The patient returned 18 months later with recurrent pancreatitis and similar electrolyte abnormalities; QT-prolonging drugs were avoided at that time and her course was uncomplicated. QT prolongation with subsequent torsades des pointes and cardiac arrest may occur in high-risk patients receiving small doses of ondansetron. Further studies are warranted to determine the safest antiemetic for use in the emergency department.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112U1sj1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although serotonin (5-HT 3) receptor antagonists are effective in reducing nausea and vomiting, they may be associated with increased cardiac risk. Our objective was to examine the comparative safety and effectiveness of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists (e.g. dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, palonosetron, tropisetron) alone or combined with steroids for patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until December 2015 for studies comparing 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists with each other or placebo in chemotherapy patients. The search results were screened, data were abstracted, and risk of bias was appraised by pairs of reviewers, independently. Random-effects meta-analyses and network meta-analyses (NMAs) were conducted.

Results

After screening 9226 citations and 970 full-text articles, we included 299 studies (n = 58,412 patients). None of the included studies reported harms for active treatment versus placebo. For NMAs on the risk of arrhythmia (primary outcome; three randomized controlled trials [RCTs], 627 adults) and mortality (secondary outcome; eight RCTs, 4823 adults), no statistically significant differences were observed between agents. A NMA on the risk of QTc prolongation showed a significantly greater risk for dolasetron + dexamethasone versus ondansetron + dexamethasone (four RCTs, 3358 children and adults, odds ratio 2.94, 95% confidence interval 2.13–4.17).

For NMAs on the number of patients without nausea (44 RCTs, 11,664 adults, 12 treatments), number of patients without vomiting (63 RCTs, 15,460 adults, 12 treatments), and number of patients without chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting (27 RCTs, 10,924 adults, nine treatments), all agents were significantly superior to placebo. For a NMA on severe vomiting (10 RCTs, 917 adults), all treatments decreased the risk, but only ondansetron and ramosetron were significantly superior to placebo. According to a rank-heat plot with the surface under the cumulative ranking curve results, palonosetron + steroid was ranked the safest and most effective agent overall.

Conclusions

Most 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists were relatively safe when compared with each other, yet none of the studies compared active treatment with placebo for harms. However, dolasetron + dexamethasone may prolong the QTc compared to ondansetron + dexamethasone. All agents were effective for reducing risk of nausea, vomiting, and chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^113tFSV4]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Dopamine receptor antagonists — droperidol for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis: the recommended dose is 0.625–1.25 mg (A1) and the optimal timing is the end of surgery (A1). Meta-analyses support its efficacy; in bimaxillary surgery, droperidol 0.3–1 mg had equal efficacy as granisetron 1.0 mg, although both were less effective than a droperidol and granisetron combination. Safety and regulatory notes include an FDA black box warning in 2001 for risk of sudden cardiac death; at PONV doses, QT prolongation potential is similar to ondansetron and, when combined with ondansetron, the risk is comparable to either drug alone. Observational data report no increase in ventricular tachycardia with droperidol 0.625 mg, akathisia risk comparable between ondansetron 4 mg, droperidol 0.625 mg, and droperidol 1.25 mg, and a low rate (0.9%) of adverse events such as extrapyramidal effects (B1).

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114dPNQN]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although serotonin (5-HT 3) receptor antagonists are effective in reducing nausea and vomiting, they may be associated with increased cardiac risk. Our objective was to examine the comparative safety and effectiveness of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists (e.g., dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, palonosetron, tropisetron) alone or combined with steroids for patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until December 2015 for studies comparing 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists with each other or placebo in chemotherapy patients. The search results were screened, data were abstracted, and risk of bias was appraised by pairs of reviewers, independently. Random-effects meta-analyses and network meta-analyses (NMAs) were conducted.

Results

After screening 9226 citations and 970 full-text articles, we included 299 studies (n = 58,412 patients). None of the included studies reported harms for active treatment versus placebo. For NMAs on the risk of arrhythmia (primary outcome; three randomized controlled trials [RCTs], 627 adults) and mortality (secondary outcome; eight RCTs, 4823 adults), no statistically significant differences were observed between agents. A NMA on the risk of QTc prolongation showed a significantly greater risk for dolasetron+dexamethasone versus ondansetron+dexamethasone (four RCTs, 3358 children and adults, odds ratio 2.94, 95% confidence interval 2.13–4.17). For NMAs on the number of patients without nausea (44 RCTs, 11,664 adults, 12 treatments), number of patients without vomiting (63 RCTs, 15,460 adults, 12 treatments), and number of patients without chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting (27 RCTs, 10,924 adults, nine treatments), all agents were significantly superior to placebo. For a NMA on severe vomiting (10 RCTs, 917 adults), all treatments decreased the risk, but only ondansetron and ramosetron were significantly superior to placebo. According to a rank-heat plot with the surface under the cumulative ranking curve results, palonosetron+steroid was ranked the safest and most effective agent overall.

Conclusions

Most 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists were relatively safe when compared with each other, yet none of the studies compared active treatment with placebo for harms. However, dolasetron+dexamethasone may prolong the QTc compared to ondansetron+dexamethasone. All agents were effective for reducing risk of nausea, vomiting, and chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of medically refractory gastroparesis: expert review [^113nChBs]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Medications for nausea and vomiting — domperidone — are discussed for patients who fail metoclopramide, noting limited large RCT data; domperidone, a dopamine D2-receptor antagonist, does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, QT prolongation and ventricular tachycardia are risks, it has fewer central side effects than metoclopramide, and availability in the United States is only through an FDA investigational drug application; the recommended starting dose is 10 mg 3 times a day, although escalation to 20 mg 4 times a day has been reported, this should probably be avoided for cardiovascular safety considerations; published studies reveal modest efficacy, and in a single-center cohort (n = 115) 68% had improvement in symptom scores, although 7% had cardiac side effects requiring drug cessation.

### Latest update on prevention of acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in pediatric cancer patients [^1129hcDU]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

5-HT3 antagonists form the cornerstone of antiemetic prophylaxis regimens for moderate to highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses in adults, and then in children, have shown their efficacy. Tricco et al. systemically reviewed over 299 studies with 58,412 patients, published 1995–2015. Twenty-five (8%) of those studies included pediatric-only trials and eight (2.7%) included combined adult and pediatric patients. Primary outcomes were to evaluate both efficacy and safety when using 5-HT3 antagonists alone and with dexamethasone. No statistically significant differences in the overall effectiveness between the 5-HT3 antagonists were observed. Combination of a 5-HT3 antagonist with dexamethasone provided superior antiemetic control than a 5-HT3 antagonist alone. None of the studies compared treatment versus placebo arm for adverse effects. However, when specifically evaluating for QTc prolongation, a known adverse effect of the 5-HT3 antagonists, a network meta-analysis showed a slightly increased risk of prolongation of QTc with the combination of dolasetron and dexamethasone versus ondansetron and dexamethasone. The analysis included four randomized controlled trials reflecting 3358 adults and children, odd ratio of 2.94 and 95% CI 2.13–4.17. Of note, all of the 5-HT3 antagonists come with labeling of possible QTc prolongation, however, in children, the risk is minimal given single doses of > 16 mg are never used and co-morbidities that increase this risk (use of antiarrhythmic, cardiovascular disease) are much lower. In fact, even when studies have found statistically significant minor EKG changes, none have reported dangerous rhythm disturbances or adverse events in children.

### Effect of single doses of IV palonosetron, up to 2.25 mg, on the QTc interval duration: a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study in healthy volunteers [^114JfjMh]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The use of serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists (RAs) in the prevention of nausea and vomiting caused by emetogenic chemotherapy is part of a comprehensive management strategy for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Electrocardiographic effects have been reported in patients after intravenous administration of 5-HT3 RAs. The present study investigated the electrocardiogram (ECG) profile of the 5-HT3 RA palonosetron following International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E14 Guidelines.

Methods

A total of 221 healthy subjects (101 females, 120 males) were randomized in this phase I, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study and assigned to one of five treatments: placebo, palonosetron (0.25, 0.75, or 2.25 mg), or moxifloxacin (400 mg). ECGs were recorded for 24 h pre-dosing until 48 h post-dose. The primary endpoint was the placebo time-matched and baseline-subtracted individual QTc interval prolongation (ΔΔQTcI).

Results

The QTc interval was not prolonged after administration of palonosetron (ΔΔQTcI upper confidence interval was < 10 ms for all time points in all palonosetron treatment groups). Assay sensitivity was confirmed with the expected change in the QTc interval after administration of the positive control moxifloxacin.

Conclusions

Palonosetron, even at supratherapeutic doses, has no effect on cardiac repolarization as measured by the QTc interval in a validated controlled clinical trial.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines for management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^116vQJmq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric cyclic vomiting syndrome — acute antiemetic therapy with ondansetron/5‑HT3 receptor antagonists: Ondansetron is widely used in the acute management of CVS, and the panel judged the desirable effects as moderate based on indirect evidence including a retrospective pediatric migraine study demonstrating 90% efficacy in controlling vomiting (formulation not specified). None of the studies reported on side effects of 5‑HT3 receptor antagonists and the panel judged the undesirable effects as small, noting reported constipation, headache, transaminitis, and QTc interval prolongation. The panel rated the overall certainty of the evidence as very low, judged the balance of effects to probably favor the intervention, considered it to be cost‑effective due to prevention of hospitalizations, and judged it probably acceptable and feasible with probably no impact on health equity. The guideline panel determined that while certainty is very low, the use of IV ondansetron is supported by its indirect efficacy, broad availability and safety in a diversity of settings, with much of these data also applying to enteral 5‑HT3 receptor antagonists; despite widespread use there is a paucity of high‑quality effectiveness evidence, and the intervention was judged to have neutral effects on health equity and probably be acceptable and feasible, particularly when used within individualized protocols. Implementation considerations include potential drug interactions and risks of QTc interval prolongation; for most younger patients, dose ranges between 0.13 and 0.26 mg/kg showed no major outcome differences. Subgroup considerations include patients whose disease is refractory to outpatient interventions and requiring IV intervention, and periodic re‑evaluation of efficacy is essential. The panel recommended trials assessing the efficacy of ondansetron singly or as part of a multi‑drug protocol for pediatric CVS in both the home and acute care setting and also recommends head‑to‑head comparison trials between IV 5‑HT3 receptor antagonists and NK‑1 receptor antagonists.

### Safety of domperidone in treating nausea associated with dihydroergotamine infusion and headache [^1176kzeP]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this population, we observed no serious side effects or QTc prolongation. We also found that domperidone helps manage DHE-associated nausea in combination with other antiemetics. These findings align with decades of internationally accumulated clinical experience and numerous prospective trials. Although a range of options exist to treat migraine, migraine-associated nausea, and emergent nausea with DHE, most treatments are dangerous or replace nausea with disabling sedation. As a less sedating alternative, domperidone is invaluable in migraine management given that safety concerns are allayed.

Limitations of this study include its retrospective design and small sample size. Efficacy, including comparisons with centrally acting dopaminergic blockers, could not be assessed. Rare events and conditions, such as a concealed long QT syndrome, may be missed. In addition, this population was relatively young and healthy, and few patients had exacerbating conditions, such as electrolyte disorders or coadministration of QT prolonging agents. Finally, side effects were not specifically queried; we relied on progress notes and discharge summaries. Minor and asymptomatic side effects, such as liver enzyme or prolactin elevation, may have been missed.

It should be noted that no patients received high domperidone doses, and that all patients had baseline screening ECGs. While caution should be used when treating patients with risk factors such as older age, heart disease, concurrent use of QT prolonging medications, and hypokalemia, current evidence suggests that domperidone is safe and effective in the vast majority of individuals.

This audit provides Class IV evidence that domperidone is safe for treating nausea associated with DHE infusion and headache in a tertiary hospital. Future studies should extend these findings to other settings (e.g. outpatient clinics) and other populations (e.g. nonmigrainous headache disorders, patients with risk factors). Given domperidone's effectiveness and tolerability, concern for safety should not preclude its use in a well-screened headache population.

### Acquired long QT syndrome due to antiemetics, COVID-19 andinduced exacerbation of congenital chloride losing diarrhoea [^1133icub]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Congenital chloride losing diarrhoea (CCLD) is a rare disease caused by mutations in an intestinal chloride/bicarbonate ion exchange channel. Few reports describe CCLD in adults and none has described the impact of a parasitic infection on CCLD. Severe diarrhoea may result in hypokalaemia with QT interval prolongation. Treatment with antiemetics may further increase the QT interval. To raise awareness of this preventable complication, we describe the course of a woman in her 20s with CCLD who developed COVID-19 and a Blastocystis hominis infestation. Treatment with antiemetics and hypokalaemia resulted in prolongation of the QT interval to 640 ms. While, the QT interval normalised with discontinuation of antiemetics and electrolyte replacement, patients with CCLD must take precautions to prevent gastrointestinal infections. Regardless, whenever patients with CCLD present to hospital, the authors recommend monitoring the QT interval and avoiding medications that predispose to torsade de pointes.

### Effect of low-dose droperidol on the QT interval during and after general anesthesia: a placebo-controlled study [^113LQYZY]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Since the effects of antiemetic doses of droperidol on the QT interval have not been previously studied, the authors designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the intraoperative and postoperative effects of small-dose droperidol (0.625 and 1.25 mg intravenous) on the QT interval when used for antiemetic prophylaxis during general anesthesia.

Methods

One hundred twenty outpatients undergoing otolaryngologic procedures with a standardized general anesthetic technique were enrolled in this study. After anesthetic induction and before the surgical incision, 60 patients were given either saline or 0.625 or 1.25 mg intravenous droperidol in a total volume of 2 ml. A standard electrocardiographic lead II was recorded immediately before and every minute after the injection of the study medication during a 10-min observation period. The QTc (QT interval corrected for heart rate) was evaluated from the recorded electrocardiographic strips. In 60 additional patients, a 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained before and at specific intervals up to 2 h after surgery to assess the effects of droperidol and general anesthesia on the QTc. Any abnormal heartbeats or arrhythmias during the operation or the subsequent 2-h monitoring interval were also noted.

Results

Intravenous droperidol, 0.625 and 1.25 mg, prolonged the QT interval by an average of 15 ± 40 and 22 ± 41 ms, respectively, at 3–6 min after administration during general anesthesia, but these changes did not differ significantly from that seen with saline (12 ± 35 ms) (all values mean ± SD). There were no statistically significant differences among the three study groups in the number of patients with greater than 10% prolongation in QTc (vs. baseline). Although general anesthesia was associated with a 14- to 16-ms prolongation of the QTc interval in the early postoperative period, there was no evidence of droperidol-induced QTc prolongation after surgery. Finally, there were no ectopic heartbeats observed on any of the electrocardiographic rhythm strips or 12-lead recordings during the perioperative period.

Conclusion

Use of a small dose of droperidol (0.625–1.25 mg intravenous) for antiemetic prophylaxis during general anesthesia was not associated with a statistically significant increase in the QTc interval compared with saline. More importantly, there was no evidence of any droperidol-induced QTc prolongation immediately after surgery.

### Effect of intravenous ondansetron on the QT interval of patients' electrocardiograms [^111jiQsB]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Ondansetron improves the success of oral rehydration in children with gastroenteritis. In postoperative adults, ondansetron has been shown to prolong the corrected QT (QTc). The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of ondansetron on the QT at peak effect and at 1-hour postpeak effect in pediatric patients.

Methods

This was an observational study looking at patients aged 6 months to 18 years receiving intravenous ondansetron for nausea, vomiting, or the inability to take fluids in the emergency department. Patients had electrocardiogram performed at baseline, at ondansetron's peak effect, and 1 hour postpeak effect. A paired samples Student t test compared QTc change at peak effect to zero. Peak effect of intravenous ondansetron is 3 minutes.

Results

One hundred patients were included. Fifty-five percent of patients were female with a mean age of 8.3 years. The mean (range) baseline QTc was 435 (388 to 501) milliseconds. The mean (range) change in QTc at peak effect of ondansetron was 3 (-40 to 65) milliseconds (P = 0.072). The change in QTc 1-hour postpeak effect of ondansetron was 3 (-43 to 45) milliseconds (P = 0.082). No change at peak effect or 1-hour postpeak effect was clinically significant.

Conclusions

Ondansetron does not affect the QTc of pediatric patients receiving the medication for nausea, vomiting, or inability to take fluids in the emergency department. No changes in the QTc are clinically significant. To date, there have been no studies evaluating the effect of ondansetron in this acutely ill population; therefore, a larger study should be completed to confirm these data.

### Which QT correction formulae to use for QT monitoring? [^116GbKo4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Retrospective Clinical Analysis

Haloperidol should not be used in patients with QT prolongation. The data from the haloperidol point‐prevalence study illustrated that when using optimal QT correction, the proportion of patients with QTc values above clinical standards before the prescription of this QT‐prolonging drug could be reduced with up to 50%. This implies that a hospital‐wide automated algorithm, which uses QTcB for assessment of a possible dangerous QT prolongation, would generate double the amount of alerts compared to an algorithm using the optimal QT correction formula. This could lead to alert fatigue and avoiding clinically indicated first‐choice drugs because of potential QT‐prolonging effects. 26 Hence, using an optimal QT correction formula could reduce the workload and improve patient safety.

Limitations

One of the main limitations of this study is its single‐center retrospective character. The survival status of the patients was based on the electronic medical record at our institution, without a link to a public register. Although our electronic medical record is linked to multiple regional hospitals, the number of events might be underestimated. We limited current analysis to patients in sinus rhythm with a narrow QRS and a heart rate < 90 bpm in order to avoid the number of outliers. The number of parameters included in the risk stratification modeling was limited; however, the data set yielded no missing values. Furthermore, prospective population studies should be used to study population‐based rate correction in abnormal heart rhythms, such as sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular conduction defects.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116pU4bo]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment

Studies involving patients of any age undergoing chemotherapy and receiving a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist (i.e. dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, palonosetron, ramosetron, tropisetron) alone or combined with steroids (dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, prednisone) were included, regardless of publication status, duration of administration of the intervention, or duration of follow-up. Studies published in languages other than English were excluded.

After a calibration exercise, pairs of reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of citations and the full-text articles of potentially relevant studies, and then abstracted data from included studies. Disagreements were resolved through consensus or the involvement of an arbitrator (ACT). The following types of data were abstracted from the included studies a priori: study characteristics, patient characteristics, and outcomes. The primary outcome of interest, as identified by policy-makers with Health Canada, was the number of patients experiencing arrhythmia. Secondary outcomes included the numbers of patients experiencing QTc prolongation, QRS interval prolongation, death, sudden cardiac death, delirium, no nausea, no vomiting, no CINV, and severe vomiting.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs, and controlled before–after studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care risk-of-bias tool. Cohort studies were assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. The quality of reporting of harm outcomes was appraised using the McMaster Quality Assessment Scale of Harm (McHarm) tool. Potential conflicts of interest were recorded for all studies. Pairs of reviewers independently appraised methodological quality and conflicts were resolved through discussion.

### Ondansetron and the risk of cardiac arrhythmias: a systematic review and postmarketing analysis [^116EhuEN]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To explore the risk of cardiac arrhythmias associated with ondansetron administration in the context of recent recommendations for identification of high-risk individuals.

Methods

We conducted a postmarketing analysis and systematically reviewed the published literature, grey literature, manufacturer's database, Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System, and the World Health Organization Individual Safety Case Reports Database (VigiBase). Eligible cases described a documented (or perceived) arrhythmia within 24 hours of ondansetron administration. The primary outcome was arrhythmia occurrence temporally associated with the administration of a single, oral ondansetron dose. Secondary objectives included identifying all cases associating ondansetron administration (any dose, frequency, or route) to an arrhythmia.

Results

Primary: No reports describing an arrhythmia associated with single oral ondansetron dose administration were identified. Secondary: Sixty unique reports were identified. Route of administration was predominantly intravenous (80%). A significant medical history (67%) or concomitant use of a QT-prolonging medication (67%) was identified in 83% of reports. Approximately one third occurred in patients receiving chemotherapeutic agents, many of which are known to prolong the QT interval. An additional third involved administration to prevent postoperative vomiting.

Conclusion

Current evidence does not support routine ECG and electrolyte screening before single oral ondansetron dose administration to individuals without known risk factors. Screening should be targeted to high-risk patients and those receiving ondansetron intravenously.

### Effect of single doses of IV palonosetron, up to 2.25 mg, on the QTc interval duration: a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study in healthy volunteers [^111AZTSp]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Commonly used chemotherapy regimens, such as those containing anthracyclines, have been associated with cardiac arrhythmias. Since the adverse cardiac effects of some chemotherapeutic agents can emerge even years after treatment, cardiac toxicity of these agents is increasingly relevant because of the rising pool of long-term cancer survivors. The potential for adverse cardiac events should therefore be an important consideration when selecting an antiemetic agent to be administered as supportive care, so that there is no further increase in the potential risk of cardiac complications due to predisposition to cardiac arrhythmias or to cardiotoxic anticancer regimens.

In registrative pivotal trials of palonosetron in both HEC and MEC settings, ECGs were recorded for palonosetron and the comparators dolasetron and ondansetron in order to perform an integrated data analysis. In this analysis, the prolongation effect of palonosetron on QTc was of 2 ms while for ondansetron and dolasetron comparators, the mean changes from baseline were of a larger magnitude of 4–5 ms.

With respect to dolasetron (Anzemet, IV), a dose-dependent increase in QTc interval prolongation was shown in a thorough QT/QTc study, resulting in its CINV indication being removed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA; 22 September 2011). Post-marketing cases of torsades de pointes were also identified for ondansetron IV at the dose of 32 mg. A thorough QT/QTc study was conducted in which a significant dose relationship with QTc interval prolongation was observed. For this reason, the FDA changed its recommended dose of ondansetron to half of the previously approved dose (a maximum of 16 mg for the IV formulation; 14 November 2014). Published data (ISoP 2011 and 2014) on palonosetron originating from post-marketing spontaneous reporting showed that the number of cardiac events associated with palonosetron was negligible and clinically irrelevant.

Palonosetron caused neither significant clinical prolongation of the QTc interval or adverse cardiac events in this study, indicating, based on ICH E14 guideline principles, that its risk of cardiotoxicity is low and that its use in the prevention of CINV in patients receiving MEC and HEC is apparently safe for cardiac function.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^111BFkMa]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of ondansetron hydrochloride IV (also known as Zofran):
- **Anaphylaxis, bronchospasm**: use extreme caution in patients with hypersensitivity to selective 5-HT₃ receptor antagonists.
- **Mask symptoms of ileus, gastric distension**: use caution in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting or after abdominal surgery.
- **Myocardial infarction**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ondansetron has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischemia.
- **Prolonged QT interval**: use caution in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, congestive HF, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other QT-prolonging medications. Obtain ECG monitoring. Avoid using ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ondansetron has been associated with an increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially in patients with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs, such as SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, MAOIs, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue.

Prospective data evaluating the effect of ondansetron on the corrected QT (QTc) interval is lacking in emergency department clinical use. As part of a randomized trial of a 24-mg bimodal-release ondansetron (RHB-102) pill, we tested the effect of RHB-102 compared to placebo on QTc change.

Methods

This was a planned safety outcome analysis within a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial compared the effects of RHB-102 among patients ≥ 12 years who presented to 21 centers with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. Patients with an initial baseline electrocardiogram as well as a follow-up electrocardiogram 4 h later were included in the analysis. The safety endpoint for this analysis was the change from baseline in QTc interval at 4 h, the median time at which ondansetron serum level peaks.

Results

A total of 147 patients were included with a mean baseline QTc in the RHB-102 and placebo arms of 410 and 406 ms, respectively. There was no difference in the change in QTc at 4 h post-study drug administration between the RHB-102 (+4, 95% CI 1–8 ms) and placebo group (+5, 95% CI 1–9 ms). In the RHB-102 arm, 6.6% of patients had a QTc change > 30 ms and in the placebo arm 3.6% (p = 0.48). No patient in either arm had a QTc change > 60 ms after study drug administration.

Conclusion

In patients with normal baseline QTc, 24-mg bimodal-release ondansetron did not prolong the QTc in comparison to placebo.

### Benefit-risk assessment of off-label drug use in children: the bravo framework [^111ZWmev]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

RISK TOLERANCE FOR THE USE OF ONDANSETRON FOR GASTROENTERITIS‐INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING

The assessment has been reviewed by the DPF's editorial board. The board concluded that in cases where prolonged nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea leads to (risk of) dehydration, drug treatment can be considered to prevent hospital admission and to improve the success rate of oral rehydration. Vomiting and diarrhea are uncomfortable symptoms for both the child and parent, but do not need treatment in general. Editorial board members do not have conflicts of interest (as author of any of the papers included or as consultant to pharmaceutical industry). Some board members are familiar with using ondansetron for gastroenteritis. QT prolongation is rare and not conceived as a frequent or serious problem in children in daily practice and is sufficiently covered by — pragmatically — assessing family history on cardiac events and other risk factors. Serious side effects are not observed. This may bias their opinion favoring the use of ondansetron. There is a relevant medical need to treat children in whom oral rehydration alone is not successful, in both university hospitals and regular pediatric clinics.

### The effect of oral ondansetron on QT interval in children with acute gastroenteritis; a retrospective observational study [^114UvtMv]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients and setting

This retrospective observational study was conducted in a pediatric ED of Ajou University Hospital which is the largest tertiary referral university hospital located on Southern Kyounggi Province. We reviewed the charts of all patients whose primary discharge diagnosis was AGE between January 2017 and June 2018. Among them, we selected patients aged from 6 months to 14 years. Finally, we included patients who received oral ondansetron with ORT and underwent an electrocardiogram (ECG) according to the ORT protocol in our pediatric ED. Patients were excluded if they had clinical dehydration scale (CDS) ≥ 6, oliguria, surgical abdomen, medical history of abdomen surgery, congenital heart disease, arrhythmias, or a history of use of QT-prolonging medication. We also excluded patients with missing medical records, those who could not measure the QT intervals due to ECG noise and those who received intravenous fluid or other antiemetics. The study was approved by institute' ethics committee. The study also complied with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.

ORT protocol

In our pediatric ED, the ORT protocol with oral ondansetron has been performed for mildly to moderately dehydrated patients with CDS ≤ 5 with AGE. If the patient complains of vomiting, 2 mg (for patients 8–15 kg), 4 mg (for patients 15–30 kg), or 8 mg (for patients > 30 kg) of ondansetron (Zofran Zydis®, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) was administered by the oral route for antiemetic effect. ORT was started 15 to 20 min after administration of oral ondansetron. For early detection of QT prolongation and fatal arrhythmias, ECG recording (lead II; standard paper speed of 25 mm/sec, standard calibration of 10 mm/mV) was performed using biphasic defibrillator (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA, USA) before the administration of ondansetron. To detect any changes in the ECG after administration of ondansetron, a post-ECG was obtained before discharge from ED.

### Safety of domperidone in treating nausea associated with dihydroergotamine infusion and headache [^114tHep3]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

METHODS

The experience of adults admitted for IV DHE treatment to the UCSF Headache Center between July 2012 and May 2015 was audited. Treatment was at the discretion of the attending neurologist. In our practice, we routinely use domperidone 10 mg orally prior to DHE infusion, with increased dosing as needed for persistent nausea. All patients who received at least one dose of domperidone were included. Patients with at least one ECG after exposure to domperidone were included in the analysis of cardiac safety.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents.

This study was approved by the UCSF Committee on Human Research. Patient consent was waived for this retrospective audit.

Nausea severity.

Nausea severity was defined as absent (no as-needed antiemetics), mild (some as-needed antiemetics but no increase in scheduled dosing), moderate (aprepitant added or increased, or additional antiemetics required despite maximum aprepitant), severe (DHE infusion slowed despite maximum antiemetics), or refractory (DHE stopped due to nausea).

QT interval measurement.

Admission ECG QT and QTc were interpreted automatically at the time of the admission. All ECGs for patients included in the QTc analyses were also manually interpreted in a blinded fashion by 2 cardiac electrophysiologists (M.M.S. H. I.). If patients had multiple ECGs on domperidone, QTc was averaged for comparison.

Statistical methods.

All tests were done with IBM (Armonk, NY) SPSS Statistics v22. We compared manually interpreted QTc before and after domperidone administration using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with 2-tailed significance. A drug-induced QTc prolongation of ≥ 30 ms has been proposed as the cutoff for defining a clinically significant change. To increase sensitivity for detecting safety concerns, we used a postdomperidone increase of ≥ 10 ms. Assuming a 10-ms difference and a common SD of 15 ms, we calculated that 26 patients would be required to achieve adequate power. We compared groups using Pearson χ², Mann-Whitney U, or Fisher exact test as appropriate.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^113yQTAc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of ondansetron hydrochloride PO (also known as Zofran):
- **Anaphylaxis, bronchospasm**: use extreme caution in patients with hypersensitivity to selective 5-HT₃ receptor antagonists.
- **Mask symptoms of ileus, gastric distension**: use caution in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting or after abdominal surgery.
- **Myocardial infarction**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ondansetron has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischemia.
- **Prolonged QT interval**: use caution in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, congestive HF, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other QT-prolonging medications. Obtain ECG monitoring. Avoid using ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ondansetron has been associated with an increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially in patients with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs, such as SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, MAOIs, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue.

### Antiemetics: ASCO guideline update… [^1143w8PK]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

5This update of the 2017 guideline provides guidance on the use of dexamethasone as a prophylactic antiemetic in patients receiving CPIs. This guideline update addresses programmed death-1, programmed death 1–ligand, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein-4 CPIs. 12 10Children who received the 3-drug antiemetic regimen experienced lower rates of vomiting than children who received only ondansetron plus dexamethasone. The primary outcome of delayed-phase complete response occurred in 79% of children in the intervention arm and 51% of children in the intervention arm. P <. 0001). The 5-mg and 10-mg doses of olanzapine have not been compared directly in this setting. 12Thirty-three of the patients received chemotherapy alone and 68 received conditioning chemotherapy for HCT. Overall, the addition of olanzapine to the 3-drug antiemetic regimen improved complete response compared with the 3-drug regimen alone.

A benefit of olanzapine was observed in the delayed but not in the acute phase. In subgroup analysis, a benefit was observed among patients receiving HCT but not among the smaller group of patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Discussion 26, 27Significant progress has been made in limiting CINV through the introduction of several classes of antiemetics and their evidence-based incorporation into antiemetic regimens. 28Corticosteroids — almost exclusively dexamethasone — have been shown to be effective and safe agents for use either as single agents with low emetogenic chemotherapy or as essential components of multiagent, combination antiemetic regimens with moderate and highly emetogenic chemotherapy. 13, 17KEYNOTE 189 and KEYNOTE 407 evaluated the role of platinum-based chemotherapy used alone or in combination with the anti-PD1 agent pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic nonsquamous and squamous NSCLC, respectively.

The combination of a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and the NK1-receptor antagonist aprepitant were recommended as the antiemetic regimen to use prior to chemotherapy administration.

### Droperidol and ondansetron-induced QT interval prolongation: a clinical drug interaction study [^115gNrLG]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Droperidol and ondansetron have previously been found to prolong the QT interval in the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting. However, this adverse effect has never been confirmed and compared with both drugs under controlled conditions. The objective was to study the effects of droperidol and ondansetron alone or in combination on QT interval duration in healthy subjects.

Methods

Sixteen healthy volunteers, eight males and eight females, were enrolled in this prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Subjects received 1 mg droperidol, 4 mg ondansetron, 1 mg droperidol plus 4 mg ondansetron, or a placebo, intravenously in a crossover design. Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) and plasma concentrations were measured repeatedly during 10 h at each study period. The primary endpoint was the maximal placebo time-matched and baseline-subtracted QTcF prolongation (DeltaDeltaQTcF).

Results

Compared with placebo, both droperidol and ondansetron significantly prolonged the QTcF interval. DeltaDeltaQTcF prolongation was 25 ± 8 ms after droperidol, significantly greater than the 17 ± 10-ms prolongation with ondansetron (P = 0.014). The combination of droperidol and ondansetron significantly increased the mean maximal DeltaDeltaQTcF by 28 ± 10 ms. The combination induced greater QTcF prolongation compared with ondansetron alone (P = 0.001), but not with droperidol alone (P = 0.33). There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between droperidol and ondansetron.

Conclusions

Under controlled conditions, both droperidol and ondansetron either alone or in combination induced significant marked QTc interval prolongation. However, the combination of both drugs did not significantly increase QTc prolongation compared with that induced by droperidol alone.

### Emergency medicine updates: droperidol [^116h2X3D]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Droperidol is a butyrophenone that has recently been reintroduced after a United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) black box warning in 2001. Evidence demonstrates utility in a variety of clinical conditions.

Objective

This paper provides evidence-based updates concerning the use of droperidol for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Droperidol received a black box warning by the US FDA in 2001 due to concerns for QT prolongation and torsades de pointes; however, reevaluation of the available data suggests droperidol is a safe and efficacious medication. It can be used in the emergency department (ED) setting for many conditions, including acute agitation, headaches, vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. Extensive literature supports that the QT-prolonging effects are transient and that the risk of torsades de pointes is rare with doses utilized in the ED. An electrocardiogram does not need to be routinely obtained before droperidol use but should be considered in patients at high risk for QT prolongation.

Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that droperidol is a safe and effective medication for treating nausea and vomiting, headache, vertigo, and agitation in the ED setting.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^1173KESS]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Dopamine receptor antagonists — amisulpride for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV): an IV formulation was recently approved for PONV, and dose–response data indicate that amisulpride 5 mg was more effective vs. placebo (A2) whereas 1 and 2 mg were not (A3). As PONV treatment rescue in prophylaxis naïve patients, 5 and 10 mg were more effective than placebo (A3), and for PONV treatment the 10 mg dose was more effective than 5 mg in patients who had prior PONV prophylaxis with a non-antidopaminergic agent (A3). Safety findings note a mild increase in prolactin with unclear clinical significance, that for the PONV dose amisulpride is unlikely to cause QTc prolongation or extrapyramidal side effects, and that 10 mg IV alone or with ondansetron did not have a clinically significant effect on QTc; a single preoperative oral dose of 25 mg given two hours before craniotomy decreased PONV with no adverse effects.

### The effect of oral ondansetron on QT interval in children with acute gastroenteritis; a retrospective observational study [^111HHuFM]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In mildly to moderately dehydrated patients with acute gastroenteritis (AGE), oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is the treatment of choice. Though ondansetron is a very effective antiemetics and leads to succeed ORT, there have been reports QT prolongation in patients using it. We investigated the effect of oral ondansetron on QT interval in mildly to moderately dehydrated children with AGE.

Methods

This retrospective observational study was conducted in a single pediatric emergency department (ED) of a tertiary university hospital. We collected the medical records of patients with a primary diagnosis of AGE who received oral ondansetron and underwent an electrocardiogram between January 2017 and June 2018. A pediatric emergency physician calculated the corrected QT interval (QTc) by Bazett's method, and the calculations were reviewed by a pediatric cardiologist. QTc values before (preQTc) and after (postQTc) ondansetron administration were analyzed. ΔQTc was calculated as the change from preQTc to postQTc. We also investigated any cardiac complications from oral ondansetron.

Results

Total 80 patients were included. The mean age of the patients was 53.31 ± 32.42 months, and 45% were male. The mean dose of oral ondansetron was 0.18 ± 0.04 mg/kg. The mean interval from administration of ondansetron to performance of the electrocardiogram was 65 ± 26 min. The mean preQTc was 403.3 ± 24.0 ms, and the mean postQTc was 407.2 ± 26.7 ms. Two patients had a preQTc ≥ 460 ms, and one patient had a postQTc ≥ 460 ms. ΔQTc was ≥ 30 ms in seven patients (8.8%). No ΔQTc was ≥ 60 ms. No pre- or postQTc was ≥ 500 ms. No patient had a fatal cardiac arrhythmia after taking ondansetron.

Conclusion

Oral administration of a single dose of ondansetron in children with AGE did not cause high-risk QTc prolongation or fatal arrhythmia.

### Treatment principles in adults and development of patient-reported outcomes in cyclic vomiting syndrome [^115fXYqh]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1.1 Tricyclic antidepressants

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are strongly recommended as first‐line treatment in the treatment of moderate‐to‐severe CVS. The mechanism of action is not clear, but TCAs act on multiple receptors in the brain and inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake in the synaptic cleft. The mean effective dose is 75–100 mg at bedtime; patients are typically started at 25 mg, and the dose is titrated in 10 mg increments each week to improve tolerability and compliance with the medication. Efficacy data are based mostly on retrospective studies in adult and pediatric populations and showed that 413/600 or 70% of patients reported complete or partial improvement in CVS symptoms. Outcome measures included frequency of CVS episodes/year and reduction in emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations.

Despite its efficacy, approximately 9%–25% of patients experience side effects which include daytime sedation, constipation, dryness of mouth, and weight gain. The need to monitor the QT interval with successive EKGs, particularly during dose titration can be cumbersome in clinical practice. Further, most of these studies were either open‐label trials or retrospective studies, though funding for randomized controlled trials in CVS can be challenging and may pose some ethical concerns.

### Prevalence of the QT interval prolongation and its risk factors in hospitalized geriatric patients: findings of a single center cross-sectional study in Pakistan [^113c3sf2]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and objectives

Geriatric inpatients are particularly susceptible to Torsades de Pointes (TdP) because they are usually polymorbid and often take QT-prolonging drugs. Since polypharmacy is common in hospitalized geriatrics, it may lead to QT-prolonging Drug-Drug interactions, resulting in adverse cardiac events. Additionally, a significant portion of geriatric patients likely have a combination of other risk factors such as heart failure, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, bradycardia, diabetes mellitus, and electrolyte imbalances. However, there is a lack of published data regarding the prevalence of risk factors for QT interval prolongation in this population. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of QT interval prolongation and its risk factors among hospitalized geriatric patients, shedding light on potential contributors to this life-threatening condition in a vulnerable population.

Methods

This cross-sectional study was conducted at Ayub Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad from December 17, 2023, to May 9, 2024. During this study, 384 patients aged 65 years and older were analyzed. Various QT-prolonging medications were assessed using the CredibleMeds ® database, while drug-drug interactions were evaluated using the Lexicomp interactions database. Logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of QT interval prolongation.

Results

Our study found that QT prolongation was more common in females (50.8%) than in males (49.2%). Among these patients, 60.2% presented with six QT-prolonging risk factors. Overall, QT-prolonging drugs were prescribed to 99.5% of patients. A total of 970 QT-prolonging drugs were identified, with the majority (70.4%) carrying a conditional risk of Torsades de Pointes. The most frequently prescribed category of QT-prolonging drugs was diuretics, accounting for 228 instances. QT-prolonging Drug-Drug Interactions were identified in 23.2% of patients. Statistically significant differences were found between the two groups (Prolonged QT interval vs. normal QT interval) in various factors such as all DDIs (p = 0.008), triglycerides (p = 0.03), ischemic heart disease (p = 0.02), myocardial infarction (p = 0.01), antimicrobials (p = 0.004), anti-emetics (p = 0.01), and analgesics (p = 0.05). Univariate analysis showed a statistically significant association of QT interval prolongation with 6–10 DDIs (p = 0.03); 11–15 DDIs (p = 0.001), > 15 DDIs (p = 0.01), ischemic heart disease (p = 0.02), myocardial infarction (p = 0.01), antimicrobials (p = 0.04), and antiemetic's (p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, a statistically significant association of QT interval prolongation was found with 11–15 DDIs (p = 0.03).

Conclusion

This study identified a high prevalence of various risk factors for QT interval prolongation. When prescribing medications to this patient population, clinicians should conduct comprehensive medication reviews, regularly monitor the QT interval, and consider alternative therapies. Educating patients on medication risks and adherence to monitoring is crucial for early detection and reporting of adverse effects.

### Panobinostat (Farydak) [^115cZW53]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

7.4 Drugs that Prolong QT interval

Concomitant use of anti-arrhythmic medicines (including, but not limited to amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and sotalol) and other drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval (including, but not limited to chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, methadone, moxifloxacin, bepridil and pimozide) is not recommended. Anti-emetic drugs with known QT prolonging risk, such as dolasetron, ondansetron, and tropisetron can be used with frequent ECG monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Effectiveness of a clinical decision support system for reducing the risk of QT interval prolongation in hospitalized patients [^111HppS3]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2014). Low credibility.

Background

We evaluated the effectiveness of a computer clinical decision support system (CDSS) for reducing the risk of QT interval prolongation in hospitalized patients.

Methods and Results

We evaluated 2400 patients admitted to cardiac care units at an urban academic medical center. A CDSS incorporating a validated risk score for QTc prolongation was developed and implemented using information extracted from patients' electronic medical records. When a drug associated with torsades de pointes was prescribed to a patient at moderate or high risk for QTc interval prolongation, a computer alert appeared on the screen to the pharmacist entering the order, who could then consult the prescriber on alternative therapies and implement more intensive monitoring. QTc interval prolongation was defined as QTc interval > 500 ms or increase in QTc of ≥ 60 ms from baseline; for patients who presented with QTc > 500 ms, QTc prolongation was defined solely as increase in QTc ≥ 60 ms from baseline. End points were assessed before (n = 1200) and after (n = 1200) implementation of the CDSS. CDSS implementation was independently associated with a reduced risk of QTc prolongation (adjusted odds ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.89; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, CDSS implementation reduced the prescribing of noncardiac medications known to cause torsades de pointes, including fluoroquinolones and intravenous haloperidol (adjusted odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.63–0.91; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

A computer CDSS incorporating a validated risk score for QTc prolongation influences the prescribing of QT-prolonging drugs and reduces the risk of QTc interval prolongation in hospitalized patients with torsades de pointes risk factors.

### Intravenous ondansetron and the QT interval in adult emergency department patients: an observational study [^115iR6QT]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Ondansetron is known to cause QT interval prolongation, but this effect and clinical significance has not been prospectively studied in adult emergency department (ED) patients. The primary objective was to determine the mean maximal corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation after intravenous (IV) administration of 4 mg of ondansetron. The secondary objective was to report any serious adverse cardiac electrical events.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational, single-center cohort study conducted between 2012 and 2013 in an academic, military hospital ED. Adult patients ordered to receive 4 mg of IV ondansetron were eligible for the study. A six-lead electrocardiogram was recorded at baseline and every 2 minutes after ondansetron administration for 20 minutes. The QTc was calculated using the Bazett formula. Serious adverse cardiac electrical events (nonsinus rhythm, severe bradycardia, and sudden cardiac death) were also recorded.

Results

Twenty-two adult ED patients were enrolled. Ondansetron caused a mean prolongation of the QTc by 20 ms (95% confidence interval [CI] = 14 to 26 ms), with a mean proportion change from baseline of 5.2% (95% CI = 3.8% to 6.6%). There were zero (95% CI = 0 to 13%) reported serious adverse cardiac electrical events.

Conclusions

While QTc prolongation does occur in adult ED patients receiving IV ondansetron, the clinical impact is questionable.

### Prolongation of QTc interval after postoperative nausea and vomiting treatment by droperidol or ondansetron [^1126be5U]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

At dosages above 0.1 mg/kg, droperidol induces a dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation. Although subject to controversy, low-dose droperidol has recently been suspected to induce cardiac arrhythmias. Hence, 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 antagonists have become the first-line drug for management of postoperative nausea and vomiting. These drugs are also known to prolong the QTc interval at high dosages. This study describes QTc interval changes associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting treatment by droperidol or ondansetron at low doses.

Methods

Eighty-five patients with postoperative nausea and vomiting were included in this prospective, single-blind study. Patients received either 0.75 mg intravenous droperidol (n = 43) or 4 mg intravenous ondansetron (n = 42). Electrocardiographic recordings were obtained before administration of antiemetic drug and then 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 min after. Electrocardiographic monitoring was maintained for 3 h in eight patients in each group.

Results

The QTc interval was prolonged (> 450 ms in men, > 470 ms in women) in 21% of the patients before antiemetic drug administration. This was significantly correlated with lower body temperature and longer duration of anesthesia. Compared with predrug QTc measurement, both antiemetics were associated with a significant QTc interval prolongation (P < 0.0001). The mean maximal QTc interval prolongation was 17 ± 9 ms after droperidol occurring at the second minute and 20 ± 13 ms after ondansetron at the third minute (both P < 0.0001). Compared with predrug measurement, the QTc interval was significantly lower after the 90th minute in both groups.

Conclusions

Droperidol and ondansetron induced similar clinically relevant QTc interval prolongations. When used in treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting, a situation where prolongation of the QTc interval seems to occur, the safety of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 antagonists may not be superior to that of low-dose droperidol.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115E6hFa]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 8.2 million deaths in 2012. Chemotherapy is a major component of cancer therapy. However chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are common, affecting approximately 70–80% of patients who receive chemotherapy, and can be debilitating. CINV cause significant anxiety; decrease quality of life; and can result in dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and hospital admission.

Serotonin (5-HT 3) receptor antagonists are antiemetic medications that act by inhibiting the vagal nerves in the central nervous system and intestinal mucosa that trigger the emetic reflex. Examples of first-generation 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists include dolasetron, granisetron, and ondansetron, while palonosetron is a second-generation receptor antagonist. These treatments can be administered orally, subcutaneously, or intravenously. Previous systematic reviews have found that 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists are effective for treating nausea and vomiting that occur after chemotherapy. As such, 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists are recommended as the first-line of treatment for CINV in both adults and children.

Although 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists are effective in reducing nausea and vomiting, concerns have been raised that they may be associated with increased risk of arrhythmia. Some evidence suggests that they prolong the QT interval on electrocardiography, which is associated with an increased risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. torsades de pointes). In vitro studies have indicated that 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists block voltage-dependent sodium channels and human ether-a-go-go-related gene potassium channels (cardiac ion channels), with the magnitude and type of electrocardiographic change depending on the particular drug. The US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada (a division of the Canadian federal government) have published warnings on the safety of dolasetron but no warnings have appeared for other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Information about cardiac risks cannot be gleaned from previous systematic reviews of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists because cardiac safety was not examined in those studies. This systematic review was undertaken, at the request of Canadian policy-makers from Health Canada, to determine the comparative safety and effectiveness of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists for patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Pediatric QT interval–prolonging medications and antipsychotic risk — many commonly used pediatric agents may prolong the QTc, including antiemetics, macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, antifungals such as ketoconazole, antihistamines, and other psychiatric medications; among antipsychotics, thioridazine and ziprasidone are associated with the greatest degrees of QTc prolongation, U.S. Food and Drug Administration "black box" warnings have been issued for both droperidol and thioridazine, and clonidine can result in hypotension and sedation.

### Guidelines on management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association [^114U8Nhp]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

The mean effective dose in adults is 75‐100 mg daily or 1‐1.5 mg/kg body weight. 3, 15, 28 Amitriptyline is best titrated in 10‐25 mg increments as this improves tolerability by allowing adaptation to and preventing discontinuation from side effects, particularly daytime sedation. This improves the ultimate efficacy of the medication. Most of the panelists used 10 mg but some used 25 mg. As always, this needs to be individualized based upon the patient response. The incidence of side effects with AT varies from 9% to 25% although this did not result in discontinuation of the drug in most studies. 19 Side effects include daytime sedation, weight gain, dryness of mouth, and constipation. The night‐time administration of AT can often promote sleep, whereas the lingering daytime sedation tends to improve or resolve in 8‐12 weeks. Though most studies have only evaluated AT, NT may be used alternatively to minimize side effects. Given the risk of prolongation of the QTc interval and cardiac arrhythmias, we recommend obtaining an EKG at baseline, once during titration at ~50 mg and after the target dose is reached. More frequent monitoring will vary between individual patients, based on their response to AT and concomitant use of other medications that can prolong the QT interval. It is recommended that the QTc be maintained at < 470 msec for women and < 450 msec for men. The dosage of AT should be reduced or stopped if there is QTc prolongation or development of significant side effects. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias appears to be low, and no serious adverse events have been reported with its use in CVS. Serious psychiatric side effects such as psychotic reactions, hypomania, and delirium may occur with the treatment of depression with amitriptyline but are not reported in CVS, perhaps due to the higher doses typically used to treat the former. 29

### Effect of ondansetron on QT interval in patients cared for in the PICU [^115ET9kZ]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

There is no evidence regarding the effect of ondansetron on the QT interval in pediatric patients in the ICU. This study aimed to describe the effect of ondansetron on the corrected QT interval in patients cared for in the PICU.

Design

Retrospective cohort, consecutive enrollment study.

Setting

Single-center, tertiary-level, medical/surgical PICU.

Patients

All patients less than 8 years old who received ondansetron over an 11-month period were included. Exclusion criteria were atrial arrhythmia, bundle-branch block, known congenital long QT syndrome, and concomitant administration of proarrhythmic antiarrhythmic agents.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Overall, 210 doses of ondansetron were administered to 107 patients, with a mean age 10.5 ± 4.8 years; 49% were men. Corrected QT interval increased to 460-500ms in 29% and to more than 500ms in 11% of events of ondansetron administration. The mean baseline corrected QT interval even before ondansetron administration was higher for these groups (460–500 and > 500ms; 457 ± 33 and 469 ± 45, respectively; p ≤ 0.05). In multivariate analysis, both groups were associated significantly with underlying electrolyte abnormalities (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1–4.4 and odds ratio, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8–15.7, respectively); the group with corrected QT interval more than 500ms was also significantly associated with organ dysfunction (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.1–9.4). As the numbers of risk factors increased from only ondansetron to three additional QT aggravating factors (electrolyte abnormalities, administration of other QT-prolonging drugs, and organ dysfunction), the likelihood of being associated with corrected QT interval more than 500ms increased.

Conclusions

Prolonged QT interval is observed commonly in PICUs following the administration of ondansetron. Underlying risk factors, such as electrolyte abnormalities and organ dysfunction, seem to pose the highest risk of prolongation of QT interval in these patients. The awareness of prevalent risk factors for increased corrected QT interval may help identify patients at high risk for arrhythmias.

### The effect of oral ondansetron on QT interval in children with acute gastroenteritis; a retrospective observational study [^1111UZ9p]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

A previous study of IV ondansetron in healthy children who were undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia or who had AGE with mild dehydration found a nonsignificant prolongation of QTc of 0.4 to 17 ms. Our results were similar, showing that oral ondansetron did not prolong QTc and that changes in ΔQTc were not significant. However, Trivedi et al. reported that several risk factors, including electrolyte imbalance, multidrug use with the possible risk of QT interval change, and organ dysfunction, prolonged QT in pediatric patients in the intensive care unit. In patients who had risk factors or baseline QTc over 460 ms, QT could be prolonged more than 500 ms. The patients we included were children with acute diseases who were previously healthy and without underlying disease and who received only a single dose of ondansetron. Recently two pediatric emergency centers in Pakistan conducted randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that supported our results which reported safety use and improve success rate of ORT of single dose oral ondansetron among children with gastroenteritis-associate vomiting. Therefore, further multicenter prospective study focusing on the effect of oral ondansetron on QT prolongation is needed to deduce the efficacy and safety of repeated doses of ondansetron in patients with a high risk of QT prolongation.

### Comparative safety of serotonin (5-HT ₃) receptor antagonists in patients undergoing surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116caTHf]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Arrhythmia was the most frequently reported outcome (46%). Only five studies reported QT prolongation, and 13 reported on the QT interval. None of the studies reported the number of patients experiencing PR prolongation or sudden cardiac death. We abstracted data from all of the included studies, and included 51 studies in our analyses. Reasons for excluding studies from the analyses included the manner in which the outcome was reported (e.g. mean versus number of patients), reporting zero events for all treatment arms, and investigating a single 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist (with a different dosage in each treatment arm).

The average sample size was 242 participants ranging from 28 to 1,044, and 64% of participants were women (Table 2, Additional file 1: Appendix 4). Most of the studies involved only adult patients (63%), patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II (58%), and patients who were undergoing obstetrical and gynecological (32%) surgery. Patients' history of postoperative nausea and vomiting was reported in 58% of the studies, and history of motion sickness was reported in 43% of the studies. Comorbidities were rarely reported (6%) (Table 2).

Patient characteristics

a Includes unpublished data; b some studies considered more than one comorbidity

Methodological quality and risk of bias

The majority of the included experimental and quasi-experimental studies had unclear or high risk of bias on the following items: allocation concealment (57%), similarity of baseline outcome characteristics (88%), incomplete outcome data (51%), selective outcome reporting bias (97%), and other types of bias, including the potential for funding bias because the study was funded by private industry and an author on the publication was employed by the company sponsoring the study (88%) (Additional file 1: Appendix 5, 6). None of the 115 studies reporting harms outcomes fully reported all items on the McHarm tool (Additional file 1: Appendix 7, 8). The visual inspection of the comparison adjusted funnel plots showed that there was no evidence for small-study effects and publication bias (Additional file 1: Appendix 9).

### Comparative safety of serotonin (5-HT ₃) receptor antagonists in patients undergoing surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1123U2EM]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

We used an integrated knowledge translation approach, entailing collaboration between researchers and research users throughout the conduct of this study. The research users involved in this study who posed the original study question were from Health Canada.

Protocol

A protocol was developed and revised using feedback from the research team and the research users. We registered our protocol with PROSPERO (CRD42013003564) and published it in an open-access journal. Our methods are described briefly here; additional details can be found in the protocol publication. We originally intended to evaluate both safety and efficacy outcomes for patients undergoing surgery or chemotherapy; however, due to the enormous number of studies that met the inclusion criteria, we made slight changes to our protocol and subdivided the analyses. The current paper focuses on the safety of 5-HT 3 antagonists in patients undergoing surgery. Subsequent papers will examine the efficacy of 5-HT 3 antagonists for patients undergoing surgery, and the efficacy and safety of 5-HT 3 antagonists for patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Eligibility criteria

We included experimental (randomized clinical trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, non-RCTs), quasi-experimental (interrupted time series, controlled before–after studies), and observational (cohort) studies involving patients of any age undergoing any type of surgery who were given a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist for nausea and/or vomiting. A list of the agents and relevant comparators that were investigated in the included studies can be found in Additional file 1: Appendix 1. The primary outcome was the number of patients experiencing arrhythmia, and secondary outcomes were QT prolongation, PR prolongation, delirium, and mortality (overall and sudden cardiac death). Given the large number of included studies we limited the review to those published in English. Studies suspected or identified as fraudulent were excluded.

Information sources

An experienced librarian executed searches of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until 11 January 2013. Unpublished studies were sought by searching trial protocol registries and conference proceedings.

Study selection and data collection

After a calibration exercise, the literature search results were screened by pairs of reviewers, working independently. The same approach was used to abstract data and appraise the quality of included studies. Conflicts at both the screening and the abstraction steps were resolved through discussion. When data was missing or clarification of published data was needed we contacted the authors.

### Effect of single doses of IV palonosetron, up to 2.25 mg, on the QTc interval duration: a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study in healthy volunteers [^114PmC1L]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Most of the cases of QTc interval prolongation and related transient arrhythmias described in the literature have been observed in the PONV setting with either dolasetron or ondansetron. The addition of certain risk factors (e.g. congenital long QT syndrome, hypokalemia, or female gender) have been suggested as potential inducers for torsades de pointes. The prescribing information for both dolasetron and ondansetron carries a cardiovascular warning. A more recent study in healthy volunteers, designed on the basis of the E14 guidance, found that under controlled conditions, both droperidol and ondansetron, either alone or in combination, induced marked QTc interval prolongation. However, the combination of both drugs did not significantly increase QTc interval prolongation compared to droperidol alone.

Palonosetron is a unique 5-HT 3 RA that is characterized by a half-life of about 40 h compared to the first-generation 5-HT 3 RAs such as ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron (4–9 h). The present study investigated the effects of single increasing intravenous (IV) doses (0.25 mg, 0.75, and supratherapeutic 2.25 mg) of palonosetron on the ECG profile in healthy volunteers compared to placebo and a positive control, namely oral moxifloxacin (400 mg). The study was designed, conducted, analyzed, and interpreted in accordance with the recommendations of the ICH E14 Guidelines as a "thorough QT/QTc study".

### QT-prolonging medications: prevalence of use and associated risks in CKD [^114wiE8C]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 10% of the global adult population and is associated with substantial cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Sudden cardiac death (often precipitated by ventricular arrhythmias like torsades de pointes) is a leading cause of death in patients with CKD. Prolongation of the QT interval (a marker of delayed ventricular repolarization) is a significant risk factor for arrhythmia in patients with CKD, whether they are on dialysis or not. QT prolongation in CKD is multifactorial and may result from electrolyte imbalances, myocardial remodelling, autonomic dysfunction, and exposure to QT-prolonging drugs. Patients on haemodialysis are particularly vulnerable to QT prolongation, due to rapid intradialytic electrolyte and fluid shifts. Many drugs known to prolong the QT interval (including various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antibiotics, antiemetics, and antipsychotics) are frequently prescribed to patients with CKD, even though there are few data on their safety in this population. The results of several well-designed pharmaco-epidemiological analyses (all based on data from the United States Renal Data System) have shown associations between QT-prolonging drugs and an elevated risk of sudden cardiac death among patients on dialysis. These findings are concerning, given the widespread use of such drug. The objective of this narrative review is to critically evaluate the pathophysiological relevance, prevalence, and cardiovascular consequences of QT-prolonging drug use in the CKD setting.

### Fourth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^11611fYZ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). High credibility.

Granisetron for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) efficacy and dosing — intravenous use and comparative data are summarized: "Granisetron 0.35–3 mg (5–20 μg/kg) IV has similar PONV efficacy compared to other first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and to dexamethasone 8 mg (evidence A1)". Additionally, "One study showed that granisetron 0.3 mg IV had better effectiveness than ondansetron 4 mg IV", and in middle ear surgery granisetron "resulted in less PONV than ondansetron up to 24 hours postoperatively". The guideline also states that "Dolasetron is no longer marketed in the USA due to the concerns over QT prolongation", and mentions that in laparoscopic cholecystectomy "granisetron was comparable to palonosetron".

### What clinicians should know about the QT interval [^114jAiSn]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Of the several factors implicated in causing QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, errors in the use of medications that may prolong this interval deserve special attention.

Objective

To systematically summarize the available clinical data on the QT interval and to offer improved recommendations for the use of QT-prolonging medications.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE from 1966 through 2002 for all English-language articles related to the QT interval. Additional data sources included bibliographies of articles identified on MEDLINE, a survey of experts, and data presented at a meeting of experts on long QT syndrome.

Study Selection

We selected for review registries and case series examining clinical outcomes of patients with prolonged QT interval and the effect of different methods of measurement of the QT interval on patient outcomes. Ten studies were identified, of which 6 were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction

Data quality was determined by publication in the peer-reviewed literature.

Data Synthesis

Optimal measurement of the QT interval is problematic because of lack of standardization and lack of data regarding the best way to adjust for heart rate. Reliable information on the proper use of QT-prolonging medications is scarce. Although a QT interval of at least 500 milliseconds generally has been shown to correlate with a higher risk of torsades de pointes, there is no established threshold below which prolongation of the QT interval is considered free of proarrhythmic risk. The risk of torsades de pointes should be assessed in patients who are about to begin taking a QT-prolonging medication. Although inadequate clinical studies preclude prediction of absolute risk for individual patients, particularly high-risk situations can be defined based on clinical variables. We propose recommendations on proper monitoring of the QT interval in patients receiving QT-prolonging medications.

Conclusion

Although the use of QT-prolonging medications can predispose to torsades de pointes, there is a relative paucity of information that can help clinicians and patients make optimal informed decisions about how best to minimize the risk of this serious complication.

### Prolonged QT syndrome and sedation: a case report and a review of the literature [^11744j9k]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Prolonged QT syndrome is the most common genetic arrhythmia syndrome, and the majority of patients are undiagnosed. The syndrome is characterized by abnormally long ventricular repolarization (QT interval) on electrocardiogram, which may manifest as syncopal episodes, arrhythmias, or sudden death. Arrhythmias may be precipitated by stress or medications. There are few randomized controlled trials examining the safety of typical sedation medications in the patient with prolonged long-QT syndrome. This case describes the management of sedation in a patient with prolonged long-QT syndrome and then reviews the current literature regarding commonly utilized sedation medications.

### The effect of oral ondansetron on QT interval in children with acute gastroenteritis; a retrospective observational study [^1126qrm6]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) findings have guided the US Food and Drug Administration on issues of drug-induced QT prolongation. The ICH has suggested that an increase in QTc of 30 ms is a "possible" cause for concern and an increase of 60 ms is a "definite" cause for concern. After administration of an at-risk drug, increases in QT or QTc to ≥ 500 ms or to ≥ 60 ms over baseline are commonly used as thresholds for potential discontinuation or alternative pharmacotherapy. In our study, there were seven patients with an increase in QTc of ≥ 30 ms and no patients with an increase of ≥ 60 ms. Patients with an increase of ≥ 30 ms were younger and had a lower body weight. In patients with an increase of ≥ 30 ms, baseline QTc was shorter and the change of QTc after taking medicine was greater. The dose of ondansetron per unit weight and the interval from oral administration of ondansetron to performance of the EGG did not significantly differ between patients who had an increase of < 30 ms and those who had an increase of ≥ 30 ms. However, ondansetron might cause a greater prolongation of QTc in younger children. Although all patients had QTc < 460 ms and there was no "definite" concern about ΔQTc, physicians need to be careful when using ondansetron in younger children.

### Which QT correction formulae to use for QT monitoring? [^115kiTfS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Drug safety precautions recommend monitoring of the corrected QT interval. To determine which QT correction formula to use in an automated QT-monitoring algorithm in our electronic medical record, we studied rate correction performance of different QT correction formulae and their impact on risk assessment for mortality.

Methods and Results

All electrocardiograms (ECGs) in patients > 18 years with sinus rhythm, normal QRS duration and rate < 90 beats per minute (bpm) in the University Hospitals of Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) during a 2-month period were included. QT correction was performed with Bazett, Fridericia, Framingham, Hodges, and Rautaharju formulae. In total, 6609 patients were included (age, 59.8 ± 16.2 years; 53.6% male and heart rate 68.8 ± 10.6 bpm). Optimal rate correction was observed using Fridericia and Framingham; Bazett performed worst. A healthy subset showed 99% upper limits of normal for Bazett above current clinical standards: men 472 ms (95% CI, 464–478 ms) and women 482 ms (95% CI 474–490 ms). Multivariate Cox regression, including age, heart rate, and prolonged QTc, identified Framingham (hazard ratio [HR], 7.31; 95% CI, 4.10–13.05) and Fridericia (HR, 5.95; 95% CI, 3.34–10.60) as significantly better predictors of 30-day all-cause mortality than Bazett (HR, 4.49; 95% CI, 2.31–8.74). In a point-prevalence study with haloperidol, the number of patients classified to be at risk for possibly harmful QT prolongation could be reduced by 50% using optimal QT rate correction.

Conclusions

Fridericia and Framingham correction formulae showed the best rate correction and significantly improved prediction of 30-day and 1-year mortality. With current clinical standards, Bazett overestimated the number of patients with potential dangerous QTc prolongation, which could lead to unnecessary safety measurements as withholding the patient of first-choice medication.

### Use of QT prolonging medications by hemodialysis patients and individuals without end-stage kidney disease [^113Lzzby]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study establishes that hemodialysis patients use QT prolonging medications with known and possible TdP risk to a greater extent than individuals without ESKD. Non‐antiarrhythmic drugs (eg, psychotropics, antiemetics, acid suppressants) were the most commonly prescribed agents. Our findings highlight high‐risk and potentially unsafe prescribing patterns, underscoring the need for future studies evaluating the cardiac safety of QT prolonging medications, especially non‐antiarrhythmic agents, in the clinically complex hemodialysis population.

### Electrocardiographic and cardiovascular effects of the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonists [^115UHHbj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the electrocardiographic (ECG) and cardiovascular effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine(3) (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonists preclinically, in healthy volunteers, and in patients undergoing chemotherapy or surgery.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was performed of clinical trials and preclinical data published between 1963 and December 2002 assessing the ECG and cardiovascular effects of 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, supplemented with reviews and secondary sources.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All of the articles identified were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included in this review.

Data Synthesis

There are no clinically relevant differences in efficacy and safety among the available 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists for prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced and postoperative nausea and vomiting. As a class, they have well-defined electrophysiologic activity. Changes in ECG parameters (PR, QRS, QT, QTc, JT intervals) are small, reversible, clinically insignificant, and independent of the patient population studied, and patients are asymptomatic during these changes. ECG changes are most prominent 1–2 hours after a dose of dolasetron, ondansetron, and granisetron and return to baseline within 24 hours. Clinically important adverse cardiovascular events associated with these changes are rare. No serious cardiac events (including torsade de pointes) arising from ECG interval changes have been attributed to 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist use.

Conclusions

Clinical data demonstrate that ECG interval changes are a class effect of the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. Theoretical concern regarding cardiovascular adverse events with these agents is not supported by clinical experience. The significant benefits of these agents outweigh the theoretical small risk of meaningful cardiovascular events.
