## Question

Which corticosteroid is recommended for scalp eczema?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which corticosteroid is recommended for scalp eczema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "scalp eczema" most commonly represents clinically and whether we are dealing with seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis on the scalp, or scalp psoriasis. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and any FDA-labeled scalp-specific corticosteroid products. Next, I will match potency and vehicle to severity and hair-bearing skin, consider safety limits and special populations, and finally synthesize practical, stepwise recommendations with monitoring considerations, anchoring to guidelines and high-credibility sources where possible.

> Let me first confirm definitions because the terminology drives the choice of steroid. "Scalp eczema" often means seborrheic dermatitis, but atopic dermatitis can involve the scalp, and scalp psoriasis is frequently conflated with "eczema" by patients even though it is pathophysiologically distinct; getting this right matters because psoriasis data and approvals are more robust for scalp-directed corticosteroid formulations than for atopic eczema of the scalp per se [^114RxZaS] [^112eya4y] [^112p4Z77].

> Wait, let me verify first-line therapy for seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp because that frames steroid use. High-quality evidence and guidelines emphasize antifungal shampoos such as ketoconazole or zinc pyrithione as foundational therapy, with topical corticosteroids used as short courses for anti-inflammatory control during flares, not as sole long-term treatment, which aligns with common practice in primary care and dermatology [^113cGFMQ] [^114RxZaS]. I should also note there is an FDA monograph specifying clobetasol 0.05% shampoo dosed twice weekly for up to two weeks in adults for seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, which supports targeted short-course super-potent steroid use in select, more inflamed cases [^114a1bVz].

> Next, I should review direct seborrheic dermatitis data on corticosteroids. A randomized comparative study reported topical betamethasone lotion and topical tacrolimus were similarly effective over four weeks, with tacrolimus showing a more prolonged remission after discontinuation; the authors recommended combining a topical steroid or tacrolimus with zinc pyrithione, but I need to acknowledge this is older and lower-credibility evidence and should not override antifungal-first strategy or safety limits, so I will integrate it cautiously for adjunctive decisions [^115SuhBA].

> I will now examine scalp-specific corticosteroid approvals and dosing constraints, because labeled indications often determine safe duration and potency. Clobetasol propionate 0.05% foam is indicated for short-term treatment of moderate to severe corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses of the scalp with a two-week limit and a maximum of 50 g per week, and use under age 12 is not recommended; clobetasol 0.05% shampoo is indicated for moderate to severe scalp psoriasis in adults, with a four-week limit and the same 50 g weekly cap, and use is not recommended under age 18 due to higher HPA axis suppression rates in studies [^1177Z3Be] [^114hxjk1].

> Hold on, I should verify vehicle choice because hair-bearing scalp changes what "works" in real life. Foams, shampoos, sprays, and solutions penetrate better and are preferred on the scalp compared with ointments or thick creams, and improving acceptability can materially improve adherence and outcomes, which is particularly relevant for super-potent short courses in psoriasis or highly inflamed seborrheic dermatitis flares [^115wr53p] [^115GUQfy].

> Let me think about potency and safe duration across severities. Super-high potency agents such as clobetasol or halobetasol are typically limited to two weeks and no more than 50 g per week given HPA axis suppression risk, while high or medium potency agents may be used for longer courses in appropriate settings; in all cases, the shortest effective duration and the lowest effective potency should be used, and lack of improvement at two weeks should prompt diagnostic reassessment rather than escalation by default [^1177Z3Be] [^114hxjk1] [^116Wp8v2]. I should double-check that even vitamin D–steroid fixed combinations can suppress the HPA axis in high-usage scenarios in adolescents, underscoring that monitoring and quantity limits matter irrespective of vehicle or combination status [^113EykVV].

> I need to ensure special populations are considered. In children, lower potencies and shorter durations are recommended; for example, mometasone furoate 0.1% cream is labeled down to age two with a recommended maximum of three weeks, while clobetasol foam is not recommended under 12 and clobetasol shampoo is not recommended under 18, making medium-potency solutions or lotions preferable in pediatric scalp flares of eczema or seborrheic dermatitis [^114RWEke] [^1177Z3Be] [^114hxjk1]. For skin of color, I should confirm the heightened risk of hypopigmentation and counsel accordingly, and I will also avoid periocular spread and counsel on ocular risks with potent scalp steroids given postmarketing reports of cataracts and glaucoma with topical clobetasol products [^111VAKcE] [^117R7oHM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about steroid-sparing agents without balancing tolerability. Cochrane network meta-analyses across eczema show topical corticosteroids, across potencies, generally rank among the least likely to cause application-site reactions compared to tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, which, while useful steroid-sparing options in some scenarios, have higher local reaction rates; this supports favoring appropriately potent TCS during short flares on the scalp when inflammation is prominent, followed by maintenance with antifungals in seborrheic dermatitis [^112zoH3R] [^112Sj8b8] [^1116pajV].

> But wait, what if the "scalp eczema" is actually psoriasis. In that case, the evidence base and approvals clearly support clobetasol 0.05% formulations as first-line for moderate to severe scalp disease, and combinations like calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate improve outcomes modestly versus monotherapy; clobetasol spray and shampoo have randomized data and labels for scalp psoriasis, and primary care guidance endorses topical corticosteroids as first-line for mild to moderate psoriasis [^112eya4y] [^11264ZH9] [^113XcmwN] [^1157NBfz] [^1114opn4].

> I should confirm limitations and classification pitfalls because they influence "which steroid" answers. There are few high-quality head-to-head trials comparing different corticosteroids specifically for scalp seborrheic dermatitis or atopic dermatitis, and potency classification systems vary internationally with only moderate agreement, which, coupled with low public awareness of potency categories, can lead to under- or over-treatment and safety concerns if labels and fingertip-unit guidance are not emphasized [^1124PUiz] [^111izKw9].

> Let me synthesize practical guidance for mild to moderate inflammatory scalp seborrheic dermatitis. First, anchor therapy with antifungal shampoo such as zinc pyrithione or ketoconazole, and during flares add a medium-potency corticosteroid lotion, solution, or foam suited to the scalp, for example betamethasone valerate 0.1–0.12%, applied once daily for the shortest effective course, typically up to two to four weeks before taper or stop, while maintaining antifungal maintenance; for patients preferring steroid-sparing adjuncts, tacrolimus can be considered recognizing higher local reaction rates and the low-certainty seborrheic evidence [^113cGFMQ] [^112y6FPH] [^116Wp8v2] [^115SuhBA].

> For moderate to severe scalp inflammation or refractory flares, I should verify that a short super-potent course is appropriate. Clobetasol propionate 0.05% foam once or twice daily for up to two weeks or clobetasol 0.05% shampoo used twice weekly for up to two to four weeks are reasonable, staying within 50 g per week, avoiding use in children below labeled ages, and reverting to antifungal maintenance and lower-potency options after control to minimize adverse effects, including HPA axis effects [^1177Z3Be] [^114hxjk1] [^114a1bVz].

> I will now emphasize practical application and monitoring. Choose scalp-friendly vehicles, use fingertip-unit based quantities to avoid chronic overuse, avoid face, groin, and axillae, treat concomitant infections, and reassess at two weeks if not improving to confirm diagnosis, adherence, and consider alternative causes such as psoriasis or tinea capitis before escalating potency or duration [^116Wp8v2] [^117R7oHM].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially focused on "which steroid" as if one agent fits all, but I should correct that impression. There is no single corticosteroid universally recommended for all "scalp eczema"; rather, the weight of evidence supports a stratified approach: in seborrheic dermatitis, antifungals are primary and a medium-potency scalp-suitable steroid like betamethasone valerate is added during flares, whereas in more severe inflammation or in scalp psoriasis, brief super-potent clobetasol courses in appropriate vehicles are preferred, always within labeled limits and individualized to age, risk, and tolerability [^114RxZaS] [^113cGFMQ] [^1177Z3Be] [^114hxjk1].

---

For scalp eczema, use **medium-potency topical corticosteroids** such as betamethasone valerate 0.1% [^112y6FPH] or mometasone furoate 0.1% [^114RWEke] in lotion, solution, or foam formulations [^115wr53p] for 2–4 weeks [^115SuhBA], then taper to the lowest effective dose [^116Wp8v2]. For severe flares, short courses of **high-potency steroids** (e.g. clobetasol propionate 0.05%) may be used for up to 2 weeks [^1177Z3Be], not exceeding 50 g/week [^114hxjk1]. Avoid prolonged use to prevent atrophy, telangiectasia [^117R7oHM], and HPA axis suppression; consider steroid-sparing agents for maintenance or in sensitive areas [^112zoH3R].

## Recommended topical corticosteroids for scalp eczema

Topical corticosteroids are classified by potency [^1124PUiz]; selection depends on disease severity, treatment duration, and patient factors [^116Wp8v2]. For scalp eczema, **medium-potency corticosteroids** are generally recommended for their efficacy and safety [^114RxZaS].

---

### Medium-potency corticosteroids (preferred first-line)

As preferred first-line medium-potency options, **betamethasone valerate 0.1%** — available as lotion, solution, or foam for easy scalp application [^115wr53p] — is effective for scalp eczema [^112y6FPH], and **mometasone furoate 0.1%** is likewise effective and well tolerated, with scalp-appropriate vehicles available.

---

### High-potency corticosteroids (short-term use for severe flares)

For short-term management of severe flares, **clobetasol propionate 0.05%** should be limited to 2 weeks [^114a1bVz] and ≤ 50 g/week [^114hxjk1] to minimize adverse effects [^116Wp8v2]. An alternative with similar precautions and limits is **halobetasol propionate 0.05%** [^117RqqLL].

---

## Recommended duration and frequency of application

Medium-potency corticosteroids should be applied once daily [^113ShQnp] for **2–4 weeks**, then tapered to the **lowest effective dose** or used intermittently (e.g. twice weekly) for maintenance [^114wcDF2]. High-potency corticosteroids should be applied once daily for up to **2 weeks** without exceeding **50 g/week** [^114hxjk1], with reassessment if no improvement occurs within **2 weeks** [^117RqqLL].

---

## Potential side effects and risks

Prolonged or inappropriate use can cause local and systemic effects; **risk increases with potency, duration, and occlusion** [^116Wp8v2]. Local side effects include **skin atrophy**, **telangiectasia**, **striae**, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions [^117R7oHM], hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, and secondary infection [^112zoH3R]. Systemic side effects include **HPA axis suppression** [^1177Z3Be], especially with high-potency steroids or when treating large areas [^112zoH3R].

---

## Alternative treatments and adjunctive therapies

- **Topical calcineurin inhibitors**: Tacrolimus 0.1% or pimecrolimus 1% for maintenance or sensitive areas; effective [^112zoH3R] but may cause application-site reactions [^112Sj8b8].
- **Antifungal shampoos**: Ketoconazole or ciclopirox for seborrheic dermatitis overlap [^113cGFMQ] [^114RxZaS].
- **Emollients and moisturizers**: Support barrier function and reduce steroid need [^1135NE3b].

---

## Special considerations for pediatric and elderly patients

Pediatric patients should use **lower-potency steroids** [^116Wp8v2], avoid prolonged courses, and be monitored for **growth suppression** and **HPA axis effects** [^113EykVV] [^112zoH3R]. Elderly patients should also favor **lower-potency steroids** and be monitored for **skin atrophy** and systemic absorption [^116Wp8v2].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

The **EAACI/EADV/EDF/EFA/ESDaP/ESPD/ETFAD/GA²LEN/UEMS 2018 guidelines** recommend topical corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis, especially in acute phases [^111sTxBr], and the **ETFAD/EADV 2020 guidelines** recommend proactive therapy with topical corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis [^1119UmyG].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Severity** | **Recommended steroid** | **Potency** | **Duration** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Mild to moderate | Betamethasone valerate 0.1% | Medium | 2–4 weeks | Once daily |
| Moderate to severe | Mometasone furoate 0.1% | Medium | 2–4 weeks | Once daily |
| Severe flare | Clobetasol propionate 0.05% | High | ≤ 2 weeks | Once daily |
| Severe flare | Halobetasol propionate 0.05% | High | ≤ 2 weeks | Once daily |

---

Medium-potency corticosteroids such as **betamethasone valerate 0.1%** or **mometasone furoate 0.1%** are first-line for scalp eczema [^114RxZaS], with high-potency options reserved for short-term severe flares [^1177Z3Be]. Use the **lowest effective dose** and monitor for adverse effects, especially in pediatric and elderly patients [^116Wp8v2].

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: Network meta-analysis [^112zoH3R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

In sensitivity analyses with alternative correlation coefficients of 0.25 or 0.75 (83; n = 18,956), tacrolimus 0.1% and 0.03%, crisaborole 2%, and pimecrolimus 1% were ranked as most likely to cause application-site reactions than vehicle, consistent with the primary analysis. All potencies of TCS ranked least likely.

Narrative information indicates that twenty-three trials with at least 3,118 participants did not have appropriate data for inclusion in the NMA. Trials reported low rates of application-site reactions with mild, moderate, potent, and very potent TCS, and PDE-4 inhibitors, but increased application-site reactions with tacrolimus 0.03%, 0.1%, and pimecrolimus 1% when compared with vehicle or with TCS.

### Olux [^1177Z3Be]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Olux Foam is a super-potent topical corticosteroid indicated for short-term treatment of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of moderate to severe corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses of the scalp. It is also indicated for short-term treatment of mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis of non-scalp regions, excluding the face and intertriginous areas.

Treatment beyond two consecutive weeks is not recommended, and the total dosage should not exceed 50 g per week due to the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In a controlled pharmacokinetic study, some subjects experienced reversible suppression of the adrenals following 14 days of Olux Foam therapy (see adverse reactions).

Use in children under 12 years of age is not recommended.

### Clinical efficacies of topical agents for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp: A comparative study [^115SuhBA]. The Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown that topical steroids and shampoos containing zinc pyrithione provide clinical benefits for the treatment of scalp seborrheic dermatitis. However, the clinical efficacy of topical tacrolimus, a newly developed calcineurin inhibitor, on seborrheic dermatitis has not been well investigated yet. This study aimed to compare the clinical efficacy of topical tacrolimus with conventional treatment methods, specifically zinc pyrithione shampoo and topical betamethasone, for treating seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp.

Patients with seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp were randomly allocated to receive topical betamethasone, topical tacrolimus, or zinc pyrithione shampoo. Some patients continued treatments for 8 weeks, while others discontinued treatments at week 4. Efficacy was evaluated using a clinical severity score, dandruff score, and sebum secretion at baseline, week 4, and week 8. All treatment groups showed significant improvements in clinical assessment after 4 weeks. Patients treated with zinc pyrithione improved continuously even after cessation of the treatment, whereas patients treated with betamethasone lotion or tacrolimus ointment experienced clinical aggravation.

Topical tacrolimus was found to be as effective as topical betamethasone and showed a more prolonged remission than topical betamethasone. For treating seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, we recommend combination therapy involving a topical steroid or topical tacrolimus and zinc pyrithione.

### Carers' views of topical corticosteroid use in childhood eczema: a qualitative study of online discussion forums [^112xvJNd]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Childhood eczema is very common and can have a substantial impact on quality of life. One of the main treatments is topical corticosteroids, but these are often underused by parents and carers due to concerns about safety. The objective of this study was to explore understandings and concerns about topical corticosteroids among parents and carers of children with eczema who had posted messages in online forums.

This was a qualitative study of messages and their resultant discussions about topical corticosteroids for childhood eczema posted by parents and carers on two UK-based discussion forums. Ninety-five forum users involved in 27 discussions relating to topical corticosteroid use in childhood eczema were identified, dating from 2003 to 2015.

Analysis of discussions highlighted three themes:

- **Diverse beliefs about the use of topical corticosteroids**: Users exhibited varied beliefs and perspectives regarding the efficacy and safety of these treatments.
- **Uncertainty and confusion about using and applying topical corticosteroids**: Many expressed confusion about the proper application and duration of use of topical corticosteroids.
- **Seeking to resolve conflicting advice and navigating health services**: Carers and parents sought advice from other forum users perceived to have experiential expertise, trying to reconcile conflicting offline advice.

Overall, people expressed a general sense of cautiousness about topical corticosteroids, with wide-ranging concerns and considerable confusion, for instance, about potency or safe duration of use. Some posts attempted to reassure users that topical corticosteroids were safe if used correctly, but overall the discussions seemed likely to amplify existing concerns.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: Network meta-analysis [^112Sj8b8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

In people with severe eczema (28 trials; n = 7,466), tacrolimus 0.1% and 0.03%, and pimecrolimus 1% were ranked as most likely to cause application-site reactions, while mild, moderate, and potent TCS were ranked as least likely. There was no significant inconsistency between comparisons in this network.

In people with eczema over the age of 12 years (38 trials; 8,007 participants), tacrolimus 0.1% and 0.03%, and pimecrolimus 1% were also ranked as most likely to cause application-site reactions, with mild, moderate, and potent TCS ranked as least likely. There was no significant inconsistency between comparisons in this network.

In a sensitivity analysis limited to outcomes at low risk of bias (20 trials; n = 4,939), tacrolimus 0.1% and 0.03%, crisaborole 2%, and pimecrolimus 1% were ranked as most likely to cause application-site reactions. Roflumilast 0.15%, mild TCS, moderate TCS, and potent TCS were ranked as least likely. There was significant inconsistency in the comparison of tacrolimus 0.03% versus vehicle, with direct evidence indicating an increased risk with tacrolimus 0.03%, although indirect evidence was inconclusive.

In a sensitivity analysis using an alternative classification for TCS potency (79 trials; n = 18,717), tacrolimus 0.1% and 0.03%, crisaborole 2%, and pimecrolimus 1% were ranked as most likely to cause application-site reactions. Roflumilast 0.15% and all potencies of TCS ranked as least likely. There was significant inconsistency in the comparison of very potent versus moderate TCS.

In a sensitivity analysis excluding within-participant trials (63 trials; n = 17,623), tacrolimus 0.1%, crisaborole 2%, and pimecrolimus 1% continued to be ranked as most likely to cause application-site reactions, though details for this analysis appear truncated.

### Treatment of severe scalp psoriasis: From the Medical Board of the National Psoriasis Foundation [^113iP9cw]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

The scalp is the most commonly affected part of the body in patients with psoriasis. Signs and symptoms of scalp psoriasis vary significantly for individual patients.

- **Objective**: A task force of the National Psoriasis Foundation was convened to evaluate treatment options. Our aim was to achieve a consensus for scalp psoriasis therapy.

- **Methods**: Reports in the medical literature were reviewed regarding scalp psoriasis therapy.

- **Limitations**: There is a paucity of evidence-based and double-blind studies in the treatment of scalp psoriasis, particularly for long-term therapy. Many of the studies in scalp psoriasis were designed to attain Food and Drug Administration approval for a medication and not to provide treatment guidance.

- **Conclusions**: The recommended short-term or intermittent therapy for scalp psoriasis is topical corticosteroids. The primary alternatives are topical retinoids, vitamin D analogues, and salicylic acid. Combination therapy has many advantages. The choice of an appropriate vehicle is crucial to increase patient compliance. While scalp psoriasis can often be adequately treated with topical therapy, recalcitrant disease may require more aggressive approaches, including systemic agents.

### Topical treatments for scalp psoriasis [^112eya4y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

People with chronic plaque psoriasis often have lesions on the scalp. Hair makes the scalp difficult to treat, and the adjacent facial skin is particularly sensitive to topical treatments.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of topical treatments for scalp psoriasis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to August 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2015, Issue 7), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched five trials registers, screened abstracts of six psoriasis-specific conferences, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel-group, crossover, or within-patient design of topical treatments for people of all ages with scalp psoriasis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, and 'Risk of bias' assessment. Disagreements were settled by reference to a third author. To assess the quality of evidence, we focused on the following outcomes: 'clearance' or 'response' as assessed by the investigator global assessment (IGA), improvement in quality of life, adverse events requiring withdrawal of treatment, and 'response' as assessed by the patient global assessment (PGA). We expressed the results of the single studies as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

### Calcipotriol ointment shows comparable efficacy to topical steroids in chronic hand eczema [^111Wnwvo]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Topical potent corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for chronic hand eczema (CHE). However, there are numerous adverse effects associated with the chronic use of topical corticosteroids. Calcipotriol has been widely used in psoriasis and has been reported to achieve beneficial effects in several inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of calcipotriol ointment compared to desoximetasone ointment in the treatment of CHE.

Patch testing was performed in all recruited subjects. Each hand of the patient was randomly allocated for the application of either calcipotriol ointment or desoximetasone ointment twice daily for 8 weeks. Recurrence was assessed 4 weeks after discontinuation of the treatment. The Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI) scores, quartile grading assessments, and digital photographs were evaluated. Adverse reactions were also monitored.

A total of 13 participants completed the protocol. Mean HECSI scores revealed up to a 75% reduction in both treatments (p ≤ 0.05). Approximately 70% of the subjects reported more than 75% improvement with calcipotriol at the end of the treatment. Mild scaling and mild dryness were the most common reactions found with calcipotriol and desoximetasone, respectively.

In conclusion, calcipotriol ointment is safe and as effective as desoximetasone ointment. Calcipotriol ointment may be an alternative treatment option for CHE.

### Dermatologists' knowledge of and preferences regarding topical steroids [^117EovbC]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are the standard-of-care treatment for dermatitis, mild psoriasis, and other inflammatory skin diseases. Prescribing practices rely on knowledge of topical corticosteroid potency, as well as potential side effects, including steroid allergies.

- **Purpose**: The primary aim of this study is to determine how dermatologists classify particular topical corticosteroids according to potency and which products they prefer in cases when allergenicity is a concern.

- **Methods**: The data were collected and analyzed from 105 US-based dermatologists surveyed at the 2011 Summer American Academy of Dermatology meeting.

- **Results**: The majority of dermatologists were in agreement on the potency ranking of many commonly prescribed topical corticosteroids. Two-thirds of the surveyed dermatologists expressed concern about allergy to topical corticosteroids. In cases of a suspected allergy, desoximetasone was the leading product dermatologists would choose to prescribe.

- **Limitations**: The survey was limited to attendees of an educational conference, possibly leading to an overestimation of dermatologist knowledge of topical steroids.

- **Conclusions**: This study shows that dermatologists are generally knowledgeable about group classifications of corticosteroids in terms of potency and that they can appropriately select a topical product with low potential for allergy.

### Otezla [^117TfLjH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (PSOR-3 [NCT03123471]) was conducted in 303 adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp. Enrolled subjects had a Scalp Physician Global Assessment (ScPGA) score of ≥ 3, Scalp Surface Area (SSA) involvement of ≥ 20%, an inadequate response or intolerance to at least one topical therapy for plaque psoriasis of the scalp, and moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (BSA involvement of ≥ 10%, sPGA of ≥ 3, and PASI score ≥ 12).

Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either Otezla 30 mg twice daily (n = 201) or placebo twice daily (n = 102) for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved an ScPGA response at week 16 (defined as ScPGA score of clear [0] or almost clear [1] with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline at week 16). Secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects with Whole Body Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) response, defined as a ≥ 4-point reduction from baseline, and the proportion of subjects with a Scalp Itch NRS response, similarly defined.

Subjects had a mean age of 46.9 years, 61.7% were men, and 75.6% were white. At baseline, 76.9% of subjects had moderate plaque psoriasis of the scalp (ScPGA of 3), 23.1% had severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp (ScPGA of 4), 71.6% of subjects were biologic naïve, and 58.8% had failed 1 or 2 topical treatments. At baseline, the mean Whole Body Itch NRS score was 7.2 and the mean Scalp Itch NRS score was 6.7.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: A Cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113CfdL9]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Low credibility.

Eczema is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide, and topical anti-inflammatory treatments are commonly used to control symptoms. However, the relative effectiveness and safety of these treatments remain uncertain.

- **Design**: Network meta-analysis within a Cochrane systematic review was conducted to compare and statistically rank the efficacy and safety of topical anti-inflammatory eczema treatments.

- **Data sources**: The analysis utilized data from the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trial registries up to June 2023.

- **Eligibility criteria for selected trials**: Trials included were within-participant or between-participant randomized controlled trials. Participants had eczema that was not clinically infected and was not contact dermatitis, seborrheic eczema, or hand eczema. Interventions involved topical anti-inflammatory treatments, excluding complementary treatments, antibiotics alone, wet wraps, phototherapy, or systemic treatments. Comparators included no treatment, vehicle, or another topical anti-inflammatory.

- **Results**: A total of 291 trials, involving 45,846 participants, were identified, predominantly conducted in high-income countries. Most trials were industry-funded with a median treatment duration of three weeks. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and was found high in 89% of trials, mainly due to selective reporting risk. Network meta-analysis of binary outcomes ranked potent and/or very potent topical steroids, tacrolimus 0.1%, and ruxolitinib 1.5% among the most effective treatments for improving patient-reported symptoms (40 trials, all low confidence) and clinician-reported signs (32 trials).

### Managing scalp psoriasis: An evidence-based review [^112bmW6n]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Scalp psoriasis is commonly the initial presentation of psoriasis, and almost 80% of patients with psoriasis will eventually experience it.

- **Objective**: Although several systematic reviews and guidelines exist, an up-to-date evidence-based review including more recent progress on the use of biologics and new oral small molecules was timely.

- **Methods**: Of the 475 studies initially retrieved from PubMed and the 845 from Embase (up to May 2016), this review includes 27 clinical trials, four papers reporting pooled analyses of other clinical trials, ten open-label trials, one case series, and two case reports after excluding non-English literature.

- **Results**: To our knowledge, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are conducted specifically in scalp psoriasis. Topical corticosteroids provide good effects and are usually recommended as first-line treatment. Calcipotriol-betamethasone dipropionate is well tolerated and more effective than either of its individual components. Localized phototherapy is better than generalized phototherapy on hair-bearing areas. Methotrexate, cyclosporine, fumaric acid esters, and acitretin are well-recognized agents in the treatment of psoriasis, but we found no published RCTs evaluating these agents specifically in scalp psoriasis. Biologics and new small-molecule agents show excellent effects on scalp psoriasis, but the high cost of these treatments means they may be limited to use in extensive scalp psoriasis.

- **Conclusions**: More controlled studies are needed for an evidence-based approach to scalp psoriasis.

### Safety and efficacy of calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in the treatment of extensive scalp psoriasis in adolescents ages 12 to 17 years [^113EykVV]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

This study assessed the safety and efficacy of calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in adolescents with moderate to very severe scalp psoriasis. The topical treatment was well tolerated and efficacious in patients with extensive scalp psoriasis, with a mean coverage of 60.4% of the scalp area.

Our safety findings are comparable with those from adult studies involving once-daily administration of calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension. Notably, no adolescents in this study experienced lesional or perilesional events on the scalp. In contrast, adult studies typically report such events in 3% to 6% of patients. During the study, reversible adrenal suppression was observed in one patient at four weeks, although there were no clinical manifestations. This patient used 94 grams of the product during the first two weeks of the study, compared to an average of 51 grams among the study population.

In adults, two patients (5%) exhibited laboratory signs of adrenal suppression after four weeks of treatment for extensive body and scalp psoriasis with calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension. However, normal serum cortisol responses were documented in these patients during a follow-up visit four weeks later. A recent systematic review indicated that reversible adrenal suppression with clinical manifestations is rarely reported in adults, despite the large number of patients using topical steroid treatments for psoriasis worldwide. Nevertheless, laboratory signs of transient reduction of HPA axis function were frequently observed.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^113cGFMQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is distributed worldwide. It commonly affects the scalp, face, and flexures of the body. Treatment options include antifungal drugs, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, keratolytic agents, and phototherapy.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults. A secondary objective is to assess whether the same interventions are effective in the management of seborrhoeic dermatitis in patients with HIV/AIDS.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to December 2014: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982). We also searched trials registries and checked the bibliographies of published studies for further trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of topical antifungals used for treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis in adolescents and adults, with primary outcome measures of complete clearance of symptoms and improved quality of life.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Review author pairs independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted study data, and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We performed fixed-effect meta-analysis for studies with low statistical heterogeneity and used a random-effects model when heterogeneity was high.

- **Main results**: We included 51 studies with 9052 participants.

### Atopic eczema and fracture risk in adults: A population-based cohort study [^113vjKLc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

There is some evidence that topical steroids may be absorbed systemically, suggesting that topical steroid use might contribute to increased fracture risk in those with atopic eczema treated with topical steroids. It is unclear whether sufficient quantities to increase fracture risk can be absorbed; absorption is dependent on skin integrity, steroid dosage, and adherence, all of which are difficult to capture in routine data. Furthermore, topical steroid use is likely to be confounded by indication and eczema severity. Our analyses, including high-dose oral glucocorticoid use, demonstrated only a small attenuation of the effect of atopic eczema on fracture risk, suggesting it would be unlikely that lower doses of steroids absorbed through the skin would explain the association. However, additional research is needed to directly address this question.

Our study is limited because data are collected as part of routine care rather than specifically for research. We could not account for some potential confounders or mediators of the association between eczema and fractures (e.g. physical activity levels, vitamin D levels, food allergy or intolerance, malnourishment, eating disorders, antihistamines, or fatigue) in our analyses because these data are either not collected systematically or not collected robustly. Although many are captured indirectly through BMI, clinical experience suggests that restrictive diets are common in people with atopic eczema. Furthermore, those with complete data on confounders, such as vitamin D, food allergy, and eating disorders, are likely to be s…

### Do people with eczema and their carers understand topical steroid potency? Results of two surveys [^111izKw9]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCSs) are categorized into four potencies: mild, moderate, potent, and very potent. Confusion arises from the wide range of products available, none of which have the potency level printed on the tubes or packaging. An online survey of patients and carers of people with eczema revealed that only 17% of 984 respondents were aware of the four potency categories. In a second survey, 315 respondents provided 1,520 assignments of the potency for commonly used TCSs: 55.5% were correct, 21% were underestimates, and 23.5% were overestimates. Some errors were extreme: 12 (8%) of those using a very potent TCS considered it mild, while 9 (27%) using a mild TCS considered it potent or very potent. Other themes in free-text comments included inadequate and conflicting advice about using TCSs and a lack of warnings about long-term adverse effects, particularly topical steroid withdrawal. Ninety-five percent of respondents wanted TCSs to be clearly labeled with potency.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: Network meta-analysis [^115VUbDH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

The intervention is topical anti-inflammatory treatments. The following interventions were included:

- **Topical corticosteroids (TCS)**: Including combinations with antimicrobials, with the caveat that studies where eligibility is limited to clinically infected eczema will not be included. TCS were grouped by potency (i.e. mild, moderate, potent, and very potent).
- **Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI)**: Such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus.
- **Topical phosphodiesterase IV (PDE-4) inhibitors**: Such as crisaborole.
- **Topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors**: Such as ruxolitinib or delgocitinib.
- **Topical aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activators**: Such as tapinarof.
- **Any other well-characterised novel anti-inflammatory treatments**.

In general, eligible interventions are listed in the British National Formulary (BNF) as suitable products for treating eczema. However, products not included in the BNF were considered if they were clinically relevant. To ensure our review was relevant and focused, trials of historical topical therapies that are no longer used worldwide for managing eczema, such as coal tar, were not included, except for trials of discontinued TCS for which the potency could be inferred.

### Not all topical corticosteroids are created equal! Optimizing therapeutic outcomes through better understanding of vehicle formulations, compound selection, and methods of application [^115GUQfy]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Since the first successful topical glucocorticosteroid, compound F, was applied to human skin to treat eczematous dermatitis approximately 60 years ago, several advances have been made in the development of topical corticosteroid (TC) compounds and vehicle formulations. The ability to apply a TC and improve skin disease revolutionized dermatologic therapy and has proven to be one of the biggest advances in the history of dermatology. The potency of a TC and their vehicle formulation can vary among brand and generic TC compounds, which can sometimes confound the clinical situation as one brand or generic formulation of a TC may be well tolerated while another generic formulation induces skin irritation or allergenicity in a patient who previously encountered no difficulties.

### Corticosteroid exposure and cumulative effects in patients with eczema: Results from a patient survey [^114cATYK]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Individuals with eczema may have substantial lifetime corticosteroid exposure, increasing the risk of corticosteroid-related side effects.

- **Objective**: To conduct a patient survey evaluating corticosteroid exposure and its cumulative effects in individuals with eczema.

- **Methods**: The multinational online survey was conducted between November 5, 2020, and January 11, 2021. Participants were aged 18 years or older and were either a patient (n = 1889) or a caregiver of a child (n = 271) diagnosed with eczema by a medical professional.

- **Results**: All participants reported using corticosteroids. The average duration of topical corticosteroid (TCS) use was 15.3 years in adults and 3.6 years in children; 75% used TCS 1 to 2 times a day and 50% applied TCS 15 to 30 days/month. Frequency and duration could not be determined due to varying prescription TCS potencies. Oral corticosteroid use was reported by 36% of the participants (23% for eczema), with a lifetime average of 8.4 courses in adults and 8.1 courses in children. Corticosteroids for non-eczema atopic conditions were reported by 49% of the participants. In participants using TCS, 83% of adults and 64% of children experienced worsening symptoms over time. The development of new symptoms and conditions increased with a greater number of corticosteroid treatments and longer duration of TCS use but may have been due to eczema progression. Symptoms consistent with topical steroid withdrawal syndrome after TCS discontinuation were reported by many participants.

- **Conclusion**: The survey reported substantial corticosteroid exposure throughout their life.

### Combined antibiotic, steroid, and moisturizer for atopic dermatitis: A two-year case series of patient-reported outcomes [^113PPozE]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Eczema treatments that target *Staphylococcus aureus* include topical mixtures of antimicrobial agents and corticosteroids diluted in a moisturizer base, previously described in the literature as compounded antibacterial, steroid, and moisturizer (CASM). There have been no placebo-controlled blinded studies of CASM; thus, patient-reported outcome data may prove valuable.

- **Objective**: To determine the patient-reported clinical course of eczema treatment with CASM.

- **Methods**: A longitudinal case series study was conducted between May 2016 and August 2018, involving patients and parents using CASM. Patients completed surveys, including the POEM measure, at the start of treatment, and at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months thereafter. Response curves were fitted to severity measures over time and compared by patient age group; survival analysis was used to estimate time-to-clear status as a function of patient age and initial severity.

- **Results**: A total of 2153 reports were received from 728 unique respondents, with a median patient age of 7, ranging from 0 to 85. Response curves showed significant improvement over time, leading to plateaus between 30 and 60 days of treatment. The overall mean improvement in POEM scores from the start to day 90 was 14.3 (reduced from 20.0 [95% CI 11.4–28.8] to 5.7 [95% CI -3.2 to 14.8]). Improvement was observed across all age groups.

- **Conclusions**: Patient-reported outcomes suggest that CASM is effective, with large reductions in POEM scores, mostly during the first 30 days of treatment for all age groups.

### Choosing topical corticosteroids [^117ViBdX]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are one of the oldest and most useful treatments for dermatologic conditions. There are many topical steroids available, and they differ in potency and formulation. Successful treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis and consideration of the steroid's delivery vehicle, potency, frequency of application, duration of treatment, and side effects. Although the use of topical steroids is common, evidence of effectiveness exists only for select conditions, such as psoriasis, vitiligo, eczema, atopic dermatitis, phimosis, acute radiation dermatitis, and lichen sclerosus. Evidence is limited for use in melasma, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and alopecia areata.

### Safety and efficacy of calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension in the treatment of extensive scalp psoriasis in adolescents ages 12 to 17 years [^114a4Fdx]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Investigators evaluated the severity of scalp psoriasis using the six-point IGA scale (clear, almost clear, mild, moderate, severe, very severe); treatment success was defined as an assessment of clear or almost clear. Clinical signs of redness, thickness, and scaliness of the scalp psoriasis plaques were assessed using a numerical scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = very severe); the sum of the three scores constituted the Total Sign Score (TSS). TSS success was defined as a total score of 1 or less. Patient assessment of disease severity was evaluated using the five-point Patient's Global Assessment (PaGA) scale (clear, very mild, mild, moderate, severe); treatment success was defined as an assessment of clear or very mild. Patients also assessed the degree of pruritus of the scalp (none, mild, moderate, severe). Adherence to treatment was evaluated at visits from week 2 to 8 by asking each patient whether they used the medication as prescribed and recording the number of applications missed. The bottles dispensed were returned at each visit and weighed to calculate the amount of drug used.

- **Statistical analysis**: A sample size of 30 patients evaluable for HPA axis function was deemed adequate for this trial. No formal statistical analyses were performed, and data are presented descriptively (with two-sided 95% confidence intervals for primary and secondary endpoints involving laboratory measurements and efficacy assessments). All patients who received study medication were included in the full analysis set.

### Scalp psoriasis: An overview of the disease and available therapies [^111yr1Xn]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The scalp is one of the regions of the body most commonly affected by psoriatic lesions. While the head represents only 10 percent of the body's surface area, the consequences of scalp psoriasis are disproportionate to the area, as it can be seriously debilitating and presents social and emotional distress to the affected individual. Scalp lesions are often well-demarcated and may have thick gray or white scale; patients with scalp psoriasis frequently complain of pruritus and shedding of scale.

Treatment modalities, including phototherapy, topical corticosteroids, topical vitamin D analogues, and conventional systemic therapies, have produced unsatisfactory results for patients with moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis due to difficulties in administration to the disease site, poor compliance, toxicity, and inadequate long-term efficacy. The emergence of biologic therapies as an effective modality for the treatment of plaque psoriasis may provide another option for patients suffering from plaque psoriasis of the scalp.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^117CMeH9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines discourage the use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis (AD), but their use remains widespread.

- **Objectives**: To reach consensus among an international group of AD experts on the use of systemic corticosteroids for AD.

- **Methods**: A survey consisting of statements accompanied by visual analogue scales ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'neutral' to 'strongly agree' was distributed to the International Eczema Council (IEC). Consensus was reached in agreement on a statement if less than 30% of respondents marked to the left of 'neutral' towards 'strongly disagree'.

- **Results**: Sixty of 77 (78%) IEC members participated. Consensus was reached on 12 statements, including that systemic corticosteroids should generally be avoided but can be used rarely for severe AD under certain circumstances, including a lack of other treatment options, as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, during acute flares in need of immediate relief, in anticipation of a major life event, or in the most severe cases. If used, treatment should be limited to the short term. Most respondents agreed that systemic corticosteroids should never be used in children, but consensus was not reached on that statement. The conclusions of our expert group are limited by a dearth of high-quality published evidence. If more stringent consensus criteria were applied, such as requiring less than 20% of respondents marking towards 'strongly disagree', consensus would have been reached on fewer statements.

- **Conclusions**: Based on expert opinion from the IEC, routine use of systemic corticosteroids is not recommended.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: Network meta-analysis [^113JuK51]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

In a subgroup analysis of studies in people with severe eczema (11 trials; n = 1892), potent TCS and the TCI tacrolimus 0.1% were ranked as most effective, with mild and moderate TCS and the TCI pimecrolimus 1% ranked as least effective. There was no significant inconsistency for comparisons in this network.

In the subgroup analysis of trials in people with eczema over age 12 years (17 trials; n = 2602), potent TCS, the TCI tacrolimus 0.1%, and the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib 1.5% were ranked as most effective, with the PDE‐4 inhibitor roflumilast 0.15% ranked as least effective. There was significant inconsistency for the comparison of potent TCS versus pimecrolimus 1%, where indirect effects suggest similar effectiveness, but direct evidence suggests potent TCS was more effective than pimecrolimus 1%.

In a sensitivity analysis using an alternative classification for TCS potency (42 trials; n = 6571), the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib 1.5%, and potent and very potent TCS were ranked as most effective. Mild TCS and PDE‐4 inhibitors roflumilast 0.15% and crisaborole 2% were ranked as least effective. There was significant inconsistency between the comparison of moderate TCS versus pimecrolimus 1%, where indirect effects suggest similar effectiveness, but direct evidence suggests moderate TCS was more effective than pimecrolimus 1%.

In the sensitivity analysis excluding within‐participant studies (32 trials; n = 5978), potent TCS, the TCI tacrolimus 0.1%, and the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib 1.5% were ranked as most effective. PDE‐4 inhibitors roflumilast 0.15% and crisaborole 2% were ranked among the least effective.

### Tovet (emollient formulation) [^117R7oHM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Local adverse reactions with topical corticosteroids**: Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use, or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. If irritation develops, treatment with Tovet Foam should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

- **Ophthalmic adverse reactions**: Use of topical corticosteroids, including Tovet Foam, may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported postmarketing with the use of topical corticosteroids, including topical clobetasol products [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Avoid contact of Tovet Foam with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation.

- **Concomitant skin infections**: Concomitant skin infections should be treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists, Tovet Foam should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately treated.

- **Flammable contents**: The propellant in Tovet Foam is flammable. Avoid fire.

### Expert consensus: Time for a change in the way we advise our patients to use topical corticosteroids [^113LBWjF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids form the mainstay of treatment for many skin conditions. When used appropriately, they are safe and effective, with side effects generally uncommon. Advising patients to apply topical corticosteroid preparations "sparingly" or "thinly" contributes to steroid phobia, increasing the risk of poor clinical response and treatment failure. Such cautionary advice overlooks the fact that the vast majority of patients are prescribed topical corticosteroids of mild potency, for which evidence suggests that the risk of harm is minimal.

In the patient's mind, the advice groups all steroids together, regardless of their potential for adverse effects. This also tends to reinforce an erroneous concern that the risks from topical corticosteroids may be similar to those from systemic corticosteroids. We propose a change to make the pharmacy labeling of topical corticosteroids more accurately reflect the low risk of harm from corticosteroids of low to moderate potency, emphasizing the importance of applying sufficient medication to achieve a satisfactory clinical response.

This change could provide the focus for updated, evidence-based education for healthcare professionals in prescribing topical corticosteroids and aid in providing more appropriate advice to patients. We recommend that patients are informed that treatment should not exceed prescribed quantities, with continuing treatment under careful medical supervision. We also recommend that topical corticosteroid products include clear "fingertip unit" instructions.

### Emerging paradigm shift toward proactive topical treatment of psoriasis: A narrative review [^1122t7Q8]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

In contrast to atopic dermatitis, where topical tacrolimus ointment is approved by regulatory agencies for maintenance therapy, in psoriasis (PsO) there are currently no topical regimens approved for maintenance therapy. Consequently, maintenance treatment decisions in PsO are based on clinical experience and on a limited number of studies reporting on the long-term efficacy, safety, and acceptability of select topical therapy regimens. These primarily include topical corticosteroids (TCS), vitamin D3 analogs, or a combination of both, applied using a variety of maintenance approaches: continuous therapy, chronic intermittent therapy, step-down regimens, sequential or "pulse" regimens, and proactive maintenance therapy. These approaches variably meet the goals of long-term management of PsO.

Evidence supports the efficacy of TCS for inducing remission and reducing the frequency of relapses over periods of up to six months of continuous twice-daily treatment. However, treatment success with TCS is variable across short-term studies, and there are relatively few longer-term studies despite PsO being a chronic disease. Importantly, no severe adverse effects, including hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, were reported in trials of patients who used up to 20 g per week of clobetasol propionate ointment 0.05%, betamethasone valerate 0.1% ointment, or fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% ointment.

### Topical corticosteroids for atopic eczema: Clinical and cost effectiveness of once-daily vs. more frequent use [^113ShQnp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment for atopic eczema, yet there is uncertainty over the frequency of their use in terms of clinical and cost effectiveness.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of once-daily vs. more frequent use of same-potency topical corticosteroids in atopic eczema.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the clinical and cost-effectiveness literature was undertaken, together with a cost-minimization analysis.

- **Results**: The review identified a sparse literature, comprising one previous systematic review and 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). No published cost-effectiveness studies were identified. RCTs were focused on potent topical corticosteroids (eight RCTs), with no trials (RCTs/controlled clinical trials) identified on mild potency products. There was broad heterogeneity in trial methods; therefore, we considered outcomes according to: (i) at least a good response or 50% improvement and (ii) eczema rated as cleared or controlled. Studies found little difference between once-daily and more frequent use of topical corticosteroids. The literature on moderately potent and potent corticosteroids offered no basis for favoring once-daily or more frequent use, although some significant differences favoring twice-daily treatment were identified. One RCT on very potent products favored three times daily use on the basis of clinical response but reported no difference in the numbers with at least a good response. Given the similar outcomes seen in clinical effectiveness, a cost-minimization approach should be considered.

### Pediatric topical steroid withdrawal syndrome: What is known, what is unknown [^113ukRRX]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

We searched Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and gray literature from January 1946 to January 2024, using search terms relating to "TSW in children", "eczema", "red skin syndrome", "red sleeves", "topical steroid addiction", "topical steroid abuse", "topical steroid dependence", "topical steroid rebound", and "effects of long‐term topical steroid use in children with eczema". These search terms were based on two large systematic reviews conducted for adult topical steroid withdrawal (Hajar et al. and Hwang and Lio). References of key articles were hand‐searched to find additional articles. Only English-language studies and those that included pediatric patients (age < 18 years of age) were included. All relevant information, if available, from the pediatric cases was extracted, including the age, sex, duration of TCS use, type of TCS used, areas that TCS was applied to, and anatomic areas affected by the rash.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: Network meta-analysis [^117DXVNN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Comparison of approach and findings with existing eczema topical network meta-analyses:

Both reviews found that high-potency TCS and tacrolimus 0.1% are likely to be among the most effective short-term treatments for improving eczema severity. Chu 2023 also included studies of topical anti-inflammatory treatments for maintaining control of eczema, without an initial randomized daily treatment regimen. They found that moderate potency TCS and TCI were the most studied and among the most effective treatments for maintaining control of eczema.

Pimecrolimus 1% was either mid-ranked or among the least effective treatments in our review, and it was similarly classified in Chu 2023 for inducing remission. The short-term outcome data from both reviews agree that pimecrolimus 1% is a relatively weak topical anti-inflammatory treatment for the induction of remission in people with eczema. Systemic calcineurin inhibitors carry safety concerns around malignancy, especially lymphoma. Malignancy and lymphoma risks associated with TCI were not evaluated in Chu 2023 but have been evaluated elsewhere.

### Topical corticosteroids: Choice and application [^116Wp8v2]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are an essential tool for treating inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. They are classified by strength and the risk of adverse effects, including atrophy, striae, rosacea, telangiectasias, purpura, and other cutaneous and systemic reactions. The risk of adverse effects increases with prolonged use, large areas of application, higher potency, occlusion, and application to areas of thinner skin, such as the face and genitals.

When prescribing topical corticosteroids for children, lower potencies and shorter durations should be used. Topical corticosteroids can work safely and effectively in patients who are pregnant or lactating. They are available in various formulations, including ointments, creams, lotions, gels, foams, oils, solutions, and shampoos. The quantity of corticosteroid prescribed depends on the duration of treatment, frequency of application, skin location, and total surface area treated. Correct patient application is critical to successful use. Patients may be taught application using the fingertip unit method; one fingertip unit is the amount of medication dispensed from the tip of the index finger to the crease of the distal interphalangeal joint and covers approximately 2% of body surface area on an adult.

Topical corticosteroids are applied once or twice per day for up to three weeks for super-high-potency corticosteroids or up to 12 weeks for high- or medium-potency corticosteroids. There is no specified time limit for low-potency topical corticosteroid use.

### Agreement and correlation between different topical corticosteroid potency classification systems [^1124PUiz]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCSs) are available in multiple potencies that alter their effectiveness and safety. Pharmacoepidemiologic studies on TCSs are hampered by the absence of a universal potency classification system, limiting comparisons across studies, robust exposure classification, and clinical interpretation. This study aims to classify TCSs into three commonly used potency classification systems and evaluate the agreement and correlation between the three systems.

In this classification study, a comprehensive list of TCS formulations was compiled using sources identified in the literature, the Ontario Drug Benefit Formulary, a recent Cochrane review on the use of TCSs in people with eczema, and the Anatomical Therapeutic Classification (ATC) of the World Health Organization from August 11, 2021, to January 6, 2022. Topical corticosteroid potency classifications were assigned and compared using the 7-category US classification system, a 4-category classification from a recent Cochrane review largely based on the UK formulary, and the 4-category ATC classification. To facilitate comparisons across systems, the 7-category US system was consolidated into 4 categories.

Cohen weighted κ (κw) and Spearman rank correlation coefficients (r) were computed to examine agreement and correlation between the classification systems. A total of 232 unique TCS formulations (ATC, n = 231; US classification, n = 232; Cochrane review, n = 89) were included. Overall, there was low-to-moderate agreement but strong correlation between the classification systems.

### Complementing baricitinib response in late-responding alopecia areata through alternating weekly double combination of topical corticosteroids: A split-scalp comparison [^112QEpMT]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A 40-year-old woman with a history of patchy alopecia areata since the age of 10 years and alopecia totalis since the age of 20 years was referred to our clinic (Fig 1, A). Previous treatments included topical steroids, intralesional steroid injections, systemic steroids, and diphencyprone, all without significant success. She was started on baricitinib 4 mg daily. After 6 months, due to suboptimal response and the patient's concerns regarding possible discontinuation by month 9 for lack of efficacy of the only approved treatment for her condition — as per Italian agency recommendations — a weekly alternating regimen of topical corticosteroids was added, applied exclusively to the right scalp for capturing its relative contribution.

The treatment involved a once daily evening sequential application of a corticosteroid solution followed by an ointment applied on top, with both products kept under overnight occlusion with a shower cap to enhance penetration. The regimen alternated weekly between betamethasone valerate 0.5 mg/g solution with halometasone 0.05% ointment and halcinonide 0.1% solution with clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment. This rotation aimed to prevent tachyphylaxis, a phenomenon demonstrated in laboratory settings but questioned in clinical practice. From a clinical perspective, perceived tachyphylaxis likely reflects reduced compliance rather than true therapeutic resistance. Beyond theoretical benefits, this rotation strategy may enhance treatment adherence through conscious engagement with changing formulations. The left scalp remained untreated.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^1116pajV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not identify important differences from the main NMA, and are summarized below.

- **NMA at class level**: A combination was ranked as most likely to cause skin thinning compared to vehicle, but this was based on indirect evidence only and had wide confidence intervals, which included no effect for all interventions. There was no significant inconsistency between comparisons in this network. The odds of skin thinning and related signs did not differ between potent/very potent TCS and potent TCI (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.02, 59.99) or between mild/moderate TCS and mild TCI (OR 5.06, 95% CI 0.69, 37.27) but confidence intervals were wide.

- **Subgroup analysis of studies in people with non-severe eczema**: Pimecrolimus 1%, moderate TCS, mild TCS, and potent TCS were not more likely than vehicle to cause skin thinning, but confidence intervals were wide. There was no significant inconsistency between comparisons in this network.

- **Subgroup analysis of studies in people with severe eczema**: Very potent and potent TCS were ranked as most likely to cause skin thinning, with mild and moderate TCS ranked as least likely, but wide CIs included no effect for all interventions. There was no significant inconsistency between comparisons in this network.

- **Sensitivity analysis using an alternative classification for TCS potency**: Moderate and potent TCS were ranked as most likely to cause skin thinning, with roflumilast 0.15%, pimecrolimus 1%, and mild TCS ranked accordingly.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^115ahS9M]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The divergence between guidelines discouraging systemic corticosteroid (CS) use and their frequent use in routine clinical practice is a concern. Ease of use, rapid response in distressed patients, cost, and familiarity of primary care physicians with systemic CS for other conditions likely contribute to this issue. The divergence between treatments physicians suggest in guidelines under hypothetical clinical scenarios and the decisions made during individual patient consultations has been studied using a behavioral economics approach. Physicians often deviate from agreed best practices when confronted with a distressed patient. Systematic approaches to understand the implementation gaps between guidelines and practice have been advanced in a recent white paper by the healthcare quality organization Joint Commission International and may be applicable to systemic CS use for atopic dermatitis.

A major strength of our study is the large, geographically diverse group of International Eczema Council (IEC) expert atopic dermatitis (AD) clinicians and researchers who participated in the consensus process. During the panel discussion preceding the formal consensus survey, it was clear that clinical practice, even among experts, differed significantly from country to country. Particularly given the sparsity of randomized controlled trial (RCT) and high-quality nonrandomized study evidence to support any one viewpoint, keeping an open mind to different practices is important. Despite the diversity of respondents, there was an over-representation from some countries, including the United States, which may have biased the results.

### A review of topical corticosteroid foams [^115wr53p]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are efficacious treatment options for multiple dermatoses; however, ointments and cream corticosteroid vehicles can be cumbersome for patients and may act as a barrier to adherence. Foam vehicles may be preferred by some patients.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical corticosteroid foams.

- **Methods**: A literature review was conducted using the keywords "clobetasol", "betamethasone", "propionate", "valerate", "topical", "foam", "vehicles", "desonide", and "clinical trial". Thirty-seven articles were chosen.

- **Results**: For moderate plaque-type psoriasis, 68% of subjects using clobetasol propionate foam achieved a Physician Static Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 at week 2 compared with 21% in the control group (P < 0.0001). For betamethasone valerate (BMV) foam, a 12-week regimen for alopecia areata yielded a mean Investigator Global Assessment score of 2.9 compared with placebo (4.6; P < 0.001) and achieved ≥ 75% hair regrowth in 42.86% of subjects. Furthermore, BMV foam cleared or almost cleared 72% of scalp psoriasis subjects compared with BMV lotion (P ≤ 0.005%). For calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate foam, 38.3% of psoriasis subjects achieved treatment success compared with placebo (22.5%; P < 0.001). Desonide 0.05% foam was superior to vehicle foam in pediatric atopic dermatitis subjects.

Topical corticosteroid foams can be used for a variety of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. They are generally easy to apply and may improve patient adherence, and therefore, clinical outcomes.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: Network meta-analysis [^114aSEn7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

In the subgroup analysis of trials in people with non-severe eczema (14 trials, n = 1802), moderate or potent TCS, the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib 1.5%, and the PDE-4 inhibitor difamilast 1% were ranked as most effective, with the PDE-4 inhibitors roflumilast 0.15% and crisaborole 2% ranked as least effective. There was no significant inconsistency between comparisons in this network.

In a subgroup analysis of studies in people with eczema over the age of 12 years (18 trials, n = 2788), the TCI tacrolimus 0.1% and the JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib 1.5% and delgocitinib 0.5% were ranked as most effective, with the PDE-4 inhibitor roflumilast 0.15% and the AHR activator tapinarof 1% ranked as least effective. There was no significant inconsistency between comparisons in this network.

In a sensitivity analysis using an alternative classification for TCS potency (34 trials, n = 4312), potent TCS were ranked as most effective, with the TCI tacrolimus 0.1%, JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib 1.5% and delgocitinib 0.5%, and moderate TCS ranked as effective. The PDE-4 inhibitors roflumilast 0.15%, crisaborole 2%, and difamilast 0.3%, and the AHR activator tapinarof 1% ranked as least effective. There was significant inconsistency in the comparison of potent versus moderate TCS, where indirect effects suggest similar effectiveness, but direct evidence suggests potent TCS were more effective than moderate TCS.

In a sensitivity analysis limited to the studies reporting the home-recommended outcome measure EASI (19 trials, n = 3498), potent TCS, the TCI tacrolimus 0.1%, the JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib…

### Topical corticosteroids in dermatology [^1135NE3b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are the most commonly prescribed agents in the treatment of dermatologic conditions. They are used primarily as monotherapy or in combination with other agents for enhanced efficacy. Several stronger preparations are now available since their first introduction. They are also available in various vehicles, altering the potency and providing the option of tailoring them for use based on specific anatomic locations, areas of involvement, the age of the patient, and most importantly, the severity of the condition.

Several local and systemic side effects have been associated with their inadvertent use. Allergic contact dermatitis to most preparations has also been noticed. Judicious use with reinforced patient education lowers the risk of side effects and can be of great use in treating dermatologic conditions.

### Spotlight on calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate in psoriasis vulgaris of the trunk, limbs, and scalp [^113XcmwN]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Calcipotriene (calcipotriol)/betamethasone dipropionate (calcipotriene 50 μg/g and betamethasone 0.5 mg/g) is a fixed-dose combination of a vitamin D3 analog and a corticosteroid indicated for the once-daily, topical treatment of psoriasis vulgaris of the trunk, limbs, and scalp in adults. Both the ointment (Daivobet®; Dovobet®) and gel (Xamiol®; Daivobet® Gel; Dovobet® Gel) formulations of calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate can be used to treat psoriasis vulgaris of the trunk and/or limbs, although the gel formulation was specifically developed for the treatment of scalp psoriasis.

This article reviews the efficacy and tolerability of calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate in patients with psoriasis vulgaris, as well as summarizing its pharmacologic properties. Calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate has low systemic absorption and displays local anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties. It reduces the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and helps normalize keratinocyte differentiation.

In large, well-designed clinical trials, calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate, either as the ointment or the gel formulation, applied once daily for 4–8 weeks, was more effective than placebo, calcipotriene, or tacalcitol, as well as betamethasone dipropionate in most instances, for the topical, symptomatic treatment of psoriasis vulgaris of the trunk/limbs. Likewise, calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate gel applied once daily for 8 weeks was more effective than placebo or either component alone in the topical, symptomatic treatment of psoriasis vulgaris of the scalp.

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2018. Part 1: Prevention and topical therapies [^113aP9V1]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

This review is part of a series of annual updates that summarize the evidence base for atopic eczema (AE). The aim is to provide a succinct guide for clinicians on the key findings from 14 systematic reviews on the prevention and topical treatment of AE published or indexed in 2018. Various supplements, including long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, and the probiotic *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GG, given prenatally and postnatally, have not been shown to prevent AE in infants, although mixed strains of probiotics may decrease the risk of AE if given to the mother during pregnancy and to the infant for the first six months of life.

In the postnatal period, there is no evidence that hydrolyzed formula, compared with cow's milk formula (CMF), reduces the risk of AE in partially breastfed infants. However, weak evidence suggests that a specific partially hydrolyzed whey formula decreases the risk of AE compared with CMF. No specific skin practices can be recommended to reduce the eczema risk in healthy term babies. There is weak evidence of a low risk of reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression following two to four weeks of treatment with low-potency topical steroids, and conflicting evidence as to whether bleach bathing affects skin flora or AE severity.

A single study demonstrated that the topical Janus kinase inhibitor tofacitinib at 2% significantly reduces the Eczema Area and Severity Index compared with the vehicle. Topical naltrexone cream 1% improves pruritus (measured using a visual analogue scale) by 30% more than placebo.

### Clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray for the management of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp: Results from a randomized controlled trial [^1157NBfz]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). High credibility.

Clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray is available for treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis; however, there is limited information specifically for plaque psoriasis of the scalp.

- **Objective**: Evaluate the efficacy, safety, and quality-of-life impact of clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp.

- **Methods**: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study involved 81 men and women with moderate-to-severe (Global Severity Score [GSS] = 3 or 4) plaque psoriasis of the scalp. Eligible patients were treated with clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray or vehicle spray, applied twice daily for up to four weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the GSS of psoriasis of the scalp after four weeks. Safety assessments included local tolerability, presence of Cushing's syndrome, and adverse events.

- **Results**: At the end of treatment, 85 percent (35/41) of patients in the clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray group achieved success (GSS clear or almost clear), compared with 13 percent (5/40) in the vehicle spray group (P < .001). The proportion of patients treated with clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray who achieved a rating of clear (GSS = 0) after two weeks and at the end of treatment was 12 percent and 51 percent, respectively. Clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events or reported cases of folliculitis or Cushing's syndrome.

- **Conclusion**: Treatment with clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray for up to four weeks is effective and well tolerated for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp.

### Topical treatments for scalp psoriasis: Summary of a Cochrane systematic review [^11264ZH9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). High credibility.

People with chronic plaque psoriasis often have lesions on the scalp that are difficult to treat. This report is a summary of a Cochrane review on the efficacy and safety of topical treatments for scalp psoriasis. For quality-of-evidence assessment, we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group approach. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion. We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS; ongoing trials; indexes of included studies; and screened abstracts of six psoriasis-specific conferences up to August 2015.

We included 59 RCTs, with 11,561 participants overall. Most findings were limited to short-term treatments (< 6 months). According to the clinician and patients' self-assessment, a corticosteroid-vitamin D combination (e.g. betamethasone dipropionate plus calcipotriol) and corticosteroids of high and very high potency were better than vitamin D. The two-compound combination was superior to the corticosteroid alone, but the additional benefit was small. Reporting of quality-of-life data was insufficient. The two-compound combination and corticosteroids caused fewer withdrawals due to adverse events than vitamin D. There was no difference between the two-compound combination and corticosteroid monotherapy concerning this outcome. Overall, the evidence was of moderate quality. Evaluation of other topical treatments was limited. Given the comparable safety profile and only slim benefit of the two-compound combination over the corticosteroid alone, mo

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: A Cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116anFjE]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). High credibility.

**Clinician-reported eczema signs**: The network meta-analysis (NMA) included 32 trials (n = 4121), which most commonly reported a ≥ 75% relative improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index. Potent topical corticosteroids (TCS) (OR 8.15, 95% CI 4.90, 13.57), tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 8.06, 95% CI 3.30, 19.67), and JAK inhibitors ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 7.72, 95% CI 4.92, 12.10) and delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 7.61, 95% CI 3.72, 15.58) were ranked as most effective. Mild TCS (OR 2.22, 95% CI 0.74, 6.64), PDE-4 inhibitors roflumilast 0.15% (OR 2.43, 95% CI 0.88, 6.70), crisaborole 2% (OR 2.98, 95% CI 1.42, 6.26), and the AHR activator tapinarof 1% (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.00, 6.02) were ranked as least effective. Confidence intervals were wide and overlapping for most comparisons, but CINeMA ratings were moderate or high for most licensed interventions. CINeMA downgrades were most commonly made for within-trial bias, as well as imprecision and heterogeneity. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses, narrative information, and analysis of clinician-reported eczema signs as a continuous outcome are shown in the full Cochrane review and associated repository. In general, these were consistent with the main binary analysis of clinician-reported eczema signs. However, NMA of clinician-reported eczema signs yielded some counter-intuitive findings, such as increased effectiveness of lower potency TCI and TCS when indirectly compared with higher potency TCI and TCS.

### Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrheic dermatitis of the face or scalp: Summary of a Cochrane review [^1173T5tQ]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Are there differences in effectiveness between topical anti-inflammatory treatments (steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or lithium salts) and placebo or azoles in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adults?

The topical anti-inflammatory treatments were more effective in achieving total clearance of symptoms than placebo by 1.4-fold to 8.5-fold. However, there are no considerable differences between the various anti-inflammatory topical treatments or in comparison with azoles for short-term treatment. Despite the chronic nature of the disease, there is no evidence of treatment effects in long-term, continuous, or intermittent use of these compounds.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: Network meta-analysis [^111X3u4N]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

We found evidence that JAK inhibitors may be among the most effective short-term treatments for eczema, with low-to-moderate confidence. Chu 2023 found moderate-to-high-certainty evidence for topical ruxolitinib and topical delgocitinib JAK inhibitors to have intermediate effectiveness for clinician-evaluated eczema signs and patient-reported itch. This small difference in ranking is likely related to differences in analytical approaches and the totality of the evidence included in the networks. For example, we limited analyses to licensed potencies of drugs, and Chu 2023 pooled different potencies of the same drug if they showed similar treatment effects. The treatment arms with lower potencies of ruxolitinib generally showed slightly lower treatment effects than the 1.5% concentration in the ruxolitinib trials (NCT03745638; NCT03745651; Raoof 2020).

A second potential explanation for our slightly higher ranking of ruxolitinib is the potency classification of triamcinolone 0.1% cream, used as an active comparator for up to four weeks in Raoof 2020. Triamcinolone 0.1% cream was classified as potent in our primary analysis, but is classified as lower potency in the classifications used by Chu 2023. Triamcinolone 0.1% cream is classified as lower mid-strength (5) in the 7-point United States classification system and moderate in the shorter four-point United States classification. By classifying triamcinolone 0.1% cream as potent, we may have spuriously increased the relative ranking of ruxolitinib, since other TCS classified as potent TCS in the networks may be more potent.

### Halobetasol propionate [^117RqqLL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Apply a thin layer of Halobetasol Propionate Ointment to the affected skin once or twice daily, as directed by your physician, and rub in gently and completely. Halobetasol Propionate Ointment is a super-high potency topical corticosteroid; therefore, treatment should be limited to two weeks, and amounts greater than 50 g/wk should not be used. As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If no improvement is seen within two weeks, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary. Halobetasol Propionate Ointment should not be used with occlusive dressings.
