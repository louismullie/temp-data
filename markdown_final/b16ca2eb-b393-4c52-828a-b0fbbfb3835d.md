## Question

Vasopressin's and v-fib

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of vasopressin in ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest, including whether it should be used, how it compares to epinephrine, and what current guidelines recommend. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context of VF arrest and the pathophysiologic rationale for vasopressors. Then, I should review historical and current guideline positions on vasopressin. Next, I will examine high-quality randomized trials and meta-analyses to quantify outcomes. After that, I should check mechanistic and safety considerations, including any signals for harm. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and highlight special situations and controversies that do not change current practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and physiologic rationale. In VF arrest, the priority is immediate high-quality CPR and rapid defibrillation, with vasopressors added to raise coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) and improve myocardial blood flow; vasopressin is a non-catecholamine vasoconstrictor acting via V1a receptors that can increase systemic vascular resistance and CPP without beta-adrenergic effects, and in theory may be less impaired by acidosis than epinephrine, though that is a theoretical advantage rather than a proven clinical benefit [^111Fy2UR] [^114VXLBY] [^11258pmp].

> Next, I should review historical guidance to anchor where we came from. In the 2000–2015 era, guidelines allowed vasopressin 40 units IV/IO as an alternative to the first or second dose of epinephrine during cardiac arrest, largely based on mechanistic appeal and mixed early clinical signals; however, this permissive stance did not assert superiority over epinephrine and reflected uncertainty rather than a definitive endorsement [^111Fy2UR] [^112rNoSE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check current guideline positions. The 2017 AHA/ACC/HRS ventricular arrhythmia guideline explicitly states vasopressin is no longer recommended in ACLS, and the 2019 ILCOR Consensus advises avoiding vasopressin in place of or in addition to epinephrine during CPR; the 2025 AHA ALS update reiterates that vasopressin, alone or with epinephrine, should not be used as a substitute for epinephrine in adult cardiac arrest, reflecting no demonstrated advantage in outcomes [^116EdKBZ] [^112mDbLU] [^114Pv8Sa] [^112SzmwK].

> I will now examine the pivotal randomized trial in VF/VT. The NEJM multicenter RCT in 1,186 out-of-hospital arrests showed no significant difference between vasopressin and epinephrine for survival to hospital admission overall, and specifically no difference among patients with VF/VT (46.2% vs 43.0%, P = 0.48); the notable signal was in asystole, where vasopressin improved admission and discharge, but that does not translate into a VF benefit and should not be extrapolated to shockable rhythms [^1138vf1f].

> Wait, let me verify whether combinations of vasopressin and epinephrine helped. In that same NEJM trial, among those who failed the two study-drug injections, subsequent epinephrine rescue produced better outcomes in the vasopressin arm than in the epinephrine arm, but this was a post hoc subgroup with multiple testing concerns; pooled analyses and subsequent RCTs have not shown that adding vasopressin to epinephrine improves survival or neurologic outcomes compared with epinephrine alone, despite transient hemodynamic advantages seen in animals and small studies [^1138vf1f] [^111mkdLK] [^111ZCpYC].

> Next, I should review systematic reviews and meta-analyses to quantify the totality of evidence. High-quality syntheses, including Cochrane and ILCOR-informed reviews, show that vasopressin is not superior to epinephrine for ROSC, survival to discharge, or favorable neurologic outcome, and the combination of vasopressin plus epinephrine does not improve clinically meaningful outcomes compared with epinephrine alone; a 2022 meta-analysis likewise found no advantage in ROSC or survival, although exploratory subgroup signals with steroids and in-hospital arrest warrant cautious interpretation [^116b9dPG] [^1176NmRb] [^111ZCpYC].

> I should double-check mechanistic and safety signals that might argue against vasopressin. Animal data suggest vasopressin can worsen early post-resuscitation left ventricular function compared with epinephrine, and while antagonizing vasopressin improved early hemodynamics, it paradoxically reduced 24-hour survival, highlighting complex and potentially harmful interactions; clinically, vasopressin is associated with mesenteric and digital ischemia, and its labeling warns that it can worsen cardiac function, particularly in patients with impaired cardiac response, reinforcing caution in VF arrest where myocardial stunning is common [^1148n1yc] [^1141m2DD] [^114mGcqm].

> Let me consider the epinephrine side of the equation to ensure I'm not overstating harm. Epinephrine increases ROSC and short-term survival, with more pronounced benefits in non-shockable rhythms, but it does not clearly improve favorable neurologic outcomes; importantly, guidelines advise against high-dose epinephrine (> 1 mg boluses), underscoring that more vasopressor is not necessarily better and that we should avoid layering vasopressin onto standard-dose epinephrine without outcome benefit [^1176NmRb] [^112EzoWx] [^1145ef1g].

> But wait, what if a vasopressin–steroid strategy changes the calculus? The VSE combination (vasopressin plus methylprednisolone with epinephrine) has shown improved ROSC in in-hospital cardiac arrest across RCTs, yet contemporary data and meta-analyses have not demonstrated improved survival to discharge or favorable neurologic outcomes; major guidelines issue only weak recommendations against routine VSE outside trials, and Red Cross guidance states evidence is insufficient to recommend vasopressin with corticosteroids for in-hospital or out-of-hospital arrest, so this remains investigational and not a reason to prefer vasopressin in VF [^116nSEGJ] [^113fJtss] [^115CneSY] [^116TtGAy].

> I should confirm the practical, guideline-concordant approach for VF arrest. High-quality chest compressions, early defibrillation, and timely epinephrine 1 mg every 3–5 minutes remain standard; vasopressin should not be used in place of epinephrine or added to epinephrine during CPR for adult cardiac arrest, including VF, because no advantage has been demonstrated and there are potential harms; after vasopressor and continued CPR, consider amiodarone or lidocaine for refractory VF/VT per updated algorithms [^112SzmwK] [^111jKiQx] [^111G5to1].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion aligns with the weight of evidence. For VF arrest, vasopressin offers no proven clinical advantage over epinephrine and may worsen post-arrest myocardial function; current international consensus and AHA guidance recommend avoiding vasopressin and sticking with epinephrine, reserving vasopressin for investigational contexts or guideline-directed trials rather than routine care [^112SzmwK] [^114Pv8Sa] [^1148n1yc].

---

Vasopressin is not recommended for ventricular fibrillation (VF) because **it does not improve survival or neurologic outcomes** compared to epinephrine [^112SzmwK] [^1138vf1f] [^112ffohg]. While vasopressin can increase coronary perfusion pressure and may aid ROSC in refractory VF, **epinephrine remains first-line** due to stronger evidence for survival benefit [^112o972F] [^116b9dPG]. Vasopressin may be considered only as a **second-line alternative** or in combination with epinephrine in refractory cases, but current guidelines favor epinephrine alone [^114Pv8Sa] [^112SzmwK].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms of vasopressin in VF

Vasopressin is a non-catecholamine vasopressor that **acts via V1 receptors** to cause peripheral vasoconstriction, increasing systemic vascular resistance and coronary perfusion pressure during CPR [^114VXLBY]. Unlike epinephrine, it **does not increase myocardial oxygen demand or cause β-adrenergic-mediated arrhythmias**, which theoretically makes it attractive in VF arrest [^111jRsvG].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting vasopressin use in VF

Several studies have evaluated vasopressin in VF arrest, but results are mixed:

- **Wenzel et al. (2004)**: A large RCT found vasopressin and epinephrine had similar rates of ROSC, survival to hospital discharge, and neurologic outcomes in VF/VT arrest; vasopressin was superior only in asystole, not VF [^1138vf1f].
- **Meta-analyses**: Multiple meta-analyses show no significant benefit of vasopressin over epinephrine for ROSC, survival, or neurologic outcomes in VF arrest [^notfound].
- **Combination therapy**: Some studies suggest vasopressin plus epinephrine may improve hemodynamics and ROSC, but do not show consistent survival or neurologic benefit [^116eEZ4G] [^111mkdLK].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current resuscitation guidelines reflect the **lack of superiority of vasopressin** in VF:

- **AHA 2025**: Recommends epinephrine as the primary vasopressor; vasopressin is not recommended as a substitute or adjunct to epinephrine in VF arrest [^112SzmwK].
- **ILCOR 2019**: Advises against using vasopressin instead of or in addition to epinephrine during CPR [^114Pv8Sa].
- **ACC/AHA/HRS 2018**: Does not recommend vasopressin for VF arrest management [^112mDbLU].

---

## Comparative effectiveness: vasopressin vs. epinephrine

| **Outcome** | **Epinephrine** | **Vasopressin** | **Vasopressin + epinephrine** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ROSC | Improved rates [^116b9dPG] | Similar or slightly lower [^1164Q1Xt] | Similar or slightly improved [^116b9dPG] |
| Survival to discharge | Improved rates [^116b9dPG] | No significant benefit [^1164Q1Xt] | No significant benefit [^111mkdLK] |
| Neurologic outcomes | Uncertain benefit [^116b9dPG] | No significant benefit [^1164Q1Xt] | No significant benefit [^111ZCpYC] |

---

Overall, **epinephrine remains the vasopressor of choice** in VF arrest due to consistent evidence of improved survival outcomes, whereas vasopressin does not demonstrate a clear advantage [^1138vf1f] [^116b9dPG].

---

## Potential advantages and disadvantages of vasopressin in VF

### Advantages

Potential advantages include **V1-mediated vasoconstriction** that increases coronary perfusion pressure and may facilitate ROSC, as well as **acidosis resistance**, with vasopressin maintaining efficacy in low pH environments where epinephrine may be less effective [^114VXLBY].

---

### Disadvantages

- **Lack of benefit**: No consistent improvement in survival or neurologic outcomes [^1164Q1Xt].
- **Adverse effects**: Risk of ischemia, bradycardia, and ventricular arrhythmias [^1141m2DD] [^115JtsCe].
- **Limited evidence**: Most data are from small studies or animal models, limiting clinical applicability [^111pKxPp].

---

## Clinical scenarios where vasopressin may be considered

Vasopressin may be considered in **refractory VF** as a second-line agent when epinephrine fails, although evidence is limited. It may also be used in prolonged arrest (> 20 minutes) where acidosis may blunt epinephrine's effectiveness; again, supportive data are sparse.

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Current research focuses on identifying subgroups (e.g. prolonged arrest, acidosis) that may benefit from vasopressin, as well as **combination regimens** exploring vasopressin with epinephrine and steroids to improve outcomes. Novel dosing strategies are also being studied to optimize administration and timing [^1164Q1Xt] [^111RCrfp].

---

Vasopressin is **not recommended as first-line therapy** for VF arrest due to lack of survival benefit. Epinephrine remains the standard vasopressor; vasopressin may be considered only in refractory cases or specific scenarios, with ongoing research needed to clarify its role [^112SzmwK] [^114Pv8Sa].

Advanced cardiac life support — pulseless arrest with shockable rhythm (ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia) follows a shock–CPR–drug sequence: Give 1 shock with device-specific energy (manual biphasic typically 120 to 200 J; if unknown, use 200 J; AED device specific; monophasic 360 J), then resume CPR immediately and give 5 cycles of CPR*. Recheck rhythm ("Check rhythm Shockable rhythm?") and deliver subsequent shocks at the same or higher biphasic dose (if unknown, use 200 J; monophasic 360 J), resuming CPR immediately. When IV/IO available, give vasopressor: "Epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO Repeat every 3 to 5 min" or "May give 1 dose of vasopressin 40 U IV/IO to replace first or second dose of epinephrine". After further shocks, consider antiarrhythmics: "amiodarone (300 mg IV/IO once, then consider additional 150 mg IV/IO once) or lidocaine (1 to 1.5 mg/kg first dose then 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg IV/IO, maximum 3 doses or 3 mg/kg)", and "Consider magnesium, loading dose 1 to 2 g IV/IO for torsades de pointes".

### Effect of vasopressin on postresuscitation ventricular function: unknown consequences of the recent guidelines 2000 for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^1148n1yc]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effect on postresuscitation left ventricular function of vasopressin vs. epinephrine used during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a swine model of prolonged prehospital ventricular fibrillation.

Design

Prospective, randomized experimental study.

Setting

University large animal resuscitation research laboratory.

Subjects

Forty-eight swine (29 ± 1 kg).

Interventions

Resuscitation after 12.5 mins of untreated ventricular fibrillation, randomizing animals during cardiopulmonary resuscitation to treatment with epinephrine, vasopressin, or vasopressin followed by a vasopressin antagonist administered in the postresuscitation period.

Measurements and Main Results

Serial measurements of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function (prearrest, postresuscitation at 30 mins and 6 hrs) and 24-hr survival. Animals receiving vasopressin had more postresuscitation left ventricular dysfunction than those receiving epinephrine (p < .05). The vasopressin antagonist produced vasodilation and improved early postresuscitation left ventricular systolic and diastolic function but did not have a lasting effect on such postresuscitation ventricular function and decreased 24-hr survival compared with the use of vasopressin alone (3/16 vs. 10/16 survivors; p < .05).

Conclusions

Vasopressin use during cardiopulmonary resuscitation results in worse postresuscitation left ventricular function early but did not compromise 24-hr outcome. Reversal of vasopressin's effect with a specific V-1 antagonist in the postresuscitation period did not improve survival.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Cardiac arrest medications and wide QRS complex tachycardia — key evidence and cautions are as follows: High-dose epinephrine (0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg IV versus a standard 1 mg) has been studied and, in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest unresponsive to defibrillation, improved survival to hospital admission but did not improve survival to hospital discharge or long-term survival; vasopressin is no longer recommended in advanced cardiovascular life support algorithms. Intravenous magnesium showed no benefit in 2 randomized controlled trials for refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) during cardiac arrest; in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 2 to 4 g IV magnesium did not improve survival to hospital admission, and in inpatient cardiac arrest it did not improve return of spontaneous circulation, survival to 24 hours, or survival to hospital discharge; exceptions include marked hypokalemia or medication-induced torsades de pointes in which IV magnesium is warranted. For prophylaxis after acute myocardial infarction, routine lidocaine or procainamide was associated with increased mortality while beta blockers were associated with a significantly lower mortality; an RCT of 1073 patients found high-dose amiodarone led to higher mortality, and a moderate dose was not superior to placebo. For stable wide QRS tachycardia, differentiation between supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy and ventricular tachycardia (VT) is often possible by history and the 12-lead ECG; patients with wide QRS tachycardia and known structural heart disease should be presumed to have VT until proven otherwise, and verapamil given to a patient with VT may cause severe hypotension or syncope except in verapamil-sensitive VT (intrafascicular reentry) in a structurally normal heart, which is often difficult to recognize initially.

Cardiac arrest pharmacology and wide QRS complex tachycardia — High-dose epinephrine (0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg IV, as opposed to a standard dose of 1 mg) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest unresponsive to defibrillation improved survival to hospital admission but showed no difference in survival to hospital discharge or long-term survival, and the administration of vasopressin is no longer recommended. Intravenous magnesium showed no benefit for refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest; in out-of-hospital arrest, administration of 2 to 4 g magnesium intravenously did not improve survival to hospital admission, and in inpatient arrest it did not improve return of spontaneous circulation, survival to 24 hours, or survival to hospital discharge, with exceptions such as marked hypokalemia or medication-induced torsades de pointes in which intravenous magnesium is warranted. Post–myocardial infarction prophylactic antiarrhythmic use found routine lidocaine and procainamide associated with increased mortality and beta blockers associated with a significantly lower mortality rate; a subsequent randomized controlled trial involving 1073 patients showed high-dose amiodarone led to a higher mortality rate, while a moderate dose was not superior to placebo. For a stable, wide QRS complex tachycardia, patients with wide QRS complex tachycardia and known structural heart disease should be presumed to have ventricular tachycardia (VT) until proven otherwise, and administration of a calcium channel blocker such as verapamil to a patient with VT may result in severe hypotension or syncope, with the exception of verapamil-sensitive VT that occurs in a structurally normal heart, which is often difficult to recognize on initial presentation.

### Vasopressin and epinephrine in the treatment of cardiac arrest: an experimental study [^114VXLBY]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

In case of VF, the Advanced Life Support Guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council recommend the periodic use of epinephrine if two initial defibrillations have failed. The use of a vasopressor is thought to be beneficial in cardiac arrest by improving cardiac and brain blood flow during CPR.

Epineprhine increases CPP via systemic arteriolar vasoconstriction, which maintains peripheral vascular tone and prevents arteriolar collapse. Furthermore, during experimental and clinical cardiac arrest, endogenous catecholamine concentrations are extremely high (up to 170 times normal levels in an animal model of VF). Thus, evidence suggests that epinephrine may be helpful in CPR, especially in short-term survival.

Vasopressin, an endogenous peptide, is a potent vasopressor agent and has been shown to be beneficial in CPR. Via the V 1 receptors, it stimulates the contraction of vascular smooth muscles, resulting in peripheral vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Via the V 2 receptors, vasopressin possibly induces vasodilation. Unlike epinephrine, it is resistant to the effects of acidosis. Endogenous vasopressin levels were found to be higher in survivors of cardiac arrest than those who died.

Pulseless ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation in acute coronary syndromes — initiate ACLS with unsynchronized shock after basic assessment and CPR; use monophasic shocks at 360 J or biphasic per manufacturer, and if not available give 200 J for the first shock with an equal or higher dose for subsequent shocks. If defibrillation fails, give epinephrine 1 mg intravenously every 3 to 5 min or vasopressin 40 U intravenously once only, amiodarone 300-mg or 5–mg/kg intravenous push with a possible repeat 150-mg intravenous push once only, and consider second-tier options including lidocaine 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg up to a total dose of 3 mg/kg, magnesium 1 to 2 g, or procainamide 30 mg/min up to 17 mg/kg.

### Vasopressin improves outcome in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia: a observational cohort study [^114z46Hh]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Survival after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with adrenaline (epinephrine) therapy is disappointing. The use of adrenaline is associated with increased myocardial oxygen consumption, ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial dysfunction during the period following resuscitation. In the American Heart Association 2000 Guidelines and in the Emergency Cardiovascular Care Guidelines 2000 for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care, vasopressin is considered a secondary alternative to adrenaline in the treatment of unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). During CPR it significantly improves total cerebral and left myocardial blood flow, and it causes a sustained increase in mean arterial blood pressure as compared with maximal doses of adrenaline. However, some clinical studies yielded contrasting findings. Moreover, clinical experience with vasopressin as an alternative to adrenaline for vasopressor therapy in CPR is limited.

We conducted a clinical investigation to assess the effect of vasopressin on outcome in out-of-hospital CPR for VF and pulseless VT. Our hypothesis was that vasopressin improves outcome in VF/VT cardiac arrest, especially in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

### Is vasopressin superior to adrenaline or placebo in the management of cardiac arrest? A meta-analysis [^111pKxPp]. Resuscitation (2003). Low credibility.

Vasopressin is currently recommended in the management of patients with cardiac arrest, but its efficacy is still incompletely established. We systematically reviewed randomized trials comparing vasopressin to control treatment in the management of cardiac arrest in humans and animals. Two human and 33 animal studies were retrieved. At pooled analysis vasopressin appeared equivalent to adrenaline (epinephrine) in the management of human cardiac arrest (N = 240), with, respectively 63 (78/124) vs 59% (68/116) ROSC (P = 0.43), and 16 (20/124) vs 14% (16/116) survival to hospital discharge (P = 0.52). In animal trials (N = 669) vasopressin appeared instead significantly superior to both placebo (ROSC, respectively 93 [98/105] vs 19% [14/72], P < 0.001) or adrenaline (ROSC, respectively 84 [225/268] vs 52% [117/224], P < 0.001). In conclusion, vasopressin is superior to both placebo or adrenaline in animal models of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Evidence in humans is still limited and confidence intervals estimates too wide to reliably confirm or disprove results obtained in experimental animal settings.

### Vasopressin and epinephrine in the treatment of cardiac arrest: an experimental study [^116fhxxX]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac arrest affects more than 700,000 people per year in Europe. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is used to treat up to 40% of the cases when help arrives. VF requires immediate bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and electrical defibrillation.

The preferred drug for more than 100 years for use during VF has been epinephrine (adrenaline). Epinephrine's vasoconstrictive action results in a rise in the aortic pressure, thus increasing the coronary perfusion pressure (CPP).

Vasopressin also has a vasoconstrictive action in the vascular network of the skeletal muscles, bowel, fat tissue, skin and, to a lesser degree, the coronary and renal vessels, while it causes vasodilation in the brain vessels. This results in an increase of the coronary perfusion pressure and, in general, an increase of blood flow to the vital organs without causing a dramatic increase in the myocardial oxygen consumption. The aim of the present study is to assess whether the combination of vasopressin with epinephrine (Vaso-Epi combination) would increase initial resuscitation success demonstrated by the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).

ACC/AHA/ESC ventricular tachyarrhythmia management during cardiac arrest — Intravenous amiodarone has replaced lidocaine for resistant ventricular tachyarrhythmias, but amiodarone need not be given routinely after a successful initial defibrillation; if cardiac arrest was heralded by acute coronary syndromes (ACS), intravenous lidocaine may still be used, and beta blockers may be preferred for ACS; vasopressin has been suggested as an alternative to epinephrine, but superiority is not clearly established.

### Vasopressin improves outcome in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia: a observational cohort study [^117LcoDe]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

For patients in cardiac arrest with refractory VF or pulseless VT after defibrillation, administration of a vasopressor is intended to improve myocardial and cerebral perfusion. It should not increase myocardial oxygen demand or promote arrythmias. Adrenaline increases myocardial oxygen demand and consumption, decreases myocardial ATP with proarrhythmic effects, and increases myocardial lactate level. Prehospital administration of adrenaline appears to be of little value in increasing rates of survival to discharge, and the cumulative dose of adrenaline is an independent predictor of poor neurological outcome. Adrenaline increases intrapulmonary shunting by 30% and decreases arterial oxygen saturation. It also significantly increases the severity of post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction, and consequently it decreases post-resuscitation survival.

Vasopressin is an attractive alternative to adrenaline during CPR because it significantly improves cerebral and myocardial blood flow by virtue of its nitric oxide vasodilatatory effect. The potential benefits of vasopressin in CPR arise primarily from its ability to stimulate the contraction of vascular smooth muscle, resulting in peripheral vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Unlike adrenaline, vasopressin has no β-adrenergic effects and is resistant to the effects of acidosis. It does not decrease myocardial ATP level and does not increase myocardial lactate level.

### Vasopressin during cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a progress report [^11258pmp]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, circulating endogenous vasopressin concentrations were significantly higher in successfully resuscitated patients than in patients who died. These observations have prompted several investigations to assess the role of vasopressin to improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation management.

Design

Literature review.

Results

In the cardiopulmonary resuscitation laboratory, vasopressin improved vital organ blood flow, cerebral oxygen delivery, the probability of restoring spontaneous circulation, and neurologic recovery better than epinephrine. In pediatric preparations with asphyxia, epinephrine was superior to vasopressin, whereas in both pediatric pigs with ventricular fibrillation and adult porcine models with asphyxia, combinations of vasopressin and epinephrine proved to be highly effective. In addition, vasopressin enabled short- and long-term survival in a porcine model of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock. In a recently published European, multiple-center trial, 1,219 adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were randomized to receive two injections of either 40 IU of vasopressin or 1 mg of epinephrine followed by additional epinephrine if needed. The clinical study did not confirm laboratory data showing vasopressin to be more effective than epinephrine in ventricular fibrillation and pulseless electrical activity, but vasopressin was superior to epinephrine in patients with asystole. Vasopressin followed by epinephrine was more effective than epinephrine alone in the treatment of refractory cardiac arrest.

Conclusions

According to new data from the European vasopressin study, we suggest, first, the administration of 1 mg of epinephrine, followed alternately by 40 IU of vasopressin and 1 mg of epinephrine every 3 mins in adult cardiac arrest victims, regardless of the initial electrocardiographic rhythm.

The effectiveness of pharmacologic management of cardiac arrest patients is widely debated; however, several studies published in the past 5 years have begun to clarify some of these issues. This article covers the current state of evidence for the effectiveness of the vasopressor epinephrine and the combination of vasopressin-steroids-epinephrine and antiarrhythmic medications amiodarone and lidocaine and reviews the role of other medications such as calcium, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium, and atropine in cardiac arrest care. We additionally review the role of β-blockers for refractory pulseless ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation and thrombolytics in undifferentiated cardiac arrest and suspected fatal pulmonary embolism.

### Vasopressin improves outcome in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia: a observational cohort study [^115SUcjG]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

We undertook a prospective observational cohort study, with a retrospective control group, in a prehospital setting, after approval had been granted by the ethical review board of the Ministry of Health of Slovenia. The study community, in the region surrounding the city of Maribor in Slovenia, includes a population of 190,000, and approximately 90 resuscitations are attempted per year. The initial response to cardiac arrest is by emergency doctors (prehospital emergency unit). Basic and advanced cardiac life support are provided by emergency doctors before the patient's arrival to the hospital, applying a regional protocol that incorporates European Resuscitatation Council standards, guidelines and clinical algorithms for CPR.

This study included only victims of cardiac arrest with registered initial VF or pulseless VT. We compared three treatments. Group I patients received only adrenaline 1 mg every three minutes (data were collected from February 1998 to October 2000). In group II patients received one intravenous dose of 40 IU arginine vasopressin (Pitressin™; Goldshield Pharmaceuticals, Croydon, UK) after three doses of 1 mg adrenaline (data were collected prospectively from November 2000 to October 2003). Finally, group III patients received arginine vasopressin 40 IU as first-line therapy (data were collected prospectively from November 2003 to December 2004). If there was no return of pulse after vasopressin, patients received adrenaline 1 mg every three minutes during CPR. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were similar in the three groups.

Exclusion criteria were successful defibrillation without administration of a vasopressor, age under 18 years, documented terminal illness, traumatic cardiac arrest, severe hypothermia (< 30°C), pulseless electrical activity or asystole as initial rhythm at arrival, and inability to gain intravenous access. All drugs were injected exclusively intravenously, followed by 20 mL normal saline.

The causes of cardiac arrest were divided into AMI and other. The criteria used for diagnosis of AMI and for primary arrhythmia are consistent with current standards (for instance, those of the World Health Organization, and the Joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology Committee). In the group of 'other' causes of cardiac arrest, we included submersion, respiratory causes, intoxication, electrolytic and endocrinologic disorders, and unknown aetiology. Diagnoses were confirmed in the intensive care unit or, for those patients who died at the scene, at autopsy.

### Vasopressin in cardiac arrest [^111jRsvG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of vasopressin in cardiac arrest.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched (all to June 2005) for full-text English-language publications describing trials in humans. Search terms were vasopressin, epinephrine, adrenaline, heart arrest, cardiac arrest, and clinical trial.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective, randomized, controlled trials that evaluated efficacy or safety endpoints of vasopressin in the management of cardiac arrest were included. Efficacy outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation, successful resuscitation, survival to hospital admission, 24-hour survival, and survival to hospital discharge. Safety outcomes were as defined by each trial.

Data Synthesis

Three prospective trials were identified and included in this review. Vasopressin does not appear to offer any therapeutic advantage compared with epinephrine in the treatment of both in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, regardless of the presenting arrest rhythm. Although there is a suggestion that vasopressin may be effective in treatment of asystole, the evidence for this arises from a subgroup analysis that should be viewed as hypothesis generating. There are limited data describing the safety of vasopressin in cardiac arrest.

Conclusions

The current evidence for the use of vasopressin in cardiac arrest is indeterminate. Given the similarly equivocal evidence of efficacy for epinephrine, either drug could be considered the first-line agent in cardiac arrest. Placebo-controlled studies with appropriate statistical power are warranted to evaluate meaningful clinical outcomes, such as survival to hospital discharge. Further evaluation of the role of vasopressin in asystolic cardiac arrest and its use in combination with epinephrine is also justified.

### Management of refractory ventricular Fibrillation: extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or epinephrine? [^113Q7ACo]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2017). Low credibility.

One technique that is promulgated to support patients with refractory cardiac arrest is the use of cardiopulmonary bypass during attempted resuscitation. This consists of emergent cannulation of a large vein and artery, then initiation of venoarterial extracorporeal circulation and oxygenation with an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO). Multiple observational studies, primarily originating in Southeast Asia, suggest that ECMO is associated with improved outcome after refractory cardiac arrest. Because the overall survival in these locations is low compared with contemporary survival in the United States, it is unclear if one can generalize from their experience with ECMO. Observational studies in Melbourne, Australia and Paris, France suggest that early use of ECMO in combination with other interventions may be associated with good neurologic outcomes. A case-control study in Minneapolis, Minnesota of patients with refractory OHCA caused by a shockable rhythm reported that early transport to the cardiac catheterization laboratory followed by ECMO then PCI was associated with greater survival with good neurologic function as compared with historical control subjects (50% vs. 8.2%; p < 0.0001). A randomized feasibility trial of ECMO in patients with refractory cardiac arrest was recently initiated in the United States. In summary, there is considerable interest in the effectiveness of ECMO in humans with refractory OHCA.

Another technique that is promulgated to support patients with cardiac arrest is IV administration of medication to improve blood pressure and flow to the coronary and cerebral circulation so as to enhance the likely restoration of circulation and to reduce brain injury. Increased coronary perfusion pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure during CPR may be offset by increased myocardial work and reduced subendocardial perfusion. Multiple large observational studies from southeast Asia have suggested that early but not late use of epinephrine is associated with improved outcomes after OHCA. The only placebo-controlled trial of epinephrine (also called adrenalin) reported to date did not achieve its maximum expected enrollment but did observe that epinephrine significantly increased restoration of circulation and survival to admission as compared with placebo. Pooled analyses of prior trials confirm that vasopressin has no significant benefit over epinephrine. In 2 small trials in Greece, epinephrine combined with vasopressin and multiple doses of corticosteroids increased the likelihood of restoration of circulation as compared with placebo. A large pragmatic trial comparing epinephrine with placebo is currently enrolling patients with OHCA in England. In summary, there is considerable interest in the effectiveness of IV vasopressors in humans with refractory cardiac arrest.

### Vasopressin improves outcome in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia: a observational cohort study [^1173aMN1]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

An increasing body of evidence from laboratory and clinical studies suggests that vasopressin may represent a promising alternative vasopressor for use during cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Current guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation recommend the use of adrenaline (epinephrine), with vasopressin considered only as a secondary option because of limited clinical data.

Method

The present study was conducted in a prehospital setting and included patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia undergoing one of three treatments: group I patients received only adrenaline 1 mg every 3 minutes; group II patients received one intravenous dose of arginine vasopressin (40 IU) after three doses of 1 mg epinephrine; and patients in group III received vasopressin 40 IU as first-line therapy. The cause of cardiac arrest (myocardial infarction or other cause) was established for each patient in hospital.

Results

A total of 109 patients who suffered nontraumatic cardiac arrest were included in the study. The rates of restoration of spontaneous circulation and subsequent hospital admission were higher in vasopressin-treated groups (23/53 [45%] in group I, 19/31 [61%] in group II and 17/27 [63%] in group III). There were also higher 24-hour survival rates among vasopressin-treated patients (P < 0.05), and more vasopressin-treated patients were discharged from hospital (10/51 [20%] in group I, 8/31 [26%] in group II and 7/27 [26%] group III; P = 0.21). Especially in the subgroup of patients with myocardial infarction as the underlying cause of cardiac arrest, the hospital discharge rate was significantly higher in vasopressin-treated patients (P < 0.05). Among patients who were discharged from hospital, we found no significant differences in neurological status between groups.

Conclusion

The greater 24-hour survival rate in vasopressin-treated patients suggests that consideration of combined vasopressin and adrenaline is warranted for the treatment of refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. This is especially the case for those patients with myocardial infarction, for whom vasopressin treatment is also associated with a higher hospital discharge rate.

### Vasopressin improves outcome in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia: a observational cohort study [^115gudtc]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

With respect to resuscitation outcomes, in group II (three doses of adrenaline first, followed by vasopressin; 113 patients with initial VF/VT rhythm) 29 patients were resuscitated after adrenaline only (29/113 [26%]) and 11 patients were resuscitated after vasopressin was given, without additional doses of adrenaline (11/31 [36%]). In group III (vasopressin as first-line therapy; 38 patients with initial VF/VT rhythm) 10 patients were resuscitated after a single dose of vasopressin (10/38 [27%]). Demographic characteristics and causes of cardiac arrest are summarized in Table 2.

More patients treated with vasopressin (but not significantly more) were discharged from hospital (P = 0.21). There were no significant differences in neurological status between the groups at discharge. For group I Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) values were as follows: six out of ten patients had CPC 1 or 2; three out of ten had CPC 3 or 4; and one out of ten had CPC 5. For group II the values were as follows: five out of eight patients had CPC 1 or 2; and three out of eight had CPC 3 or 4. Finally, for group III the CPC values were as follows: four out of seven patients had CPC 1 or 2; and three out of seven had CPC 3 or 4.

### Association of vasopressin plus catecholamine vasopressors vs catecholamines alone with atrial fibrillation in patients with distributive shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113goUKs]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Vasopressin is an alternative to catecholamine vasopressors for patients with distributive shock-a condition due to excessive vasodilation, most frequently from severe infection. Blood pressure support with a noncatecholamine vasopressor may reduce stimulation of adrenergic receptors and decrease myocardial oxygen demand. Atrial fibrillation is common with catecholamines and is associated with adverse events, including mortality and increased length of stay (LOS).

Objectives

To determine whether treatment with vasopressin+catecholamine vasopressors compared with catecholamine vasopressors alone was associated with reductions in the risk of adverse events.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched from inception to February 2018. Experts were asked and meta-registries searched to identify ongoing trials.

Study Selection

Pairs of reviewers identified randomized clinical trials comparing vasopressin in combination with catecholamine vasopressors to catecholamines alone for patients with distributive shock.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers abstracted data independently. A random-effects model was used to combine data.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was atrial fibrillation. Other outcomes included mortality, requirement for renal replacement therapy (RRT), myocardial injury, ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, and LOS in the intensive care unit and hospital. Measures of association are reported as risk ratios (RRs) for clinical outcomes and mean differences for LOS.

Results

Twenty-three randomized clinical trials were identified (3088 patients; mean age, 61.1 years [14.2]; women, 45.3%). High-quality evidence supported a lower risk of atrial fibrillation associated with vasopressin treatment (RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.67 to 0.88]; risk difference [RD], -0.06 [95% CI, -0.13 to 0.01]). For mortality, the overall RR estimate was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.97; RD, -0.04 [95% CI, -0.07 to 0.00]); however, when limited to trials at low risk of bias, the RR estimate was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.11). The overall RR estimate for RRT was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.51 to 1.08; RD, -0.07 [95% CI, -0.12 to -0.01]). However, in an analysis limited to trials at low risk of bias, RR was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.92, P for interaction = .77). There were no significant differences in the pooled risks for other outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the addition of vasopressin to catecholamine vasopressors compared with catecholamines alone was associated with a lower risk of atrial fibrillation. Findings for secondary outcomes varied.

Recommendation

Given the paucity of proven interventions for, and the high mortality in, hospital cardiac arrest patients, it is reasonable to consider a combination of vasopressin, steroids and epinephrine during resuscitation and during the post-resuscitation shock phase.

### Vasopressin and epinephrine in the treatment of cardiac arrest: an experimental study [^116eEZ4G]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our study has demonstrated that the combination of epinephrine and vasopressin in the treatment of VF cardiac arrest improved perfusion pressures and short-term survival, in comparison to the single use of epinephrine. This study adds some evidence to the existing literature of the epinephrine-vasopressin combination benefits and further evaluation of these results should be undertaken in the future.

### Advanced life support. drug therapy and vascular access [^111G5to1]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Cardiac arrest vasopressors — Red Cross guidelines specify that epinephrine 1 milligram intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO) may be administered after initial defibrillation attempts are unsuccessful for cardiac arrest with a shockable rhythm and may be repeated every 3 to 5 minutes. For cardiac arrest with non-shockable rhythms, epinephrine should be administered at 1 milligram IV or IO as early as possible and repeated every 3 to 5 minutes. Vasopressin should not be used in place of epinephrine nor in addition to epinephrine for cardiac arrest.

### The effects of endogenous and exogenous vasopressin during experimental cardiopulmonary resuscitation [^116faqe9]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2001). Low credibility.

Exogenous vasopressin is a promising vasopressor when blood pressure is critically threatened, but the role of endogenous vasopressin during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is unknown. We assessed the role of endogenous versus exogenous vasopressin in a porcine open chest CPR model. Seven minutes before induction of cardiac arrest, seven pigs received 10 microg/kg of a selective vasopressin V(1)-receptor-antagonist (Blocked Vasopressin group); another 12 pigs in two groups received saline administration only. After 4 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation followed by 3 min of basic life support CPR, six animals received 0.8 U/kg vasopressin (Exogenous Vasopressin group), whereas the blocked vasopressin group (n = 7), and the remaining six animals received saline placebo only (Endogenous Vasopressin group). Defibrillation was attempted after 14 min of CPR. During basic life support CPR, left ventricular myocardial blood flow was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in the Blocked Vasopressin group compared with the Exogenous Vasopressin group and Endogenous Vasopressin group (42 ± 5 compared with 64 ± 6 and 66 ± 6 mL x min(-1) x 100g(-1)). Left ventricular myocardial blood flow was significantly decreased in the Blocked Vasopressin group versus Exogenous Vasopressin group versus Endogenous Vasopressin group 90 s and 5 min after drug administration, respectively (38 ± 4 and 27 ± 3 vs 145 ± 32 and 110 ± 12 vs 62 ± 4 and 56 ± 6 mL x min(-1) x 100g(-1), respectively). None of seven Blocked Vasopressin animals, six of six Exogenous Vasopressin pigs, and six of six Endogenous Vasopressin swine had return of spontaneous circulation after 14 min of cardiac arrest including 10 min of CPR (P < 0.05). In conclusion, pigs with blocked endogenous vasopressin had poor coronary perfusion pressure and left ventricular myocardial blood flow during open chest CPR, and could not be successfully resuscitated. All pigs with effective endogenous vasopressin or pigs with effective endogenous vasopressin and additional exogenous vasopressin had good left ventricular myocardial blood flow during experimental CPR, and survived the 1-h postresuscitation phase. We conclude that endogenous vasopressin is an adjunct vasopressor to epinephrine and may serve as a back-up regulator to maintain cardiocirculatory homeostasis.

### Vasopressin improves outcome in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia: a observational cohort study [^114G42c5]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Comparing the groups in our trial, significant differences were found between vasopressin groups (groups II and III) and the adrenaline group (group I) in the rate of ROSC with hospitalization and in 24-hour survival rate. In the study there were no significant differences in rates of hospital discharge between vasopressin groups and adrenaline group, as was reported previously. Lindner and coworkers reported that a significantly larger proportion of patients treated with vasopressin were resuscitated and survived 24 hours as compared with those treated with adrenaline. Stiell and coworkers observed no difference between adrenaline and vasopressin groups in survival rates at 1 hour and 30 days. Several differences between these two studies may account for their results. Vasopressin was administered much later in the study by Lindner and coworkers than in that by Stiell and colleagues. Compared with adrenaline, vasopressin exerts greater vasoconstriction in hypoxic and acidotic conditions, and so the rapid response and early treatment in the study by Stiell and colleagues may explain the lack of difference observed between vasopressin and adrenaline. Vasopressin improved perfusion pressures during CPR in patients with VF/VT in a trial conducted by Wenzel and coworkers, but it did not improved the outcome. In that trial there was no difference in findings between vasopressin groups. This observation may indicate that the interactions between adrenaline and vasopressin improve ROSC and short-term survival in VF/VT arrest. In the present study we also showed that the sequence of vasopressin administered (for example, initially or after adrenaline) was not important; what was important was combined therapy with the two drugs. This findings suggests that the presence of one of these drugs may enhance the effects of the other.

### Vasopressin improves outcome in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia: a observational cohort study [^113RXge6]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Results

The total numbers of episodes of cardiac arrest for the three study periods (for example, groups I, II and III), the number of resuscitation attempts along with the specific rhythms and outcomes, and various other CPR variables are summarized in Table 1.

We retrospectively studied 51 adult patients in nontraumatic, out-of-hospital VF/VT cardiac arrest who received only adrenaline 1 mg every three minutes during CPR (group I). The average dose of adrenaline was 6.3 ± 3.5 mg (range 1–16 mg; Table 2). This value was higher than the average dose of adrenaline in the vasopressin groups (groups II and III; P < 0.05). We also prospectively studied 31 patients in VF/VT cardiac arrest who received vasopressin after three doses of 1 mg adrenaline (group II), and 27 patients who received vasopressin as the first-line therapy (group III). There were no statistically significant differences in sex, age, time elapsed before initiation of CPR, suspected cause of cardiac arrest, witnessed arrest, and bystander basic life support between the three groups (Table 2). The time to resuscitation by the medical team was significantly longer in patients in the adrenaline-only group than in the vasopressin groups (P < 0.05). The rate of restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) with hospital admission, and the 24-hour survival rate were significantly higher among patients in the vasopressin groups (P < 0.05); rates were similar between the two vasopressin groups (P = 0.79; Table 2).

Regarding medical management for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to nonvasopressor medications, other agents, AHA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that the use of β-blockers, bretylium, procainamide, or sotalol for VF or pulseless VT unresponsive to defibrillation is of uncertain benefit.

### Meta-analysis of efficacy of vasopressin during cardiopulmonary resuscitation [^111ZCpYC]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of vasopressin versus standard of care during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) have yielded conflicting results. An electronic search of MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Embase databases was conducted through February 2022 for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the outcomes of vasopressin versus standard of care during CPR among patients with cardiac arrest. The primary outcome was the likelihood of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) return. Data were pooled using the random-effects model. The final analysis included 11 trials with 6,609 patients. The weighted mean age was 65.5 years, and 68.2% were men. There was no significant difference between the vasopressin and control groups in the likelihood of ROSC (33.1% vs 31.9%, odds ratio [OR] 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98 to 1.55). Subgroup analyses suggested that the use of vasopressin versus control increased the likelihood of ROSC when used in combination with steroids (p interaction = 0.01) and in cases of in-hospital cardiac arrest (p interaction = 0.01). There was no significant difference between the vasopressin and control groups in the likelihood of favorable neurological outcome (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.71), in-hospital mortality (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.31), or ventricular arrhythmias (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.97). In conclusion, compared with the standard of care, the use of vasopressin during CPR did not increase the likelihood of ROSC among patients with cardiac arrest. There was no difference between the vasopressin and control groups in the likelihood of the favorable neurological outcome, in-hospital mortality, or ventricular arrhythmias.

### Vasopressin improves outcome in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia: a observational cohort study [^1124G2Qq]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

In patients with myocardial infarction we found significantly higher rates of ROSC and hospital discharge in groups treated with vasopressin than in the adrenaline group. This observation has potentially important consequence for the treatment of VF/VT cardiac arrest in the prehospital setting. Our findings strongly support combined administration of vasopressin and adrenaline during CPR among patients in VF/VT arrest caused by myocardial infarction.

Our study has some important limitations. This observational study was limited by the small number of patients included, and our findings in patients with AMI require confirmation in a larger multicentre clinical trial. Indeed, the ideal comparison between the three groups would be performed within the context of a randomized controlled clinical trial; however, such a 'perfect' study could may be considered unethical because, in our view, it is unacceptable to withhold vasopressin when it is available. We are aware that the nonrandomized setting in which our study was conducted dilutes the value of our conclusions but, in a field in which there are few clinical investigations, we believe that the study provides important additional data that may help to improve outcomes in patients with cardiac arrest.

### A comparison of vasopressin and epinephrine for out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation [^1138vf1f]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Vasopressin is an alternative to epinephrine for vasopressor therapy during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but clinical experience with this treatment has been limited.

Methods

We randomly assigned adults who had had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to receive two injections of either 40 IU of vasopressin or 1 mg of epinephrine, followed by additional treatment with epinephrine if needed. The primary end point was survival to hospital admission, and the secondary end point was survival to hospital discharge.

Results

A total of 1219 patients underwent randomization; 33 were excluded because of missing study-drug codes. Among the remaining 1186 patients, 589 were assigned to receive vasopressin and 597 to receive epinephrine. The two treatment groups had similar clinical profiles. There were no significant differences in the rates of hospital admission between the vasopressin group and the epinephrine group either among patients with ventricular fibrillation (46.2 percent vs. 43.0 percent, P = 0.48) or among those with pulseless electrical activity (33.7 percent vs. 30.5 percent, P = 0.65). Among patients with asystole, however, vasopressin use was associated with significantly higher rates of hospital admission (29.0 percent, vs. 20.3 percent in the epinephrine group; P = 0.02) and hospital discharge (4.7 percent vs. 1.5 percent, P = 0.04). Among 732 patients in whom spontaneous circulation was not restored with the two injections of the study drug, additional treatment with epinephrine resulted in significant improvement in the rates of survival to hospital admission and hospital discharge in the vasopressin group, but not in the epinephrine group (hospital admission rate, 25.7 percent vs. 16.4 percent; P = 0.002; hospital discharge rate, 6.2 percent vs. 1.7 percent; P = 0.002). Cerebral performance was similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

The effects of vasopressin were similar to those of epinephrine in the management of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless electrical activity, but vasopressin was superior to epinephrine in patients with asystole. Vasopressin followed by epinephrine may be more effective than epinephrine alone in the treatment of refractory cardiac arrest.

Vasopressor use during cardiac arrest — evidence overview indicates that epinephrine use during cardiac arrest has been shown to improve rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival. The most recent ILCOR review with meta-analysis was completed in 2019 and used to inform the Red Cross guidelines, concluding that randomized controlled trial data suggest epinephrine improves ROSC, survival to hospital discharge, and 3-month survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, with more pronounced improvement in short-term outcomes for non-shockable rhythms; vasopressin with or without epinephrine was not shown to provide a benefit compared with epinephrine alone. A 2022 ILCOR evidence update identified multiple new observational studies and secondary analyses, and the reviewers concluded that there is insufficient new data.

### Vasopressin improves outcome in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia: a observational cohort study [^117LVXpQ]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

When adjusting for differences in age, sex, basic life support from bystanders, time elapsed before initiation of CPR, witnessed arrest, response time, and administration of amiodarone and bicarbonate, the odds ratio for ROSC among patients who received vasopressin (groups II and III) versus the adrenaline group (group I) was 3.1 (95% confidence interval 1.7–8.3; P < 0.01). With the same adjustment as for ROSC, the odds ratio for survival of the first 24 hour survival among patients who received vasopressin versus the adrenaline group was 3.8 (95% confidence interval 1.5–9.1; P < 0.01).

Rates of ROSC with admission to hospital and hospital discharge in patients with AMI were significantly higher in the vasopressin groups than in the adrenaline group (discharge: four out of 32 patients [12.5%] in group I; five out of 20 patients [25%] in group II; five out of 18 patients [28%] in group III; P < 0.05). The adjusted odds ratio for ROSC with admission to hospital among patients with AMI in the vasopressin groups versus the adrenaline group was 2.8 (95% confidence interval 1.4–4.8; P < 0.01). The adjusted odds ratio for surviving to hospital discharge among patients with AMI in the vasopressin groups versus the adrenaline group was 2.9 (95% confidence interval 1.1–5.3; P = 0.01). There was no significant difference between the groups in ROSC rate when patients with primary arrythmia were compared with patients with other causes of cardiac arrest (Table 3).

Regarding medical management for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to nonvasopressor medications, amiodarone and lidocaine, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider administering IV lidocaine in patients with a witnessed cardiac arrest due to VF or polymorphic VT unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and vasopressor therapy.

### Vasopressin combined with epinephrine during cardiac resuscitation: a solution for the future? [^115fNb62]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Epinephrine given during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause beta-mimetic complications in the postresuscitation phase. Vasopressin may be an alternative vasopressor drug during CPR. A subgroup analysis of a large prospective CPR investigation and of retrospective CPR studies suggests that vasopressin may be especially beneficial when combined with epinephrine. Beneficial effects of adding vasopressin were observed in other catecholamine-refractory shock states as well, such as vasodilatory shock and haemorrhagic shock. In order to maximize effects of any vasopressor during CPR, rapid aggressive chest compressions must be ensured to maximize blood flow and to enable advanced cardiac life support drugs to reach the arterial vasculature. We suggest alternating injections of 1 mg epinephrine i.v. and 40 IU vasopressin i.v. every 3–5 minutes during CPR until spontaneous circulation can be achieved or CPR efforts are terminated.

### Vasopressin and epinephrine in the treatment of cardiac arrest: an experimental study [^117PkcaZ]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

However, the recent international literature is not very encouraging in the use of vasopressin as a single agent of choice for cardiac arrest. On a systematic review and meta-analysis of 1,519 patients with cardiac arrest from 5 randomized controlled trials, the results demonstrate that there is no clear advantage of vasopressin over epinephrine and that vasopressin should not be recommended on resuscitation protocols until more solid human data on its superiority are available.

In a multicenter trial, the effects of vasopressin were similar to those of epinephrine in the management of cardiac arrest and pulseless electrical activity (PEA). On the other hand, most of the porcine models of cardiac arrest give encouraging results. Biondi-Zoccai et al, in a meta-analysis including 33 animal studies, showed that vasopressin appeared to be superior to both placebo and epinephrine in VF cardiac arrest. These seemingly contradictory findings may be explained by the fact that many of the studies do not take into account a subgroup analysis such as the distinction between VF, PEA and asystole. Another fact that should be taken into consideration is that many experimental models refer to asphyxial cardiac arrest, which implies a different mechanism of induction of cardiac arrest than electrical stimulation, and also leads to a severely hypoxic myocardium. All of these facts may suggest that the usual approach of pharmacological CPR management to administer identical drugs and dosages for patients with cardiac arrest caused by different factors may have to be reconsidered. Furthermore, it is possible that when the degree of ischemia is fundamental, as during asphyxia, or when advanced cardiac life support is prolonged, a combination of vasopressin with epinephrine may be beneficial. Wenzel et al also provided recent supported for this finding in a clinical trial where the Vaso-Epi patient subgroup had significantly higher ROSC and hospital discharge rates. This finding may indicate that the interactions among vasopressin, epinephrine and the underlying degree of ischemia during CPR may be more complex than was thought previously. Even if the Vaso-Epi subset of patients in the aforementioned study was fortuitous, our data also show a stronger vasoconstrictive effect of the combination of the two drugs in comparison to epinephrine alone in the first minute of CPR with an increase of CPP. This increase was further attenuated in the second minute when diastolic aortic pressure and CPP are significantly increased.

### Clinical practice recommendations on the management of perioperative cardiac arrest: a report from the PERIOPCA consortium [^112g9mdz]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary of PERIOPCA recommendations

ETCO 2 as a prognosis tool of cardiac arrest

In patients with PERIOPCA, it may be reasonable to maintain an ETCO 2 ≥ 10 mmHg during advanced life support. However, ETCO 2 should be evaluated in the context of the patient's clinical status and individualized targets may be necessary considering the cause of arrest, the degree of hypoxia, the quality of CPR and time to ROSC (COR/LOE: IIb/C-EO).

Monitoring physiological parameters during CPR

In adults with cardiac arrest in the perioperative setting, the use of physiological feedback may be reasonable to increase CPR quality and improve short- and long-term outcome (COR/LOE: IIb/C-EO).

Chest compression or defibrillation strategy for ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT)

In adult patients with PERIOPCA, ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia should be defibrillated within 3 min after the onset of the arrest (COR/LOE: I/C-LD). The use of AEDs in patients with ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia can be useful for improving survival (COR/LOE: IIa/C-LD). It is not recommended to defibrillate patients with ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia lasting more than 3 min without prior chest compressions (COR/LOE: III/C-LD).

Timing of administration of epinephrine

In adult patients with PERIOPCA, epinephrine administration after the 3rd shock can be beneficial (COR/LOE: IIa/C-LD).

Standard-dose epinephrine (SDE) versus low-dose epinephrine (LDE) or high-dose epinephrine (HDE)

In patients with PERIOPCA, it may be reasonable to administer 1 mg epinephrine for improving coronary perfusion pressure (COR/LOE: IIb/C-EO).

No vasopressor versus epinephrine, or vasopressin

In patients with PERIOPCA, it may be reasonable to administer epinephrine every 3–5 min (COR/LOE: IIb/C-EO).

### Time-dependent interventions [^114v7wAv]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

The contribution by Pepe and colleagues provides additional evidence that initial defibrillation is not necessarily the optimal intervention for victims of cardiac arrest and especially when cardiac arrest has been untreated for more than 3 min. Precordial compression therefore remains the mainstay of basic life support cardiopulmonary resuscitation after sudden death. It is increasingly apparent that neither epinephrine whether in conventional or high doses nor vasopressin improve ultimate survival. To the contrary, there is evidence favoring beta1-adrenergic blockade.

### A critical reappraisal of vasopressin and steroids in in-hospital cardiac arrest [^112WphBY]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Epinephrine during resuscitation

Advanced life support (ALS) objectives include maximization of coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) for prompt return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and minimization of cardiac arrest-associated ischemia–reperfusion injury. Epinephrine, the standard ALS vasopressor, improves ROSC rate, with uncertain effect on neurological outcome. Epinephrine efficacy is limited by its potential to cause arrhythmias, myocardial ischemic contracture, and cerebral microcirculatory dysfunction.

### Arginine vasopressin during cardiopulmonary resuscitation: laboratory evidence, clinical experience and recommendations, and a view to the future [^113zaTGo]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

When stimulating adult pigs with ventricular fibrillation or postcountershock pulseless electrical activity for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, vasopressin improved vital organ blood flow, cerebral oxygen delivery, ability to be resuscitated, and neurologic recovery better than epinephrine. In pediatric preparations with asphyxia, epinephrine was superior to vasopressin, whereas in both pediatric pigs with ventricular fibrillation and adult porcine models with asphyxia, combinations of vasopressin and epinephrine proved to be highly effective. This may suggest that a different efficiency of vasopressors in pediatric vs. adult preparations and different effects of dysrhythmic vs. asphyxial cardiac arrest on vasopressor efficiency may be of significant importance. Whether these theories can be extrapolated to humans is unknown at this time. In patients who experienced out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation, a larger proportion of patients treated with vasopressin survived 24 hrs compared with patients treated with epinephrine; during in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation, comparable short-term survival was found in groups treated with either vasopressin or epinephrine. Currently, a large trial comprising patients who experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and who are treated with vasopressin vs. epinephrine is ongoing in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The new cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidelines of both the American Heart Association and the European Resuscitation Council consider 40 units of vasopressin intravenously and 1 mg of epinephrine intravenously equally effective for the treatment of adult patients with ventricular fibrillation; however, because of a lack of clinical data, no recommendation for vasopressin has been made for adult patients with asystole and pulseless electrical activity or for pediatric patients.

Experimental Protocol

Following hemodynamic measurements at baseline, ventricular fibrillation was electrically induced by an alternating current of 5 to 10 V and 1 to 2 mA by a 5 F pacing catheter. Mechanical ventilation and anesthesia were discontinued after cardiac arrest, which was identified by a ventricular fibrillation pattern on the ECG and a systolic arterial blood pressure < 25 mmHg. To prevent clot formation, the animals received heparin (100 IU/kg) prior to induction of cardiac arrest. After a 7-minute nonintervention interval of untreated ventricular fibrillation, basic life support CPR was simulated for 2 minutes, applying external manual chest compressions at a rate of 100 per minute with a 50% duty cycle, a compression depth of 25% of the anterior–posterior diameter of the chest wall, and ventilations with 100% oxygen at 12 breaths per minute. Subsequently, advanced cardiac life support was started with alternating administration of 15 μg/kg epinephrine and 0.3 IU/kg vasopressin every second minute. The first biphasic defibrillation attempt was administered after a total of 4 minutes of chest compressions at 3 J/kg according to the 1-shock protocol and was repeated every 2 minutes with increasing energy up to 4 J/kg as suggested by the AHA guidelines(Figure 2). Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was defined as maintenance of an unassisted pulse and a systolic aortic blood pressure ≥ 60 mm Hg lasting for 10 consecutive minutes according to the Utstein-style guidelines.CPR was terminated when resuscitation remained unsuccessful for 23 minutes.

### Emergency medicine updates: cardiac arrest medications [^1171dQCu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac arrest is a serious condition frequently managed in the emergency department (ED). Medications are a component of cardiac arrest management.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning medications used for patients in cardiac arrest.

Discussion

Several medications have been evaluated for use in cardiac arrest. Routes of administration may include intravenous (IV) and intraosseous (IO). IV administration is recommended, though if an attempt at IV access is unsuccessful, IO access can be utilized. Epinephrine is a core component of guidelines, which recommend 1 mg in those with shockable rhythms if initial CPR and defibrillation are unsuccessful, while in nonshockable rhythms, guidelines recommend that epinephrine 1 mg be administered as soon as feasible. While epinephrine may improve rates of ROSC, it is not associated with improved survival with a favorable neurologic outcome. Evidence suggests the combination of vasopressin, steroids, and epinephrine may improve ROSC among those with in-hospital cardiac arrest, but there is no improvement in survival to discharge and survival with a favorable neurologic outcome. Antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, lidocaine, procainamide) likely do not improve short-term or long-term survival or neurologic outcomes, though guidelines state that amiodarone may be used in those with cardiac arrest and refractory pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF). Calcium and sodium bicarbonate should not be routinely administered in those with cardiac arrest. Beta-blockers may be considered in those with shock-resistant pVT/VF.

Conclusions

An understanding of literature updates concerning medication use in cardiac can improve the ED care of these patients.

### Revised resuscitation guidelines: adrenaline versus adrenaline / vasopressin in a pig model of cardiopulmonary resuscitation – a randomised, controlled trial [^1169cKUD]. Resuscitation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Synergistic effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) and vasopressin may be beneficial during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, it is unknown whether either adrenaline alone or an alternating administration of adrenaline and vasopressin is better for restoring vital organ perfusion following basic life support (BLS) according to the revised algorithm with a compression-to-ventilation (c/v) ratio of 30:2.

Material and Methods

After 4min of ventricular fibrillation, and 6min of BLS with a c/v ratio of 30:2, 16 pigs were randomised to receive either 45microg/kg adrenaline, or alternating 45microg/kg adrenaline and 0.4U/kg vasopressin, respectively.

Results

Coronary perfusion pressure (mean ± S.D.) 20 and 25min after cardiac arrest was 7 ± 4 and 5 ± 3mm Hg after adrenaline, and 25 ± 2 and 14 ± 3mm Hg after adrenaline/vasopressin (p < 0.001 and < 0.01 versus adrenaline), respectively. Cerebral perfusion pressure was 23 ± 7 and 19 ± 9mm Hg after adrenaline, and 40 ± 10 and 33 ± 7mm Hg after adrenaline/vasopressin (p < 0.001 and < 0.01 versus adrenaline), and cerebral blood flow was 30 ± 10 and 27 ± 11% of baseline after adrenaline, and 65 ± 40 and 50 ± 31% of baseline after adrenaline/vasopressin (p < 0.05 versus adrenaline), respectively. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) did not differ significantly between the adrenaline group (0/8) and the adrenaline/vasopressin group (3/8).

Conclusion

Adrenaline/vasopressin resulted in higher coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures, and cerebral blood flow, while ROSC was comparable.

### Vasopressin and epinephrine in the treatment of cardiac arrest: an experimental study [^112o972F]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Epinephrine remains the drug of choice for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The aim of the present study is to assess whether the combination of vasopressin and epinephrine, given their different mechanisms of action, provides better results than epinephrine alone in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Methods

Ventricular fibrillation was induced in 22 Landrace/Large-White piglets, which were left untreated for 8 minutes before attempted resuscitation with precordial compression, mechanical ventilation and electrical defibrillation. Animals were randomized into 2 groups during cardiopulmonary resuscitation: 11 animals who received saline as placebo (20 mL dilution, bolus) + epinephrine (0.02 mg/kg) (Epi group); and 11 animals who received vasopressin (0.4 IU/kg/20 mL dilution, bolus) + epinephrine (0.02 mg/kg) (Vaso-Epi group). Electrical defibrillation was attempted after 10 minutes of ventricular fibrillation.

Results

Ten of 11 animals in the Vaso-Epi group restored spontaneous circulation in comparison to only 4 of 11 in the Epi group (p = 0.02). Aortic diastolic pressure, as well as, coronary perfusion pressure were significantly increased (p < 0.05) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the Vaso-Epi group.

Conclusion

The administration of vasopressin in combination with epinephrine during cardiopulmonary resuscitation results in a drastic improvement in the hemodynamic parameters necessary for the return of spontaneous circulation.

### Vasopressin use across shock states: international insights from an international ESICM-endorsed survey: the PRESS survey [^114Zzb8B]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Septic shock is one of the leading causes of admission in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is still associated with high mortality and morbidity. The initial hemodynamic management of patients with septic shock consists of fluid resuscitation and norepinephrine administration, which is currently the recommended first-line vasopressor.

Current guidelines suggest adding vasopressin rather than increasing the norepinephrine dose when mean arterial pressure (MAP) is considered inadequate despite doses of norepinephrine of 0.25–0.5 µg/kg/min. Introduction of vasopressin is justified by vasopressin deficiency occurring in one third of patients with septic shock and using vasopressin in patients with septic shock already receiving norepinephrine may be associated with decreased requirement of renal replacement therapy and less atrial fibrillation. Additionally, using high-doses of norepinephrine may be associated with poorer outcomes and adverse cardiac effects like myocardial inflammation and necrosis. On the other hand, vasopressin use is associated with a higher incidence of digital ischemia, without any effect on mortality.

Supporting evidence underpinning current guidelines is limited and many questions regarding the use of vasopressin and its analogues remain unresolved: their availability, the triggers for their initiation and the timing for their initiation. This international survey aimed to address the use of vasopressin and its analogues in patients with septic shock in ICUs around the world.

### Vasopressin for cardiac arrest: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1164Q1Xt]. Resuscitation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Prior meta-analyses-reported results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1997 and 2004 failed to show any vasopressin-related benefit in cardiac arrest. Based on new RCT-data and a hypothesis of a potentially increased vasoconstricting efficacy of vasopressin, we sought to determine whether the cumulative, current evidence supports or refutes an overall and/or selective benefit for vasopressin regarding sustained restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), long-term survival, and neurological outcome.

Methods

Two reviewers independently searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database for RCTs assigning adults with cardiac arrest to treatment with a vasopressin-containing regimen (vasopressin-group) vs adrenaline (epinephrine) alone (control-group) and reporting on long-term outcomes. Data from 4475 patients in 6 high-methodological quality RCTs were analyzed. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to initial cardiac rhythm and time from collapse to drug administration (T(DRUG)) < 20 min.

Results

Vasopressin vs. control did not improve overall rates of sustained ROSC, long-term survival, or favourable neurological outcome. However, in asystole, vasopressin vs. control was associated with higher long-term survival {odds ratio (OR) = 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04–3.12, P = 0.04}. In asystolic patients of RCTs with average T(DRUG) < 20 min, vasopressin vs. control increased the rates of sustained ROSC (data available from 2 RCTs; OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.17–2.47, P = 0.005) and long-term survival (data available from 3 RCTs; OR = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.19–6.79, P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Vasopressin use in the resuscitation of cardiac arrest patients is not associated with any overall benefit or harm. However, vasopressin may improve the long-term survival of asystolic patients, especially when average T(DRUG) is < 20 min.

### Advanced life support. drug therapy and vascular access [^116TtGAy]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Evidence summary — vasopressin with corticosteroids in cardiac arrest indicates that a 2021 American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council Answer on the combined use of vasopressin with corticosteroids for in-hospital cardiac arrest identified three randomized controlled trials reporting higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) with the combined use of vasopressin with corticosteroids. The most recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), however, failed to show a benefit for survival to hospital discharge or for favorable functional outcome at hospital discharge. A recent systematic review and International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation Consensus on Science with Treatment Recommendations concluded that while intra-arrest administration of vasopressin with corticosteroids improved ROSC, this was not shown for outcomes of survival to hospital discharge and favorable functional outcome at hospital discharge. There continues to be no evidence specific to cardiac arrest in the out-of-hospital setting. This systematic review was used to generate weak treatment recommendations that suggest against the combined use of vasopressin with corticosteroids in addition to the standard care for adult in-hospital cardiac arrest and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

### Improving vasopressor use in cardiac arrest [^111mkdLK]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Vasopressin

Vasopressin, a naturally occurring hormone, given at high doses is a potent vasoconstrictor, acting via V1a receptors located on smooth muscle cells to increase systemic vascular resistance. It was recommended in resuscitation guidelines between 2000 to 2015. The Cochrane review of vasopressors in cardiac arrest examined the use of vasopressin as an alternative to adrenaline and in addition to adrenaline.

Vasopressin as an alternative to adrenaline

The review identified six randomised controlled trials that compared vasopressin with standard dose adrenaline. Vasopressin improved survival to hospital admission (RR 1.27 (95% CI 1.04–1.54); 3 studies, 1954 participants), but had no effect on ROSC (RR 1.10 (95% CI 0.90–1.33); 6 studies, 2531 participants), survival at hospital discharge (RR 1.25 (95% CI 0.84–1.85); 6 studies, 2511 participants) or favourable neurological outcome (RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.54–1.25); 4 studies, 2406 participants). Evidence certainty was ranked as low for survival to hospital admission and very low for return of spontaneous which may explain, in part, the difference in observed effect despite the outcomes occurring at a similar time-point. The absence of consistent evidence that either drug is superior may be due to their broadly similar pharmacological effects as vasoconstrictors or, possibly, that that previous trials comparing the two drugs were underpowered to detect any small difference in effect.

Vasopressin in addition to adrenaline

Three randomised controlled trials compared vasopressin and adrenaline with adrenaline alone in out of hospital cardiac arrest. The combination of vasopressin and adrenaline did not improve any short-term or long-term outcome (e.g. survival to hospital discharge RR 0.76 (95% CI 0.47–1.22); three trials, 3242 participants).

### Improving vasopressor use in cardiac arrest [^112dprwv]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The Chain of Survival highlights the effectiveness of early recognition of cardiac arrest and call for help, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation and early defibrillation. Most patients, however, remain in cardiac arrest despite these interventions. Drug treatments, particularly the use of vasopressors, have been included in resuscitation algorithms since their inception. This narrative review describes the current evidence base for vasopressors and reports that adrenaline (1 mg) is highly effective at achieving return of spontaneous circulation (number needed to treat 4) but is less effective on long-term outcomes (survival to 30 days, number needed to treat 111) with uncertain effects on survival with a favourable neurological outcome. Randomised trials evaluating vasopressin, either as an alternative to or in addition to adrenaline, and high-dose adrenaline have failed to find evidence of improved long-term outcomes. There is a need for future trials to evaluate the interaction between steroids and vasopressin. Evidence for other vasopressors (e.g. noradrenaline, phenylephedrine) is insufficient to support or refute their use. The use of intravenous calcium chloride as a routine intervention in out of hospital cardiac arrest is not associated with benefit and may cause harm. The optimal route for vascular access between peripheral intravenous versus intraosseous routes is currently the subject of two large randomised trials. Intracardiac, endobronchial, and intramuscular routes are not recommended. Central venous administration should be limited to patients where an existing central venous catheter is in situ and patent.

### Adrenaline and vasopressin for cardiac arrest [^116b9dPG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adrenaline and vasopressin are widely used to treat people with cardiac arrest, but there is uncertainty about the safety, effectiveness and the optimal dose.

Objectives

To determine whether adrenaline or vasopressin, or both, administered during cardiac arrest, afford any survival benefit.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase and DARE from their inception to 8 May 2018, and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation 2015 Advanced Life Support Consensus on Science and Treatment Recommendations. We also searched four trial registers on 5 September 2018 and checked the reference lists of the included studies and review papers to identify potential papers for review.

Selection Criteria

Any randomised controlled trial comparing: standard-dose adrenaline versus placebo; standard-dose adrenaline versus high-dose adrenaline; and adrenaline versus vasopressin, in any setting, due to any cause of cardiac arrest, in adults and children. There were no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified trials for review, assessed risks of bias and extracted data, resolving disagreements through re-examination of the trial reports and by discussion. We used risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare dichotomous outcomes for clinical events. There were no continuous outcomes reported. We examined groups of trials for heterogeneity. We report the quality of evidence for each outcome, using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 26 studies (21,704 participants). Moderate-quality evidence found that adrenaline increased survival to hospital discharge compared to placebo (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.86; 2 studies, 8538 participants; an increase from 23 to 32 per 1000, 95% CI 25 to 42). We are uncertain about survival to hospital discharge for high-dose compared to standard-dose adrenaline (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.62; participants = 6274; studies = 10); an increase from 33 to 36 per 1000, 95% CI 24 to 53); standard-dose adrenaline versus vasopressin (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.85; 6 studies; 2511 participants; an increase from 72 to 90 per 1000, 95% CI 60 to 133); and standard-dose adrenaline versus vasopressin plus adrenaline (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.22; 3 studies; 3242 participants; a possible decrease from 24 to 18 per 1000, 95% CI 11 to 29), due to very low-quality evidence. Moderate-quality evidence found that adrenaline compared with placebo increased survival to hospital admission (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.76; 2 studies, 8489 participants; an increase from 83 to 209 per 1000, 95% CI 139 to 313). We are uncertain about survival to hospital admission when comparing standard-dose with high-dose adrenaline, due to very low-quality evidence. Vasopressin may improve survival to hospital admission when compared with standard-dose adrenaline (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.54; 3 studies, 1953 participants; low-quality evidence; an increase from 260 to 330 per 1000, 95% CI 270 to 400), and may make little or no difference when compared to standard-dose adrenaline plus vasopressin (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08; 3 studies; 3249 participants; low-quality evidence; a decrease from 218 to 207 per 1000 (95% CI 181 to 236). There was no evidence that adrenaline (any dose) or vasopressin improved neurological outcomes. The rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was higher for standard-dose adrenaline versus placebo (RR 2.86, 95% CI 2.21 to 3.71; participants = 8663; studies = 3); moderate-quality evidence; an increase from 115 to 329 per 1000, 95% CI 254 to 427). We are uncertain about the effect on ROSC for the comparison of standard-dose versus high-dose adrenaline and standard-does adrenaline compared to vasopressin, due to very low-quality evidence. Standard-dose adrenaline may make little or no difference to ROSC when compared to standard-dose adrenaline plus vasopressin (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.08; 3 studies, 3249 participants; low-quality evidence; a possible decrease from 299 to 290 per 1000, 95% CI 260 to 323). The source of funding was not stated in 11 of the 26 studies. The study drugs were provided by the manufacturer in four of the 26 studies, but neither drug represents a profitable commercial option. The other 11 studies were funded by organisations such as research foundations and government funding bodies.

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides moderate-quality evidence that standard-dose adrenaline compared to placebo improves return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital admission and survival to hospital discharge, but low-quality evidence that it did not affect survival with a favourable neurological outcome. Very low -quality evidence found that high-dose adrenaline compared to standard-dose adrenaline improved return of spontaneous circulation and survival to admission. Vasopressin compared to standard dose adrenaline improved survival to admission but not return of spontaneous circulation, whilst the combination of adrenaline and vasopressin compared with adrenaline alone had no effect on these outcomes. Neither standard dose adrenaline, high-dose adrenaline, vasopressin nor a combination of adrenaline and vasopressin improved survival with a favourable neurological outcome. Many of these studies were conducted more than 20 years ago. Treatment has changed in recent years, so the findings from older studies may not reflect current practice.

### Epinephrine, vasopressin and steroids for in-hospital cardiac arrest: the right cocktail therapy? [^112BQwiq]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Commentary

In-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Among in-hospital post-cardiac arrest patients, survival to hospital discharge is approximately 20%. Among these survivors, the prevalence of severe disability or vegetative state ranges from 25% to 50%.

During resuscitation from cardiac arrest, coronary perfusion pressure is driven by the difference between aortic diastolic pressure and right atrial pressure. Vasopressor drugs act primarily by increasing aortic diastolic pressure and systemic vascular resistance, thus increasing coronary perfusion pressure. For many years epinephrine has been the standard vasopressor recommended in Advanced Cardiac Life Support algorithms. Epinephrine acts on both α- and β-receptors, increasing peripheral vasoconstriction and cardiac stimulation. The α-adrenergic effects are believed to be primarily responsible for increasing myocardial and cerebral blood flow and facilitating return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The β-effects of epinephrine on the heart are not beneficial during or after cardiac arrest, and may worsen post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction and increase myocardial oxygen consumption.

Vasopressin, an endogenous peptide synthesized in the hypothalamus, has been proposed as an adjunct to epinephrine in management of cardiac arrest. Vasopressin causes vasoconstriction of skin, skeletal muscle, and splanchnic circulation, thus increasing peripheral arterial resistance. These effects are mediated via V1 receptors, but unlike epinephrine, vasopressin has no direct effects on the myocardium. Vasopressin dilates cerebral blood vessels to a greater extent than epinephrine, it has a longer half-life, and its effect is not diminished by acidosis, common in prolonged cardiac arrest. Further support for possible benefits of vasopressin during cardiac arrest comes from the observation that vasopressin levels in post-cardiac arrest patients are higher in survivors compared to non-survivors. The role of steroids in stress states has been well studied and may be beneficial in cardiac arrest patients for several reasons. Steroids attenuate the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and improve cerebral perfusion. Cardiac arrest is a high stress state that is associated with SIRS-like response, decreased perfusion of the adrenal glands, and lower cortisol levels during and after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The release of adrenal hormone per se is impaired in post-cardiac arrest patients, thus leading to inadequate response to the physiological insult. The beneficial role of adrenal activation during cardiac arrest is supported by the high adrenocorticotropic hormone levels in successfully resuscitated cardiac arrest patients and low serum cortisol levels in patients with early post-resuscitation mortality. In addition, steroids potentiate the effects of the vasoconstrictors by facilitating intracellular signaling by vasoconstrictor receptors.

### Comparative effectiveness of vasopressin, steroids, and epinephrine-based regimens in cardiac arrest: a network meta-analysis of clinical trials [^111RCrfp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite extensive efforts to improve survival in cardiac arrest (CA), the optimal pharmacologic strategy during resuscitation remains uncertain. While prior meta-analyses have explored individual drug classes, the relative effectiveness of combined regimens remains inadequately defined. This network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to evaluate and compare the efficacy of triple therapy with vasopressin (VP), steroids, and epinephrine (EP) in CA patients.

Methods

A comprehensive electronic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, and other bibliographic databases. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of steroids, epinephrine, and vasopressin in CA patients were included. In trials that involved additional agents (e.g., lidocaine), only the data pertaining to epinephrine/vasopressor-based interventions were extracted and synthesized to ensure comparability with the study scope. Out of 3453 identified studies, 36 RCTs involving 21,768 patients were included. Interventions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation were categorized as monotherapy, double therapy, or triple therapy (VSE). Primary outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital admission, 24-h survival, and survival to hospital discharge. Neurological outcomes were also evaluated to determine functional recovery, when consistently reported, although heterogeneity of measurement tools precluded quantitative synthesis.

Results

Triple therapy (VSE) and the combination of epinephrine plus steroids demonstrated the highest probability of improving all major survival outcomes. Ranking analysis consistently favored VSE over monotherapies to improve clinical outcomes of CA patients.

Conclusion

This NMA provides comparative evidence supporting the superiority of epinephrine-steroid double therapy and VSE triple therapy in improving resuscitation outcomes in cardiac arrest. These findings may inform future guidelines and clinical decision-making.

### Epinephrine and vasopressin during cardiopulmonary resuscitation [^111Xf1d5]. Resuscitation (2005). Low credibility.

Epinephrine (adrenaline) and vasopressin have been by far the most commonly studied vasopressors in experimental cardiac arrest. Despite animal experimental studies suggesting improved outcomes in experimental cardiac arrest, clinical trials of pressor agents have failed to show clear cut benefit from either vasopressin or epinephrine, although few, if any, trials compared pressor agents to a placebo. The action of vasopressors in the heart, particularly beta1-adrenergic stimulation, is associated with adverse cardiac effects including post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction, worsening ventricular arrhythmias, and increasing myocardial oxygen consumption. Alpha2-adrenergic agonists, in experimental studies, show great promise in improving outcomes in experimental cardiac arrest, but have not been studied in humans. The combination of epinephrine and vasopressin may be effective, but has been incompletely studied. Clinical trials of vasopressor agents, which minimize direct myocardial effects are needed.

### Pulmonary gas exchange after cardiopulmonary resuscitation with either vasopressin or epinephrine [^1179xXJ6]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

It is well established that epinephrine administered during cardiopulmonary resuscitation results in pulmonary gas exchange disturbances. It is uncertain how vasopressin affects gas exchange after cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Design

Prospective, randomized experimental study.

Setting

Animal research laboratory.

Subjects

Twenty domestic pigs.

Interventions

Animals were subjected to ventricular fibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation by using either vasopressin or epinephrine. Hemodynamic and pulmonary gas exchange (multiple inert gas elimination technique) variables were recorded before cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 10, 30, 60, and 120 mins after return of spontaneous circulation when either epinephrine (control) or vasopressin was used.

Measurements and Main Results

At 10 mins after return of spontaneous circulation, blood flow to low V /Q lung units was increased in animals treated with epinephrine (17.8 ± 6 vs. 2.6 ± 3%, mean ± sd, p < .01). Resulting carbon dioxide elimination was impaired in animals treated with epinephrine but not in animals treated with vasopressin (PaCO2, 55 ± 2 vs. 46 ± 4 torr, p < .05). Thirty minutes after return of spontaneous circulation, blood flow to lung units with a normal VA /Q ratio was reduced in animals treated with epinephrine (79 ± 1 vs. 84 ± 12%, p < .05), resulting in a depressed PaO2 (147 ± 4 vs. 127 ± 10 torr, p < .05).

Conclusion

Vasopressin compared with epinephrine for cardiopulmonary resuscitation resulted in better gas exchange variables in the early postresuscitation phase.

### Vasopressin or epinephrine for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^112ffohg]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The use of vasopressin in patients with cardiac arrest presenting with specific rhythms is controversial. We performed an evidence-based emergency medicine review of evidence comparing vasopressin to epinephrine in structured cardiac arrest protocols.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and other databases for randomized trials or systematic reviews comparing vasopressin to epinephrine for adults with cardiac arrest and measuring survival to hospital discharge and neurologic function in survivors. We used standard criteria to appraise the quality of published trials and systematic reviews. We used the random effects model in supplementary analyses to summarize results and to test for significant differences across subgroups of patients presenting with different arrest rhythms.

Results

We found 3 high-quality well-reported randomized trials and 1 rigorous meta-analysis. The evidence does not confirm a consistent benefit of vasopressin over epinephrine in increasing survival or improving neurologic outcome in survivors. Subgroup analysis reveals a large difference in effect of vasopressin over epinephrine in cardiac arrest patients with asystole, compared to other arrest rhythms, coming from within-trial comparisons. The difference is not consistent across otherwise similar trials, is not statistically significant, may reflect the application of multiple unplanned subgroup analyses, and is not supported by a plausible biological hypothesis.

Conclusion

Evidence from randomized trials does not establish a benefit of vasopressin over epinephrine in increasing survival to discharge or improving neurologic outcomes in adult patients with nontraumatic cardiac arrest.

### Vasopressin and epinephrine in the treatment of cardiac arrest: an experimental study [^111vQMkh]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

There are experimental models indicating that an epinephrine-vasopressin combination works better. A secondary analysis of a clinical retrospective out-of-hospital cardiac arrest study drew the same conclusions. In our study we have taken two points stated previously by other authors into consideration: first, that vasopressin has greater activity than epinephrine under the hypoxic and acidic conditions of a prolonged cardiac arrest; and, second, that its V 2 -mediated vasodilatory effect could improve the end-organ hypoperfusion resulting by epinephrine and catecholamine stimulation.

The institution of effective external cardiac compressions restores a pressure gradient between the aorta and the right atrium with a return of blood flow. Chest compressions appear to be the most important factor, both in human and animal studies, and even short interruptions decrease CPP dramatically. In previous studies, CPP has been found to be the key determinant for successful defibrillation in humans and various animal models.

The quality of chest compressions should not be overlooked in the interpretation of the results of clinical studies. Chest compressions in animal models are standardized and are usually delivered mechanically. On the other hand, chest compressions in clinical studies are usually of poor quality. The large clinical vasopressin studies were performed before problems in out-of-hospital CPR quality were recognized, therefore this factor should also be taken into consideration in the interpretation of the clinical outcome in vasopressin studies.

The authors recognize several limitations in the interpretation of the present findings. The study was conducted on apparently healthy pigs and its direct application to human victims of cardiac arrest has yet to be addressed. Furthermore, between-species differences in the effects of vasopressin have not been evaluated in the present study. For example, there are different receptors in pigs (lysine vasopressin) and in humans (arginin vasopressin). In addition, the experimental animals were anesthetized and the potential interactions of the different agents were not assessed.

### Vasopressin and its analogues in patients with septic shock: holy grail or unfulfilled promise? [^115r56hn]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Because of the adverse effects of high doses of norepinephrine, it is currently suggested that vasopressin, a non-catecholaminergic vasopressor, be used as a second-line vasopressor in patients with septic shock requiring doses of norepinephrine base > 0.25–0.50 µg/kg/min, after excluding persistent hypovolemia and cardiac dysfunction. To date, the use of vasopressin has no beneficial effect on mortality and the reduction in the need for RRT and the risk of atrial fibrillation needs to be confirmed. Nevertheless, vasopressin use is associated with a norepinephrine-sparing effect, which is an interesting strategy in terms of decatecholaminization. Clinical use of vasopressin should balance hemodynamic goals and potential ischemic risks, especially in patients with impaired cardiac function or acidemia.

There are still several unresolved issues regarding the worldwide availability of vasopressin, the identification of subgroups of patients most likely to benefit from it and the management of its administration, including the timing of its initiation, the optimal dose and the weaning strategy. Patient selection and the timing of vasopressin administration remain particularly critical, and future approaches may be guided by biomarkers such as copeptin or dynamic tests to help personalize therapy. A better understanding of the interactions between vasopressin and corticosteroids is also needed. The results of an ESICM-endorsed survey on vasopressin use in patients with septic shock (PRESS Survey) will provide new insights into these issues and could be the first step in further studies.

### Beneficial effects of vasopressin in prolonged pediatric cardiac arrest: a case series [^115AUvZc]. Resuscitation (2002). Low credibility.

Children who suffer cardiac arrest have a poor prognosis. Based on laboratory animal studies and clinical data in adults, vasopressin is an exciting new vasopressor treatment modality during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In particular, vasopressin has resulted in short term resuscitation benefits as a "rescue" pressor agent in the setting of prolonged out-of-hospital CPR for ventricular fibrillation in adults. This retrospective series presents the first evidence for resuscitation benefit of bolus vasopressin therapy in the specific setting of pediatric cardiac arrest. All episodes of CPR initiated in a 120-bed tertiary care children's hospital over a three-year period (1997–2000) were reviewed. Four children in the pediatric ICU received vasopressin boluses as rescue therapy during six cardiac arrest events, following failure of conventional CPR, advanced life support, and epinephrine vasopressor therapy. Return of spontaneous circulation for greater than 60 min occurred in three of four patients (75%) and in four of six CPR events (66%) following vasopressin administration. Two of four vasopressin recipients survived > 24 h; one survived to hospital discharge and one had withdrawal of supportive therapies following family discussion. Our observations are AHA level 5 (retrospective case series) evidence that vasopressin administration may be beneficial during prolonged pediatric cardiac arrest. Such reports should pave the way for prospective clinical trials comparing vasopressor medications in the setting of pediatric cardiac arrest.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdosage with vasopressin injectioncan be expected to manifest as consequences of vasoconstriction of various vascular beds (peripheral, mesenteric, and coronary) and as hyponatremia. In addition, overdosage may lead less commonly to ventricular tachyarrhythmias (including Torsade de Pointes), rhabdomyolysis, and non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms.

Direct effects will resolve within minutes of withdrawal of treatment.

### Vasopressors during adult cardiac arrest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1176NmRb]. Resuscitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To systematically review the literature on the use of vasopressors during adult cardiac arrest to inform an update of international guidelines.

Methods

PRISMA guidelines were followed. We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library for controlled trials and observational studies. The population included adults with cardiac arrest in any setting. Pairs of investigators reviewed studies for relevance, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for individual studies. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE for controlled trials and meta-analyses were performed when at least two studies could be pooled.

Results

We included 15 controlled trials and 67 observational studies. The majority of studies included out-of-hospital cardiac arrest only. Meta-analyses were performed for two controlled trials comparing epinephrine to placebo, three comparing vasopressin to epinephrine, and three comparing epinephrine plus vasopressin to epinephrine only. All controlled trials ranged between low to some concern in risk of bias. The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to high. Risk of bias for observational studies was generally critical or serious, largely due to confounding and selection bias.

Conclusions

Controlled trial data suggest that epinephrine improves return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital discharge, and 3-month survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The improvement in short-term outcomes appeared more pronounced for non-shockable rhythms. Differences in long-term neurological outcome did not reach statistical significance, although there was a signal toward improved outcomes. Controlled trial data indicated no benefit from vasopressin with or without epinephrine compared to epinephrine only.

### Is the combination of vasopressin and epinephrine superior to repeated doses of epinephrine alone in the treatment of cardiac arrest-a systematic review [^111NLJKy]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

No evidence supports vasopressin over epinephrine in cardiac arrest; however animal and some clinical studies support their concurrent use. This systematic review compares the efficacy of vasopressin and epinephrine used together versus repeated doses of epinephrine alone in cardiac arrest.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) where vasopressin and epinephrine were administered concurrently to cardiac arrest patients within the half-life of vasopressin. Two reviewers assessed studies for eligibility, data extraction and quality. Appropriateness of studies for meta-analysis was assessed. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge and the secondary outcome was return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).

Results

From 235 titles identified, we reviewed 29 abstracts. Three cardiac arrest studies were included (N = 1226). Study 1 randomized vasopressin versus epinephrine then subsequent epinephrine. Study 2 randomized two doses of vasopressin versus epinephrine. Study 3 randomized vasopressin versus placebo, administered following initial epinephrine. All studies favored combination treatment for ROSC, but only study 2 was statistically significant (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14–1.77). Studies 1 and 2 reported survival to discharge, only study 2 was significant (RR 3.69, 95% CI 1.52–8.95). The methods for the three studies were too dissimilar to allow pooling of results.

Conclusion

This systematic review of the combination of vasopressin and epinephrine found trends towards better ROSC but equivocal effects on survival. At the present time, there is inadequate evidence to advocate the sequential use of vasopressin and epinephrine for cardiac arrest.

### Improving vasopressor use in cardiac arrest [^115mK7jD]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiac arrest is characterised by the sudden and catastrophic loss of cardiac output. The condition affects hundreds of thousands of people around the world each year in both the pre-hospital and hospital setting. Unless resuscitation is started promptly and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) achieved rapidly, few patients survive to make a meaningful recovery. Whilst the early parts of the Chain of Survival (early recognition and call for help, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation) are the most effective at improving outcomes from cardiac arrest, many patients remain refractory to these interventions. Vasopressors have been used since the inception of modern-day CPR in patients where initial resuscitation efforts have failed to achieve ROSC. Early clinical guidelines produced by Safar et al. in the 1960's recommended the inclusion of vasopressors including adrenaline, noradrenaline, phenylephrine, metaraminol and calcium in the Physicians Emergency Drug Bag. This narrative review provides a state-of-the-art summary of recent evidence for vasopressor use during cardiac arrest. The reader is directed to the European Resuscitation Council and European Society Intensive Care Medicine guidelines for a detailed summary and recommendations regarding their use following ROSC.

Vasopressin and corticosteroids

The potentially synergistic effects of vasopressin and corticosteroids have been explored in three randomised controlled trials during in-hospital cardiac arrest, published in 2009, 2013 (Greece) and 2021 (Denmark). The trial interventions comprised 40 mg methylprednisolone and 20 IU vasopressin (up to five doses) in adult in-hospital cardiac arrest patients receiving at least one dose of adrenaline (total sample size 869). Across studies, there was heterogeneity in the characteristics of enrolled patients and post-resuscitation steroid protocols.

A Bayesian, meta-analysis of individual participant data, using non-informative priors as the primary analysis reported the posterior odds ratio for ROSC as 2.13 (95% credible interval 1.51–2.82), whilst effects on long-term outcomes were uncertain (survival to hospital discharge OR 1.39 (95% credible interval 0.81–2.00); favourable neurological outcome 1.65 (95% credible intervals 0.91–2.45). In analyses with strongly optimistic priors, all outcomes were improved with the intervention whilst in the analyses with strongly pessimistic priors, only ROSC improved with the intervention. The probability of observing a beneficial effect for survival to hospital discharge (i.e. odds ratio > 1.0) ranged from 24% for a strong pessimistic prior to 99% for a strong optimistic prior. Treatment effects were consistent across 6 pre-defined sub-groups (age, time to study drug, witnessed, initial rhythm, aetiology and location). The authors of the review highlight the need for larger trials to determine the effect on long-term outcomes.

### The vasopressin loading for refractory septic shock (VALOR) study: a prospective observational study [^112URRWk]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

As reported in our previous study, we classified patients into responders and non-responders to vasopressin loading based on changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) just after vasopressin loading. In this prospective study, the maximum MAP change was prospectively and carefully observed by the physicians within 3–5 min after loading, and was recorded as MAP change (ΔMAP). Since we previously selected a cut-off for a loading response from MAP change retrospectively obtained from medical records, we expected a different ΔMAP distribution and cut-off for this prospective study. Therefore, to follow our previous study in which the cut-off of 18 mmHg was the lower tertile, we herein selected the lower tertile of ΔMAP as the cut-off in this study.

We recorded hemodynamics, including an arterial pressure wave analysis, just before vasopressin loading and when maximum ΔMAP was achieved. Blood pressure from the arterial line, heart rate, cardiac output CO, stroke volume, stroke volume variation (SVV), central venous pressure, systemic vascular resistance SVR, and dPmx, the maximum pressure increase over time calculated in ProAQT, were evaluated. dPmx, generally expressed as dP/dt max, is expected to represent left ventricular contractility, however, the limitation has been demonstrated that preload and actual aortic pressure also affected dP/dt max. Digital ischemia, mesenteric ischemia, and myocardial ischemia during the admission period were prospectively and systematically recorded as adverse events.

Age, sex, height, body weight, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) scores and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores on admission, comorbidities, and atrial fibrillation at the administration of vasopressin were analyzed as basic characteristics. The use of adjunctive therapies, such as mechanical ventilation, blood purification, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, was extracted. The timing of the administration of vasopressin from the initiation of noradrenaline, the noradrenaline dose and CAI when vasopressin was introduced, and maximum lactate levels within 24 h of the administration of vasopressin were also evaluated. In endocrinological tests, v, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol levels were evaluated just before vasopressin loading.

### Association of epinephrine and outcome in cardiac arrest with refractory shockable rhythm: a population-based, propensity-score matched analysis [^1152gDN3]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Even though epinephrine increases cerebral and coronary perfusion during cardiac arrest through alpha-1-adrenergic receptors, thereby increasing the odds of ROSC, it also increases myocardial demand, decreases sub-endocardial perfusion, and favors arrhythmia, through beta-adrenergic receptors which could explain lower survival rates in patients with shockable rhythm. At the brain level, its potential detrimental impact on neurological outcome could be mediated by its effect in microcirculation that can lead to reduced cerebral perfusion that was reported in animals.

Given the observational nature of our data, it is essential to recognize that causality cannot be conclusively established in this context, and we can only compile indirect evidence. The strength of the association, its consistency following propensity-score analysis, the dose–response relationship, biological plausibility and the plausible temporal sequence of events all contribute to reinforcing this hypothesis. Given the persistent uncertainty regarding the use of epinephrine in the setting of shockable OHCA, we believe that alternative strategies might be considered. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate alternative therapeutic options for OHCA, including investigations into the potential benefits of glucocorticoids, vasopressin, or beta-blockade. Double sequential external defibrillation should be considered for refractory ventricular fibrillation, as a randomized controlled trial has demonstrated its association with improved survival and favorable neurological outcome. Recent observational studies have also explored the reduction of epinephrine doses, yielding conflicting findings. An ongoing randomized controlled trial, the CanROC Epinephrine Dose trial (NCT 03826524), aims to compare the efficacy of low-dose (up to 2 mg) versus standard-dose epinephrine in patients with shockable rhythms. Furthermore, an additional therapeutic option under consideration is extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR), increasingly being regarded as a potential rescue therapy for refractory shockable cardiac arrest. Recently, three randomized controlled trial were published on ECPR in out of hospital refractory ventricular fibrillation with conflicting results, and survival rates ranging from 20% up to 43%. A meta-analysis of these trials concludes that ECPR improves survival with a good neurological outcome especially when the first rhythm is shockable. In this study, the number needed to treat was 7 in patients with shockable rhythm, whereas in PARAMEDICS 2 the number needed to treat with epinephrine was 112. Another recent meta-analysis of trials and propensity score matched studies, found that ECPR improved outcomes after cardiac arrest, particularly after in-hospital cardiac arrest. In light of recent data, including our observational findings, current guidelines may need to be reevaluated to discourage the use of epinephrine in cardiac arrest with refractory shockable rhythms and to carefully reconsider the role of ECPR in selected patients with refractory shockable rhythms. ECPR could represent a valuable alternative; however, its use requires a thorough cost-effectiveness evaluation. Indeed, it requires considerable ressources and incurs significant costs. To date, only a few studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of ECPR, with mixed results that may not be directly applicable to the French healthcare system. Additionnal data are needed to optimize the efficiency of ECPR and ensure its use in carefully selected patients. Moreover, for ECPR to be effectively implemented, pre-hospital care should adopt an approach similar to that used in the ARREST trial to minimize delays from cardiac arrest to ECMO initiation thereby optimizing patient selection for ECPR. This strategy involves patient's transport under continuous chest compressions in cases of refractory shockable cardiac arrest, directing patients to specialized cardiac arrest centers equipped for immediate coronary angiography and rapid ECPR initiation in the absence of ROSC.

### Vasopressin and its analogues in patients with septic shock: holy grail or unfulfilled promise? [^116BfJUc]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The VASST, VANISH and VANCS II trials found no difference in the incidence of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia between norepinephrine and vasopressin groups. Moreover, an aggregate data meta-analysis including 17 studies and 1,462 patients showed a reduced risk of atrial fibrillation in the vasopressin group compared to the norepinephrine group (OR 0.77 (0.67–0.88), p < 0.001, low heterogeneity, I 2: 1%). It should be noted that this effect was mainly driven by the VANCS trial (accounting for 75% of the weight) which was the only trial to find a significantly reduced risk of atrial fibrillation. This trial included both patients with septic shock and post-cardiac surgery patients. A post hoc analysis of the VASST trial found no difference in electrocardiogram findings or troponin levels.

Vasopressin may also reduce myocardial injury. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy occurs in 20–65% of patients with septic shock and is associated with severe cardiac dysfunction in 24% of cases. Compared to norepinephrine alone, the combination of vasopressin and norepinephrine in a porcine model of fecal peritonitis decreased heart rate and cardiac output as well as troponin I blood levels, similarly to angiotensin II. Therefore, vasopressin may be a promising alternative for reducing catecholamine exposure in patients with sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, despite evidence suggesting that vasopressin use does not reduce histological lesions in this condition.

Ultimately, no definitive conclusions can be drawn about vasopressin impact on cardiac function in patients with septic shock.

### Effects of vasopressin with vs without catecholamine vasopressors on adverse outcomes in patients with shock… [^117HoENy]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Addition of vasopressin to catecholamines may offer a clinical advantage for prevention of atrial fibrillation. Importance Vasopressin is an alternative to catecholamine vasopressors for patients with distributive shock — a condition due to excessive vasodilation, most frequently from severe infection. Blood pressure support with a noncatecholamine vasopressor may reduce stimulation of adrenergic receptors and decrease myocardial oxygen demand. Atrial fibrillation is common with catecholamines and is associated with adverse events, including mortality and increased length of stay. Results Twenty-three randomized clinical trials were identified. High-quality evidence supported a lower risk of atrial fibrillation associated with vasopressin treatment.

Pooling data from 13 studies demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of atrial fibrillation associated with the administration of vasopressin. Based on the GRADE framework, this was judged to be high-quality evidence. This result was driven by the study by Hajjar et al, 18 which carried 74. 8% of the weight. In absolute terms, the absolute effect is that 68 fewer people per 1000 patients will experience atrial fibrillation when vasopressin is added to catecholaminergic vasopressors. Quiz Ref IDVasopressin may have contributed to a reduction of atrial fibrillation by sparing the adrenergic stimulation provided by catecholaminergic vasopressors.

6–8, 14 This could have manifested in fewer patients developing atrial fibrillation or may have caused atrial fibrillation to be shorter in duration and lower in rate and, in consequence, less likely to be detected.

### Vasopressin and methylprednisolone vs placebo on return of spontaneous circulation in in-hospital cardiac arrest… [^116nSEGJ]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The primary outcome was return of spontaneous circulation, which was defined as spontaneous circulation with no further need for chest compressions sustained for at least 20 minutes. 11 Key secondary outcomes included survival at 30 days and survival at 30 days with a favorable neurologic outcome, which was defined as a Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2. The Cerebral Performance Category score is a 5-point scale assessing neurologic outcomes after brain damage, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes. 12 Additional outcomes, as described below, were considered tertiary outcomes. The sample size was based on the primary outcome of return of spontaneous circulation. Based on unpublished preliminary data from the participating hospitals, we assumed that 45% of patients in the placebo group would achieve return of spontaneous circulation.

We assumed an absolute difference of 13% between the placebo and intervention group, corresponding to 58% of patients achieving return of spontaneous circulation in the intervention group. The risk ratio was slightly higher when adjusting for site and prognostic factors. Results were generally consistent across predefined subgroups. The median time to return of spontaneous circulation was 16 minutes in the intervention group and 18 minutes in the placebo group. A favorable neurologic outcome, based on the Cerebral Performance Category score, was observed in 18 patients in the intervention group and 20 patients in the placebo group at 30 days.

Results for survival and favorable neurologic outcome were generally consistent across predefined subgroups. In the 2 trials by Mentzelopoulos et al, 6, 7 the investigators found improvements in return of spontaneous circulation as well as an improvement in survival to hospital discharge. The current trial found an improvement in return of spontaneous circulation with a risk ratio of 1. 30, which is consistent with the previous trials' findings. 6, 7 However, contrary to the previous trials, there was no improvement in survival.

### NCT06265259 | Efficacy of the use of vasopressin as… [^1176PBF4]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Vasopressin is an endogenous peptide that through V1 receptors causes selective vasoconstriction in non-vital organs and increases blood flow to the myocardium and brain. Vasopressin via V2 receptors causes vasodilation in coronary vessels as well as in cerebral vessels. Noradrenaline "is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor which acts both on arterial and venous substrates and as a cardiac inotropic stimulator. These effects result in an increase in systemic arterial pressure and blood flow in the coronary arteries". However, a subgroup analysis in the Vasopressin and Septic Shock Trial showed extremely low baseline vasopressin levels in patients with septic shock, so the lack of vasopressin is obvious. At the same time, the same subanalysis found a survival benefit in patients given vasopressin when the norepinephrine dose was less than 15 μg/min. VI. Fluid balance in the first 5 days. VIII. Need to use venovenous hemodialysis. IX.

2. METHODS
1. Design
- Study Protocol The methodology to be followed will be a comparison between 2 cohorts of patients: i. The group where vasopressin will be administered first up to a maximum dose of 0. 03 IU/min for the treatment of hemodynamic instability. Then, if the patient remains unstable, noradrenaline will be started. The dose of vasopressin will not be increased further than the above mentioned limit.
