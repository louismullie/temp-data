## Question

What do I check to assess lfts

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to check to assess LFTs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "LFTs" actually measure and how to name them correctly. Then, I should verify the core panel and which analytes reflect injury versus function. Next, I will consider pattern recognition and thresholds, including sex-specific ALT cutoffs. After that, I need to check the initial workup steps, including history, exam, and medication review. Then, I will outline the first-line etiologic screen and when to image. Finally, I should review advanced functional tests, special populations, and how to monitor and follow abnormalities, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because calling them "liver function tests" is misleading. Most of the routine panel reflects hepatobiliary injury rather than synthetic function, so the preferred terms are liver chemistries, liver tests, or liver blood tests, not LFTs, and I should explicitly separate markers of injury (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT) from markers of function (bilirubin, albumin, INR) to avoid misinterpretation [^1155asMt] [^112RBbyZ].

> I need to verify the core panel. The standard initial tests include ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin, with GGT added to confirm a hepatic source of ALP and to refine patterns. Albumin and INR are essential to assess synthetic function, and a complete blood count helps identify thrombocytopenia suggesting portal hypertension or advanced fibrosis, so I should ensure these are included when assessing liver disease rather than just "screening" enzymes alone [^1155asMt] [^111Zqb9T] [^1134JoKn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "normal" ALT. I should confirm sex-specific thresholds because many labs still use outdated ULNs. True healthy ALT is about 29–33 IU/L in males and 19–25 IU/L in females, and values above these warrant evaluation even if within a lab's reference range; importantly, normal ALT does not exclude significant liver disease, so I must interpret results in clinical context and not dismiss mild elevations [^111Zqb9T] [^112nyEMD] [^116bPbMD].

> Next, I should review pattern recognition because it narrows the differential. Hepatocellular injury is suggested when ALT and/or AST are disproportionately elevated relative to ALP, whereas cholestatic injury is suggested when ALP is disproportionately elevated; isolated hyperbilirubinemia requires fractionation into direct and indirect components to distinguish hemolysis or Gilbert syndrome from hepatocellular or obstructive causes, and I should double-check that I am not mixing these patterns when I interpret a panel [^111Zqb9T] [^112RBbyZ].

> I will now examine the initial clinical assessment, because labs without context mislead. I need to check for risk factors such as alcohol use, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, viral hepatitis risks, autoimmune disease, and a meticulous medication and supplement history including OTC and herbal agents; on exam I should look for stigmata of chronic liver disease and features suggesting decompensation, since these contextual clues often explain abnormalities and guide testing [^1155FJc1] [^115PkWRv].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line etiologic screen. For adults with persistent abnormalities, guidelines recommend abdominal ultrasound to assess liver parenchyma, biliary tree, and signs of portal hypertension; serologies for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody with reflex RNA if positive, autoimmune markers (ANA, ASMA, AMA), iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation), and immunoglobulins; I should also consider ceruloplasmin and alpha-1 antitrypsin when clinically indicated, and I need to ensure I do not omit these basics before escalating [^113z2Ems] [^1155asMt].

> But wait, what if the patient is being considered for hepatic resection or has complex liver disease? I should confirm whether dynamic quantitative liver function tests are indicated. Indocyanine green clearance and hepatobiliary scintigraphy with 99mTc-mebrofenin provide functional assessments that complement volumetry, especially when the future liver remnant is small or parenchyma is diseased; these tests help predict post-hepatectomy liver failure and should be timed thoughtfully after chemotherapy or volume modulation strategies [^112oFzQJ] [^116U1B7o] [^113WXTeC].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't overgeneralize. In pregnancy, physiologic changes can alter ALP and albumin, but abnormal transaminases or bilirubin still warrant standard evaluation. In pediatrics, the differential differs and a lower threshold for specialist referral is appropriate. In patients with alcohol use disorder, I should incorporate alcohol screening and fibrosis assessment. And in those with drug-induced liver injury risk, I should obtain baseline liver chemistries and tailor monitoring to the hepatotoxicity profile of the agent [^1159MCAQ] [^113XoUqa] [^116o9TN8] [^115LpMTQ].

> I should double-check the approach to monitoring and follow-up. For incidental abnormalities, repeating the same panel without a plan is discouraged; instead, I should confirm persistence, characterize the pattern, and proceed with targeted evaluation. In patients with established chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, periodic assessment with liver chemistries, CBC, and INR is appropriate, and in transplant recipients, individualized surveillance is standard. If I initially thought to repeat tests in 3–6 months for everyone, wait, that is too passive for persistent abnormalities and risks missed disease, so I should align with guideline-driven pathways that escalate based on risk and persistence [^113XoUqa] [^117Tx6ik] [^117T66qg].

> Let me reconsider fibrosis assessment because normal enzymes can coexist with advanced disease. For NAFLD and other chronic liver diseases, I should risk-stratify using FIB-4 or APRI and, if indeterminate, proceed to elastography or ELF to estimate fibrosis stage; I need to ensure I do not rely on liver enzymes alone to exclude fibrosis, as sensitivity is poor and ALT often normalizes as cirrhosis advances [^113z2Ems] [^116bPbMD] [^113FmFw6].

> In summary, I need to ensure my "LFT assessment" is a structured, context-aware process: confirm the abnormality and pattern, interpret using sex-specific ALT thresholds, integrate history and exam, execute a first-line etiologic screen with ultrasound and targeted serologies, and deploy functional tests when surgical planning or advanced disease assessment is needed. I should avoid calling them "liver function tests" and instead communicate clearly about which markers reflect injury versus function, because that distinction drives appropriate next steps and prevents misinterpretation [^111Zqb9T] [^113z2Ems] [^112oFzQJ].

To assess liver function tests (LFTs), order a **standard panel** [^113z2Ems] including ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, total and direct bilirubin, albumin, and INR, and add a CBC and platelets to assess synthetic function and screen for portal hypertension [^1134JoKn]. Interpret results by **pattern** (hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed) [^111Zqb9T] and magnitude of elevation [^111MfEZb], and always correlate with clinical context and prior results [^115LahNR]. If abnormalities persist, pursue targeted serologies (viral hepatitis, autoimmune, iron/ copper studies) [^113z2Ems] and abdominal ultrasound [^112SbFyr]; use noninvasive fibrosis scores (FIB-4, APRI) [^113FmFw6] or elastography [^115oTn1y] when chronic liver disease is suspected. Repeat testing only to confirm persistence or monitor change, and escalate to specialist referral or liver biopsy if unexplained abnormalities persist or if advanced disease is suspected [^1156xFwp].

---

## Standard liver function test panel

The **standard LFT panel** includes the following tests:

| **Test** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) | Hepatocellular injury marker [^111Zqb9T] |
| Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) | Hepatocellular injury marker [^111Zqb9T] |
| Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) | Cholestasis marker [^111Zqb9T] |
| Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) | Cholestasis marker [^111Zqb9T] |
| Total and direct bilirubin | Hepatic excretory function [^111Zqb9T] |
| Albumin | Hepatic synthetic function [^111Zqb9T] |
| International normalized ratio (INR) | Hepatic synthetic function [^111Zqb9T] |

---

Additional tests often included are a **complete blood count (CBC)** and platelets to assess for thrombocytopenia, which may indicate portal hypertension or advanced liver disease [^1134JoKn].

---

## Interpretation of liver function tests

LFTs should be interpreted by **pattern and magnitude** of abnormality, along with clinical context [^1155Yms9]:

- **Hepatocellular pattern**: Disproportionate elevation of ALT and AST suggests hepatocellular injury (e.g. viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) [^111Zqb9T].
- **Cholestatic pattern**: Disproportionate elevation of ALP and GGT suggests cholestatic injury (e.g. biliary obstruction, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis) [^111Zqb9T].
- **Mixed pattern**: Simultaneous elevation of hepatocellular and cholestatic markers suggests mixed injury (e.g. drug-induced liver injury, advanced liver disease) [^notfound].
- **Isolated hyperbilirubinemia**: Elevated bilirubin with normal enzymes suggests hemolysis, Gilbert syndrome, or Dubin-Johnson syndrome [^112RBbyZ].

---

## Clinical context and correlation

LFTs must be interpreted in the **clinical context**, including:

- **History**: Alcohol use, medication use (prescription, over-the-counter, herbal), risk factors for viral hepatitis, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune diseases [^1155FJc1].
- **Physical examination**: Stigmata of chronic liver disease (jaundice, ascites, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, spider angiomas) [^115PkWRv].
- **Previous results**: Trend analysis is crucial for accurate interpretation [^115LahNR].

---

## Follow-up and additional investigations

If abnormalities are detected, the following steps are recommended:

- **Confirm abnormality**: Repeat LFTs to confirm persistence [^1156xFwp].
- **Targeted serologies**: Viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV), autoimmune markers (ANA, ASMA, AMA), iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation), copper studies (ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper) [^113z2Ems].
- **Imaging**: Abdominal ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality to assess liver structure, biliary tree, and signs of portal hypertension [^112SbFyr].
- **Noninvasive fibrosis assessment**: FIB-4, APRI, transient elastography (FibroScan) for chronic liver disease evaluation [^113z2Ems].
- **Liver biopsy**: Consider when serologic testing and imaging fail to elucidate the diagnosis, to stage disease, or when multiple diagnoses are possible [^1156xFwp].

---

## Frequency of monitoring

The frequency of LFT monitoring depends on the **clinical scenario**:

- **Routine health screening**: Annually or as clinically indicated.
- **Chronic liver disease**: Every 3–6 months or as clinically indicated.
- **Medication-induced liver injury**: Baseline before starting hepatotoxic drugs, periodic monitoring based on drug risk profile [^1166BbqX].
- **Post-liver transplantation**: Individualized monitoring based on clinical stability and complications [^117T66qg].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Normal LFTs do not exclude liver disease**: Significant liver disease can exist with normal LFTs, particularly in chronic liver disease [^116bPbMD].
- **Variability**: LFTs can be influenced by age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities [^117NxXoi].
- **False positives/negatives**: Non-hepatic conditions can affect LFTs (e.g. skeletal disease affecting ALP, muscle injury affecting AST) [^112GFrQG].

---

Assessing LFTs involves ordering a **standard panel**, interpreting results by pattern and magnitude, correlating with clinical context, and pursuing targeted investigations if abnormalities persist. This structured approach ensures accurate diagnosis and management of liver diseases.

The liver has a key role in the metabolism (ie, inactivation or activation) of many commonly used anticancer agents-cytotoxics or new biological agents. Therefore, assessment of liver function is a fundamental part of initial work-up and management of patients with cancer. An understanding of the meaning of conventional serum biochemical testing of liver function and status, what variables they are measuring, and usefulness for chemotherapy dosing is essential. Emerging awareness of the drawbacks of conventional serum biochemical testing and further understanding of the intricacies of liver function is leading to the development of alternative strategies for appropriate chemotherapy regimens and dosing. We present an overview of assessment of liver function and chemotherapy dosing. We consider the use of serum liver biochemical testing to predict liver function, potential causes of biochemical abnormalities in patients with cancer, and chemotherapy drugs that are associated with hepatotoxicity. Part II will overview the current knowledge surrounding chemotherapy dosing in the setting of liver dysfunction; as well as alternative tests of hepatic metabolic function that are beginning to be used as strategies for appropriate individualised chemotherapy administration.

### Monitoring for hepatotoxicity: what is the predictive value of liver "function" tests? [^113EvKTy]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major reason drugs fail during development or are withdrawn from the market. The ability to predict, detect, and avoid DILI through appropriate patient selection and effective monitoring has proved to be an elusive goal. Many approved drugs have labeling recommendations for serum enzyme monitoring intended to detect and prevent hepatotoxicity, but such monitoring is often seen as inconvenient, uncomfortable, costly, and inefficient by both patients and doctors, and thus monitoring recommendations are poorly followed, if at all. This review considers whether monitoring works to prevent DILI, whether monitoring recommendations are derived from data or opinions, and whether any better alternatives exist.

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^112Rymzo]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

Recent Findings

The toll of liver disease continues to rise and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

Summary

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® abnormal liver function tests [^112SbFyr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver function tests are commonly obtained in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Various overlapping lab patterns can be seen due to derangement of hepatocytes and bile ducts function. Imaging tests are pursued to identify underlying etiology and guide management based on the lab results. Liver function tests may reveal mild, moderate, or severe hepatocellular predominance and can be seen in alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease, acute hepatitis, and acute liver injury due to other causes. Cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase can be seen with various causes of obstructive biliopathy. Acute or subacute cholestasis with conjugated or unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be seen due to prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic causes. We discuss the initial and complementary imaging modalities to be used in clinical scenarios presenting with abnormal liver function tests. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Noninvasive assessment of liver function [^1135kmny]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

It is our opinion that there is an unmet need in hepatology for a minimally or noninvasive test of liver function and physiology. Quantitative liver function tests define the severity and prognosis of liver disease by measuring the clearance of substrates whose uptake or metabolism is dependent upon liver perfusion or hepatocyte function. Substrates with high-affinity hepatic transporters exhibit high 'first-pass' hepatic extraction and their clearance measures hepatic perfusion. In contrast, substrates metabolized by the liver have low first-pass extraction and their clearance measures specific drug metabolizing pathways.

Recent Findings

We highlight one quantitative liver function test, the dual cholate test, and introduce the concept of a disease severity index linked to clinical outcome that quantifies the simultaneous processes of hepatocyte uptake, clearance from the systemic circulation, clearance from the portal circulation, and portal-systemic shunting.

Summary

It is our opinion that dual cholate is a relevant test for defining disease severity, monitoring the natural course of disease progression, and quantifying the response to therapy.

### Part II: liver function in oncology: towards safer chemotherapy use [^113pPtPL]. The Lancet: Oncology (2008). Medium credibility.

The liver is fundamentally important in drug metabolism. In oncology, the astute clinician must not only understand the meaning and limitations of commonly ordered liver biochemical tests, but also be aware of which anticancer agents might induce liver dysfunction, and of the strategies for appropriate dosing of patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction. In part I of our Review, we highlighted both the importance and inadequacies of identifying serum biochemical liver abnormalities in oncology; we also discussed a lack of routine formal investigation of liver function. We summarised chemotherapy-related hepatotoxicity and other causes of liver toxic effects in patients with cancer. Here in part II, we discuss trials that have specifically assessed chemotherapy dosing strategies in the setting of overt biochemical liver dysfunction and we note their recommendations. Furthermore, we review other assessments of liver metabolic and excretory function, particularly in the setting of chemotherapy drug handling. We discuss the potential use of these metabolic probes in practice.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is an emerging literature suggesting that the current reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions. Elevations of either fraction will therefore lead to a rise in the measured bilirubin concentration. The most common cause of an isolated elevated bilirubin concentration is Gilbert's syndrome, which is an inherited disorder of metabolism and leads to impaired conjugation via reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase.

Non-invasive tests are increasingly being used to improve the diagnosis and prognostication of chronic liver diseases across aetiologies. Herein, we provide the latest update to the EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines on the use of non-invasive tests for the evaluation of liver disease severity and prognosis, focusing on the topics for which relevant evidence has been published in the last 5 years.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

### Alanine aminotransferase: a clinical and regulatory tool for detecting liver injury-past, present, and future [^116xdYTr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Assay of the serum activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has become the primary screening tool for detecting acute liver injury. But what does an elevated value mean? Not what it is too often mistakenly believed to indicate. It is not a test of liver function. It does not necessarily predict worse effects to come (in a given person). It is not a valid measure of severity of liver injury or dysfunction. It is too unspecific to be reliable in screening for relatively rare effects on the liver. Although these are substantial limitations, ALT is a very useful biomarker if understood and used properly. It is important to consider how and why these erroneous concepts came to have such wide acceptance, and how elevations of ALT activity for evaluating patients and subjects under study might be interpreted better.

### Physiological and biochemical basis of clinical liver function tests: a review [^111Ufwv7]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature on the most clinically relevant and novel liver function tests used for the assessment of hepatic function before liver surgery.

Background

Postoperative liver failure is the major cause of mortality and morbidity after partial liver resection and develops as a result of insufficient remnant liver function. Therefore, accurate preoperative assessment of the future remnant liver function is mandatory in the selection of candidates for safe partial liver resection.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was performed using the key words "liver function tests", "functional studies in the liver", "compromised liver", "physiological basis", and "mechanistic background", with and without Boolean operators.

Results

Passive liver function tests, including biochemical parameters and clinical grading systems, are not accurate enough in predicting outcome after liver surgery. Dynamic quantitative liver function tests, such as the indocyanine green test and galactose elimination capacity, are more accurate as they measure the elimination process of a substance that is cleared and/or metabolized almost exclusively by the liver. However, these tests only measure global liver function. Nuclear imaging techniques ((99m)Tc-galactosyl serum albumin scintigraphy and (99m)Tc-mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy) can measure both total and future remnant liver function and potentially identify patients at risk for postresectional liver failure.

Conclusions

Because of the complexity of liver function, one single test does not represent overall liver function. In addition to computed tomography volumetry, quantitative liver function tests should be used to determine whether a safe resection can be performed. Presently, (99m)Tc-mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy seems to be the most valuable quantitative liver function test, as it can measure multiple aspects of liver function in, specifically, the future remnant liver.

### Liver function testing with nuclear medicine techniques is coming of age [^115Cekf7]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Liver function is a broad term, as the organ participates in a multitude of different physiological and biochemical processes, including metabolic, synthetic, and detoxifying functions. However, it is the function of the hepatocyte that is central to sustaining normal life and dealing with disease states. When the liver begins to fail in severely ill patients, it forecasts a terminal outcome. However, unlike the glomerular filtration rate which clearly quantifies the key renal function, at most practice sites, there is no clinically available quantitative test for liver function. Although it is commonplace to assess indirect evidence of that function (by measuring blood levels of its end products and by-products) and to detect an acute injury (by following rising transaminases), a widely available test that would directly measure hepatocellular function is lacking. This article reviews current knowledge on liver function studies and focuses on those nuclear medicine tests available to study the whole liver and regional liver function. The clinical application driving these tests, prediction of remnant liver function after partial hepatectomy for primary liver malignancy or metastatic disease, is addressed here in detail. The test was recently validated for this specific application and was shown to be better than the current standard of practice (computed tomography volumetry), particularly in patients with hepatic comorbidities like cirrhosis, steatosis, or cholestasis. Furthermore, early assessment of regional liver function increase after preoperative portal vein embolization becomes possible with this technology. The limiting factor to a wider acceptance of this test is based on the lack of clinical software that would allow calculation of liver function parameters. This article provides information that enables a clinical nuclear medicine facility to provide this test using readily available equipment. Furthermore, it addresses emerging clinical applications that are under investigation.

### Towards better diagnostic tools for liver injury in low-income and middle-income countries [^1119YSBm]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Liver disease is a significant public health burden in both high-income and low-income countries, accounting for over 2 million annual, global deaths. Despite the significant mortality burden, liver diseases are historically a neglected problem due to a lack of accurate incidence and prevalence statistics, as well as national and international programmes targeting these diseases. A large portion of deaths due to liver diseases can be treated (eg, chronic hepatitis B), cured (eg, chronic hepatitis C) or prevented (eg, acute liver failure due to medications) if prompt diagnosis is made, but currently diagnostic methods fall short. Therefore, there is a critical need to fund the development of prompt, effective diagnostics for liver function, specifically in low-income and middle-income countries where the landscape for this testing is sparse. Here, we review and compare available and currently emerging diagnostic methods for liver injury in low-income and middle-income settings, while highlighting the opportunities and challenges that exist in the field.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115wEbB4]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. But the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. Addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%and, notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

Timing of assessment

Q5: Is there an ideal time point for assessing liver function before surgery?

An ideal time point for preoperative metabolic liver function tests cannot be defined precisely in general, and it should be adapted to individual clinical scenarios.

Recommendation grade: Conditional | median level of evidence: 2+ (range 3 to 1+).

Expert panel comment

To date, there has been no published comparative study providing high-level evidence specifically on the ideal preoperative time point for performing liver function tests for optimal accuracy of prediction. Most studies investigating preoperative liver function undertook such tests a few days to a couple of weeks before the planned surgery to obtain relevant results as close as possible to the time of surgery. Timing of liver function testing, however, should also consider any type of previous treatment or potential recent liver injury (CALI or DALI), or volume modulation strategy. For example, patients who have recently received preoperative chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastases might still be in a liver function recovery phase within the first few weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy. Usually, liver function is considered stable 4–6 weeks after treatment, although further improvement might be noted beyond 6–8 weeks. The liver recovery time should be taken into consideration when liver function tests are performed timely (for example 2 weeks) after chemotherapy. Furthermore, in the case of volume modulation strategies, the dynamics over time — also known as kinetic growth rate — especially within the first weeks after PVE have been shown to be of particular importance in regard to overall FLR growth. This might also indicate that the gain in liver function might not be linear within the first weeks after such modulation. Therefore, in certain scenarios, testing liver function early enough, or even in a dynamic fashion at more than one time point to potentially allow adaptation of planned strategies, might be advisable. In the event of longer waiting times to improve liver function (for example over 4 weeks), oncological restaging with new imaging is advisable to assess the stability and/or progression of disease.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^117Tx6ik]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

AASLD–IDSA post-treatment and follow-up guidance states that Assessment of quantitative HCV RNA and a hepatic function panel are recommended 12 weeks or later following completion of therapy to confirm HCV RNA is undetectable (virologic cure) and transaminase normalization, with further Assessment for other causes of liver disease recommended for patients with elevated transaminase levels after achieving SVR; after cure, Ultrasound surveillance for HCC (with or without alpha-fetoprotein testing) every 6 months is recommended for patients with cirrhosis and Patients with ongoing risk for HCV infection should be counseled about risk reduction and tested for HCV RNA annually, while Patients should abstain from alcohol to avoid progression of liver disease; if cure is not achieved, Patients in whom initial HCV treatment fails to achieve cure (SVR) should be evaluated for retreatment by a specialist, Ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (with or without alpha-fetoprotein testing) every 6 months is recommended for patients with cirrhosis, and Assessment of disease progression every 6 to 12 months with a hepatic function panel, CBC, and INR is recommended.

### Aminotransferase levels in clinical practice-what is normal? [^112nyEMD]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

No universal consensus exists as to what the upper limit of normal for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) should be. The purpose of this review is to provide insight on the wide variation in the upper limit of normal for ALT, and to highlight key elements resulting in these differences. We also wish to point to potential solutions for standardizing the upper limit of normal.

Recent Findings

There are considerable differences in the values for what constitutes a 'normal' ALT serum concentration set by laboratories, and reference values may vary two-fold between different institutions (from 30 to 60U/l). Key reasons for this include using markedly different reference populations to establish the bounds of normal, and differences in analyzers and assays used to quantify ALT levels. A number of studies have attempted to re-evaluate the upper limit of normal and propose new cut-offs that would allow better detection of liver disease.

Summary

The upper limit of normal for ALT continues to vary from one laboratory to another. Despite ongoing efforts, there is still an unmet demand to standardize ALT reference ranges, which is critical for clinical practice. More rigorous inclusion criteria for reference population studies and harmonization in analyzer differences is required to standardize ALT reference ranges universally.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113Q87eu]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

These updated guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests have been commissioned by the Clinical Services and Standards Committee (CSSC) of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) under the auspices of the liver section of the BSG. The original guidelines, which this document supersedes, were written in 2000 and have undergone extensive revision by members of the Guidelines Development Group (GDG). The GDG comprises representatives from patient/carer groups (British Liver Trust, Liver4life, PBC Foundation and PSC Support), elected members of the BSG liver section (including representatives from Scotland and Wales), British Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL), Specialist Advisory Committee in Clinical Biochemistry/Royal College of Pathology and Association for Clinical Biochemistry, British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (BSPGHAN), Public Health England (implementation and screening), Royal College of General Practice, British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiologists (BSGAR) and Society of Acute Medicine. The quality of evidence and grading of recommendations was appraised using the AGREE II tool. These guidelines deal specifically with the management of abnormal liver blood tests in children and adults in both primary and secondary care under the following subheadings: (1) What constitutes an abnormal liver blood test? (2) What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel? (3) When should liver blood tests be checked? (4) Does the extent and duration of abnormal liver blood tests determine subsequent investigation? (5) Response to abnormal liver blood tests. They are not designed to deal with the management of the underlying liver disease.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^111NZBzD]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Guideline development

These guidelines were drafted after discussions within the liver section of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) and acceptance of the proposal by the Clinical Services and Standards Committee (CSSC). There followed division of sections to be researched by designated authors and a literature review. The NICE guidelines were closely followed and guideline quality was assessed using the AGREE tool(section 'Assessing the quality of guidelines: the AGREE II instrument'). A preliminary guideline document was drafted by the authors following discussion and, where necessary, voting by members of the Guidelines Development Group. The draft guidelines were submitted for review by the CSSC, then BSG council members. Finally, full peer review was undertaken by reviewers selected by the editor of Gut.

Assessing the quality of guidelines: the AGREE II instrument is an accepted method for appraising clinical guidelines. Six domains are listed:

Scope and purpose

These guidelines are intended to be of use for all healthcare professionals, although with a major focus on the asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver blood tests. Nonetheless, the guideline will review the role/utility of liver blood tests in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and explore their possible role in case finding in high-risk groups or following a clinical concern. They include recommendations for both adults and children, although the evidence for children is often lacking.

No meta-analyses or randomised controlled trials concerning the management of abnormal LFTs in asymptomatic people have been carried out and therefore no grade A evidence exists in these guidelines to support the recommendations made. These guidelines are not intended to serve as rigid protocols or to replace clinical judgement.

Guideline development group membership and stakeholder involvement

Membership of the group includes patient/patient group representation, adult and paediatric hepatologists, clinical biochemists, general practitioners, internal medicine specialists, public health specialists and radiologists.

### Elevated liver enzymes: emergency department-focused management [^111MfEZb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are a common problem faced by emergency physicians. This has become more common with the introduction of laboratory panels and automated routine laboratory testing. Fortunately, not all patients with irregularities in liver enzymes possess underlying pathology. This emergency medicine focused review provides a discussion of the various biochemical tests, their underlying biological basis, and an algorithmic approach to the interpretation of abnormalities.

Objective

Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an overview of the evaluation and management of patients with elevated LFTs.

Discussion

The liver is a complex organ with multiple roles. The key biochemical markers of hepatic function can be organized into the groupings of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or functioning liver, based on underlying enzymatic roles. Pathologic alterations to these markers can be algorithmically assessed by separating disease processes of these groupings, followed by assessment of the magnitude of enzymatic elevation. This review conducts an in-depth evaluation of the differential diagnosis and emergency department-centered clinical response of elevated LFTs based on subcategories of mild, moderate, and severe transaminase elevation.

Conclusions

By understanding the biochemical basis of each LFT, it is possible to correlate laboratory findings to a patient's clinical presentation. An algorithmic approach can be taken to help narrow the spectrum of a differential diagnosis. This may assist providers in ensuring appropriate management and evaluation of the patient with elevated LFTs.

### How are abnormal results for liver function tests dealt with in primary care? Audit of yield and impact [^114FH32S]. BMJ (2001). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine whether abnormal results for liver function tests are investigated in primary care and findings on full investigation.

Design

Retrospective audit and prospective clinical investigation.

Setting

University hospital and surrounding general practices serving around 330 000 people.

Subjects

Adults with abnormal results for liver function based on tests requested by their doctor between 1 January and 30 June 1995.

Interventions

All patients with gamma-glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or alkaline phosphatase concentrations at least twice the upper limit of the reference range were studied. A median of 15 months later (range 12–21) records of hospital attendances and further investigations were examined. Where investigations were incomplete the records from the general practice were examined, and suitable patients were invited to attend the liver clinic.

Main Outcome Measures

Investigations requested by the doctor and final diagnoses reached.

Results

933 patients with abnormal liver function tests were identified; follow up data were obtained in 873 (94%). 531 patients were already under hospital review. Of the remaining 342 patients, 157 were suitable for investigation; the others had died, moved away, were elderly, or had repeat liver function tests with normal results. No further tests were requested for 91 (58%) of these patients. 66 had been partially investigated by their doctor, and in seven patients results suggesting a treatable chronic liver disease had not been followed up. On investigation, 97 (62%) had an identifiable diagnosis requiring hospital intervention or follow up, or both.

Conclusions

Abnormal results for liver function are often not adequately investigated, missing an important chance of identifying treatable chronic liver disease.

### Beyond the liver function tests: a radiologist's guide to the liver blood tests [^115RwZpe]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver blood tests (often also known as liver chemistries, liver tests, or the common misnomer liver function tests) are routinely used in diagnosis and management of hepatobiliary disease. Abnormal liver blood test results are often the first indicator of hepatobiliary disease and a common indication for abdominal imaging with US, CT, or MRI. Most of the disease entities can be categorized into hepatocellular or cholestatic patterns, with characteristic traits on liver blood tests. Each pattern has a specific differential, which can help narrow the differential diagnosis when combined with the clinical history and imaging findings. This article reviews the major liver blood tests as well as a general approach to recognizing common patterns of hepatobiliary disease within these tests (hepatocellular, cholestatic, acute liver failure, isolated hyperbilirubinemia). Examples of hepatobiliary disease with hepatocellular or cholestatic patterns are presented with characteristic test abnormalities and imaging findings. The commonly encountered scenario of chronic hepatitis with possible fibrosis is also reviewed, with discussion of potential further imaging such as elastography. The role of liver blood tests and imaging in evaluating complications of hepatic transplant is also discussed. Overall, integrating liver blood test patterns with imaging findings can help the radiologist accurately diagnose hepatobiliary disease, especially in cases where imaging findings may not allow differentiation between different entities. © RSNA, 2021.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Initial clinical assessment for abnormal liver chemistries states that clinical assessment of the patient with elevated liver tests should begin with a thorough history and physical examination, with history including risk factors for underlying liver disease, associated medical conditions, use of alcohol, and use of medications including over-the-counter products and herbal supplements, and physical examination assessing for stigmata of chronic liver disease as well as signs or symptoms pointing to a specific liver disease etiology.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113JkQRa]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

When should liver blood tests be checked?

There are a range of settings where requesting liver blood tests should be considered to determine the presence, or severity, of liver disease:

Non-specific symptoms

Liver disease tends to develop silently with no signs or symptoms, and there is evidence that the majority of people with late-stage liver disease are undiagnosed. However, inflammatory liver diseases including autoimmune liver disease and viral hepatitis can be associated with symptoms. For example, 75% of patients with AIH have one or more non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea or anorexia. These diseases can be effectively treated, and are often diagnosed late, so the presence of these non-specific symptoms would be an indication to check routine liver blood tests, accepting that there are many other causes for these symptoms.

Evidence of chronic liver disease

Patients with symptoms or signs of cirrhosis, portal hypertension or liver failure, including ascites, peripheral oedema, spider naevi and hepatosplenomegaly, need liver blood tests to monitor their function. In that regard the inclusion of INR is important to fully define their synthetic function.

Conditions which are associated with a high risk of developing liver disease

Autoimmune liver disease is more common in patients with pre-existing autoimmune diseases, and liver blood tests may be appropriate if clinical symptoms change to suggest development of liver disease — for example, pruritus in primary biliary cholangitis. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) have a particular notable risk of developing the autoimmune cholestatic liver disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis; disease prevalence is estimated at just under 10%. Primary sclerosing cholangitis-inflammatory bowel disease is associated with increased complications relating to liver disease, as well as increased colorectal cancer risk. Periodic monitoring of liver blood tests is therefore common practice, with a low clinical threshold for investigation of cholestatic liver blood tests by MRI. In the absence of currently approved medical therapy ongoing efforts clinically focus on early recognition of disease with subsequent risk stratification, in order to facilitate timely consideration of trial-based intervention.

Functional and morphological non-imaging tests

Indocyanine green clearance

Q18: What is the role of indocyanine green in preoperative assessment of liver function before liver resection?

ICG clearance testing can be used to assess overall liver function. To estimate remnant liver function, ICG needs to be combined with volumetry.

Recommendation grade: Strong (major hepatectomies); conditional (minor hepatectomies) | median level of evidence: 2+ (range 2− to 2+).

Expert panel comment

Several studiesinvestigated preoperative ICG clearance mainly in major but also minor hepatectomies. The results showed that it reflects global liver function, and that impaired preoperative ICG clearance is associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications including liver dysfunction. However, additional CT/MRI volumetry is necessary in order to estimate FLR function. Benefits of ICG clearance include its availability, reproducibility, relatively low costs, and negligible invasiveness and risk for patients. Nevertheless, most studies had a retrospective design that was prone to selection bias. Varying ICG retention rates after 15 min and plasma disappearance rate cut-offs were proposed and different endpoints were assessed in these studies. Thus, adequate expertise with this technique and its interpretation is required. ICG clearance is affected by hyperbilirubinaemia and cholestasis, resulting in less reliable results in patients presenting with these conditions. Furthermore, in the event of potentially inhomogeneous parenchymal function (for example after volume modulation strategies or in patients with portal vein thrombosis), calculation of estimated FLR function on the basis of overall liver function through ICG measurement and volumetry may be affected.

### Hepatotoxicity of chemotherapy [^112kvv24]. The Oncologist (2001). Low credibility.

After assessment of tumor histology, the next important factor to consider in the selection of a chemotherapy regime is organ function. Patients who are to receive chemotherapy require careful assessment of liver function prior to treatment to determine which drugs may not be appropriate, and which drug doses should be modified. Following therapy abnormalities of liver function tests may be due to the therapy rather than to progressive disease, and this distinction is of critical importance. Furthermore, not all abnormalities in liver function are due to the tumor or its treatment, and other processes, such as hepatitis, must be kept in mind. This article reviews the hepatic toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents, and suggests dose modifications based upon liver function abnormalities. Emphasis is placed on agents known to be hepatotoxic, and those agents with hepatic metabolism.

### AASLD practice guideline on blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^113FmFw6]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

AASLD blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment — methods and grading approach are as follows: Recommendations were developed from a commissioned systematic review conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center and then graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The panel monitored the literature and included relevant studies through April 2022. Strength of recommendations was determined assuming that tests with acceptable (> 70%), excellent (> 80%), or outstanding (> 90%) diagnostic accuracy are associated with improved patient outcomes, and recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable). Studies with mixed etiology and smaller sample sizes (< 50 individuals) were excluded.

### Assessment of liver function before major hepatectomy [^115DQQ4V]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Although dynamic testing has limitations as it only involves surrogate markers of liver function, meaning that they do not provide a direct assessment of all aspects of liver function and are subject to variability and individual differences, estimating liver function with hepatobiliary scintigraphy before major liver resection has been shown to reduce the incidence of PHLF. The technique is simple and can be performed at every nuclear medicine department with the help of practical guidelines currently available.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^111Zqb9T]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — summary statements on abnormal liver chemistries state that liver chemistries including ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are markers of liver injury, not liver function, and should be referred to as liver chemistries, or liver tests; albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time are markers of hepatocellular function that can be influenced by extrahepatic factors; elevations of AST and/or ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin suggest hepatocellular injury and are the abnormal liver chemistries that require assessment and potential evaluation; ALT is a more specific marker of hepatic injury than AST; and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of hepatic origin may be confirmed by elevation of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^113nKCKt]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) — principles of liver functional assessment state that general assessment of liver function should include a thorough history and physical examination as well as serum laboratory tests, with evaluation for clinically significant portal hypertension and confirmation by measuring the hepatic vein pressure gradient, and assessment of hepatic synthetic function (albumin and coagulation studies) and total bilirubin. The CTP Score classification is the most commonly used tool to assess liver function and classifies patients with cirrhosis as having compensated (Class A) or decompensated (Classes B and C) cirrhosis based upon blood tests and extent of ascites and encephalopathy. Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is a numerical scale ranging from 6 to 40 to risk stratify patients in the setting of cirrhosis and has been adopted by UNOS to rank patients on the liver transplantation waiting list for donor allocation. Another alternative to the CTP score is the Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade, which may help stratify patients with relatively stable cirrhosis. Noninvasive tools such as ultrasound-based or magnetic resonance-based elastography as well as histologic evaluation of non-tumor liver can be used to determine presence and extent of inflammation/hepatitis, steatosis, and fibrosis/cirrhosis. Most systemic therapies for HCC have been studied in patients with CTP A liver cirrhosis, and treatment in patients with greater degrees of liver dysfunction requires individualized decision-making including review of any dose modifications/guidelines for hepatic dysfunction in package insert for specific agents, selection of alternate agents with evidence for safety in hepatic dysfunction, and close monitoring for toxicity. Use of these agents in the CTP B population is largely extrapolated from data from patients with CTP A liver disease and retrospective/real world data demonstrating diminished efficacy but no new safety signals. Patients with CTP C liver disease or progressive hepatic decompensation to end-stage liver failure should only be offered systemic therapy in select circumstances or clinical trials given the unclear survival benefit in this setting, and may require transition to best supportive/palliative care. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### E-AHPBA-ESSO-ESSR innsbruck consensus guidelines for preoperative liver function assessment before hepatectomy [^115KM9ff]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Expert panel comment

The cause of PHLF is multifactorial, and closely related to the volume and function of the remnant liver. This is reflected by various — either imaging or blood parameter-based — tools aiming to predict PHLF. The combination of volumetric and laboratory data offers a non-invasive tool with more accurate prediction of PHLF. Numerous risk factors have been identified, including clinical signs of portal hypertension on imaging or specific laboratory parameters. In patients who underwent resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), an albumin–indocyanine green (ICG) evaluation grade of 2 combined with clinical signs of portal hypertension was shown to result in a six-fold increased rate of PHLF. In this regard, several nomograms have been developed, including the criterium clinical signs of portal hypertension, providing good performance in predicting PHLF and outperforming Child–Pugh and MELD-based algorithms.

Q4: Should functional liver assessment be performed in patients scheduled to receive a volume augmentation strategy?

Assessment of liver function should be considered in all patients in whom any type of hepatic volume modulation is planned.

Recommendation grade: Strong | median level of evidence: 2+ (range 2− to 2++).

Expert panel comment

A variety of procedures have been proposed to increase the volume of the FLR to mitigate the risks of extended liver resections. Portal vein embolization (PVE) or ligation, associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS), and double vein embolization have been introduced successfully and adopted into clinical routine by several centres. The growth in volume achieved by these augmentation procedures, however, may not correlate with an actual concordant increase in remnant liver function. Functional liver assessment tests provide an estimate of overall parenchymal quality in these circumstances, and may help in selecting patients for such advanced resections. For calculation of the predicted FLR functional capacity in relation to total liver function, either dynamic tests need to be combined with quantitative liver volume assessment (volumetry), or a functional test with specific assessment of regional functional capacity (such as hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS)) should be performed. Repeated functional testing before augmentation, and again before surgery, should be considered to better estimate dynamic changes.

CF Foundation screening recommendations — laboratory tests for cystic fibrosis hepatobiliary involvement: The CFF recommends that these tests be performed on an annual basis beginning at CF diagnosis, and we recommend further evaluation if any abnormalities are persistent (> 3–6 mo). Prior guidelines recommended further action at 1.5–2× upper limit of normal values for increased specificity, but it is important to use age and sex-normative values. Common liver test abnormalities in cystic fibrosis may include elevations in serum AST, ALT, GGT, and/or alkaline phosphatase.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1114tRa1]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Applicability

This guideline has provided advice on the pathways and tools to be used to best manage patients with abnormal liver blood tests. The pathways will be freely disseminated and incorporated into primary care IT systems to allow automatic calculation of risk scores when appropriate, to ensure recommendations can be put into practice.

Facilitators of the guideline will include specialist societies — in particular, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the British Liver Trust and the British Society of Gastroenterology. Barriers to use include access to the guideline and its potential complexity. This has been addressed by inclusion of all relevant stakeholders, a simplified set of pathway figures and a comprehensive dissemination plan.

The potential resource implications of applying the recommendations have been considered, and will be formally evaluated after adoption. At present, investigation and referral of patients with abnormal liver blood tests is variable, resulting in both unnecessary referral of patients and missing of significant liver disease. This pathway may rationalise the approach to abnormal liver blood tests and reduce healthcare expenses. An example of this is in Lambeth, where such a pathway has been successfully introduced, reducing referral of patients with NAFLD and minimal fibrosis.

### Circulating markers of liver function and cardiovascular disease risk [^112GFrQG]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Measurement of serum concentrations of various liver enzymes and other nonenzymatic proteins and metabolites of heme metabolism (eg, bilirubin) is often undertaken in clinical practice. Measurement of these liver function tests is simple, quick, and relatively inexpensive. However, interpreting the liver function test results in patients without evidence of liver disease is often challenging. Concentrations of some of liver enzymes, such as γ-glutamyltransferase or alkaline phosphatase, and concentrations of liver-derived metabolites, such as bilirubin, may be influenced by metabolic processes beyond the liver, sometimes making interpretation of the test results difficult. This scenario frequently occurs both in individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease and in patients with known cardiovascular disease, often resulting in the clinicians ignoring the test results. In this brief review, we discuss the evidence for associations between key serum liver function tests and cardiovascular disease risk and where associations are robust; we provide an interpretation for possible mechanistic links between the liver function test and cardiovascular disease.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1133f5Yq]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood or function tests (LFTs), which are perceived to be inexpensive, are checked ever more frequently in both primaryand secondary care in an attempt to exclude liver disease, for the monitoring of potential adverse effects of drugs on the liver such as statins, and for the investigation of the generally unwell patient. These tests often produce an abnormal result, the clinical significance of which is unclear. In many cases though they are requested in response to non-specific symptoms where there is little potential link between symptoms and likelihood of liver disease, or the blood tests are performed for unrelated reasons such as chronic disease monitoring. This commonly presages a cycle of additional liver blood test testing in an otherwise asymptomatic individual, and notably, most patients referred to hospital with abnormal liver tests do not have any evidence of significant liver disease. For example, University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust received 130 849 requests for liver blood tests in 2016, from 82 general practices and of these, 38 636 (30%) contained at least one abnormal result, defined as being outside the stated reference range. The Abnormal Liver Function Investigations Evaluation (ALFIE) study from Tayside in Scotland showed that over a 10-year period 25% of the community population aged over 16 had liver blood tests, with about a third having at least one abnormal value. Although an abnormal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was predictive of liver disease (HR = 4.2), the rate of detection was remarkably low, with only 3.9% of those with an abnormal value being diagnosed with significant liver disease within 5 years of the test. Thus, used in isolation, liver blood tests are neither specific diagnostic tools nor specific exclusion tools, whereas they can be more effectively used to assess the extent of liver fibrosis if incorporated into algorithmsor used in conjunction with other modalities.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1134JoKn]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma — assessment of liver function includes liver function testing with serum bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), prothrombin time (PT) expressed as international normalized ratio (INR), albumin, and platelet count as a surrogate for portal hypertension; other recommended tests include complete blood count (CBC), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine to assess kidney function, and creatinine is also an established prognostic marker in patients with liver disease; further assessment of hepatic functional reserve before hepatic resection in cirrhosis may use tools such as US and MRI elastography, non-focal liver biopsy, and transjugular liver biopsy with pressure measurements, and there are emerging data for functional MRI assessment; the Child-Pugh (C-P) classification has been traditionally used in cirrhosis, the C-P score incorporates serum albumin, bilirubin, PT and clinical assessments of encephalopathy and ascites, and it provides a general estimate of liver function by classifying patients as having compensated (class A) or decompensated (classes B and C) cirrhosis.

### AASLD practice guideline on noninvasive liver disease assessment of portal hypertension [^1117qzHx]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

AASLD guideline framework — evidence grading and recommendation strength are defined as follows: The guideline uses the GRADE approach, and the quality of evidence for each recommendation is rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. Strength of recommendations is based on the quality of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, burden of testing, and feasibility, and the "strength of recommendation" determination assumed that performing tests with good (> 80%) or excellent (> 90%) diagnostic accuracy is associated with improved patient outcomes. Accordingly, recommendations were graded as either strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, with acceptable variation), and because patient representation was not included, patient values and preferences beyond the panel's experience were not specifically addressed; technical remarks and supporting evidence are included to facilitate implementation.

### A clinical perspective on the criteria for liver resection and the use of liver function tests [^111idDk3]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

We emphasize specifically the use of quantitative dynamic liver function tests [i.e. ICG clearance, 99m Tc-mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS), galactose elimination capacity (GEC), and 99m Tc-labeled galactosyl human serum albumin scintigraphy (GSAS)] inasmuch as conventional liver function tests such as prothrombin time, serum bilirubin, and the Child-Pugh score are relatively insensitive and are thus lagging indicators for determining whether a liver resection can be safely performed. It is well known that there are notable discrepancies between the above-mentioned dynamic liver function tests in the assessment of liver function. In our patient population, ICG and 99m Tc-mebrofenin uptake exhibited similar pharmacokinetics in regenerating rat livers (that also corresponded well to the extent of hepatic damage), whereas the GSAS and GEC tests displayed an underestimation and an overestimation, respectively, of liver function in comparison to ICG and 99m Tc-mebrofenin uptake (unpublished). This is because liver function encompasses a broad spectrum of processes, ranging from uptake, synthesis, biotransformation, and systemic and canalicular secretion, whereby each test measures a different component of that spectrum.

In summary, criteria on the basis of which extended liver resections are performed should preferably be dictated by functional parameters rather than volume alone, especially when livers are resected to a minimally accepted remnant volume. Furthermore, we advocate the use of dynamic liver function tests such as ICG or 99m Tc-mebrofenin uptake for testing liver function due to their sensitivity and prognostic strength. We acknowledge that each of these tests reflects a limited aspect of liver function only. However, currently no better, clinically viable alternatives are available.

### Noninvasive assessment of hepatic decompensation [^113Lsmaw]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The evolvement and documentation of the benefit of noninvasive tests (NITs) in clinical hepatology has accelerated in recent years. While the assessment of patients from their signs and symptoms remains essential in daily clinical practice, objective measures are important to standardize patient management. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a noninvasive test as a medical test that does not cut the skin or enter the body. However, blood sampling from simple venipuncture and surplus samples of, for example, body fluids from samples taken for noninvestigational purposes are also considered noninvasive. Many NITs were developed to diagnose and assess severity at the early stages of disease. However, NITs may be equally valuable when applied at more advanced stages of disease, to patients with decompensated disease, or to patients at risk of decompensation. Recent developments have provided a wealth of data to support the applicability of NITs in these patient groups. In addition to serving a diagnostic purpose and guiding decisions on treatment, several NITs also provide important prognostic information. – While diagnostic NITs for patients with suspected liver disease are often used sequentially along a health care pathway, secondary and tertiary care more often use NITs in parallel, looking for concordant results to support management decisions. This review provides an overview of NITs that are used to inform clinical decision-making in patients with decompensated disease or patients at risk of decompensation.

Noninvasive tests to guide clinical decision-making

Conceptually, NITs are only relevant when there is a decision to be made and when the test result can influence the decision. If the physician is certain about the next steps in the management of his/her patient, or the NIT provides no information to support or contradict the decision, then noninvasive testing is superfluous. For patients at risk of decompensation, NITs often inform decisions regarding whether to start, adjust, or stop interventions to halt the development of first decompensation, avoid further decompensation, improve quality of life, reduce the risk of hospitalization, or decrease the risk of mortality (Table 1).

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^116GtydU]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Simplified HCV treatment algorithm for treatment-naive adults with compensated cirrhosis defines eligibility, exclusions, and pretreatment assessments: The algorithm applies to persons aged ≥ 18 years who have not been previously treated and have evidence of compensated cirrhosis (Child-Turcotte-Pugh [CTP] class A) but not decompensated cirrhosis (CTP class B or C), and a CTP score ≥ 7 or any history of decompensation disqualifies these patients. Recommended pretreatment assessment includes clinical evaluation for ascites and hepatic encephalopathy and ultrasound imaging of the liver within the prior 6 months to evaluate for hepatocellular carcinoma and subclinical ascites, and any of these clinical or imaging findings are contraindications to use of the simplified treatment algorithm. Other disqualifying circumstances mirror the previous section, and medication reconciliation, assessment for potential drug–drug interactions, and pretreatment education and counseling are the same as for treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis. Pretreatment laboratory assessment includes complete blood count (CBC), INR, a hepatic function panel, and eGFR within 3 months of initiating antiviral therapy.

Recommendations were graded as strong (apply to most patients with minimal variation and can be adapted as policy in most situations) or conditional (apply to a majority of patients, but variation in care is acceptable), and statements with < 75% agreement were rediscussed using a structured process adapted by the AASLD practice metrics committee.

### Best practice in primary care pathology: review 5 [^112wxBHe]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

This fifth best practice review examines three series of common primary care questions in laboratory medicine: (1) minor liver function test abnormalities; (2) laboratory monitoring of patients receiving lithium; and (3) investigation of possible venous thromboembolism. The review is presented in question-answer format, referenced for each question series. The recommendations represent a precis of guidance found using a standardised literature search of national and international guidance notes, consensus statements, health policy documents and evidence-based medicine reviews, supplemented by Medline Embase searches to identify relevant primary research documents. They are not standards but form a guide to be set in the clinical context. Most are consensus-based rather than evidence-based. They will be updated periodically to take account of new information.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113z2Ems]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age > 3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

Rigour of development

The published literature was searched using PubMed, Medline, Web of Knowledge and the Cochrane database between October 2014 and February 2016. The Guidelines Development Group met through a series of meetings and teleconferences during that time. The level of supporting evidence (graded levels 1 to 5) is assessed by the Oxford Centre For Evidence Based Medicine (Table 1). The recommendation grade is determined on the level of evidence as follows:

Table 1
Evidence grading

consistent level 1 studies;
consistent level 2 or 3 studies or extrapolations from level 1 studies;
level 4 studies or extrapolations from level 2 or 3 studies;
level 5 evidence or troublingly inconsistent or inconclusive studies of any level.

Areas of disagreement about the recommendation grade were subjected to discussion and, if necessary, voting by members of the guidelines group. Where possible, the health benefits, side effects and risks of recommendations were discussed. The guidelines were subject to peer review after submission for consideration for publication in Gut.

Clarity and presentation

Recommendations are intended to be specific to particular situations and patient groups; where necessary, different options are listed. Where the evidence and recommendation is restricted to adults, this will be stated. The term 'patients' implies all ages. Key recommendations are linked to discussion threads on a discussion forum hosted on the BSG website.

Applicability

We have discussed organisational changes that may be needed in order to implement these recommendations with the British Liver Trust, the British Association for the Study of the Liver, the British Society of Gastroenterology, the Royal College of General Practice, the Specialist Advisory Committee in Clinical Biochemistry/Royal College of Pathology and Association for Clinical Biochemistry, the British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (BSPGHAN), Public Health England, the British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiologists (BSGAR) and the Society of Acute Medicine. We have attempted to identify key criteria for monitoring and audit purposes.

Editorial independence and conflict of interest

Guideline group members have declared any conflicts of interest. There is full editorial independence from the BSG, which commissioned the guideline. The guideline was subsequently peer reviewed by the CSSC, who provided comments and suggestions.

### What methods are being used to create an evidence base on the use of laboratory tests to monitor long-term conditions in primary care? A scoping review [^1132rgZc]. Family Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 4.
Methodology of included studies: study design (A) and statistical methods (B).

The most frequently studied laboratory tests were renal function tests (35%), including estimated glomerular filtration rate, creatinine, urea, potassium and proteinuria, followed by HbA1c (23%) and lipids (17%). Other tests that were less common, were liver function tests (including liver enzymes, 99m Tc-Hepida plasma clearance and bilirubin), blood glucose, clotting tests, thyroid and natriuretic peptides (Fig. 5A).

Figure 5.
Tests (A) and reported outcome measures (B) of included studies.

Thirty-six studies (38%) reported 'rate of monitoring' as the primary outcome. These were studies aiming to show the variation in monitoring and often compared the actual rate of monitoring to what is recommended in current guidelines ('compliance with guidelines') (Fig. 5B). Thirteen studies (14%) reported patient outcomes, such as disease progression or incidence of complications. Seven studies (7%) reported costs as the outcome, such as cost-effectiveness of a screening program for certain patient subgroups. Two studies investigated the response to test results, i.e. whether to the clinician acted on the abnormal test results. Although one study reported patient harms associated with not-testing, i.e. incidence of adverse outcomes in patients who were not monitored regularly, none of the studies investigated patient harms due to over-testing.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113CmpU6]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Does the extent and duration of abnormal liver blood tests determine subsequent investigation?

Many previous guidelines have stipulated minimum criteria for the extent and duration of any liver blood test abnormality before further investigation is considered, which in the main has been influenced by workload considerations given the large numbers of liver blood tests outside the standard reference intervals. However, over 50% of patients presenting with end-stage liver disease, without a previous diagnosis of chronic liver disease, were previously noted to have abnormal liver blood tests in their health records, indicating inadequate investigation. The Epidemiology of Liver Disease in Tayside (ELDIT) project used electronic case record linkage to diagnose liver disease and demonstrated that 20% of all liver blood tests measured were found to be abnormal, with < 10% of these explained by existing liver disease. Thus, GPs and practice nurses who request liver blood tests have the problem of managing the 20% patients who have test results reported as 'abnormal' and outside the laboratory reference intervals. GP management strategies can vary from ignoring some results (potentially unsafe), repeating them (inconvenient to the patient), requesting more tests (expensive) or referring patients to a gastroenterologist (incurring NHS costs). The NHS faces the potential for a significant rise in the costs and consequences of the uncertainty GPs have in managing liver blood test results, necessitating clear guidance on how to respond to these tests.

### Preoperative assessment of liver function [^112YBq2o]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

At the present time, the decision to resect and the choice of the extent ofa hepatic resection are largely based on surgical judgment. The CP score is the best assessment tool we can now employ. There is uniform agreement that even segmental resections are not possible in the vast majority of Child Class B patients, CP score 7 to 9. The CP score can be augmented by radiographic testing, ICG retention testing, and by assessing tumor extent and the severity of the patient's cirrhosis at surgery. Surgeons need a simple means to assist with liver function evaluation — a test to augment the CP score. Although determining ICG retention is simple, it is questionable whether it adds to one's ability to define the poor-risk patient with better accuracy than the CP score. Abundant data exist to dispute the accuracy and reproducibility of ICG retention. That surgeons use it says more about the fervent desire to find a test that supports clinical judgment in these difficult patients than the scientific validity of the test. Whether a series of tests would better define the Child-Pugh Class A patient who is also a relatively poor risk is not clear at present. Many investigations demonstrate the correlation of various assessment tools with each other, yet nothing distinguishes them in predicting risk beyond what is learned from the CP score. In a group of CP Class A patients, the extent of the disease, the nature of underlying cirrhosis, and the extent of resection provide the clinical backdrop against which a decision for resection must be made. It may well be that one test may not do it, or that one single assessment of the ICG or the 15-minute receptor volume of GSA may be inadequate to project the nuances of liver function. Thus, 99m-Tc GSA scintigraphy will provide volumetric receptor data, as well as kinetic distribution curves, and may prove a useful test in the future. Whether GSA is ultimately to be proven useful requires a correlation of the test with actual clinical outcomes, rather than correlation with other tests or with the CP score. Discovering which patients are the poor risk Child Class A patients is the desired goal. To have value, the GSA scan must augment, not mimic, the CP score. In view of the fact that experienced surgeons appear to be astute in their ability to select patients for hepatic resection, finding a more refined test will require large numbers of patients at several centers to correlate the test results and the outcomes against the spectrum of postoperative liver failure, including death. It appears that one lesson learned from portal vein embolization is that functional liver volume can be preserved. The compensatory hyperplasia that occurs in the contralateral hepatic lobe demonstrates two important features: (1) function of the opposite lobe has been transferred when evaluated by 99m-Tc-GSA, and (2) one considerable metabolic drain on the postoperative recovery from hepatic resection (ie, liver regeneration) can be attended to before the surgery. Cirrhotic livers do regenerate, but more slowly. Thus, pregrowing the remnant section of liver eliminates one stress on liver reserves following liver resection. For hepatocellular carcinoma or metastasis in cirrhotic patients, portal vein occlusion may be the best way to improve hepatic functional reserve. ICG retention may not corroborate return-to-baseline hepatic function within 2 weeks of portal vein occlusion, but may demonstrate a return to baseline when studied 6 to 8 weeks following the procedure. 99m-Tc-GSA is presently the best means to document compensatory hyperplasia and, possibly, a shift of functional reserve to the planned remnant of a more than four-segment hepatic resection. Whether this will predict the safe outcome of resection remains to be seen.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115LahNR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Importance of context

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin compared with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past/current medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)

### Liver biopsy [^112KDkkd]. Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Indications for liver biopsy — overview states that histological assessment of the liver, and thus liver biopsy, is a cornerstone in the evaluation and management of patients with liver disease. It is likely that liver biopsy will remain a valuable diagnostic tool even as sensitive and relatively accurate blood tests have become widely available, although noninvasive techniques (imaging, blood tests) may replace use of liver histology particularly for assessment of the severity of liver fibrosis. This guideline deals exclusively with liver biopsy as it relates to adult liver disease. As of 2009, liver biopsy currently has three major roles: (1) for diagnosis, (2) for assessment of prognosis (disease staging), and/or (3) to assist in making therapeutic management decisions. Although liver biopsy is often essential in the management of patients with liver disease, physicians and patients may find it to be a difficult undertaking because of the associated risks.

### Community pathways for the early detection and risk stratification of chronic liver disease: a narrative systematic review [^115q5VCP]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Patients with chronic liver disease are often diagnosed during an index presentation to hospital with decompensated cirrhosis or liver-related events, and these presentations are associated with high mortality. However, there is often a long asymptomatic phase, in which there is an opportunity for earlier diagnosis and interventions to prevent progression to advanced disease. Therefore, strategies for early diagnosis and interventions (including behavioural changes and pharmacological treatments) that prevent patients progressing to cirrhosis and its associated complications probably have substantial benefits for patients and health-care services. Many community pathways have been generated. Some pathways focus on abnormal liver function tests as a starting point to diagnose liver disease. Other pathways target groups at greater risk of chronic liver disease-particularly people with harmful alcohol consumption, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. This systematic review summarises the existing strategies available for the early detection or risk stratification of liver disease, focusing primarily on alcohol-related liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Conducting randomised clinical trials that compare different strategies will be essential to elucidate which pathways are acceptable to patients, feasible, provide high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of liver disease, improve liver-related outcomes, and are most cost-effective at the population level.

### The precarious state of the liver after a fontan operation: summary of a multidisciplinary symposium [^1151b4vE]. Pediatric Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Noninvasive Assessment of Liver Function and Fibrosis: Utility After the Fontan Operation

Noninvasive measures of hepatic function, structure, and fibrosis have been developed for clinical use and tailored to several different disease states. Testing can be focused on assessment of ongoing liver injury (test results that reflect liver damage or inflammatory states such as liver enzymes, FibroTest findings, and others) including measurements of true liver function (e.g. bilirubin, albumin, international normalized ratio [INR], indocyanine green clearance) and assessments of liver anatomy or fibrosis (e.g. routine imaging, elastography, diffusion-weighted MRI, contrast-enhanced ultrasound). Despite this plethora of available options, tests that distinguish accurately between milder gradations of liver disease in children are almost completely lacking, and this is especially true for the assessment of liver disease in the setting of congestive cardiac disease.

Evaluation of the degree of liver compromise in children and adults with congenital heart disease is of particular importance due to the significant impact of even mild liver disease on outcome from cardiac surgery, with overall mortality as high as 17% and an even higher mortality rate among those with more advanced liver disease.

It is clear that assessment of hepatic disease before cardiac surgery or transplantation is clinically important. Children with Fontan physiology pose particular difficulties for the clinician due to the nature of Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) and the confounding features of Fontan physiology or treatment. The FALD condition is unique. Although variable, congestive hepatopathy appears to develop slowly in most of these children, often without obvious clinical features. Generally, elevation in liver enzymes is minimal or absent due to the lack of significant inflammation and cell death as fibrosis gradually accumulates.

### ACG clinical guideline: liver disease and pregnancy [^1159MCAQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — evaluation of abnormal liver enzymes in pregnancy states that a pregnant patient presenting with abnormal liver tests should undergo standard workup as with any non-pregnant individual (strong recommendation, very low level of evidence). The basis for the workup of abnormal liver tests in a pregnant woman should be predicated on understanding the normal physiologic changes observed during pregnancy. The incidence of abnormal liver tests in pregnant women is 3–5%, even in this relatively young and healthy population. Of note, during pregnancy, cardiac output is increased by 40–45% with substantive increases to the renal, uterine, and skin systems, while the liver blood flow shows little change during pregnancy. Any abnormality seen in transaminases and bilirubin needs further evaluation.

### A comparison between two strategies for monitoring hepatic function during antituberculous therapy [^115zpSHx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

The optimum strategy for monitoring liver function during antituberculous therapy is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the value of the American Thoracic Society risk-factor approach for predicting drug-induced liver injury and to compare with a uniform policy of liver function testing in all patients at 2 weeks.

Methods

We conducted an observational study of adult patients undergoing therapy for active tuberculosis at a tertiary center. All patients had alanine transferase measurement at baseline and 2 weeks following commencement of therapy. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were used to assess strategies.

Measurements and Main Results

There were 288 patients included, and 21 (7.3%) developed drug-induced liver injury (57.1% "early" at 2 wk and 42.9% "late", after 2 wk). There were increased rates of individuals with HIV infection in the early drug-induced liver injury group compared with no drug-induced liver injury and late drug-induced liver injury groups (33% vs. 7.1% vs. 0%; P = 0.004). The American Thoracic Society algorithm had a sensitivity and specificity of 66.7 and 65.6%, respectively, for prediction of early and 22.2% and 63.7% for late drug-induced liver injury. The uniform monitoring policy had poor sensitivity but better specificity (22.2 and 82.1%) for prediction of late drug-induced liver injury.

Conclusions

In our urban, ethnically diverse population, a risk-factor approach is neither sensitive nor specific for prediction of drug-induced liver injury. A uniform policy of liver function testing at 2 weeks is useful for prompt identification of a subgroup who develop early drug-induced liver injury and may offer better specificity in ruling out late drug-induced liver injury.

### Trends in indirect liver function marker testing in wales from 2000 to 2017 and their association with age and sex: an observational study [^117NxXoi]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Despite the rise in liver disease in recent years, the routine use of AST in the Welsh population has at the same time decreased, possibly due to official guidelines. This is in contrast to the overall rise in venous blood testing as shown by the rapid increase in the use of the other blood markers. The reduction in AST testing is concerning as many composite liver fibrosis markers depend on it. Therefore, to implement opportunistic, widespread screening for liver disease will require either a reversal of this trend and the reinstatement of the AST in the standard liver blood panel test, or new algorithms not dependent on the AST, such as the recently reported CIRRhosis Using Standard tests, will need developing.

We have also shown important differences between age groups and sexes in what would be considered an abnormal ALT (and to a lesser extent AST). Adapting fibrosis markers to include adjustments for these age and sex differences is likely to be of crucial importance in future.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Intelligent liver function testing (iLFT): a trial of automated diagnosis and staging of liver disease in primary care [^111ZhDT5]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Liver function tests (LFTs) are frequently requested blood tests which may indicate liver disease. LFTs are commonly abnormal, the causes of which can be complex and are frequently under investigated. This can lead to missed opportunities to diagnose and treat liver disease at an early stage. We developed an automated investigation algorithm, intelligent liver function testing (iLFT), with the aim of increasing the early diagnosis of liver disease in a cost-effective manner.

Methods

We developed an automated system that further investigated abnormal LFTs on initial testing samples to generate a probable diagnosis and management plan. We integrated this automated investigation algorithm into the laboratory management system, based on minimal diagnostic criteria, liver fibrosis estimation, and reflex testing for causes of liver disease. This algorithm then generated a diagnosis and/or management plan. A stepped-wedged trial design was utilised to compare LFT outcomes in general practices in the 6 months before and after introduction of the iLFT system. Diagnostic outcomes were collated and compared.

Results

Of eligible patients with abnormal LFTs, 490 were recruited to the control group and 64 were recruited to the intervention group. The primary diagnostic outcome was based on the general practitioner diagnosis, which agreed with the iLFT diagnosis in 67% of cases. In the iLFT group, the diagnosis of liver disease was increased by 43%. Additionally, there were significant increases in the rates of GP visits after diagnosis and the number of referrals to secondary care in the iLFT group. iLFT was cost-effective with a low initial incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £284 per correct diagnosis, and a saving to the NHS of £3,216 per patient lifetime.

Conclusions

iLFT increases liver disease diagnoses, improves quality of care, and is highly cost-effective. This can be achieved with minor changes to working practices and exploitation of functionality existing within modern laboratory diagnostics systems.

Lay Summary

There is a growing epidemic of advanced liver disease, this could be offset by early detection and management. Checking liver blood tests (LFTs) should be an opportunity to diagnose liver problems, but abnormal results are often incompletely investigated. In this study we were able to substantially increase the diagnostic yield of the abnormal LFTs using the automated intelligent LFT system. With the addition of referral recommendations and management plans, this strategy provides optimum investigation and management of LFTs and is cost saving to the NHS.

Adult liver transplant (LT) recipients — liver test monitoring: The frequency of monitoring with liver tests should be individualized by the transplant center according to the time from LT, the complications from LT, the stability of serial test results, and the underlying cause (grade 1, level A). Liver tests are routinely monitored after LT, and when abnormal liver tests are recognized in a healthy, asymptomatic LT recipient, it is reasonable to repeat the tests in 1 to 2 weeks; a decision to investigate further should be based on the persistence and severity of the liver test abnormalities.

All chronic liver disease can lead to liver fibrosis. Assessment of the severity of liver fibrosis is central to making treatment and management decisions. Liver biopsy, the gold standard for liver fibrosis assessment, is invasive and carries risks of complications and sampling errors. The use of noninvasive elastography-based radiologic methods of liver fibrosis determination is limited to centers that have the capabilities. Laboratory liver fibrosis determinations, both general clinical scoring systems and combination biomarker panels, are accessible to a wider population of clinicians for identifying patients at low risk of advanced fibrosis who do not need liver biopsies.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1126AcTQ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Of note, recent guidance by NICE on NAFLD proposed single testing with serum ELF measurements without recourse to algorithms or other diagnostic modalities, on the basis of cost-effectiveness analyses. This recommendation was noted and carefully considered during the drafting of this guideline. On balance, however, it was felt that the evidence for diagnostic tests, and their use in combination in NAFLD, was still evolving and thus this guidance took a broader view setting out a pathway structure with a range of options. This view is endorsed by the EASL-ALEH guidelines for the non-invasive assessment of liver disease.

Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine their extent of liver fibrosis.
First-line testing should use either FIB-4 or NAFLD Fibrosis Score – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D)
Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum ELF measurements or Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. (level 2b, grade B)
We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area figures 1 and 2.

ARLD

Alcohol-related cirrhosis is the the most common cause of liver-related mortality in Western populations. The majority of patients with this condition are heavy daily drinkers, with a median alcohol consumption of around 120 units/week. Notably, 25% of the population drink more than recommended guidelines (≤ 14 units/week), with 10% drinking twice as much and 1.4% drinking more than 75 units/week. The relationship between alcohol consumption and liver cirrhosis is exponential; at 20 units/week the relative risk is approximately 3, whereas at 80 units/week it is 30. There is also a synergy between alcohol intake and obesity; when body mass index (BMI) is > 35, the risk of liver disease doubles for any given alcohol intake (see figures 1 and 3).

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1156xFwp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — initial evaluation steps for abnormal liver chemistries emphasize confirming true abnormalities, medication/supplement review, selective biopsy, and GGT use. Before initiating a workup, repeat the laboratory panel and/or perform a clarifying test to confirm the abnormality. Physicians should ask about prescribed/over‑the‑counter drugs, complementary/alternative medicines, and dietary/herbal supplements that may be associated with drug‑induced liver injury (DILI). A liver biopsy is recommended when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible. An elevation of alkaline phosphatase should be confirmed with an elevation in gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT), and GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease without other abnormal chemistries. All are stated as Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

Expert panel comment

Recently identified markers, such as von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen, serotonin, ADAMTS13, serum GP73, M2BPGi, type IV collagen 7S, and microRNA panels, have been studied in a very heterogeneous manner based on small or medium-sized cohorts. A number of these markers have demonstrated very good predictive performance (for example, the AUC-ROC of vWF-antigen for PHLF is 0.725), and some studies also included independent validation cohorts. Further confirmatory and comparative research is, however, needed.

Q11: Are routine or newer blood-based parameters or scores including these variables able to monitor liver function recovery dynamically?

Newer blood-based parameters (such as microRNA panels) or combined scores of traditional markers (such as APRI/ALBI score) could be used to monitor liver function recovery dynamically after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or in the first step of liver volume modulation strategies. Currently, these results remain exploratory and need further validation in larger cohorts and subgroups of patients.

Recommendation grade: Conditional | median level of evidence: 2+ (range 2+).

Expert panel comment

There is exploratory evidence to suggest that a miRNA signature panel including a ratio of two markers (miRNA 151a-5p to 192-5p or 122-5p), or the APRI/ALBI score can predict the risk of PHLF before operation. They may also be used to monitor liver function recovery dynamically after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or during the first step after liver volume modulation strategies (such as ALPPS) in conjunction with cross-sectional imaging. These miRNA panels have been validated internally in a prospective cohort, and a CE-certified assay kit is now available (hepatoMiR ®), but external validation studies are still ongoing. The APRI/ALBI score has been validated in a large cohort from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database; comparative studies with other tests are awaited. Further exploratory studies including external validation should be encouraged to assess the validity in different cohorts. At this point, volume reassessment and liver function testing after volume modulation therapies still represent the standard before proceeding to the second-stage procedure. Given the easy assessment by means of blood tests and the relevance of potential PHLF after major hepatic resections, new markers are urgently needed.

### Assessment of liver function before major hepatectomy [^116U1B7o]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessment of liver function

Indocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent dye that is exclusively cleared by the liver. After injection, the calculation of its plasma disappearance rate can be used to assess total liver function. Especially in Asia, this is a commonly used test in conjunction with liver volume to estimate the risk of liver failure. Another test for liver function is the methacetin breath test (LiMAx ®, Humedics GmbH, Berlin, Germany), which also assesses total liver function. This test measures the metabolic turnover of 13 C-labelled methacetin after intravenous injection. It is less commonly used compared with ICG, but can also be applied to estimate the risk of liver failure when combined with liver-volume assessment. These tests assume a homogeneous distribution of liver function throughout the liver and do not directly quantify the actual FLR function. This may lead to overestimation or underestimation of true FLR function.

Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) with 99m Tc-labelled mebrofenin (99m Tc-mebrofenin) or galactosyl human serum albumin (GSA) are methods to quantify total liver function, but also allow the measurement of regional liver function. Using these techniques, any limitations due to inhomogeneous liver function distribution are eliminated. GSA is not registered in Europe and therefore 99m Tc-mebrofenin scintigraphy is the scintigraphy method of choice in Western countries.

Mebrofenin is selectively taken up by the liver and excreted in the bile. Labelling with 99m Tc allows quantification of the uptake speed by using a γ probe. With single-photon emission computed tomography the uptake in specific regions of the liver can be quantified. By combining the scan with low-dose CT that allows segmentation, the uptake speed of 99m Tc-mebrofenin in the FLR can be measured. This is used as a surrogate of FLR function. This regional quantitative measure is usually corrected for body surface area (and expressed as per cent per min per m 2).

Fontan physiology — hepatic vulnerability and monitoring: There is increasing recognition of hepatic vulnerability after Fontan palliation, including cirrhosis, with uncertainty about which patients are at highest risk or how to address problems when identified; routine assessment of liver function and structure may help inform broader decisions such as timing and risk of surgery or transplantation, and consultation with a hepatologist may be of value in interpreting and following liver abnormalities. Recognizing the multiorgan vulnerability of the Fontan circulation, annual routine blood tests may have a role in identifying and addressing problems early, and catheterization can facilitate transvenous liver biopsy for monitoring liver function including as part of a pre-transplantation assessment.

Hepatocellular carcinoma — liver function assessment and prognostic scoring includes that an important additional assessment of liver function not included in the C-P score is an evaluation of signs of clinically significant portal hypertension, with evidence potentially on CT/MRI and esophageal varices evaluated using esophagogastroduodenoscopy or contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging. Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is a numerical scale ranging from 6 (less ill) to 40 (gravely ill) for individuals ≥ 12 years derived using three laboratory values (serum bilirubin, creatinine, and INR), and it has been adopted by the United Network for Organ Sharing to stratify liver transplantation waiting-list patients according to their risk of death within 3 months; it is currently unclear whether MELD is superior to the C-P score as a predictor of survival, it has not been validated for patients with cirrhosis who are not on a liver transplantation waiting list, and serum creatinine can be an unreliable marker of renal dysfunction. Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade takes into account only serum bilirubin and albumin levels; an analysis of almost 6000 patients showed that the ALBI grade, which stratifies patients into three risk categories, performs as well as the C-P score, and patients scored as C-P grade A were categorized into either ALBI grade 1 or 2. For preoperative assessment in cirrhosis, the indocyanine green (ICG) clearance test is extensively used in Asia and Japanese evidence-based clinical guidelines for HCC recommend the ICG retention rate at 15 minutes (ICGR-15) after intravenous injection, although this test is not widely used in Western countries.

### Development and validation of diagnostic triage criteria for liver disease from a minimum data set enabling the 'intelligent LFT' pathway for the automated assessment of deranged liver enzymes [^115HQMEL]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Liver function tests (LFTs) are commonly abnormal; most patients with 'incidental' abnormal LFTs are not investigated appropriately and for those who are, current care pathways are geared to find an explanation for the abnormality by a lengthy process of investigation and exclusion, with costs to the patient and to the health service.

Objective

To validate an intelligent automatable analysis tool (iLFT) for abnormal liver enzymes, which diagnoses common liver conditions, provides fibrosis stage and recommends management.

Design

A retrospective case note review from three tertiary referral liver centres, with application of the iLFT algorithm and comparison with the clinician's final opinion as gold standard.

Results

The iLFT algorithm in 91.3% of cases would have correctly recommended referral or management in primary care. In the majority of the rest of the cases, iLFT failed safe and recommended referral even when the final clinical diagnosis could have been managed in primary care. Diagnostic accuracy was achieved in 82.4% of cases, consistent with the fail-safe design of the algorithm. Two cases would have remained in primary care as per the algorithm outcome, however on clinical review had features of advanced fibrosis.

Conclusion

iLFT analysis of abnormal liver enzymes offers a safe and robust method of risk stratifying patients to the most appropriate care pathway as well as providing reliable diagnostic information based on a single blood draw, without repeated contacts with health services. Offers the possibility of high quality investigation and diagnosis to all patients rather than a tiny minority.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115PkWRv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Introduction

Accurate estimation of liver function is essential for assessing disease severity, monitoring progression, and predicting the prognosis of chronic liver disease. It also facilitates optimal surgical planning to minimize the risk of liver failure, a major cause of mortality and morbidity after hepatectomy. The liver functional assessment is crucial not only in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), most of whom have underlying cirrhosis, but also in patients with hepatic metastases due to the rising prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and neoadjuvant chemotherapy-induced liver damage. While biochemical parameters and clinical scoring systems such as the Child–Pugh score are commonly used as static liver functional makers, these methods may have limited predictive value in predicting the risk of hepatic decompensation and patient prognosis.

The indocyanine green (ICG) retention after 15-min (ICG-R15) is a well-established dynamic quantitative test for estimating liver function and determining the safe extent of hepatectomy. The utility of the ICG test has been validated and recognized in European countries, with the recently developed European guidelines recommending it prior to hepatectomy as a next-step test following static biochemical function assessments. It also has the potential to predict the severity of portal hypertension, the prognosis of cirrhosis, and clinical outcomes following therapeutic interventions other than hepatectomy. Specifically, an ICG-R15 ≥ 20% indicates severe liver dysfunction which is considered a contraindication for major hepatectomy. Although the ICG test is used as one of the reference standards for liver function, it is relatively time-consuming and lacks imaging guidance and morphological information. In contrast, technetium-99m diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid galactosyl human serum albumin (99m Tc-GSA) scintigraphy is an imaging-based liver function test. 99m Tc-GSA binds exclusively to the asialoglycoprotein receptor on hepatocytes without being taken up by other organs. Given that decreased receptor expression is indicative of liver damage, 99m Tc-GSA scintigraphy provides a direct evaluation of regional hepatocyte function. Consequently, its use is recommended for patients with a limited future liver remnant, underlying liver disease, or when volume modulation strategies are implemented before major hepatectomy. However, there are drawbacks such as limited availability, particularly in Western countries, high cost, technical complexity, and increased radiation exposure, which may limit its broad clinical applicability and frequent use in screening.

Liver blood tests

Liver blood tests, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), are frequently tested as part of routine clinical investigation in primary care. Whilst unexplained persistently abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated, normal liver blood tests do not exclude NAFLD or significant fibrosis. In a study of 223 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, ALT more than two times the upper limit of normal (> 70 IU/L) had a sensitivity of just 50% and specificity of 61% for NASH, and sensitivity 40% and specificity 58% for advanced fibrosis. Moreover, the serum ALT level typically falls as liver fibrosis progresses and patients with cirrhosis frequently have a normal range ALT level. Therefore, do not rely on abnormal liver blood tests to prompt consideration of liver disease. However, persistently unexplained abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated. (Recommendation 3, Table 1)

Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be evaluated in line with national recommendations, with a focussed history eliciting risk factors for chronic liver disease including unhealthy alcohol consumption, the presence of metabolic risk factors and a detailed drug history. Automated systems, such as intelligent liver function tests (iLFT), can streamline the investigation of abnormal liver blood tests giving a full panel of results, suggested diagnosis and advice for further management. This approach increases the diagnosis of liver disease and is highly cost effective.
