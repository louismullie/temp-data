## Question

Would you choose once-weekly exenatide specifically to reduce major cardiovascular events in a patient with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, based on EXSCEL?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether once-weekly exenatide should be chosen specifically to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in a patient with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, based on the EXSCEL trial. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the EXSCEL trial design and whether it answers the superiority question. Then, I should verify the primary and secondary outcomes and their statistical interpretation. Next, I will review subgroup analyses and sensitivity checks that might change the conclusion. After that, I need to place EXSCEL in the context of other GLP-1 RA cardiovascular outcome trials and meta-analyses. Finally, I should align the conclusion with current guideline recommendations and outline practical, evidence-based alternatives for MACE reduction in this patient population.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and objectives, because I need to ensure we are interpreting the right endpoints. EXSCEL was a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pragmatic cardiovascular outcomes trial in 14,752 patients with type 2 diabetes, with or without established cardiovascular disease, testing once-weekly exenatide 2 mg versus placebo for a median 3.2 years, with co-primary hypotheses of noninferiority for safety and superiority for efficacy on the 3-point MACE composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke [^42786d73] [^6dc528a5].

> Now, I should verify the primary outcome results and their statistical interpretation. The hazard ratio for MACE was 0.91 with a 95% CI of 0.83 to 1.00, meeting noninferiority for safety but failing to meet superiority for efficacy, with a P value of 0.06 for superiority, which is not statistically significant at the prespecified alpha level [^42786d73] [^dd3c58fa]. Wait, let me verify the absolute event rates to ensure I'm not overstating this. Event rates were 11.4% with exenatide versus 12.2% with placebo, corresponding to 3.7 versus 4.0 events per 100 person-years, respectively, reinforcing that the relative risk reduction was modest and not statistically significant for MACE [^42786d73] [^9b8b7dac].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mortality without checking the hierarchical testing sequence. The all-cause mortality reduction of 14% with nominal P = 0.016 was a secondary outcome tested only after superiority on MACE, which was not achieved; thus, this mortality signal is exploratory and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive, and I should be cautious not to overinterpret it clinically [^42786d73] [^2f65da07].

> Next, I should review subgroup analyses to see if there is any signal of differential benefit in established CVD. Let me consider the risk-stratified analyses: treatment effects on MACE and all-cause mortality were consistent across quintiles of baseline cardiovascular risk, with no significant interaction, which means there is no evidence that higher-risk patients benefited more in a statistically meaningful way in EXSCEL [^298e6a9a] [^499624f4]. I should double-check heart failure and ejection fraction subgroups as well; benefits on all-cause death were attenuated in patients with baseline heart failure, and heart failure outcomes varied by LVEF, again arguing against a uniform cardiovascular benefit signal in complex CVD phenotypes [^bf9b9be0] [^1c48dc6c].

> I will now examine potential confounders that could blunt a true effect, because I need to ensure the negative result is not just a methodological artifact. The pragmatic design allowed open-label addition of glucose-lowering therapies, with more drop-in of cardioprotective agents in the placebo arm, which could dilute the observed effect; sensitivity analyses using inverse probability weighting suggested a larger, nominally significant MACE effect, but this remains a post hoc adjustment and cannot convert a negative superiority test into a positive one [^3ec997f9]. But wait, what if the modest effect is real yet still not sufficient to claim superiority? Mediation analyses suggest that changes in conventional risk factors explain only a small portion of the observed differences, implying potential non–risk-factor mediated effects, yet even then the primary superiority endpoint was not met [^179521fb] [^3b0ff13e].

> Next, I should review the broader GLP-1 RA evidence base to contextualize EXSCEL. Meta-analyses of GLP-1 RA cardiovascular outcome trials show a class reduction in MACE of about 12–14% and reductions in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, but EXSCEL itself did not demonstrate statistically significant MACE reduction, whereas LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, HARMONY, and REWIND did, indicating heterogeneity of effects across agents and trials [^a6c5ade9] [^bed407d5] [^521aeefb]. Hold on, I should verify regulatory implications: the FDA has granted cardiovascular risk reduction labeling to liraglutide, semaglutide, and dulaglutide, but not to exenatide, reflecting the neutral MACE result in EXSCEL and the lack of proven superiority in that trial [^54bf94af] [^6dd365aa].

> I need to ensure my conclusion aligns with guidelines. Contemporary expert consensus pathways explicitly recommend GLP-1 RAs with proven cardiovascular benefit, such as liraglutide, semaglutide, and dulaglutide, for patients with type 2 diabetes and established ASCVD, while noting that exenatide showed a numerically favorable but not statistically significant MACE reduction and is not a preferred agent for this indication [^6dd365aa] [^54bf94af]. Let me reconsider whether any niche remains for exenatide; even though EXSCEL demonstrated safety and a nominal mortality reduction, the absence of proven MACE benefit means it should not be selected specifically to reduce major cardiovascular events in established CVD when alternatives with proven benefit exist [^42786d73] [^6dd365aa].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Based on EXSCEL, once-weekly exenatide should not be chosen specifically to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in a patient with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, because the trial did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in MACE and current guidelines prioritize agents with proven cardiovascular benefit such as liraglutide, semaglutide, or dulaglutide for this indication [^42786d73] [^6dd365aa] [^54bf94af]. If the clinical goal is MACE reduction, I would select one of the GLP-1 RAs with proven cardiovascular benefit; if exenatide is already on board and tolerated, it can be continued for glycemic control, but I would not rely on it to lower cardiovascular event risk [^6dd365aa] [^54bf94af].

---

I would **not choose once-weekly exenatide** to reduce major cardiovascular events in a patient with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, because EXSCEL showed only a **nonsignificant 9% reduction** in MACE (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83–1.00; P = 0.06) and did not meet superiority [^42786d73]. While a **nominal 14% reduction in all-cause mortality** was observed, this was a secondary outcome and not sufficient to support exenatide for cardiovascular risk reduction [^2f65da07]. Current guidelines favor GLP-1 RAs with proven cardiovascular benefit (e.g. liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide) for patients with established CVD, so I would select one of those instead [^6dd365aa] [^54bf94af].

## EXSCEL trial design and population

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pragmatic trial.
- **Population**: 14,752 patients with T2DM, with or without prior CVD; 73.1% had established CVD [^42786d73].
- **Intervention**: Once-weekly exenatide 2 mg vs placebo, added to usual care.
- **Primary outcome**: First occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke (MACE) [^6dc528a5].

---

## Primary cardiovascular outcomes

The **MACE hazard ratio** was 0.91 (95% CI 0.83–1.00; P = 0.06), indicating a nonsignificant 9% relative risk reduction that failed to meet superiority [^42786d73]. The **annualized event rates** were 3.7 per 100 patient-years with exenatide vs 4.0 with placebo, reinforcing the lack of statistical significance [^42786d73].

---

## Secondary outcomes and subgroup analyses

- **All-cause mortality**: Nominal 14% reduction (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77–0.97; P = 0.016), but this was a secondary outcome and not part of the hierarchical testing plan [^2f65da07].
- **Heart failure**: No significant reduction in hospitalization for heart failure (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78–1.13) [^42786d73].
- **Subgroup analyses**: No significant differential effect by baseline CVD status, age, sex, or renal function, indicating consistent but nonsignificant effects across subgroups [^298e6a9a] [^499624f4].

## Comparison with other GLP-1 receptor agonists

| **Trial** | **Agent** | **Mace reduction** | **Statistical significance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| LEADER | Liraglutide | 13% | Yes |
| SUSTAIN-6 | Semaglutide | 26% | Yes |
| REWIND | Dulaglutide | 12% | Yes |
| EXSCEL | Exenatide | 9% | No |

---

These data show that **other GLP-1 RAs** achieve statistically significant MACE reductions, whereas exenatide does not [^6dd365aa] [^54bf94af].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current ACC/AHA guidance recommends GLP-1 RAs with proven cardiovascular benefit (liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide) for patients with T2DM and established CVD, and does not list exenatide among preferred agents for cardiovascular risk reduction [^6dd365aa] [^54bf94af]. This aligns with the **lack of superiority** in EXSCEL and supports choosing agents with demonstrated cardiovascular benefit [^42786d73].

---

## Safety considerations

Exenatide was **noninferior for cardiovascular safety** and did not increase pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, or medullary thyroid carcinoma in EXSCEL, supporting its cardiovascular safety profile even if it does not reduce MACE [^42786d73] [^dd3c58fa].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

I would **not choose once-weekly exenatide** to reduce major cardiovascular events in a patient with T2DM and established CVD, given the nonsignificant MACE reduction in EXSCEL [^42786d73]. Instead, I would select a GLP-1 RA with proven cardiovascular benefit (e.g. liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide) to maximize cardiovascular risk reduction [^6dd365aa] [^54bf94af].

### Rationale and design of the EXenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) trial [^6dc528a5]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Exenatide once-weekly is an extended release formulation of exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, which can improve glycemic control, body weight, blood pressure, and lipid levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The EXenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) will compare the impact of adding exenatide once-weekly to usual care with usual care alone on major cardiovascular outcomes. EXSCEL is an academically led, phase III/IV, double-blind, pragmatic placebo-controlled, global trial conducted in 35 countries aiming to enrol 14,000 patients with T2DM and a broad range of cardiovascular risk over approximately 5 years. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive exenatide once-weekly 2 mg or matching placebo by subcutaneous injections. The trial will continue until 1,360 confirmed primary composite cardiovascular end points, defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, have occurred. The primary efficacy hypothesis is that exenatide once-weekly is superior to usual care with respect to the primary composite cardiovascular end point. EXSCEL is powered to detect a 15% relative risk reduction in the exenatide once-weekly group, with 85% power and a 2-sided 5% alpha. The primary safety hypothesis is that exenatide once-weekly is noninferior to usual care with respect to the primary cardiovascular composite end point. Noninferiority will be concluded if the upper limit of the CI is < 1.30. EXSCEL will assess whether exenatide once-weekly can reduce cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM with a broad range of cardiovascular risk. It will also provide long-term safety information on exenatide once-weekly in people with T2DM. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01144338.

Introduction

The EXSCEL (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering) was an international pragmatic trial that included a broad population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) both with and without known cardiovascular disease. 1, 2, 3 In EXSCEL, once‐weekly administration of the glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonist, exenatide, resulted in a nonsignificant 9% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs; P value for superiority = 0.061) and a nominal 14% reduction in all‐cause mortality (ACM; P = 0.016) versus placebo. Whereas these effects were consistent across prespecified subgroups in univariate analyses (including previous cardiovascular event status), it is unknown whether relative magnitude of treatment effect with exenatide depends on a patient's overall baseline risk profile. Such data could help clinicians better understand how to optimize use of this therapy to improve patients' clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that patients at increased risk for ACM and MACE would experience a comparatively greater relative treatment benefit with exenatide than those at lower risk. We were specifically interested in exploring whether the relative treatment benefit would be greater in the higher‐risk group, not merely an increased absolute effect size in a group with increased disease severity and higher event rates. This hypothesis was based on potential mechanisms of benefits from GLP‐1 receptor agonists related to anti‐inflammatory and cardioprotective effects 4 (eg, weight loss, blood pressure reduction, and lipid lowering), which could be more instrumental in those at greater risk for events, and that for a given relative risk reduction the highest absolute risk reduction is usually observed in those at highest baseline risk. Thus, we developed risk scores for clinical end points in EXSCEL based on baseline characteristics and evaluated whether there was a differential treatment effect with exenatide based on a patient's baseline risk.

Background

The cardiovascular effects of adding once-weekly treatment with exenatide to usual care in patients with type 2 diabetes are unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes, with or without previous cardiovascular disease, to receive subcutaneous injections of extended-release exenatide at a dose of 2 mg or matching placebo once weekly. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. The coprimary hypotheses were that exenatide, administered once weekly, would be noninferior to placebo with respect to safety and superior to placebo with respect to efficacy.

Results

In all, 14,752 patients (of whom 10,782 [73.1%] had previous cardiovascular disease) were followed for a median of 3.2 years (interquartile range, 2.2 to 4.4). A primary composite outcome event occurred in 839 of 7356 patients (11.4%; 3.7 events per 100 person-years) in the exenatide group and in 905 of 7396 patients (12.2%; 4.0 events per 100 person-years) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 1.00), with the intention-to-treat analysis indicating that exenatide, administered once weekly, was noninferior to placebo with respect to safety (P < 0.001 for noninferiority) but was not superior to placebo with respect to efficacy (P = 0.06 for superiority). The rates of death from cardiovascular causes, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, and hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, and the incidence of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

Among patients with type 2 diabetes with or without previous cardiovascular disease, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events did not differ significantly between patients who received exenatide and those who received placebo.

Background In the EXSCEL (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering), exenatide once-weekly resulted in a nonsignificant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and a nominal 14% reduction in all-cause mortality in 14 752 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2 DM) with and without cardiovascular disease. Whether patients at increased risk for events experienced a comparatively greater treatment benefit with exenatide is unknown. Methods and Results In the EXSCEL population, we created risk scores for MACEs and all-cause mortality using step-wise selection of baseline characteristics. A risk score was calculated for each patient, and a time-to-event model for each end point was developed including the risk score, treatment assignment, and risk-treatment interaction. Interaction P values evaluating for a differential treatment effect by baseline risk were reported. Over a median follow-up of 3.2 years (interquartile range, 2.2, 4.4), 1091 (7.4%) patients died and 1744 (11.8%) experienced a MACE. Independent predictors of MACEs and all-cause mortality included age, sex, comorbidities (eg, previous cardiovascular event), body mass index, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. The all-cause mortality and MACE risk models had modest discrimination with optimism-corrected c-indices of 0.73 and 0.71, respectively. No interaction was observed between treatment effect and risk profile for either end point (both interactions, P > 0.1). Conclusions Baseline characteristics (eg, age, previous cardiovascular events) and routine laboratory values (eg, hemoglobin A1c, estimated glomerular filtration rate) provided modest prognostic value for mortality and MACEs in a broad population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Exenatide's effects on mortality and MACEs were consistent across the spectrum of baseline risk. Clinical Trial Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT 01144338.

### Effects of once-weekly exenatide on cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^9b8b7dac]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study EXSCEL was published by Holman RR and colleagues in 2017 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the EXSCEL study, the trial question was: what is the effect of once-weekly exenatide on cardiovascular outcome in patients with T2DM? In the EXSCEL study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EXSCEL study, the population was: 14752 patients (5603 female, 9149 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM, with or without previous CVD who are on medication. The key exclusion criteria were history of ≥ 2 episodes of severe hypoglycemia during the preceding 12 months, end-stage kidney disease, personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2, or a previous treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist. In the EXSCEL study, the interventions were: n = 7356 exenatide (extended-release dose of 2 mg subcutaneous injection once weekly) n = 7396 placebo (matching placebo once weekly). In the EXSCEL study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (11.4% vs. 12.2%; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 1). In the EXSCEL study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death from any cause (6.9% vs. 7.9%; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97) No significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (4.6% vs. 5.2%; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.02) No significant difference in hospitalization for HF (3% vs. 3.1%; HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.13). In the EXSCEL study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the EXSCEL study, the conclusion was: in patients with T2DM, with or without previous CVD who are on medication, exenatide was noninferior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. EXSCEL enrolled 14 752 patients at 687 sites in 35 countries between June 2010 and September 2015. Trial design, baseline characteristics, and primary results have been published. 1, 2, 3 In brief, EXSCEL investigated the effects of the once‐weekly GLP‐1 receptor agonist, exenatide (2‐mg injection), on cardiovascular‐related outcomes in T2DM. The study included patients with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 6.5% to 10% at any level of cardiovascular risk and targeted ≈70% with a previous cardiovascular event, including previous coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular events or stenosis. Patients aged < 18 years, with type 1 diabetes mellitus, ≥ 2 episodes of severe hypoglycemia in the previous 12 months, an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, or previous pancreatitis were excluded. Median (interquartile range) age of the population was 62 years (56, 68), 38% were female, and median baseline HbA1c was 8.0% (7.3, 8.9). Median follow‐up was 3.2 years (2.2, 4.4), with a median duration of drug treatment exposure of 2.4 years (1.4, 3.8) in the exenatide group and 2.3 years (1.2, 3.6) in the placebo group. The primary composite end point of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke occurred in 11.4% (839 of 7356) of the exenatide group and 12.2% (905/7396) of the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.83–1.00). Exenatide was noninferior to placebo for safety (P < 0.001 for noninferiority), but was not superior to placebo with respect to efficacy (P = 0.061 for superiority). The secondary outcome of ACM occurred in 6.9% (507 of 7356) of exenatide patients and 7.9% (584 of 7396) of placebo patients (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.77–0.97; nominal P = 0.016).

### Impact of changes in conventional risk factors induced by once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide on cardiovascular outcomes: an EXSCEL post hoc analysis [^7ad3c938]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have become established as blood glucose-lowering therapies that should be considered in people with type 2 diabetes if glycemic targets are not met with lifestyle measures and metformin, especially in those with, or at high risk of, cardiovascular (CV) disease. GLP-1 RA treatment has been shown to have beneficial effects on CV disease, mortality, and kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.

In people with type 2 diabetes, exenatide, a GLP-1 RA, reduces blood glucose levels and can lead to modest reductions in body weight, blood pressure, and lipid levels. The Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) was a randomized event-driven trial of once-weekly exenatide (EQW). The study found that after a median 3.2 years of follow-up, participants randomized to EQW had a numerically lower incidence of major adverse CV events (MACE) and a nominally significant reduction in all-cause mortality (ACM).

We sought to examine the degree to which EQW-induced changes in conventional CV risk factors might explain the observed differences in EQW and placebo event rates using model simulation and mediation analyses.

Research insights

What is currently known about this topic?

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) affect cardiovascular (CV) outcomes via multiple mechanisms. GLP-1 RA therapies have been shown to have beneficial effects on CV disease, mortality, and kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.

What is the key research question?

To what degree do the observed changes in modifiable CV risk factors induced by once-weekly use of the GLP-1 RA exenatide explain observed differences in CV event rates between the drug and placebo arms of the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL)?

What is new?

Simulation and mediation analyses of EXSCEL both suggested observed changes in conventional CV risk factors induced by once-weekly exenatide explain only a modest proportion of the observed CV outcomes.

How might this study influence clinical practice?

The results of this study could be used to adjust risk estimates derived from prediction models in people with type 2 diabetes treated with GLP-1 RAs.

Conclusion

Baseline characteristics, including age, previous cardiovascular events, comorbidity burden, and laboratory values, provided modest prognostic value for mortality and MACEs in a broad population of patients with T2DM. Effects of exenatide on mortality and MACEs were consistent across the spectrum of baseline risk.

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide on clinical outcomes according to baseline risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^712fd581]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Following the development of the risk models, we then evaluated whether there was evidence of a differential response to exenatide on clinical outcomes according to baseline risk. We did not observe an interaction between treatment and risk profile for either end point. The consistent treatment effect was clear when presented visually across quintiles of risk.

Although we did not observe differential treatment effects within this diabetic cohort, existing examples of differential treatment effects between diabetic and nondiabetic populations warrant these investigations. For instance, a meta‐analysis of beta‐blocker therapy in patients with heart failure demonstrated a smaller magnitude of effect on mortality reduction in diabetes mellitus patients versus non–diabetes mellitus patients. 11 Moreover, research has shown that the relative benefits of device‐based therapies, such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators, are attenuated with increasing comorbidity burden such as diabetes mellitus. 12 Practically, these observations may be related to increased severity of disease and medical complexity that may be less modifiable with specific therapies. On the other hand, even with the potential attenuation of relative risk reduction in patients with T2DM, given that these patients are overall at higher risk for adverse events, the absolute reduction in clinical events may still be substantial.

Clinical Implications

Our findings showed consistent treatment effects of exenatide across the spectrum of cardiovascular risk and might help inform practicing clinicians in their decision‐making process. We have recently performed a meta‐analysis of the GLP‐1 receptor agonist class that supports consistent treatment effects of the different agents in this class (eg, liraglutide, semaglutide, and exenatide) in reducing MACE and mortality. 13 Although there were differences in study patient populations and trial designs, 2 the overall consistent effect of these agents in the context of a favorable safety profile supports shared decision making between the patient and physician to optimize choice of T2DM therapy. For instance, with data supporting consistent relative reductions in MACE, mortality, and cardiovascular death of ≈10% to 13% with GLP‐1 receptor agonists, exenatide may be an appropriate choice for some patients based on tolerability, cost, and dosing schedule (ie, weekly with exenatide versus daily with liraglutide). The present data support discussions with patients across the spectrum of baseline risk regarding the potential benefits of exenatide.

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without heart failure and heart failure-related outcomes: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^bf9b9be0]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Once-weekly exenatide (EQW) had a neutral effect on hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) in the EXSCEL study (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering), with no differential treatment effect on major adverse cardiac events by baseline heart failure (HF) status. EQW's effects on secondary end points based on HHF status have not been reported. The objective was to explore the effects of EQW on secondary end points in patients with and without baseline HF and test the effects of EQW on recurrent HHF events.

Methods

The prespecified analysis of the randomized controlled EXSCEL trial, which enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without additional cardiovascular disease, analyzed EQW effects on all-cause death, each major adverse cardiac event component, first HHF, and repeat HHF, by baseline HF status (regardless of ejection fraction). A subgroup analysis of the population stratified by preserved or reduced baseline ejection fraction was performed.

Results

Of 14752 EXSCEL participants, 2389 (16.2%) had HF at baseline. Compared with those without HF at baseline, patients with preexisting HF were older, and more likely to be male and white, with a higher burden of other cardiovascular diseases. Overall, those assigned to EQW had a lower incidence of all-cause death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.77–0.97]) and the composite outcome of all-cause death or HHF (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.80–0.99]). When stratified by presence or absence of baseline HF, there was no observed reduction in all-cause death with EQW with baseline HF (HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.85–1.29]), while the risk of mortality was reduced with EQW in the no-HF group (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.68–0.92]) with an interaction P value of 0.031. The reduction in all-cause death or HHF seen with EQW in patients without baseline HF (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.71–0.93]) was not seen in patients with baseline HF (HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.89–1.29]; interaction P = 0.015). First, plus recurrent, HHF was reduced in the exenatide group versus placebo (HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.68–0.99]; P = 0.038).

Conclusions

In EXSCEL, the use of EQW in patients with or without HF was well tolerated, but benefits of EQW on reduction in all-cause death and first hospitalization for HF were attenuated in patients with baseline HF.

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide on clinical outcomes according to baseline risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^a5b9c425]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Using the parameters of the predictive model, we created a hazard risk score for each patient. A new time‐to‐event model for each end point was developed including calculated risk score, treatment assignment, and their interaction. We report the P values of the interaction term. The adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for treatment as a function of the risk score are presented. For the analysis, a continuous risk score was assigned to each patient. For presentation purposes, we organized the relationships by quintiles to visually demonstrate the relationships between risk scores and events.

### Impact of changes in conventional risk factors induced by once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide on cardiovascular outcomes: an EXSCEL post hoc analysis [^58cd95c8]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our simulation showed that the EXSCEL trial results can in part be attributed to EQW-induced changes in conventional CV risk factors. The observed greater benefits in outcomes may reflect more pleiotropic GLP-1 RA mechanisms, and to factors not measured in the EXSCEL study. The differences seen in the simulated and observed event rates in this study could be used to adjust risk estimates derived from prediction models, such as UKPDS-OM2, in people with type 2 diabetes treated with GLP-1 RAs.

### Baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the exenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) [^c091ad7f]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

EXSCEL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examining the effect of exenatide once-weekly (EQW) versus placebo on time to the primary composite outcome (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and a wide range of cardiovascular (CV) risk.

Methods

Patients were enrolled at 688 sites in 35 countries. We describe their baseline characteristics according to prior CV event status and compare patients with those enrolled in prior glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) outcomes trials.

Results

Of a total of 14,752 participants randomized between June 2010 and September 2015, 6,788 (46.0%) patients were enrolled in Europe; 3,708 (25.1%), North America; 2,727 (18.5%), Latin America; and 1,529 (10.4%), Asia Pacific. Overall, 73% had at least one prior CV event (70% coronary artery disease, 24% peripheral arterial disease, 22% cerebrovascular disease). The median (IQR) age was 63 years (56, 69), 38% were female, median baseline HbA1c was 8.0% (7.3, 8.9) and 16% had a prior history of heart failure. Those without a prior CV event were younger with a shorter duration of diabetes and better renal function than those with at least one prior CV event. Compared with prior GLP-1RA trials, EXSCEL has a larger percentage of patients without a prior CV event and a notable percentage who were taking a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor at baseline (15%).

Conclusions

EXSCEL is one of the largest global GLP-1RA trials, evaluating the safety and efficacy of EQW with a broad patient population that may extend generalizability compared to prior GLP-1RA trials (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01144338).

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide on hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome or coronary revascularization in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^be324798]. American Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular (CV) outcome studies of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have shifted the paradigm of type 2 diabetes management given their benefits regarding a reduction in major adverse CV events. However, the relationship between GLP-1 RAs and coronary revascularization remains poorly understood. In this EXSCEL post-hoc analysis, we used univariate Cox proportional models and Kaplan Meier survival analysis to evaluate the effect of once-weekly exenatide (EQW) on a composite outcome of hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or coronary revascularization. Similar models were utilized to evaluate the relationship between significant participant characteristics within the entire study population and the composite outcome. Of the 14,736 participants in EXSCEL with complete follow-up data, 1642 (11.1%) experienced an ACS or coronary revascularization event during a median follow-up of 3.3 years (interquartile range, 2.3–4.4). EQW had no effect on hospitalization for ACS or coronary revascularization (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91–1.10). Among EXSCEL participants, enrollment in Latin America (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43–0.60) and a history of peripheral artery disease (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70–0.90) were associated with a reduced risk for coronary revascularization, whereas enrollment in North America (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.74–2.12), a history of CV disease (HR 3.24, 95% CI 2.78–3.78), and a previous myocardial infarction (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.39–1.71) were associated with increased risk for study end points. EQW had no association with hospitalization for ACS or coronary revascularization. Participant enrollment location and CV disease burden may play a role in the variable CV efficacy of GLP-1 RAs that has been observed in trials thus far.

### Changes in heart rate associated with exenatide once weekly: pooled analysis of clinical data in patients with type 2 diabetes [^f300c3be]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Results from the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL; NCT01144338), a placebo-controlled phase 4 trial examining exenatide QW for effects on cardiovascular outcomes in 14,752 patients with T2DM, of whom more than 70% had prior cardiovascular disease, showed no increase in cardiovascular events compared to placebo. Assessment of the primary outcome of this study, the time to the first confirmed cardiovascular event in the primary composite cardiovascular end point (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke), over a median follow-up of 3.2 years indicated that exenatide QW was noninferior to placebo for safety (P < 0.001) but not superior to placebo for efficacy (P = 0.06). An LS mean increase in heart rate of + 2.51 bpm was observed with exenatide QW versus placebo during the study period (P < 0.001).

A meta-analysis of the LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, ELIXA, and EXSCEL trials found that GLP-1RAs significantly reduced the risk of the composite end point of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke (P = 0.033), in addition to reducing cardiovascular mortality (P < 0.007) and all-cause mortality (P < 0.002). The effect of GLP-1RA therapy on cardiovascular outcomes will also be assessed in the Researching Cardiovascular Events With a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND) trial (NCT01394952), which will compare the time to the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke with dulaglutide versus placebo over an average follow-up of approximately 6.5 years. Results from this study are expected in 2018.

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide on clinical outcomes according to baseline risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^02e273b1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this large trial of patients with T2DM and a broad range of cardiovascular risk, we found that routinely available baseline characteristics, including demographics, smoking history, previous cardiovascular events, noncardiovascular comorbidities, and common laboratory values, provided modest prognostic value for ACM and MACE. In contrast to our hypothesis that patients at increased risk for clinical events would experience a comparatively greater treatment benefit with exenatide than those at lower risk, we found that the proportional effects of exenatide on ACM and MACE were consistent across the spectrum of baseline risk.

Given the nominal 14% reduction in ACM observed with exenatide, we were particularly interested in exploring whether higher‐risk patients benefited to a greater extent with this therapy. Our first step was to develop a risk model for mortality to better understand which patient characteristics were associated with increased mortality. Relatively few risk models for mortality have been developed for patients with T2DM, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 so we developed a new model within our study population. The candidate variable list was based on these previous studies, but also included additional comorbidity data.

Table S4 compares the EXSCEL mortality model with previous T2DM mortality models. In brief, aside from the single‐center model developed at the Cleveland Clinic (N = 33 067), 8 our model is based on the largest number of patients (> 14 700) to date. Moreover, the EXSCEL population included greater geographical representation compared with previous models that were developed exclusively in Italy, 6 Hong Kong, 7 the United Kingdom, 10 or the United States. 9 In addition, previous models also included medication data that are not intrinsic patient‐level variables. Nonetheless, the majority of the independent predictors identified by the EXSCEL model are supported by previous work. For instance, age and sex were independent predictors in most of the other models as were cardiovascular comorbidities (eg, heart failure). Clinical parameters, including body mass index as well as HbA1c and estimated glomerular filtration rate, have also been previously observed to be independent predictors of outcomes. If validated in future work, the EXSCEL model may provide clinicians with a useful tool for prognostication given that all of the variables are commonly available in routine practice. We did not perform additional internal validation of the model (ie, develop the model in half the cohort and validate in the other half), given that our primary intent was to explore the treatment effect across risk in the cohort rather than risk model development.

### Effect of race on cardiometabolic responses to once-weekly exenatide: insights from the exenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) [^59d2964d]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have become established as blood glucose-lowering therapies that should be considered in people with type 2 diabetes if glycemic targets are not met with lifestyle measures and metformin, especially in those with, or at high risk of, cardiovascular disease (CVD). There is some evidence, based on an initial meta-analysis of three Phase IV cardiovascular outcome trials, and further supported by a more recent narrative review and an expanded meta-analysis of seven trials, that Asians with type 2 diabetes may have fewer major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death) when treated with GLP-1 RAs than other racial groups. It has been proposed that one of the possible underlying mechanisms for this difference could be a greater improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors resulting from GLP-1 RA therapy in Asian participants.

There is, however, inconsistent support for this hypothesis. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that, although there is no evidence of race-specific differences in the pharmacokinetic properties of GLP-1 RAs, the hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) reduction in Asian-dominant studies (those with ≥ 50% Asian participants) was 0.32% (3 mmol/mol) greater than in non-Asian-dominant studies. Subsequent analyses of pooled individual patient data from phase 3 studies have suggested that twice-daily exenatide has greater glycemic efficacy in Asians with type 2 diabetes than other races, but that there is no such racial difference in the case of once-weekly exenatide (EQW). Race-specific responses of other CVD risk factors, including blood pressure and serum lipids, to exenatide therapy were also assessed in three of these studies, but no formal statistical comparisons were performed.

Since available data relating to the glycemic and nonglycemic CVD risk factor response to GLP-1 RA therapy have come largely from people with type 2 diabetes without CVD or at low CVD risk who have participated in Phase III studies, we examined EQW-related changes in cardiometabolic risk factors in participants in the large-scale Phase IV Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL), with particular reference to those who were Asian.

2.4 EXSCEL

EXSCEL was an event‐driven trial designed to test for both non‐inferiority and superiority as co‐primary objectives for the efficacy of exenatide (2 mg once‐weekly subcutaneous injection) to placebo for the primary composite CV outcome (MACE‐3). 29 EXSCEL was unique to all other GLP‐1 RA CVOTs in that it was pragmatic in design, and did not include the strict ancillary CV risk reduction optimization included in other trials. 29 Patients with any level of CV risk were enrolled if all other inclusion criteria were met. 12 EXSCEL was also unique to LEADER and SUSTAIN‐6 in that it was designed so that ~70% of enrolled patients had established CVD, whereas LEADER and SUSTAIN‐6 did not approximate the proportion of patients with established CVD in their study design. 12 EXCEL also differed in its definition of CV disease, which included coronary artery disease (CAD; history of MI, coronary revascularization or coronary angiography showing ≥ 1 stenosis of ≥ 50% in a major epicardial artery or branch vessel); ischaemic cerebrovascular disease (history of ischaemic stroke or history of carotid artery disease as documented by ≥ 50% stenosis [with or without symptoms of neuro deficit]); or atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease (PAD; documented by objective evidence such as amputation because of vascular disease, symptoms of intermittent claudication confirmed by an ankle‐brachial pressure index or toe‐brachial pressure index of < 0.9, or a history of percutaneous revascularization). 12

Sample size calculations were performed consistent with the superiority hypothesis. 12 EXSCEL was designed to have 85% power to detect a risk of a primary composite outcome event that was 15% lower with exenatide compared with placebo, at a two‐sided alpha of 0.05. 12 To test the above hypothesis, 1360 composite CV events were required from a projected patient population of 14 000. 29 It was assumed that the annual composite primary CV endpoint event rate would be 3.8%, the lost‐to‐follow up rate would be 1%, treatment discontinuation would be 5% and the accrual period would span 5‐6 years. 29 The planned number of events was anticipated to provide in excess of 90% power to assess the trial's primary safety objective of non‐inferiority. The non‐inferiority margin specified in EXSCEL (upper bound of 95% CI < 1.3) was consistent with the previously published ELIXA and LEADER CVOTs.

### Effects of exenatide and open-label SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, given in parallel or sequentially, on mortality and cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^e7c1cba2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes through distinct mechanisms. However, evidence on clinical outcomes in patients treated with both GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i is lacking. We aim to provide insight into the effects of open-label SGLT2i use in parallel with or shortly after once-weekly GLP-1 RA exenatide (EQW) on cardiorenal outcomes.

Methods

In the EXSCEL cardiovascular outcomes trial EQW arm, SGLT2i drop-in occurred in 8.7% of participants. These EQW+SGLT2i users were propensity-matched to: (1) placebo-arm participants not taking SGLT2i (n = 572 per group); and to (2) EQW-arm participants not taking SGLT2i (n = 575), based on their last measured characteristics before SGLT2i initiation, and equivalent study visit in comparator groups. Time-to-first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and all-cause mortality (ACM) were compared using Cox regression analyses. eGFR slopes were quantified using mixed model repeated measurement analyses.

Results

In adjusted analyses, the risk for MACE with combination EQW+SGLT2i use was numerically lower compared with both placebo (adjusted hazard ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.39–1.17) and EQW alone (0.85, 0.48–1.49). Risk of ACM was nominally significantly reduced compared with placebo (0.38, 0.16–0.90) and compared with EQW (0.41, 0.17–0.95). Combination EQW+SGLT2i use also nominally significantly improved estimated eGFR slope compared with placebo (+1.94, 95% CI 0.94–2.94 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year) and EQW alone (+2.38, 1.40–3.35 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year).

Conclusions

This post hoc analysis supports the hypothesis that combinatorial EQW and SGLT2i therapy may provide benefit on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov, Identifying number: NCT01144338, Date of registration: June 15, 2010.

### Exploring the possible impact of unbalanced open-label drop-in of glucose-lowering medications on EXSCEL outcomes [^3ec997f9]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

EXSCEL (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering) assessed the impact of once-weekly exenatide 2 mg versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, while aiming for glycemic equipoise. Consequently, greater drop-in of open-label glucose-lowering medications occurred in the placebo group. Accordingly, we explored the potential effects of their unbalanced use on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke, and all-cause mortality (ACM), given that some of these agents are cardioprotective.

Methods

Cox hazard models were performed by randomized treatment for drug classes where > 5% open-label drop-in glucose-lowering medication occurred, and for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs; 3.0%) using three methodologies: drop-in visit right censoring, inverse probability for treatment weighting (IPTW), and applying drug class risk reductions.

Results

Baseline glucose-lowering medications for the 14 752 EXSCEL participants (73.1% with previous cardiovascular disease) did not differ between treatment groups. During median 3.2 years follow-up, open-label drop-in occurred in 33.4% of participants, more frequently with placebo than exenatide (38.1% versus 28.8%), with metformin (6.1% versus 4.9%), sulfonylurea (8.7% versus 6.9%), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (10.6% versus 7.5%), SGLT-2i (10.3% versus 8.1%), GLP-1 RA (3.4% versus 2.4%), and insulin (13.8% versus 9.4%). The MACE effect size was not altered meaningfully by right censoring, but the favorable HR for exenatide became nominally significant in the sulfonylurea and any glucose-lowering medication groups, while the ACM HR and p-values were essentially unchanged. IPTW decreased the MACE HR from 0.91 (P = 0.061) to 0.85 (P = 0.008) and the ACM HR from 0.86 (P = 0.016) to 0.81 (P = 0.012). Application of literature-derived risk reductions showed no meaningful changes in MACE or ACM HRs or P values, although simulations of substantially greater use of drop-in cardioprotective glucose-lowering agents demonstrated blunting of signal detection.

Conclusions

EXSCEL-observed HRs for MACE and ACM remained robust after right censoring or application of literature-derived risk reductions, but the exenatide versus placebo MACE effect size and statistical significance were increased by IPTW. Effects of open-label drop-in cardioprotective medications need to be considered carefully when designing, conducting, and analyzing cardiovascular outcome trials of glucose-lowering agents under the premise of glycemic equipoise.

### Effect of race on cardiometabolic responses to once-weekly exenatide: insights from the exenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) [^fe735cf8]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Study participants and design

EXSCEL was a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome trial that randomized 14,752 patients with type 2 diabetes, with or without previous cardiovascular disease, to the addition of EQW or placebo to usual care. It showed that EQW was noninferior to placebo when added to usual care for type 2 diabetes with respect to the primary 3-point MACE composite endpoint. Adults aged ≥ 18 years with type 2 diabetes were eligible if their usual care HbA 1c was 6.5–10.0% (48 to 86 mmol/mol) inclusive. The EXSCEL protocol specified that ~ 70% of enrolled patients should have previous cardiovascular disease. The trial was run jointly by the Duke Clinical Research Institute and the University of Oxford Diabetes Trials Unit in an academically independent collaboration with the sponsor, Amylin Pharmaceuticals (a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca).

Participants could be enrolled if treated with a maximum of three oral blood glucose-lowering drugs, or insulin alone or in combination with up to two oral blood glucose-lowering drugs. As part of baseline assessment, participants were asked to self-identify their racial background as Indian (American) or Alaska Native, Asian, Black, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, Hispanic, or Other.

EXSCEL participants were allocated at random in a 1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous EQW (Bydureon) 2 mg or matching placebo. Other diabetes therapy (addition or substitution of any blood glucose-lowering therapies, including insulin, but excluding GLP-1 RAs) was adjusted by usual care providers according to local management guidelines. Usual care providers were asked to avoid such changes soon after randomization while HbA 1c levels were reflecting the initial effect of allocated study medication. Treatment of non-glycemic cardiovascular risk factors was also left to usual care providers with no post-randomization limitations.

In this post hoc analysis, we aimed to determine whether patients who self-identified as Asian had greater initial reductions in HbA 1c and blood pressure, pulse rate, and/or improvements in serum lipid profiles, compared with other racial groups in EXSCEL. CVD risk factors were first reassessed 6 months after baseline when the mean HbA 1c difference between the active and placebo groups was maximal because of the initial requirement to keep non-trial blood glucose-lowering therapies stable during this period. This was also the case for other CVD risk factors, reflecting the small number of participants in whom adjustments in cardiovascular therapy were made during this period.

### The effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists on cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes [^e27a3752]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Finally, the EXSCEL study tested the effects of 2 mg exenatide, another GLP‐1 agonist, administered once weekly against placebo on the incidence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke in 14 752 patients followed for a median period of 3.2 years. 49 73% of enrolled patients had previous cardiovascular disease, and baseline glycated hemoglobin level was 8.0%. 49 Mean glycated hemoglobin level was 0.7 percentage points lower in the exenatide group at 6 months when compared to the placebo group (P < 0.001), though this difference did narrow over time. 49 The observed event rates for the primary outcome were 3.7 events/100 person‐years for the exenatide group, compared to 4.0 events/100 person‐years in the placebo group (P = 0.06). 49 There was not a significant difference in the incidence rate of serious adverse events between the two groups. 49 Even though overall mortality was lower in the exenatide treatment group, the investigators noted that the threshold for significance was not met with this outcome according to the pre‐specified hierarchical analysis plan. 49 The mechanisms for improved CV outcomes with semaglutide and liraglutide but not with lixisenatide remain to be elucidated. At this point, it is not clear whether the improved CVOs are due to a class‐effect of GLP‐1 agonists or due to specific medication properties only, but future clinical trial will help answer this question. Previous animal studies and clinical trials suggest possible CV benefits of GLP‐1 agonists through modulation of CV risk factors including weight loss, reduction in blood pressure, improved lipid metabolism, and effects on the vascular endothelium. 50

### Impact of changes in conventional risk factors induced by once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide on cardiovascular outcomes: an EXSCEL post hoc analysis [^179521fb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to examine the degree to which conventional cardiovascular (CV) risk factor changes induced by once-weekly exenatide (EQW) might explain the placebo-controlled differences in CV outcomes observed in the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL).

Methods

We entered participant-level risk factor values over time into a validated type 2 diabetes-specific clinical outcomes model to estimate event rates, and compared simulated with observed relative risk changes in EXSCEL. We performed simulations for each participant to minimize uncertainty and to optimize confidence interval precision around risk point estimates. Six outcomes were examined: major adverse CV event (MACE), all-cause mortality (ACM), CV death, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure (hHF). We also performed a mediation analysis using Cox regression models to evaluate potential key mediators for ACM.

Results

Model simulations explained only modest proportions of the observed relative risk reductions for MACE (29%), ACM (15%), CV death (18%), and stroke (29%), but greater proportions for hHF (67%) and MI (200%). Mediation analysis suggested that baseline-to-6 or 12-month changes in HbA 1c, blood pressure, heart rate, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and weight did not mediate the EQW effect on ACM.

Conclusions

These model simulations explain only a modest proportion of the impact of observed EQW-induced changes in conventional CV risk factors on EXSCEL outcomes, apart from hHF and MI. Up to 1-year changes in conventional risk factors did not mediate the observed ACM risk reduction.

### Exenatide (BYDUREON BCise) [^30480d71]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.5 EXSCEL Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

EXSCEL was a multinational, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel group pragmatic study that evaluated cardiovascular (CV) outcomes during treatment with BYDUREON (exenatide) for extended-release injectable suspension in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and any level of CV risk when added to the current usual care (NCT01144338).

A total of 14,752 adult patients were randomized 1:1 to either BYDUREON 2 mg given subcutaneously once weekly or placebo and followed as in routine clinical practice for a median of 38.7 months with a median treatment duration of 27.8 months.

Ninety six percent of the patients in both treatment groups completed the study in accordance with the protocol, and the vital status was known at the end of the study for 98.9% and 98.8% of the patients in the BYDUREON and placebo group, respectively. The mean age at study entry was 62 years (21 to 92 years with 8.5% of the patients ≥ 75 years). Approximately 62.0% of the patients were male, 75.8% were White, 9.8% were Asian, 6.0% were Black or African American, and 20.5% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.7 kg/m2 and the mean duration of diabetes was 13.1 years. Approximately 49.3% had mild renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 60 to ≤ 89 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 21.6% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to ≤ 59 mL/min/1.73 m2).

### Follow the LEADER-liraglutide effect and action in diabetes: evaluation of cardiovascular outcome results trial [^8e854109]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Influence and Impact: Follow the LEADER

The LEADER trial, which studied the effect of liraglutide on CVO has changed much more than the clinical usage of liraglutide. Reported recently, its results place LEADER in the same league as the DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial) (NCT00360815) and UKPDS trials. These studies have contributed immeasurably to modern diabetes care, and their impact cannot be understated. The results of ongoing trials such as EXSCEL (exenatide once weekly) and REWIND (dulaglutide) will also modify the way in which we view LEADER. The EXenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) study (NCT01144338) will assess the impact of exenatide once weekly on major CV outcomes. EXSCEL is a double-blind, pragmatic placebo-controlled trial being conducted in 35 countries on 14,000 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and a broad range of CV risk over approximately 5 years. The Researching Cardiovascular Events With a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND) trial (NCT01394952), being carried out in 9600 participants over nearly 7 years, evaluates whether dulaglutide, administered by a once-weekly injection, can prevent the appearance of CV complications in people with type 2 diabetes. Both EXSCEL and REWIND results will be eagerly awaited, to see if the benefits obtained in LEADER are liraglutide specific or are a class effect of long-acting and intermediate-acting GLP1-RA.

Liraglutide has shown robust benefits, which extend beyond its glucose-lowering effect. Currently, it is the only glucose-lowering drug which is approved for use as an anti-obesity treatment in euglycemic persons as well. LEADER adds to this spectrum of use by encouraging its use in persons with diabetes at high risk of CV disease, and high risk of renal disease. The drug has been shown to have both macro- and micro-vascular benefits, and this allows its use as a pan-vascular preventive molecule apart from being a glucose-lowering treatment. LEADER data suggest that liraglutide can be used for secondary prevention (prevention of MI and stroke), and strongly supports its use for tertiary prevention (prevention of fatality after occurrence of MI or stroke). Long-term studies are still required to assess its utility in primary prevention, i.e. prevention of CV events and death in persons without diabetes or other lower risk populations.

### GLP-1RAs in type 2 diabetes: mechanisms that underlie cardiovascular effects and overview of cardiovascular outcome data [^6a09e3e2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

EXSCEL

Before the EXSCEL trial was completed, the exploratory results from a large uncontrolled study population of 39,275 patients suggested that patients treated with exenatide twice daily had a significantly lower rate of cardiovascular events and hospitalisations than patients treated with other glucose-lowering medications. In contrast to these preliminary findings, the results from the subsequent randomised, placebo-controlled EXSCEL trial failed to demonstrate a cardiovascular advantage. The EXSCEL trial enrolled the largest and most inclusive patient population of any cardiovascular outcome trial of the GLP-1RA class. In T2DM patients with an elevated cardiovascular risk, exenatide 2 mg weekly was compared with placebo. EXSCEL was unique in the inclusion of patients with a broad range of cardiovascular risks, including 26.9% without known cardiovascular events. Fewer cardiovascular events occurred in the exenatide group, thus showing cardiovascular safety; however, exenatide failed to show a significant cardiovascular benefit, with the overall results not significantly different from the placebo group. No significant differences were identified in severe hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer or medullary thyroid cancer between treatment and placebo.

ELIXA

The ELIXA trial included subjects randomised to receive lixisenatide (starting dose 10 mcg for 2 weeks, maximum dose 20 mcg) or placebo who were followed for a median of 25 months. The outcome of this study was the time to first MACE using a composite of 4 cardiovascular outcomes, and the study was powered to detect both non-inferiority and superiority. ELIXA was the first randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority cardiovascular outcome trial of a GLP-1RA to be reported. Only patients with previous acute coronary events were included in the trial. The results indicated similar rates of the primary composite outcome in both groups and no significant differences between the groups when components of the primary outcome were assessed independently. Moreover, there were no significant differences between the groups regarding hospitalisations for heart failure; this pattern persisted when analysed with the inclusion of hospitalisations for coronary revascularisation. Lixisenatide was not associated with an increased rate of serious adverse events or severe hypoglycaemia and exhibited a modest benefit on weight control.

### Effects of exenatide once weekly plus dapagliflozin, exenatide once weekly, or dapagliflozin, added to metformin monotherapy, on body weight, systolic blood pressure, and triglycerides in patients with type 2 diabetes in the DURATION-8 study [^50150db5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin has also been shown to improve cardiovascular risk factors in patients with increased cardiovascular risk. In a pooled analysis of 2 trials investigating initial combination therapy with dapagliflozin and metformin for 24 weeks, the proportion of patients achieving a composite endpoint of HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (< 7.0%) and SBP/diastolic blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg increased as baseline BMI increased (< 25 kg/m 2, 21%; 25 to < 30 kg/m 2, 29%; ≥ 30 kg/m 2, 48%). 10 Consistent with the results reported in this analysis, a pooled analysis of 13 studies found that patients with T2DM and systolic hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg) had a greater placebo‐subtracted decrease in SBP (−3.6 mm Hg) vs those without hypertension (−2.6 mm Hg) over 24 weeks of treatment. 11

While the present analysis focused on changes in cardiovascular risk factors with exenatide once weekly plus dapagliflozin in combination, several large‐scale randomized trials have investigated cardiovascular outcomes with GLP‐1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors separately among patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk. Liraglutide and semaglutide each demonstrated a significantly lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events vs placebo in their respective cardiovascular outcomes trials. 12, 13 Recently, the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL), which examined the cardiovascular effects of exenatide once‐weekly treatment vs usual care, found that exenatide once weekly did not increase cardiovascular risk, while also demonstrating a consistent safety profile 14; however, the recorded 9% decrease in cardiovascular events did not reach statistical significance.

Among the SGLT2 inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin have shown reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events vs placebo in their respective cardiovascular outcomes trials. 15, 16 The results of a large cardiovascular outcomes trial investigating the effects of dapagliflozin (Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events [DECLARE‐TIMI 58]) on cardiovascular events are also expected.

### Cardiovascular outcomes with exenatide in type 2 diabetes according to ejection fraction: the EXSCEL trial [^1c48dc6c]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and cardiovascular mortality in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, previous studies suggest the effects on heart failure outcomes vary according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). We aimed to evaluate the effects of exenatide on cardiovascular events according to LVEF in people with T2D.

Methods and Results

Post-hoc analysis of the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) trial evaluating the effects of once-weekly exenatide (EQW) versus placebo on cardiovascular outcomes according to baseline LVEF (< 40% or ≥ 40%). Outcomes were also evaluated according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and obesity. The main outcome was hospitalization for heart failure (HHF). A treatment-by-LVEF interaction was used. In EXSCEL (n = 14752), 4749 participants had LVEF available at baseline; 455 (10%) with LVEF < 40%, 4294 (90%) with LVEF ≥ 40%. LVEF modified the EQW effect on hHF: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95–2.43) in participants with LVEF < 40% and HR = 0.74 (95% CI = 0.55–1.01) in those with LVEF ≥ 40% (p-interaction = 0.012). No significant treatment-by-LVEF interactions (p-interaction > 0.10) were observed for MACE, cardiovascular death or all-cause mortality. The risk of HHF was also modified by baseline NYHA class (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65–1.27 for NYHA class I/II; HR 1.84, 95% CI 0.95–3.59 for NYHA class III/IV; p-interaction = 0.062), mostly driven by the LVEF < 40% subgroup. Obesity did not modify the effects of EQW on HHF.

Conclusions

The EQW effect on HHF was influenced by LVEF, with a potentially decreased risk in participants with LVEF ≥ 40% and increased risk in those with LVEF < 40%. The risk of HHF was particularly high in participants with LVEF < 40% and NYHA class III/IV. LVEF did not modify the effect of EQW on atherosclerotic outcomes.

### Sex differences in the complications, care and clinical outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes in the exenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) [^3aed838d]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To examine sex differences in the characteristics and outcomes in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D), with or without cardiovascular disease (CVD), randomized to once-weekly exenatide (EQW) or placebo in the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL).

Materials and Methods

Baseline characteristics were summarized and compared by sex. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for clinical outcomes, including the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (MACE3). Models including sex-by-treatment interaction were used to evaluate differences in effects of EQW.

Results

Overall, 5603 women and 9149 men were followed for a median of 3.2years. Women were younger (mean 61.4 vs. 62.2years, P < .001) and had a shorter duration of diabetes (mean 12.9 vs. 13.2years, P = 0.039) and less coronary artery disease (35.2% vs. 61.0%, P < .001) than men, but also a less favourable metabolic risk profile and lower use of cardioprotective medications. MACE3 occurred in 9.1% of women and 13.5% of men, corresponding to 2.82 versus 4.40 events/100 participant-years (adjusted hazard ratio 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70–0.93, P = 0.003). There was no difference in MACE3 with EQW compared with placebo, or evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect by sex.

Conclusions

This analysis of a large population of individuals with T2D, with or without established CVD, identified between-sex differences in clinical characteristics and care. Despite having worse management of CV risk factors, women had significantly lower rates of important CV events not attributable to the effects of study treatment.

### GLP-1RAs in type 2 diabetes: mechanisms that underlie cardiovascular effects and overview of cardiovascular outcome data [^64474278]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Heterogeneity and impact of cardiovascular safety studies

In 2008, the FDA published diabetes guidelines for the pharmaceutical industry, thus setting new expectations for the development of drugs for T2DM. Due to safety concerns, the guidance mandates that all new antidiabetic drugs rule out excess cardiovascular risk in long-term cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs). The requirements for CVOTs include, among others, selection of patients from high-risk populations, including individuals with established cardiovascular disease, multiple risk factors and renal impairment. Trials must include at least 2 years of cardiovascular safety data.

Since 2008, the results of five large-scale randomized trials that assessed major cardiovascular outcomes have been reported with a number of GLP-1RAs: exenatide (EXSCEL: EXenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering), lixisenatide (ELIXA: Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome), liraglutide (LEADER), semaglutide (SUSTAIN-6: Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes) and, more recently, albiglutide (HARMONY Outcomes: Albiglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease) and dulaglutide (REWIND: Researching cardiovascular Events with a Weekly INcretin in Diabetes). These trials were powered to assess non-inferiority or adequately detect differences between the drug and placebo regarding cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM at high risk for cardiovascular events or established CVD. Thus, they fundamentally differed from most of the studies included in the pooled analyses and meta-analyses of incretins, which tended to include patients at low risk for cardiovascular events. Table 2 provides a summary of the main results.

Discussion

Assessing the CV Risk of Glucose-Lowering Therapies

One of the strengths of this meta-analysis is the use of individual participant data from each of the trials, in contrast with a typical meta-analysis in which summary statistics for individual studies are used. Another strength was the use multiple methods of analysis, some of which allowed for the inclusion of studies with zero CV event rates. The results of this meta-analysis provide a preliminary assessment of the CV risk associated with exenatide treatment across trials used for registration. Because these findings are not conclusive, a prospective, adequately-powered, adjudicated, CV outcome study (NCT01144338) of the investigational once-weekly formulation of exenatide was initiated.

Applying the FDA guidance on how to assess CV safety in the development of treatments for type 2 diabetes to this analysis, the HR point estimates were both < 1 for the Primary MACE and Secondary CV endpoints resulting from the lower observed incidence of CV events with exenatide BID compared to the control group. These results statistically excluded a 1.8-fold increase of the CV risk by exenatide and were consistent with the FDA guideline that state that the upper limit of a 2-sided 95% CI for new diabetes therapies should be < 1.8. In fact, the results suggest that exenatide treatment may improve CV outcomes, although this effect failed to reach statistical significance. Our results are consistent with those of a recent retrospective analysis of a large insurance database in which the 39,275 patients treated with exenatide twice daily were found to be significantly less likely to have a CV event than were the 381,218 patients treated with other glucose-lowering therapies (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68–0.91, P = 0.01). Although the results of the current meta-analysis suggest that there may be an association between exenatide and improved CV outcomes, data from multi-year, randomized, controlled, adequately-powered clinical trials with prospective blinded adjudication of CV events are needed to evaluate whether exenatide has cardio-protective effects.

### Updates on cardiovascular outcome trials in diabetes [^fc245f65]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2008 the Food and Drug Administration introduced a guidance for industry that requires the investigation of cardiovascular outcomes of glucose-lowering medications. Since then, an increasing number of cardiovascular outcome trials have been completed in diabetes patients with high cardiovascular risk for members of the SGLT-2 and DPP4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonist classes. The trials confirmed cardiovascular safety for all tested anti-hyperglycaemic drugs and, in addition empagliflozin, semaglutide and liraglutide could even reduce cardiovascular risk. The present review summarizes the results of the DEVOTE, CANVAS, EXSCEL and ACE trials that tested cardiovascular safety of Insulin degludec, canagliflozin, once-weekly exenatide and acarbose and were published in 2017. We provide context on these results by comparing them with earlier trials of glucose-lowering drugs and give an outlook on what to expect in coming years.

When the new time‐to‐event models for each end point were developed, including the calculated risk score, there was no evidence of an interaction between treatment and risk profile for either end point (interaction P ‐value of 0.20 for ACM and 0.79 for MACE). Figure 3 presents the treatment effect by risk score quintile for clinical end points. In terms of study drug adherence by risk profile, median duration of exposure to the trial regimen was 2.5 years (interquartile range, 1.4, 4.1) in the lowest‐risk mortality group (lowest quintile) versus 2.1 years (interquartile range, 1.0–3.2) in the highest‐risk mortality group (highest quintile). The percentage of patients on treatment at 1 year and at the end of follow‐up (Table S3) was similar across quintiles 1 to 3 and was lower in the highest‐risk quintiles (quintiles 4–5). For instance, the percentage of patients on treatment at 1 year and at the end of follow‐up was ≈80% and 60%, respectively, in quintiles 1 to 3 compared with 72% and 44% in the highest risk quintile (ie, quintile 5).

### Exenatide (BYDUREON BCise) [^dd3c58fa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary endpoint in EXSCEL was the time to first confirmed Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) from randomization. MACE was defined as occurrence of either a cardiovascular (CV)-related death, or a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or a nonfatal stroke. All-cause mortality, CV-related death, and fatal or nonfatal MI or stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, and hospitalization for heart failure were also assessed as secondary endpoints.

A Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for non-inferiority against the pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE and superiority on MACE if non-inferiority was demonstrated. Type-1 error was controlled across multiple tests using a hierarchical testing strategy.

MACE Results:

BYDUREON did not increase the risk of MACE in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.832, 1.004; P < 0.001 for non-inferiority; P = 0.06 for superiority). See results in Table 10 and Figure 2. The incidence of MACE in patients with and without established CV disease was 13.4% in the BYDUREON group versus 14.6% in the placebo group and 6.0% (BYDUREON) versus 5.9% (placebo), respectively. Five hundred and seven (507) patients (6.9%) died in the BYDUREON group versus 584 (7.9%) in the placebo group.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and peripheral artery disease: results from the EXSCEL trial [^20edc5e0]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent trials have identified anti-diabetes mellitus agents that lower major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) rates, although some increase rates of lower-extremity amputation (LEA). Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have greater incidence of diabetes mellitus and risk for LEA, prompting this investigation of clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus and PAD in the EXSCEL trial (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering).

Methods

EXSCEL evaluated the effects of once-weekly exenatide (a GLP-1 [glucagon-like peptide-1] receptor agonist) versus placebo on the rates of the primary composite MACE end point (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this post hoc analysis, we assessed the association of baseline PAD with rates of MACE, LEA, and the effects of exenatide versus placebo in patients with and without PAD.

Results

EXSCEL included 2800 patients with PAD (19% of the trial population). These individuals had higher unadjusted and adjusted rates of MACE compared with patients without PAD (13.6% versus 11.4%, respectively) as well as a higher adjusted hazard ratio (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.00–1.27]; P = 0.047). Patients with PAD had higher all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.38 [95% CI, 1.20–1.60]; P < 0.001) and more frequent LEA (adjusted hazard ratio 5.48 [95% CI, 4.16–7.22]; P < 0.001). Patients treated with exenatide or placebo had similar rates of MACE and LEA, regardless of PAD status.

Conclusions

EXSCEL participants with PAD had higher rates of all-cause mortality and LEA compared with those without PAD. There were no differences in MACE or LEA rates with exenatide versus placebo. Clinical Trial Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01144338.

### Clinical application of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in cardiovascular disease: lessons from recent clinical cardiovascular outcomes trials [^68a8b653]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Potential effects of GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors in CV outcomes trials. Based on the results from recent CV outcomes trials with GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors, in addition to some common favorable CV effects associated with both classes, different class-specific effects (GLP-1RAs: benefit for risk of atherosclerotic outcomes, SGLT2 inhibitors: benefit for risk of HF outcomes) largely contributed to the overall improvement of CV outcomes. CV cardiovascular, GLP - 1RA glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, SGLT 2 sodium-glucose cotransporter 2

We also considered differences in trial designs and results among the CV outcomes trials with GLP-1RAs (Table 1). To date, four trials have been completed, and two trials are ongoing. Among the four completed trials, two (LEADER and SUSTAIN-6) demonstrated significant risk reduction in MACE, and one (EXSCEL) demonstrated a numerically reduced risk of MACE. In SUSTAIN-6, semaglutide treatment reduced the risk of MACE by 26% in a short follow-up duration (median 2.1 years). In contrast, in the ELIXA trial (once-daily lixisenatide), neither an increase nor a decrease in MACE and the individual component CV events was observed during the follow-up duration (median 2.1 years). This may suggest the possibility that the short-acting nature of GLP-1 activation enhancement was insufficient to reduce the occurrence of CV events, beyond improved glycemic metabolism. Compared to the other trials investigating GLP-1RAs, the ELIXA trial included T2D patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS), suggesting that perhaps their CV risk was too severe to demonstrate a simple decline in CV events via short-term pharmacological intervention. Furthermore, the patients in the trial had received higher rates of statin treatment (> 90%), and their levels of HbA 1c were lower (< 8.0%) than those of patients in the other trials. Such differences in trial designs and medical history of the patient populations may be a major determinant of the discrepancy in the results, although the exact reasons are currently unclear. In the more recent EXSCEL trial (once-weekly exenatide), all-cause mortality was statistically decreased by 14%, and CV death was numerically decreased by 12%. Such outcomes were also significantly reduced by liraglutide treatment in the LEADER trial, but were not significantly reduced in the SUSTAIN-6 trial. Focusing on the differences between the two trials, the LEADER trial included a higher rate (> 80%) of patients receiving secondary prevention of CV events, while the rate was 60% in the SUSTAIN-6 trial. Interestingly, among the CV outcomes trials with SGLT2 inhibitors, the EMPA REG OUTCOME trial, in which almost all patients had a history of CV events at baseline, showed marked reduction in all-cause mortality and CV death. On the other hand, the CANVAS program, in which one-third of patients had no prior history of CV events, demonstrated no significant risk reduction in such outcomes. We therefore speculate that the reduction in risk of all-cause mortality and CV death following pharmacological intervention depends, at least in part, on history of CV events at baseline. In the EXSCEL trial, > 70% of patients had a previous history of CV events, which was higher than in the SUSTAIN-6 and CANVAS trials. Moreover, a subgroup analysis revealed that exenatide treatment was numerically better at preventing MACE in patients with a previous history of CV events relative to those without, although there was no statistically significant interaction of the treatment effect across the subgroups. A similar trend was also demonstrated in a subgroup analysis of the CANVAS trial. Finally, the treatment effect of GLP-1RAs on the hospitalization for HF was consistently neutral across the trials. Thus, these results suggest that GLP-1RAs exhibit superior preventive effects on atherosclerotic CV events and can improve CV prognosis in T2D patients with a previous history of CV events (except ACS), and that such treatment effects could become apparent by, for example, comparing the results of CV outcomes trials with another class of incretin-based agents, namely dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors.

### Review of the safety and efficacy of exenatide once weekly for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^4aef8109]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize and evaluate the available literature assessing the efficacy and safety of exenatide once weekly for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Data Sources

PubMed (1966-January 2012) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1969-January 2012) were searched using the term exenatide once weekly. Abstracts presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting in 2011 and reference citations from publications were reviewed for inclusion. Eli Lilly and Company and Amylin Pharmaceuticals were contacted for additional unpublished information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles and abstracts were evaluated for inclusion. All randomized controlled trials were included in the review.

Data Synthesis

The efficacy and safety of exenatide once weekly has been evaluated as initial monotherapy and as add-on therapy to metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes for up to 3 years. Results from 6 randomized, comparator-controlled studies in over 3000 patients indicate that treatment with exenatide once weekly results in significant glycemic improvements and weight loss. Gastrointestinal adverse effects and injection site reactions are common, but rarely lead to drug discontinuation.

Conclusions

Exenatide once weekly holds promise as a convenient, efficacious, and well-tolerated antihyperglycemic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Studies evaluating outcomes such as cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality with exenatide once weekly are lacking.

### Cardiovascular safety of exenatide BID: an integrated analysis from controlled clinical trials in participants with type 2 diabetes [^b7028c2c]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

It is important for patients that treatments for diabetes not increase cardiovascular (CV) risk. The objective of this analysis was to examine retrospectively the CV safety of exenatide BID, a GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for treating hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled with diet and exercise. Individual participant data was pooled to assess the relative risk (RR) of CV events with exenatide BID versus a pooled comparator (PC) group treated with either placebo or insulin from 12 controlled, randomized, clinical trials ranging from 12–52 weeks. Mean baseline values for HbA1c (8.33–8.38%), BMI (31.3–31.5 kg/m2), and duration of diabetes (8 y) were similar between groups. Trials included patients with histories of microvascular and/or macrovascular disease. Customized primary major adverse CV events (MACE) included stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac mortality, acute coronary syndrome, and revascularization procedures. The Primary MACE RR (0.7; 95% CI 0.38, 1.31), calculated by the Mantel-Haenszel method (stratified by study), suggested that exenatide use (vs. PC) did not increase CV risk; this result was consistent across multiple analytic methods. Because the trials were not designed to assess CV outcomes, events were identified retrospectively from a list of preferred terms by physicians blinded to treatment. Other limitations included the low number of CV events, the short duration of trials (≤ 1 y), and a single active comparator (insulin). The results of these analyses are consistent with those of a recent retrospective analysis of a large insurance database that found that patients treated with exenatide twice daily were less likely to have a CV event than were patients treated with other glucose-lowering therapies.

Concomitant use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs — evidence summary: To date, no trials have studied the CV outcome effects of concomitant use of both an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit. DURATION-8 (Phase 3 28-Week Study With 24-Week and 52-Week Extension Phases to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Exenatide Once Weekly and Dapagliflozin Versus Exenatide and Dapagliflozin Matching Placebo) demonstrated greater reductions in blood pressure and body weight in patients randomly allocated to the combination of dapagliflozin and exenatide than to either agent alone. Combination therapy with both an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1RA for glycemic management also accords with current T2D management guidelines, and in randomized, placebo-controlled trials, dulaglutide, liraglutide, and semaglutide have shown an additive glucose-lowering benefit over placebo.

EXSCEL enrolled 14,752 patients with type 2 diabetes (hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) 6.5–10.0% [48-86mmol/mol]) with or without cardiovascular disease who were randomized double-blind to EQW or placebo. Background glucose-lowering/other cardiovascular therapies were unaltered for 6months post-randomization unless clinically essential, facilitating comparison of EQW-associated effects in 14,665 evaluable participants self-identifying as White (n = 11,113), Asian (n = 1444), Black (n = 870), or Other Race (n = 1,238. Placebo-adjusted 6 month absolute changes in cardiometabolic variables were assessed using generalized linear models.

Results

Mean 6-month placebo-adjusted HbA 1c reductions were similar in the four groups (range 0.54–0.67% [5.9 to 7.3mmol/mol], P = 0.11 for race×treatment interaction), with no significant difference in Asians (reference) versus other groups after covariate adjustment (all P ≥ 0.10). Six-month placebo-adjusted mean changes in systolic (-1.8 to 0.0mmHg) and diastolic (0.2 to 1.2mmHg) blood pressure, serum LDL (- 0.06 to 0.02mmol/L) and HDL (0.00 to 0.01mmol/L) cholesterol, and serum triglycerides (-0.1 to 0.0mmol/L) were similar in the racial groups (P ≥ 0.19 for race×treatment interaction and all P ≥ 0.13 for comparisons of Asians with other races). Resting pulse rate increased more in Asians (4 beats/min) than in other groups (≤ 3 beats/min, P = 0.016 for race×treatment interaction and all P ≤ 0.050 for comparisons of Asians with other races).

Conclusions

Short-term cardiometabolic responses to EQW were similar in the main racial groups in EXSCEL, apart from a greater pulse rate increase in Asians.

### Cardiovascular safety of exenatide BID: an integrated analysis from controlled clinical trials in participants with type 2 diabetes [^7c0be035]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

It is important for patients that treatments for diabetes not increase cardiovascular (CV) risk. The objective of this analysis was to examine retrospectively the CV safety of exenatide BID, a GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for treating hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled with diet and exercise. Individual participant data was pooled to assess the relative risk (RR) of CV events with exenatide BID versus a pooled comparator (PC) group treated with either placebo or insulin from 12 controlled, randomized, clinical trials ranging from 12–52 weeks. Mean baseline values for HbA 1c (8.33–8.38%), BMI (31.3–31.5 kg/m 2), and duration of diabetes (8 y) were similar between groups. Trials included patients with histories of microvascular and/or macrovascular disease. Customized primary major adverse CV events (MACE) included stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac mortality, acute coronary syndrome, and revascularization procedures. The Primary MACE RR (0.7; 95% CI 0.38, 1.31), calculated by the Mantel-Haenszel method (stratified by study), suggested that exenatide use (vs. PC) did not increase CV risk; this result was consistent across multiple analytic methods. Because the trials were not designed to assess CV outcomes, events were identified retrospectively from a list of preferred terms by physicians blinded to treatment. Other limitations included the low number of CV events, the short duration of trials (≤ 1 y), and a single active comparator (insulin). The results of these analyses are consistent with those of a recent retrospective analysis of a large insurance database that found that patients treated with exenatide twice daily were less likely to have a CV event than were patients treated with other glucose-lowering therapies.

4 CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY

Over recent decades, morbidity and mortality have improved for patients with T2DM because of improvements in research and treatment, greater emphasis on the achievement of strict glycaemic control and improvements in other cardiometabolic risk factors.

4.1 GLP‐1 RAs

GLP‐1 RAs have a number of direct and indirect benefits. These include moderate blood pressure lowering, changes in lipid profiles, and effects on cardiac output, ischaemic conditioning, inflammatory processes and endothelial function that may decrease cardiovascular risk. Since 2008, regulatory authorities have required that the cardiovascular safety of drugs in development for T2DM be studied, and the outcomes of the resultant CVOTs have been reviewed extensively., Individual CVOT outcomes with GLP‐1 RAs have been heterogeneous, possibly reflecting differences in study designs, treatment persistence and study populations.

Fully published GLP‐1 RA CVOTs include those for albiglutide (HARMONY Outcomes trial), dulaglutide (REWIND[Researching Cardiovascular Events with a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes]), exenatide once‐weekly (EXSCEL[EXenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering]), liraglutide (LEADER[Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of cardiovascular outcome Results]), lixisenatide (ELIXA[Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome]), and semaglutide (SUSTAIN‐6[Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long‐term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes] and PIONEER 6[Trial Investigating the Safety of Oral Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes]).

### Within-trial evaluation of medical resources, costs, and quality of life among patients with type 2 diabetes participating in the exenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) [^92f05a6f]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare medical resource use, costs, and health utilities for 14,752 patients with type 2 diabetes who were randomized to once-weekly exenatide (EQW) or placebo in addition to usual diabetes care in the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL).

Research Design and Methods

Medical resource use data and responses to the EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) instrument were collected at baseline and throughout the trial. Medical resources and medications were assigned values by using U.S. Medicare payments and wholesale acquisition costs, respectively. Secondary analyses used English costs.

Results

Patients were followed for an average of 3.3 years, during which time those randomized to EQW experienced 0.41 fewer inpatient days (7.05 vs. 7.46 days; relative rate ratio 0.91; P = 0.05). Rates of outpatient medical visits were similar, as were total inpatient and outpatient costs. Mean costs for nonstudy diabetes medications over the study period were ∼$1,600 lower with EQW than with placebo (P = 0.01). Total within-study costs, excluding study medication, were lower in the EQW arm than in the placebo arm ($28,907 vs. $30,914; P ≤ 0.01). When including the estimated cost of EQW, total mean costs were significantly higher in the EQW group than in the placebo group ($42,697 vs. $30,914; P < 0.01). With English costs applied, mean total costs, including exenatide costs, were £1,670 higher in the EQW group than the placebo group (£10,874 vs. £9,204; P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in EQ-5D health utilities between arms over time.

Conclusions

Medical costs were lower in the EQW arm than the placebo arm, but total costs were significantly higher once the cost of branded exenatide was incorporated.

3.2 Risk of Bias

Quality appraisal of the included trials showed an overall low risk of bias for 16 trials and six trials were rated as having some concerns. Also, two trials showed an overall high risk of bias mainly driven from measurement of the outcome and deviation from the intended intervention and also missing outcome data. All of the included trials were at low risk of potential bias arising from randomization, allocation concealment, and selective reporting of the results. A total of four trials were assumed to have some or a high level of bias due to deviations from the intended intervention as there was a high level of nonadherence (discontinuation mainly due to adverse gastrointestinal side effects), with no sensitivity analysis limited to per‐protocol population confirming the overall results, which could have potentially affected the final results (Figure 2).

### Efficacy and tolerability of exenatide once weekly over 7 years in patients with type 2 diabetes: an open-label extension of the DURATION-1 study [^2f076870]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To investigate the glycemic efficacy, effects on cardiovascular risk factors, and safety of exenatide once weekly (QW) in patients with type 2 diabetes over 7 years in the DURATION-1 study.

Methods

Patients were initially randomized to exenatide QW 2 mg or exenatide twice daily for 30 weeks, after which they received open-label, open-ended treatment with exenatide QW 2 mg for up to 7 years. Efficacy analyses included changes from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1C) and cardiovascular risk factors.

Results

Of 295 patients in the intention-to-treat population, 122 (41%) completed 7 years of treatment. Patients in the 7-year completer population showed sustained glycemic improvements from baseline (7-year least-squares mean [LSM] change in HbA 1C, -1.53%) and significant improvements in several cardiovascular risk factors, including body weight, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Seven-year completers who received no additional glucose-lowering therapies (n = 65 [53%]) had similar improvements in HbA 1C, and numerically greater reductions in body weight (7-year LSM change, -6.46 kg vs -3.87 kg), compared with the overall cohort. There were no unexpected safety findings.

Conclusions

Treatment with exenatide QW for 7 years was associated with sustained improvements in glycemic control and several cardiovascular risk factors.

Trial Data Supporting a Reduction inRisk With the Use of‐1in People With

Because T2D is associated with an increased risk of CVD, regulators recommended in 2008 that clinical trial programs for all new T2D therapies should demonstrate that the therapy will not result in an unacceptable increase in cardiovascular risk. Following this guidance, numerous trials were conducted in people with T2D to evaluate the effect of GLP‐1 RAs on cardiovascular outcomes (Table 2)., These phase 3 clinical trials all included a large population, ranging from 3183 participants Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment (PIONEER)‐6to 14 752 participants Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering Trial (EXSCEL). The median follow‐up times ranged from 15.9 months (PIONEER‐6)to 5.4 years Researching Cardiovascular Events With a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND)(Table 2). In these trials, the GLP‐1 RAs under investigation were all shown to be noninferior to placebo for the primary composite cardiovascular end point, time to first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; which included cardiovascular death, along with other cardiovascular end points such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalization for unstable angina), confirming cardiovascular safety. Furthermore, of the long‐acting GLP‐1 RAs, Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER), semaglutide (SUSTAIN‐6), albiglutide (Harmony Outcomes), dulaglutide (REWIND), and Effect of Efpeglenatide on Cardiovascular Outcomes (AMPLITUDE‐O)were all shown to be superior to placebo in reduction of the primary MACE end point (Table 2), suggesting significant prevention of CVD. These studies were included in a recent meta‐analysis, which found that GLP‐1 RAs reduced the risk of MACEs by 14%, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.80–0.93; P < 0.0001), all‐cause mortality by 12% (HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.82–0.94]; P = 0.0001), and hospital admission for heart failure by 11% (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.82–0.98]; P = 0.013). No significant heterogeneity was found between the effect of a GLP‐1 RA in the prevention of MACEs in patients at risk (without CVD) and those with CVD, or between trials when ranked low, intermediate, or high risk based on MACE rates in the placebo group. Overall, these studies demonstrate that GLP‐1 RAs have a significant favorable effect on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2D. Once‐daily subcutaneous liraglutide and once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide and dulaglutide have been approved by the FDA for risk reduction of MACEs in adults with T2D and established CVD.

### Effect of race on cardiometabolic responses to once-weekly exenatide: insights from the exenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) [^13fb8eea]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

There was no evidence of any statistically significant difference in the effect of EQW on the primary MACE endpoint by racial group in EXSCEL. However, in the meta-analyses of LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, and EXSCEL (all involving long-acting analogues), there was a statistically significantly greater CVD benefit of GLP-1 RA therapy in Asians versus Whites (relative risks [95% CI] vs. placebo of 0.35 [0.09, 1.32] and 0.92 [0.73, 1.08], respectively, and 0.68 [0.53, 0.84] and 0.87 [0.81, 0.94], respectively). Given the wide confidence intervals and post hoc nature of these meta-analyses, this finding should be considered only hypothesis-generating. Aggregate data were utilized, but patient-level data could improve the power and consistency of analyses through better characterization of subgroups. In addition, some potentially confounding variables were not considered. For example, we incorporated smoking in our adjusted models since smoking rates are relatively high in Asian populations. Although smoking is an independent risk factor for CVD, and of relevance to treatments such as exenatide as nicotine increases blood glucose levels in a GLP-1-dependent manner, it was not considered in the meta-analysis.

Our post hoc analyses have limitations. Baseline differences between racial groups in background blood glucose-lowering therapies may have influenced EQW responses during the first 6 months of the study. However, we are not aware of any clinically important relevant interactions. Despite the request for usual care providers to delay therapeutic initial intensification, there may have been small racial differences in changes in lifestyle and pharmacotherapy post-randomization that influenced group-specific cardiometabolic responses leading up to the 6-month follow-up visit. The grouping of participants may have masked important racial and ethnic differences present within the broad regional assignments we used. In the case of Asian participants, who are from an area that covers more than half of the world's population, we were not able to distinguish between East and South Asians, who are known to have different CVD risks. The strengths of the study are its relatively large number of participants, even relative to previously published meta-analyses, and the incorporation of people with type 2 diabetes at a later stage of their disease compared with participants in Phase III studies from which currently available race-specific comparisons have been made.

This analysis combined aggregate data from all available CVOTs described in Table 1. Exclusion of the ELIXA CVOT was justified based on differences in the patient population from all other included trials and pharmacologic characteristics of lixisenatide compared with other GLP-1 RAs (see Fig. 1), as has also been done in published meta-analyses.

### Cardiovascular outcomes trials with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: a comparison of study designs, populations and results [^a5b81b4b]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The HR for the first occurrence of a CV event in the primary composite endpoint comparing exenatide with placebo was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by baseline CV risk group and treatment group as a covariate. 12 Tests for non‐inferiority and superiority were conducted hierarchically, first testing for non‐inferiority then superiority for the primary composite endpoint. 12 A superiority test for the secondary outcome of all‐cause death was conducted only if non‐inferiority and superiority were significant for the primary composite endpoint. 12 Two formal interim efficacy analyses were planned to test for superiority (P < .0001 and P < .001) after 453 and 906 events, corresponding to one‐ and two‐thirds of the targeted 1360 primary CV events. 12 This design was to ensure a significance level of.0499 for the final analysis. 12

A total of 14 752 patients were randomized and 10 782 had established CVD (73.1%) with 3970 (26.9%) having CV risk factors, mirroring projections of a patient pool of 14 000 with 70% having established CVD. 12 There were 1744 primary composite outcome events observed, exceeding the minimum of 1360 needed to test EXSCEL's superiority and non‐inferiority hypotheses. 12 The incidence rate for MACE‐3 was 3.7 and 4.0 events/100 patient‐years for exenatide and placebo, respectively, exceeding the 2.2% assumed for testing EXSCEL's primary outcomes. 12 Primary composite outcome events occurred in 839 and 905 patients treated with exenatide or placebo, respectively; exenatide showed non‐inferiority to placebo with respect to safety, but not superiority to placebo with respect to efficacy (HR 0.91, 95% CI [0.83, 1.00]; P < .001 and P = 0.06, respectively). 12 Among other factors, EXSCEL's pragmatic design, shorter follow‐up, duration of treatment regimen exposure and lower baseline HbA1c compared with LEADER may have contributed to its lack of observed CV efficacy. 12 Compared with other GLP‐1 RA CVOTs, EXSCEL had low treatment regimen compliance (exenatide, 76.0%; placebo, 75.0%), defined as the duration of time that patients received the trial regimen relative to the duration of time that they were expected to receive the regimen during the trial. 12

### Estimating the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes: validation of the UKPDS outcomes model using TECOS and EXSCEL data [^27d6ea79]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model version 2 (UKPDS-OM2) cardiovascular risk estimates for people with type 2 diabetes using TECOS and EXSCEL data.

Materials and Methods

We compared model-simulated and TECOS and EXSCEL observed event rates for the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, each component, and all-cause mortality. Risk factors analysed were age, sex, race/ethnicity, height, diabetes duration, atrial fibrillation, albuminuria, and baseline plus annual measures of smoking, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, weight, systolic blood pressure, HbA 1c, heart rate, white cell count, haemoglobin, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Other factors were prior ischemic heart disease, heart failure, amputation, blindness, kidney failure, MI, stroke, and diabetic foot ulcer.

Results

Median follow-up was 3.0 and 3.2years for the 14671 TECOS and 14752 EXSCEL participants, respectively. The primary outcome occurred in TECOS for 839 (11.4%) and 851 (11.6%) sitagliptin and placebo group participants, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 0.98, 95%CI 0.89–1.08), compared with UKPDS-OM2 simulated events of 776 (10.6%) and 778 (10.6%), respectively (relative risk 1.00). The primary outcome occurred in EXSCEL for 839 (11.4%) and 905 (12.2%) once-weekly exenatide and placebo group participants, respectively (HR 0.92, 95%CI 0.84–1.01), compared with UKPDS-OM2-simulated events of 579 (7.9%) and 593 (8.0%), respectively (relative risk 0.98).

Conclusions

UKPDS-OM2 accurately simulated relative risks between randomized groups in both trials. The proportion of participants with the primary outcome was accurately estimated in both TECOS arms but underestimated by around one-third in both EXSCEL arms.

### Report from the 3rd cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) summit of the diabetes&cardiovascular disease (D&CVD) EASD study group [^0704090d]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with diabetes have an up to 50% increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) compared to individuals without diabetes. Optimisation of glycaemic control can reduce the long-term development of CVD and mortality.

Driven by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), guidelines for the approval of novel glucose-lowering medications were published in 2008 and 2012, respectively. These guidelines highlight, that new therapeutic approaches should not result in an increased CV risk. To rule out CV harm of novel treatment approaches, CV safety and benefits of glucose-lowering medications have therefore been the focus of cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) in diabetes, which have been performed according to the suggestions of the abovementioned guidelines. In the CVOTs, combined primary CV endpoints are evaluated, which include CV mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke (3-point-MACE). Additional components could be e.g. hospitalisation for heart failure (HF), acute coronary syndrome and revascularisation procedures. Several CVOTs, which analysed DPP-4 inhibitors (saxagliptin, alogliptin, sitagliptin), GLP-1 receptor agonists (RA; lixisenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide) and SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin), were published until 2016.

In 2017, CVOTs for canagliflozin (SGLT-2 inhibitor, CANVAS program), exenatide once weekly (GLP-1 RA, EXSCEL) and Insulin degludec (basal insulin analogue, DEVOTE) were published. Also the ACE trial (acarbose), which focused on secondary prevention of CVD, was completed. Other CVOTs, which included significant numbers of diabetic patients, investigated lipid-lowering strategies with evolocumab (FOURIER) and anacetrapib (REVEAL). As in 2015 and 2016, we present and summarise key aspects, which were discussed at the 3 rd CVOT Summit.

Time-to-event analyses

Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios for MACE, ACM, CV death, and serious hypoglycemia in each of the two sets of cohorts. In both comparisons, the hazard ratio for MACE with EQW+SGLT2i was non-significantly decreased compared with placebo (adjusted HR (95% CI) 0.68 (0.39–1.17)), and compared with EQW (0.85 (0.48–1.49), Fig. 2). This reduction was driven by a nominally significant decrease in risk of CV death (aHR 0.17 (0.04–0.77) compared with placebo and 0.21 (0.05–0.93) compared with EQW); nonfatal MI and nonfatal stroke were unchanged (Additional file 1: Tables S3 and S4). All-cause mortality was also reduced (aHR vs. placebo of 0.38 (0.16–0.90) and vs. EQW of 0.41 (0.17–0.95)), with no increase in risk of serious hypoglycemia (Fig. 2). Kaplan–Meier curves are shown in Additional file 1: Figures S5–S9.

MACE: major adverse cardiovascular events; CV: cardiovascular; pt-yrs: participant-years

In the exploratory analysis, the composite of hHF and CV death was nominally significantly reduced in both comparisons (Additional file 1: Tables S3 and S4), driven by CV death, while hHF was not reduced. Event numbers were small for both renal composites, with non-significant reductions in the estimated hazard ratios (Additional file 1: Tables S3 and S4). Amputations were rare (5 events total) and not significantly different in either comparison (Additional file 1: Tables S3 and S4).

### Cardiovascular, mortality, and kidney outcomes with GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials [^a6c5ade9]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists differ in their structure and duration of action and have been studied in trials of varying sizes and with different patient populations, with inconsistent effects on cardiovascular outcomes reported. We aimed to synthesise the available evidence by doing a systematic review and meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials of these drugs.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for eligible placebo-controlled trials reporting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; ie, cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction) up to June 15, 2019. We did a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to estimate overall hazard ratios (HRs) for MACE, its components, death from any cause, hospital admission for heart failure, kidney outcomes, and key safety outcomes (severe hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer). We also examined MACE in several subgroups based on patient characteristics (history of cardiovascular disease, BMI, age, baseline HbA1c, and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate), trial duration, treatment dosing interval, and structural homology.

Findings

Of 27 publications screened, seven trials, with a combined total of 56004 participants, were included: ELIXA (lixisenatide), LEADER (liraglutide), SUSTAIN-6 (semaglutide), EXSCEL (exenatide), Harmony Outcomes (albiglutide), REWIND (dulaglutide), and PIONEER 6 (oral semaglutide). Overall, GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment reduced MACE by 12% (HR 0·88, 95% CI 0·82–0·94; p < 0·0001). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity across the subgroups examined. HRs were 0·88 (95% CI 0·81–0·96; p = 0·003) for death from cardiovascular causes, 0·84 (0·76–0·93; p < 0·0001) for fatal or non-fatal stroke, and 0·91 (0·84–1·00; p = 0·043) for fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction. GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment reduced all-cause mortality by 12% (0·88, 0·83–0·95; p = 0·001), hospital admission for heart failure by 9% (0·91, 0·83–0·99; p = 0·028), and a broad composite kidney outcome (development of new-onset macroalbuminuria, decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate [or increase in creatinine], progression to end-stage kidney disease, or death attributable to kidney causes) by 17% (0·83, 0·78–0·89; p < 0·0001), mainly due to a reduction in urinary albumin excretion. There was no increase in risk of severe hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, or pancreatic cancer.

Interpretation

Treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists has beneficial effects on cardiovascular, mortality, and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide on estimated glomerular filtration rate slope depends on baseline renal risk: a post hoc analysis of the EXSCEL trial [^8c5b237c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) reduced the incidence of composite renal outcomes in several cardiovascular outcome trials. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 However, the magnitude of this effect was modest, and driven mainly by reductions in albuminuria. Interestingly, the effects of GLP‐1RAs on renal outcomes seem to be greater in patients with established chronic kidney disease (CKD). Specifically, in a subgroup analysis of the LEADER trial, the effect of liraglutide compared with placebo on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) appeared to be greater in participants with macroalbuminuria or in those with eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m. 2, 6 In addition, in the AWARD‐7 trial, the effect of dulaglutide on clinical kidney outcomes and rate of eGFR decline was more pronounced in participants with macroalbuminuria at baseline. 7 Whether this effect represents a class effect, and which specific subpopulation of patients may derive renal benefit from GLP‐1RAs, remains incompletely understood.

The current established renal endpoints for clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD are composites including doubling of serum creatinine and end‐stage renal disease. These are late manifestations in the progression of CKD. Therefore, large trials of long duration are required to establish drug efficacy using these outcomes. eGFR decline (eGFR slope) is proposed as a valid surrogate for major clinical kidney endpoints. 8 A number of studies have shown a strong and consistent relationship between eGFR slope and risk of adverse kidney outcomes, cardiovascular disease and all‐cause mortality. Importantly, treatment effects on eGFR slope are strongly associated with treatment effects on renal outcomes. 9, 10, 11 These data support use of eGFR slope as a valid endpoint for future trials in diabetes and CKD. In this context, it is relevant to obtain further insight into the effects of exenatide on eGFR slope in patients with type 2 diabetes at low, moderate and high risk of CKD progression. Therefore, we examined the effects of once‐weekly exenatide (EQW) on eGFR slope and change in urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR), as a function of baseline UACR and other risk markers of CKD progression, in the subset of EXSCEL participants with UACR measured at baseline.

### The incretin pathway as a therapeutic target in diabetic kidney disease: a clinical focus on GLP-1 receptor agonists [^998e3c60]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The following cardiovascular safety trial EXSCEL (EXenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering) investigated 14,752 people with T2D, 73% of whom had previous CVD. The results of the renal analysis have not been reported yet, but were presented at the ADA 2018 78th Scientific Sessions. As was the case with LEADER and SUSTAIN-6, hard renal outcome was unaffected by exenatide once weekly versus placebo, as the renal composite of 40% eGFR decline, RRT, and renal death did not differ between treatment arms. When new-onset macroalbuminuria was added to the composite, exenatide once weekly reduced the composite by 15% (95% CI 2–26%; p = 0.03). However, when analyzed as an individual component, the reduction of 16% in new-onset macroalbuminuria did not reach significance (95% CI 0.67–1.04; p = 0.11). eGFR levels over time also did not differ significantly between exenatide once weekly and placebo.

The recently published safety trial Harmony Outcomes (albiglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2D and CVD)only reported that albiglutide does not substantially change eGFR after 16 months. The other safety trials with GLP-1 receptor agonists FREEDOM [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01455896] and REWIND (Researching Cardiovascular Events With a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes) [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01394952], investigating, respectively, continuous subcutaneous delivery of exenatide and dulaglutide, have not yet reported a renal outcome analysis.

### Dual and triple incretin-based Co-agonists: novel therapeutics for obesity and diabetes [^d656ba7b]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Incretin Monoagonists

Exenatide, based on exendin-4, was the first incretin agonist to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the USA, with diabetes indication in 2005. A twice-daily injection of 10 μg yielded placebo-adjusted reductions of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of − 0.8% (5 μg) and − 1.0% (10 μg) after 30 weeks of treatment. Importantly, both arms of the trial showed a significant reduction in body weight. This early success of this first GLP-1R agonist drug has been followed by a number of GLP-1 analogues, including liraglutide and semaglutide, which has completely transformed the landscape of obesity. A once-weekly injection of 2.4 mg of semaglutide resulted in a remarkable reduction in body weight by − 14.9% in adults with obesity, along with substantial improvements in glucose homeostasis and reduced risk of cardiovascular events.

As a result of the interrelated nature of different metabolic diseases, and the negative effect on cardiovascular health that prior drugs for the treatment of obesity had, there has long been interest in the effect of GLP-1R agonists on cardiovascular health. Another GLP-1R agonist, lixisenatide, which, like liraglutide and semaglutide, improves glycemic control and was also well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes, did not have an increase in cardiovascular events in patients with higher risk. It was then found that patients with diabetes and high cardiovascular risk that were treated with liraglutide and semaglutide, but not exenatide, had a lower risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke and another GLP-1R agonist, dulaglutide, reduced major adverse cardiovascular events. Subsequently, in the SELECT trial, patients with overweight or obesity and established cardiovascular disease, but no diabetes, that were treated with semaglutide had a significantly lower composite of cardiovascular events (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke) than placebo. These clinical trial results clearly demonstrate the cardiovascular therapeutic usefulness of GLP-1R agonists in addition to their original indications for obesity and diabetes.

### Fixed-ratio combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide (IDegLira) improves cardiovascular risk markers in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on basal insulin [^653c844e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Analyses of the effects of other available GLP‐1RAs with respect to CV risk have shown differing results. Data from the ELIXA trial showed that, compared to placebo, the addition of lixisenatide to standard of care did not alter the rate of major adverse CV events (MACE) or other serious adverse events in people with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome. 11 Exenatide was shown in the EXSCEL trial to have no significantly different impact on the incidence of MACE compared to placebo 12; however, SUSTAIN‐6 showed a significantly lower rate of MACE with once‐weekly semaglutide compared with placebo, confirming the non‐inferiority of semaglutide in patients at high risk of CV events; albiglutide has been shown to be superior to placebo with respect to MACE, and dulaglutide has been shown to reduce CV risk markers such as systolic BP compared with placebo. 13, 14, 15

To our knowledge, the present study is the only study to assess CV risk in a basal insulin/GLP‐1RA fixed‐ratio combination. The beneficial effects of IDegLira on CV risk factors are consistent with the results from LEADER. 4 The precise mechanism by which liraglutide reduces CV risk, and whether this effect is preserved in IDegLira, remains to be determined.

Interpretation of these results is limited by their post hoc nature and lack of adjustment for multiplicity. Nevertheless, the data originate from randomized controlled trials with large cohorts and large numbers of participants in most categories. We acknowledge that endpoints such as BP were measured during study visits, which may not have represented the true 24‐hour BP value. 13 Other limitations include the fact that the trials were not powered to detect treatment differences in subgroups and we were unable to determine whether the improvements seen in the various CV risk factors were secondary to improved glycaemic control or weight loss. In addition, we were unable to examine background anti‐hypertensive and lipid‐lowering therapies across populations and thus were unable to determine if these had any impact on the results. Finally, these data are surrogate risk markers with no MACE evidence from a dedicated CVOT.

In conclusion, analyses of CV risk markers from three comparative trials in participants with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on basal insulin show that IDegLira is associated with a general improvement across most CV risk markers and baseline subgroups versus basal insulin or basal–bolus therapy after 26 weeks of treatment.

### Diabetic kidney disease: update on clinical management and non-glycaemic effects of newer medications for type 2 diabetes [^4ca3c04c]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Myocardial Infarction (ELIXA) trial examined the effect of lixisenatide in those with type 2 diabetes who had an acute coronary event (acute myocardial infarction or admission for unstable angina) within the previous 180 days. In comparison to the other trials this was a neutral trial which illustrated that the addition of lixisenatide did not alter the rate of major cardiovascular events. However, there was a signal for potential renal benefit with a modest difference in the percentage of change in urine ACR in favour of lixisenatide over placebo (24% versus 34%, p = 0.004 increase in urine ACR at 24 months).

The Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) trial randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes with or without previous cardiovascular disease to receive SC injections of extended-release exenatide (2 mg) or placebo on a once weekly basis. Similar to the other studies the outcome was a composite of major cardiovascular events. Again, this trial was neutral illustrating non-inferiority to placebo with respect to cardiovascular safety. The lack of cardiovascular benefit may be related to shorter median follow-up or lower baseline glycated haemoglobin level (8%) in comparison to that in the LEADER trial (8.7%).

Dulaglutide was studied in Dulaglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes (REWIND) a multicentre RCT of the addition of a weekly injection of 1.5 mg dulaglutide to an existing glucose-lowering regimen in participants with type 2 diabetes with either pre-existing cardiovascular disease, or cardiovascular risk factors, versus placebo. This trial was also a cardiovascular outcome trial and it found that with a median follow-up of 5.4 years (longer than the previously mentioned trials) the primary composite outcome of major cardiovascular events was lower in those treated with dulaglutide 12% versus 13.4% (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79–0.99). However, this study had lower baseline rates of both cardiovascular disease and CKD at 31.5% and 22.2%, respectively.

The studies included a total of 56,004 patients with T2DM who had either established CVD or risk factors for CVD. The sample size in the trials ranged from 3183 patients in the PIONEER-6 trial to 14,752 patients in the EXSCEL trial. The mean age of participants ranged from 59.9 to 66.2 years, with the REWIND trial including older patients. The median follow-up ranged from 1.3 years (PIONEER-6) to 5.4 years (REWIND). The ELIXA trial included only patients with recent acute coronary syndrome. Whereas the remaining trials included varying percentages of patients with established CVD, for example 31% of patients in the REWIND trial had established CVD. The use of sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) varied among the trials; the Harmony outcomes and PIONEER-6 trials had the highest use. Lastly, the use of statins ranged from 66 to 92% of patients in the included trials (Table 1). The network plot is presented in Additional file 3: Figure S2, the risk of bias assessment showed that all the included trials had a low risk of bias as presented in Additional file 4: Table S2, and there were no signs of inconsistency between the trials in the inconsistency plots for fixed models as demonstrated in Additional file 5: Figure S3.

### Exenatide once weekly plus dapagliflozin once daily versus exenatide or dapagliflozin alone in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy (DURATION-8): a 28 week, multicentre, double-blind, phase 3, randomised controlled trial [^5c52931a]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce glycaemia and weight, and improve cardiovascular risk factors via different mechanisms. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of co-initiation of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide and the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin with exenatide or dapagliflozin alone in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin.

Methods

DURATION-8 was a 28 week, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, active-controlled phase 3 trial done at 109 sites in six countries. Adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control (HbA 1c 8–12% [64–108 mmol/mol]) despite stable metformin monotherapy (≥ 1500 mg/day) were randomly assigned (1:1:1), via an interactive voice and web-response system, to receive once-weekly exenatide 2 mg by subcutaneous injection plus once-daily dapagliflozin 10 mg oral tablets, exenatide with dapagliflozin-matched oral placebo, or dapagliflozin with exenatide-matched placebo injections. Randomisation was stratified by baseline HbA 1c (< 9·0% vs ≥ 9·0% [< 75 mmol/mol vs ≥ 75 mmol/mol]). The primary endpoint was change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 28. Secondary endpoints were the change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose at week 2 and week 28, and 2 h postprandial glucose at week 28; the proportion of patients with an HbA 1c less than 7·0% (< 53 mmol/mol) at week 28; change in weight at week 28; the proportion of patients with weight loss of 5% or more at week 28; and change in systolic blood pressure at week 28. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02229396.

Findings

Between Sept 4, 2014, and Oct 15, 2015, we randomly assigned 695 patients to receive exenatide plus dapagliflozin (n = 231), exenatide alone (n = 231; n = 1 untreated), or dapagliflozin alone (n = 233). The intention-to-treat population comprised 685 participants (mean HbA 1c 9·3% [SD 1·1]; 78 mmol/mol [12]), of whom 611 (88%) completed the study. After 28 weeks, the change in baseline HbA 1c was -2·0% (95% CI -2·1 to -1·8) in the exenatide plus dapagliflozin group, -1·6% (-1·8 to -1·4) in the exenatide group, and -1·4% (-1·6 to -1·2) in the dapagliflozin group. Exenatide plus dapagliflozin significantly reduced HbA 1c from baseline to week 28 compared with exenatide alone (-0·4% [95% CI -0·6 to -0·1]; p = 0·004) or dapagliflozin alone (-0·6% [-0·8 to -0·3]; p < 0·001). Exenatide plus dapagliflozin was significantly superior to either drug alone for all secondary efficacy endpoints, with greater reductions in fasting plasma and postprandial glucose, more patients with an HbA 1c less than 7·0% (< 53 mmol/mol), greater weight loss, a greater proportion of patients with weight loss of 5% or more, and greater reductions in systolic blood pressure (all p ≤ 0·025). Adverse events were recorded in 131 (57%) of 231 patients in the exenatide plus dapagliflozin group, 124 (54%) of 230 patients in the exenatide group, and 121 (52%) of 233 patients in the dapagliflozin group. The most common adverse events (≥ 5% of patients in any group) were diarrhoea, injection-site nodules, nausea, and urinary tract infections. No episodes of major hypoglycaemia or minor hypoglycaemia were reported.

Interpretation

Co-initiation of exenatide and dapagliflozin improved various glycaemic measures and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin monotherapy. The dual treatment regimen was well tolerated, with the expected safety profile for this combination. Additional data from an ongoing study (eg, AWARD-10; NCT02597049) will further inform the use of these drug classes in combination.

### The effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^6b283376]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Exenatide

The EXSCEL trial is the largest CVOT of a GLP-1RA, assessing cardiovascular safety of once-weekly exenatide compared with placebo on the background of usual care in 14,752 patients with T2DM (73.1% had previous CVD). Renal outcomes in the EXSCEL trial were changes in eGFR, occurrence of new macroalbuminuria and two renal composites (renal composite 1: 40% decline in eGFR, RRT, renal death and renal composite 2: 40% decline in eGFR, RRT, renal death and new macroalbuminuria) from a prespecified analysis plan. Intention-to-treat analyses showed no significant difference in eGFR levels and development of new macroalbuminuria but a 15% lower renal composite 2 adjusted risk with exenatide (p = 0.027).

Albiglutide

The Harmony Outcomes trial was designed to assess cardiovascular safety of once-weekly albiglutide compared with a placebo in patients with T2DM and CVD. The trial included 9463 patients with a median follow-up of 1.5 years. No differences in the rate of eGFR decline and renal events were noted between the two groups.

### Estimated glomerular filtration rate slope and risk of primary and secondary major adverse cardiovascular events and heart failure hospitalization in people with type 2 diabetes: an analysis of the EXSCEL trial [^156ff3dd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

The decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a significant predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), occurs heterogeneously in people with diabetes because of various risk factors. We investigated the role of eGFR decline in predicting CVD events in people with type 2 diabetes in both primary and secondary CVD prevention settings.

Materials and Methods

Bayesian joint modelling of repeated measures of eGFR and time to CVD event was applied to the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) trial to examine the association between the eGFR slope and the incidence of major adverse CV event/hospitalization for heart failure (MACE/hHF) (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, CV death, or hospitalization for heart failure). The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, baseline eGFR, antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication, diabetes duration, atrial fibrillation, high-density cholesterol, total cholesterol, HbA1c and treatment allocation (once-weekly exenatide or placebo).

Results

Data from 11101 trial participants with (n = 7942) and without (n = 3159) previous history of CVD were analysed. The mean ± SD eGFR slope per year in participants without and with previous CVD was -0.68 ± 1.67 and -1.03 ± 2.13 mL/min/1.73 m 2, respectively. The 5-year MACE/hHF incidences were 7.5% (95% CI 6.2, 8.8) and 20% (95% CI 19, 22), respectively. The 1-SD decrease in the eGFR slope was associated with increased MACE/hHF risks of 48% (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.12, 1.98, p = 0.007) and 33% (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.18,1.51, p < 0.001) in participants without and with previous CVD, respectively.

Conclusions

eGFR trajectories over time significantly predict incident MACE/hHF events in people with type 2 diabetes with and without existing CVD, with a higher hazard ratio for MACE/hHF in the latter group.

### Generalizability of the results of cardiovascular outcome trials of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^88484be0]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worldwide. CVD risks are often considered the main indicator of safety issues in the evaluation of glucose-lowering therapies. For example, medications such as thiazolidinediones were found to be associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events including congestive heart failure. As a novel antidiabetic treatment, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) not only demonstrated an antidiabetic effect and cardiovascular safety but also potential cardiovascular protective effects. GLP-1 RAs were recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in 2020 as a preferable combination therapy after metformin for patients with diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or at high risk of ASCVD.

Cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) of GLP-1 RAs were conducted worldwide; however, the proportions of Chinese participants or even Asian participants were very limited in each CVOT. The proportion of Asian population in four CVOTs, namely REWIND (Researching Cardiovascular Events with a Weekly INcretin in Diabetes) (dulaglutide; NCT01394952), LEADER (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of cardiovascular outcome Results) (liraglutide; NCT01179048), SUSTAIN-6 (semaglutide; NCT01720446, and EXSCEL (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering) (exenatide once weekly; NCT01144338), was 1.5%, 9.9%, 8.3%, and 9.8%, respectively.

Although eligibility criteria for CVOTs can improve internal validity of clinical trials, they may limit the generalizability of findings to different populations recruited from heterogeneous practice settings. Several studies have been conducted to examine the generalizability of results from GLP-1 RAs CVOTs to T2DM populations in the USA and Europe, but none has been conducted in Asian patients with T2DM to our best knowledge. Ethnicity is considered one of the risk factors for diabetes and its complications including CVD. It remains unknown whether results of the CVOTs, mainly from Caucasians, are applicable to Asian ethnic groups such as the Chinese population. Therefore, our study was the first that aimed to evaluate the generalizability of the results of GLP-1 RA CVOTs to the Chinese T2DM population.

### Cardiovascular safety of exenatide BID: an integrated analysis from controlled clinical trials in participants with type 2 diabetes [^d5d5558e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Analysis

A meta-analysis was performed on 12 completed longer-term (3- to 12-month), randomized, placebo- or insulin comparator-controlled trials of exenatide BID, in accordance with the FDA guidelines. Data from approximately 4,000 patients with type 2 diabetes and an average exposure of 24 weeks were included. Pooled data from placebo- and insulin-treated patients were compared with pooled data from exenatide-treated patients. The exenatide cohort included participants randomized to receive exenatide BID 2.5 mcg (n = 37), 5 mcg (n = 594), or 10 mcg (n = 1,685). Because of the low number of CV events, the 3 exenatide dose groups were combined.

For the primary analysis, the Relative Risk (RR) of an incident CV event and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using Mantel-Haenszel method stratified by study. In order to demonstrate robustness, the RR and its 95% CI were calculated using the following additional methods: pooled RR (without stratification by study and with common continuity correction [i.e. adding 0.5 to all cells if one of the treatment groups had no events]) and Shuster's RR (weights all trials equally and included studies with no events). The Hazard Ratio (HR) was calculated using 2 methods: 1) the Cox proportional hazard model (time to first event) with adjustment for study, and 2) the Andersen-Gill model (recurrent events) with adjustment for study. Ninety-five percent CIs for the RR and HR were provided at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. Weighted Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated to show the time to first event and the proportion of patients who were risk-free over time. The time to event was calculated from the first randomized dose to the time of the first cardiac event. Exposure Adjusted Incidence Rate (EAIR) and its 95% CI were calculated using the Exact method. The RR and its 95% CI based on EAIR and event rate were provided.

Additional subgroup analyses by age (< 65 vs. ≥ 65), BMI (< 30 vs. ≥ 30), and renal function (normal, mild impairment, and moderate impairment) were provided to assess the effects of these baseline characteristics. SAS 9.2 ® (Statistical Analysis Software, Cary, NC, USA) was used for all analyses.

### Heterogeneity amongst GLP-1 RA cardiovascular outcome trials results: can definition of established cardiovascular disease be the missing link? [^7875f2a5]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of adverse outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes, and all new anti-diabetic agents are mandated to undergo cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs). Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are incretin mimetics that reduce blood glucose levels with a low associated risk of hypoglycaemia. CVOTs with different GLP-1 RAs yielded different results in terms of major cardiovascular composite outcome (MACE), with some trials showing superiority in the treatment arm, whereas other simply displayed non-inferiority. More importantly, the significance of each component of MACE varied between drugs. This begs the question of whether these differences are due to dissimilarities between drugs or other factors, namely trial design, are at the root of these differences. We analyse the trial designs for all CVOTs with GLP-1 RAs and highlight important differences between them, namely in terms of definition of established cardiovascular disease, and discuss how these differences might explain the disparate results of the trials and preclude direct comparisons between them. We conclude that a fair comparison between GLP-1 RA CVOTs would involve post-hoc analysis re-grouping the patients into different cardiovascular risk categories based upon their baseline clinical parameters, in order to even out the criteria used to classify patients.

### Cardiovascular outcomes with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis [^7a9df165]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective glucose-lowering drugs. Findings from cardiovascular outcome trials showed cardiovascular safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists, but results for cardiovascular efficacy were varied. We aimed to examine overall cardiovascular efficacy for lixisenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide, and extended-release exenatide.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we analysed data from eligible trials that assessed the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared with placebo in adult patients (aged 18 years or older) with type 2 diabetes and had a primary outcome including, but not limited to, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. We searched PubMed and MEDLINE without language restrictions up to Sept 18, 2017, for eligible trials. We did a meta-analysis of available trial data using a random-effects model to calculate overall hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular efficacy outcomes and odds ratios for key safety outcomes.

Findings

Of 12 articles identified in our search and screened for eligibility, four trials of cardiovascular outcomes of GLP-1 receptor agonists were identified: ELIXA (lixisenatide), LEADER (liraglutide), SUSTAIN 6 (semaglutide), and EXSCEL (extended-release exenatide). Compared with placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment showed a significant 10% relative risk reduction in the three-point major adverse cardiovascular event primary outcome (cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke; HR 0·90, 95% CI 0·82–0·99; p = 0·033), a 13% RRR in cardiovascular mortality (0·87, 0·79–0·96; p = 0·007), and a 12% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality (0·88, 0·81–0·95; p = 0·002), with low-to-moderate between-trial statistical heterogeneity. No significant effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists was identified on fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, hospital admission for unstable angina, or hospital admission for heart failure. Overall, no significant differences were seen in severe hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, or medullary thyroid cancer reported between GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment and placebo.

Interpretation

Our findings show cardiovascular safety across all GLP-1 receptor agonist cardiovascular outcome trials and suggest that drugs in this class can reduce three-point major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality risk, albeit to varying degrees for individual drugs, without significant safety concerns. GLP-1 receptor agonists have a favourable risk-benefit balance overall, which should allow the choice of drug to be individualised to each patient's needs.

2.5 Harmony

The study of albiglutide (30‐50 mg once‐weekly subcutaneous injection) on CV outcomes was the second GLP‐1 RA CVOT designed to exclusively enrol patients with prior CVD. 13 Eligible patients were aged 40 years or older with an HbA1c of less than 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol) and established CVD defined as CAD, cerebrovascular disease or PAD. 13 CAD was defined as a documented history of spontaneous MI, a documented CAD 50% or higher stenosis in one or more major epicardial coronary arteries, or a history of coronary revascularization. 13 Cerebrovascular disease was defined as a documented history of ischaemic stroke, carotid arterial disease with 50% or higher stenosis, or a carotid vascular procedure. 13 PAD was defined as intermittent claudication and an ankle‐brachial index of less than 0.9 in at least one ankle or a prior non‐traumatic amputation or peripheral vascular procedure caused by peripheral arterial ischaemia. 13 Definitions of CAD, cerebrovascular disease and PAD were similar to EXSCEL.

Harmony was an event‐driven trial also requiring a minimum follow‐up of 1.5 years, and was designed to first test for the non‐inferiority of albiglutide to placebo by a margin of 1.3 with respect to its effect on adjudicated MACE, followed by superiority testing if the prespecified criterion was met. 13 It was determined that 611 events were needed for 90% power to rule out a non‐inferiority margin of 1.3 for the HR with a type I error of 0.05, assuming a true HR of 1.0. 13 A total of 9400 patients were planned for enrolment and followed until 611 events occurred. 13 Assuming the number of patients lost to follow‐up would be 1% or less, the mean follow‐up would be 3.2 and 2.2 years for an observed rate of MACE of 2% and 3%, respectively. 13

### Cardiovascular safety of exenatide BID: an integrated analysis from controlled clinical trials in participants with type 2 diabetes [^4e50ed6a]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

On the basis of this integrated analysis of 3,945 participants representing 1,070 patient-years of exenatide exposure and 780 patient-years of PC exposure, no increase in CV risk was associated with use of exenatide BID (vs. PC) in patients with type 2 diabetes participating in clinical trials. This analysis, conducted in compliance with FDA guidance on the subject, provides insight into the CV safety of exenatide treatment.

Table 3
Incidence rates and exposure-adjusted incidence rates for primary MACE and secondary CV endpoints

CI = confidence interval; CV = cardiovascular; EAIR = exposure-adjusted incidence rate; MACE = major adverse cardiovascular events; RR = risk ratio

RR for the incidence was calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel estimate with study as a stratification factor

EAIR and event rate were calculated based on the Exact method, with corresponding RR calculated using the log-normal approximation

The point estimates for Primary MACE and Secondary CV endpoints between exenatide BID and the pooled comparator were both 0.7 (the upper limits of the 95% CIs were 1.3 and 1.0, respectively), in favor of exenatide (Figure 1). These results suggest that exenatide did not increase the CV risk. For the individual studies, the point estimates for RR were < 1.0 (favoring exenatide) for 10 of 12 long-term controlled studies (Figure 2). In addition, the RRs and 95% CIs for the Primary MACE were consistent across multiple methods of analysis (including sensitivity analyses of RR based on incidence and RR based on EAIR event rate), with point estimates ranging from 0.5 to 0.8, and the upper limit of the 95% CIs ranging from 1.3 to 1.5 (Figure 3). Similar point estimates were observed for the broader secondary CV endpoint; however, the upper limit of the 95% CI was < 1.3 for all methods (Figure 3). A weighted Kaplan-Meier plot shows that a significantly higher percentage of exenatide-treated patients than pooled comparator-treated patients were free of a primary MACE event over 1 year (P < 0.0001; Figure 4).

### Cardiovascular outcomes in trials of new antidiabetic drug classes: a network meta-analysis [^1d93bef2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

In recent years, new antidiabetic drug classes, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs), sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, with low risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain, have become available and are now widely used as add-on therapies after metformin. Their cardiovascular benefits have been reported in a number of studies. In the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) and the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) trials, liraglutide and empagliflozin were found to decrease cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality, respectively. These benefits were confirmed in our previous meta-analysis that included these two CVOTs and supported the guidelines recommending these two drug classes for T2DM patients with arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Recently, more CVOTs including Harmony Outcomes and Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) on GLP-1 RAs, Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (DECLARE-TIMI) 58, CANaglifozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) programs on SGLT-2 inhibitors, and Cardiovascular and Renal Microvascular Outcome Study With Linagliptin (CARMELINA) on a DPP-4 inhibitor have been completed. The findings of EXSCEL and CANVAS programs have not only confirmed the cardiovascular safety profiles of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors but also affected the recommendations on the personalised diabetes management in the ADA/EASD consensus statement. The other CVOTs reported after the publication of the ADA/EASD consensus statement showed inconsistent results compared with previous evidence. The superiority of albiglutide, a GLP-1 RA in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was found in Harmony Outcomes (P = 0.006). However, there was no significant reduction in MACE with dapagliflozin, a SGLT-2 inhibitor (P = 0.17) in DECLARE-TIMI 58. A recent meta-analysis including these two latest CVOTs showed a similar protection of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors against MACE, although DPP-4 inhibitors, a widely-used antidiabetic drug class, were not evaluated.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) — regulatory status and overall cerebrovascular effects are as follows: a 24% reduction in the risk of stroke (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.94) has been reported, and liraglutide, semaglutide SC, and dulaglutide are approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established cardiovascular (CV) disease, with dulaglutide being the only agent also approved for CV disease reduction in patients without established ASCVD; additionally, a recent meta-analysis suggests this class may offer modest reductions in hospitalization for heart failure, apparently driven by albiglutide rather than a consistent effect across all agents.

### Assessment of cardiovascular risk with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes using an alternative measure to the hazard ratio [^89acc39d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized clinical trials with the aim of evaluating the cardiovascular risks associated with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, lixisenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide, and exenatide, have been conducted. They showed different results among the agents, but the reason has not been explained.

Objective

To evaluate the cardiovascular risks associated with GLP-1 receptor agonists by using an alternative measure to the hazard ratio.

Methods

We used the difference in restricted mean survival time (RMST) as a measure of cardiovascular risks. Four randomized clinical trials with cardiovascular events as a primary endpoint, ELIXA (lixisenatide), LEADER (liraglutide), SUSTAIN-6 (semaglutide), and EXSCEL (exenatide), were reevaluated by estimating the RMSTs for each of the agents and placebo based on the reconstructed individual patient data for each time-to-event outcome from publicly available information.

Results

The differences of RMSTs (GLP-1 receptor agonist minus placebo: point estimate and 95% CI) for primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular events were 0 days [-14, 14] in ELIXA (1080 days follow-up), 20 days [6, 34] in LEADER (1620 days follow-up), 8 days [1, 15] in SUSTAIN-6 (672 days follow-up), and 11 days [-3, 26] in EXSCEL (1825 days follow-up). As for the risk of other cardiovascular outcomes, there were no substantial differences between GLP-1 receptor agonists and placebo.

Conclusions

Liraglutide and semaglutide decrease the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with placebo when using the difference in RMST. The previously reported result that GLP-1 receptor agonists do not increase the risk of cardiovascular outcomes compared with placebo is also confirmed.

### Study details | GLP-1 REceptor agonists and real world evIdeNce… [^85291d08]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are powerful second-line agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. GLP-1RA have bene marketed in 2010 in Italy and years of experience have accumulated for the treatment with this class of drugs. Cardiovascular outcome trials have shown that type 2 diabetic patients with established cardiovascular disease treated with GLP-1RA have a lower risk of future cardiovascular events. Different groups of GLP-1RA therapies will be compared:

- Long-acting versus short acting
- Fixed versus flexible combinations of GLP-1RA and basal insulin.
- GLP-1RA with similarities to human GLP-1 versus exendin-based GLP-1RA.

Randomized controlled trials have shown that addition of GLP-1RA is more effective in reducing HbA1c than addition of basal insulin in patients with uncontrolled T2D on oral therapy. GLP-1RA are associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia and are provided with extra-glycemic effects, including reduction of body weight and blood pressure. Notably, GLP-1RA as a class improve cardiovascular outcomes in T2D patients with established CVD. These benefits justify the positioning of GLP-1RA as the first injectable therapy in most T2D patients and an alternative to insulin. These included exenatide twice daily and once weekly, liraglutide, lixisenatide, dulaglutide and fixed ratio combinations of BI/GLP-1RA. The baseline visit date will be set as the date when the patients attended the outpatient clinic and received for the first time a new prescription of GLP-1RA.
- Long-acting versus short acting
- Fixed versus flexible combinations of GLP-1RA and basal insulin.
- GLP-1RA with similarities to human GLP-1 versus exendin-based GLP-1RA.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials [^a5febac2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Similar to our results, some studies also indicated that GLP-1 receptor agonists had a positive effect on the heart and enhanced cardiac function. While some previous studies found a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events when GLP-1 receptor agonists were compared with placebo. Furthermore, a comparison meta-analysis indicated that there was no significant reduction in CVD events by GLP-1 receptor agonists. Similarly, Inzucchi et al believed that the evidence of GLP-1 receptor agonist cardiovascular protection was still limited, and the cardiovascular system benefits related to GLP-1 receptor agonists may be independent of its glucose, lipid, or energy metabolism effects. In order to better define the cardiovascular effects of GLP-1 receptor agonist in type 2 diabetes, we perform this meta-analysis. The trials included in the meta-analysis are the EXSCEL study (exenatide), LEADER study (liraglutide), SUSTAIN 6 study (semaglutide) and HARMONY outcomes study (albiglutide), ELIXA study (lixisenatide) and REWIND study (dulaglutide). Not all GLP-1 receptor agonist may have the same effect on cardiovascular events, since the classification of Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists included the short acting and long acting. But there were no hand-to-hand cardiovascular outcomes studies focused on GLP-1 receptor agonist class, limiting the investigation of cardiovascular events differences between GLP-1 receptor agonists of different mechanical structure or drug potency.

### Design and baseline characteristics of the AMPLITUDE-O cardiovascular outcomes trial of efpeglenatide, a weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist [^938c28c8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

The effect of the weekly exendin-based glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist efpeglenatide on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown.

Materials and Methods

People with T2DM and glycated haemoglobin > 7%, ≥ 18years old with previous CV disease, or ≥ 50years old with CKD [defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25–59.9mL/min/1.73m 2], and one or more additional CV risk factors were recruited. Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by current, intended or neither current nor intended use of a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to receive weekly injections of efpeglenatide (4 mg or 6 mg) or masked placebo. The primary outcome is a major adverse CV event defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or CV death. Secondary outcomes include a composite kidney outcome (new onset macroalbuminuria with an increase from baseline of ≥ 30%, sustained 40% decrease in eGFR, renal replacement therapy, or sustained eGFR < 15mL/min/1.73m 2). The trial will continue until ≥ 330 participants have had a major adverse CV event outcome and the sample size was based on accruing enough outcomes to detect non-inferiority of efpeglenatide versus placebo.

Results

Recruitment of 4076 participants (33% women, mean age 64.5years) occurred between 11 May 2018 and 25 April 2019 at 344 sites in 28 countries. Mean baseline glycated haemoglobin was 8.9% (1.5), 31.6% had an eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m 2, 89.5% had previous CV disease and 15.0% were on an SGLT2 inhibitor.

Conclusions

The results of the AMPLITUDE O trial will inform the use of exendin-based glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist to people with T2DM and high CV risk, with and without CKD, in the presence and absence of an SGLT2 inhibitor.

### Cardiovascular safety for once-weekly dulaglutide in type 2 diabetes: a pre-specified meta-analysis of prospectively adjudicated cardiovascular events [^3558cb37]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have a substantial increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease and associated mortality than those without diabetes. Dulaglutide is a once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that is approved for treatment of T2D.

Methods

This meta-analysis evaluates the CV risk in patients with T2D treated with dulaglutide in 9 randomized safety and efficacy trials. Mean (median) treatment duration was 333 (358) days. Reported CV events were independently adjudicated by a treatment-blinded clinical endpoint committee. The primary measure was a 4-component major adverse CV event (4-component MACE) composite endpoint of death due to CV causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina. Additional pre-specified endpoints included adjudicated coronary revascularizations, hospitalization for heart failure, and all-cause mortality. A Cox proportional hazards regression model (stratified by study) was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and confidence interval (CI). Tests of treatment effects for the primary endpoint were conducted at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.0198 and a corresponding 98.02% CI was calculated. Statistical heterogeneity between the strata (studies) was tested by including in the Cox model an interaction term between treatment and strata.

Results

The analysis included 6010 randomized patients [dulaglutide: 3885; comparator therapy (active or placebo): 2125]; cumulative exposure to dulaglutide or comparator therapy was 3941 and 2223 patient-years, respectively. The demographic and baseline CV disease characteristics were similar across groups. Twenty-six (0.67%) patients in the dulaglutide group versus 25 (1.18%) in the comparator group experienced a primary 4-component MACE (HR 0.57; adjusted 98.02% CI 0.30, 1.10). Results for the 3-component MACE (composite endpoint of death due to CV causes, nonfatal MI or stroke), 6-component MACE (composite endpoint of death due to CV causes, nonfatal MI or stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure, or coronary revascularizations) and all-cause mortality were consistent with the primary analysis (HR < 1.0 for all).

Conclusions

These results suggest that dulaglutide does not increase the risk of major CV events in T2D patients. The ongoing CV outcomes study, Researching CV Events with a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND), will further assess CV safety of dulaglutide.

### Using exenatide twice daily or insulin in clinical practice: results from CHOICE [^ede117e7]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

CHOICE (CHanges to treatment and Outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes initiating InjeCtablE therapy; NCT00635492) assessed, as its primary objective, the time to a 'significant treatment change' (defined within this paper) after patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus initiated their first injectable, glucose-lowering therapy [exenatide twice daily (BID) or insulin] in clinical practice in six European countries and evaluated outcomes during the study.

Methods

CHOICE was a 24-month, prospective, noninterventional observational study. Patients were invited to participate in CHOICE only after their treating physician had made the clinical decision to initiate first injectable therapy with either exenatide BID or insulin. Clinical data were collected at initiation of first injectable therapy and after approximately 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

Results

A total of 2,515 patients were recruited; 1,114 patients in the exenatide BID cohort and 1,274 patients in the insulin cohort were eligible for the 24-month analysis. During the study, 42.2% and 36.0% of patients from each cohort, respectively, had a significant treatment change. By 24 months, improved mean glycated hemoglobin (p < 0.001 for both cohorts) and reduced severity of several cardiovascular risk factors were observed in both cohorts; additionally, mean weight was reduced in the exenatide BID cohort (p < 0.001) and increased in the insulin cohort (p < 0.001). Hypoglycemia was reported by 18.4% of the exenatide BID cohort and 36.8% of the insulin cohort; 25.9% of the exenatide BID cohort and 10.0% of the insulin cohort had met the secondary endpoint of glycated hemoglobin < 7.0%, no weight gain, and no hypoglycemia.

Conclusion

CHOICE provided data on exenatide BID and insulin usage patterns and 24-month outcomes in clinical practice. On average, improved glycemic control and reduced severity of cardiovascular risk factors were observed in both cohorts, and those in the exenatide BID cohort also had mean weight loss.

### Cardiovascular safety of exenatide BID: an integrated analysis from controlled clinical trials in participants with type 2 diabetes [^4dff843e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Results

The data included in these analyses represented 1,072 patient-years (PY) exposure with exenatide BID (N = 2,316) and 780 PY exposure with comparators (placebo, n = 971; insulin, n = 658). Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups (Table 2). Participants had similar mean baseline values for HbA 1c (8.33%-8.38%), BMI (31.3–31.5 kg/m 2), and duration of diabetes (8 years). Of note, the mean systolic blood pressures at baseline for both cohorts were 131 ± 4 mm Hg and 132 ± 5 mm Hg for the exenatide and the pooled comparator cohorts, respectively. Some patients had a past history of CV disease (including multiple events) and/or microvascular disease (including multiple conditions). From baseline to endpoint, heart rate changes were +0.5 ± 9.8 beats per minute (bpm) for exenatide and +0.1 ± 9.2 bpm for the pooled comparators (mean ± SD).

* Renal function is defined based on creatinine clearance (CrCl) as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation: normal, CrCl > 80 mL/min; mild impairment, CrCl > 50–80 mL/min; moderate impairment, CrCl > 30–50 mL/min

Incidence rates of Primary MACE were similar for 5 mcg (0.9%) and 10 mcg (1.1%) exenatide dose groups, and no events were observed in the 2.5 mcg group. Therefore, data from all exenatide doses (2.5 mcg, 5 mcg, 10 mcg) were pooled in the analyses. The EAIR for exenatide treatment group was 18.73 per 1,000 patient-years versus 23.17 per 1,000 patient-years for the pooled comparator group (Table 3). Overall, 26 participants experienced serious adverse CV events: 15 (0.6%) in the exenatide group and 11 (0.7%) in the pooled comparator group (data not shown). Four fatal CV events occurred: 2 in the exenatide group (MI, atrial fibrillation) and 2 in the comparator group (MI, cerebrovascular accident).

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with and without diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^ebd18534]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The majority of the Phase 3 trials on the cardiovascular outcomes of GLP‐1 RAs recruited participants with either established CVD (usually defined as a previous episode of MI, stroke, revascularization, or coexisting peripheral vascular disease) or those with a high cardiovascular risk. Long‐acting GLP‐1 RAs have been proven to be effective in reducing long‐term MACE in some trials in which a high proportion (> 80%) of patients (e.g. SUSTAIN‐6 and LEADER) or the whole eligible population (Harmony Outcomes) had established CVD. Studies on lower‐risk populations such as the REWIND trial, in which 31% of participants had coexisting cardiovascular conditions, also showed reduced risk of MACE after 6 years of dulaglutide use. Consistent with the results published from most of the trials on diabetic patients, our analysis also showed the cardiovascular efficacy of GLP‐1 RAs in the subgroup of patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Review of head-to-head comparisons of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^9c0ef14f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have agreed that assertions concerning a causal association between incretin‐based drugs and pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, as expressed recently in the scientific literature and in the media, are inconsistent with current data; however, the FDA and the EMA have not reached a final conclusion regarding such a causal relationship 81. Notably, the FDA requires evidence of cardiovascular safety of new glucose‐lowering agents in large clinical endpoint trials, and, as a by‐product of these trials, clinical events related to pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer will be assessed. The first results from the Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes After Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With AVE0010 (Lixisenatide; ELIXA; NCT01147250) study comparing lixisenatide and placebo were presented at the American Diabetes Association 2015 Scientific Sessions. The 2‐year follow‐up data showed that the effect of lixisenatide compared with placebo was neutral for the primary composite endpoint: cardiovascular death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, non‐fatal stroke or hospitalization for unstable angina (13.4% vs 13.2%). Furthermore, there was no elevation in pancreatitis and pancreas cancer with lixisenatide. Likewise, no elevation in heart rate was observed, probably explained by the short duration of action of lixisenatide given before breakfast. Lixisenatide led to a small change in HbA1c of 0.27%, in weight of 0.7 kg and in SBP of 0.8 mmHg vs placebo 82.

Following on from that study, the first results of the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results ‐ A Long Term Evaluation in 2015 (LEADER; NCT01179048); the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering Trial (EXSCEL; NCT01144338) study, comparing exenatide once weekly and placebo; and the Researching Cardiovascular Events With a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND; NCT01394952) study, comparing dulaglutide and placebo, are estimated to end in 2015, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

Consensus recommendations for the management of T2DM in patients with corresponding high risk/history of CVD

The results of all the below mentioned CVOTs are summarized in Table 2. Based on these CVOTs and years of expertise, the authors have come up with the treatment approaches for T2DM patients with high risk/history of CVDs.

Management of T2DM in patients at a risk of CVD

Figure 1 describes the consensus approach to glucose lowering with AHAs in this set of population. For patients not reaching their target HbA1c, it is advisable to assess adherence and arrange timely follow-up every 3 months.

Fig. 1
Evidence-based algorithm for the management of patients with T2DM and high risk of CVD. CVD cardiovascular disease, GLP-1 glucagon-like peptide-1, SGLT2 sodium–glucose transporter proteins-2, TZD thiazolidinedione, DPP4 dipeptidylpeptidase-4. a Proven CVD benefits means the agent has a label indication of reducing the CVD events. For SGLT2 inhibitors evidence based preference is empagliflozin > canagliflozin. SGLT2 inhibitors vary in regards to eGFR pre-requisites for a continued use. b For GLP-1 agonist evidence based preference is Semaglutide > Liraglutide > Dulaglutide > Exenatide > Lixenatide. Caution to be exercised in case of end-stage renal disease. c Degludec and insulin Glargine (U100) have shown CVD safety, d Dapagliflozin: preferred option for patients with eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, e Low dose TZDs are better tolerated. f Choose later generation SU to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia

Recommendation: we recommend using metformin alone or in combination with other drugs as first line therapy in patients with T2DM and high risk of CVD (Grade A)

One of the earliest CVOTs in T2DM patients, UKPDS 34, determined whether a policy of reducing hyperglycaemia to near-normal levels will reduce the risk of development or progression of diabetes-related complications. Metformin was among the intensive control group, which demonstrated statistically significant reductions in the risk of MI and CV death. This rendered metformin a drug of choice in the view of previously available insulin and sulphonylurea that had risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain. With a long-standing experience and global use of metformin, the Food and Drug Administration removed boxed warnings contraindicating its use in patients with HF in 2006, and liberalized contraindications for those with kidney disease in 2016.

### Microvascular and cardiovascular outcomes according to renal function in patients treated with once-weekly exenatide: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^57faaf08]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of once-weekly exenatide (EQW) on microvascular and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes by baseline renal function in the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL).

Research Design and Methods

Least squares mean difference (LSMD) in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline between the EQW and placebo groups was calculated for 13,844 participants. Cox regression models were used to estimate effects by group on incident macroalbuminuria, retinopathy, and major adverse CV events (MACE). Interval-censored time-to-event models estimated effects on renal composite 1 (40% eGFR decline, renal replacement, or renal death) and renal composite 2 (composite 1 variables plus macroalbuminuria).

Results

EQW did not change eGFR significantly (LSMD 0.21 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [95% CI -0.27 to 0.70]). Macroalbuminuria occurred in 2.2% of patients in the EQW group and in 2.5% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87 [95% CI 0.70–1.07]). Neither renal composite was reduced with EQW in unadjusted analyses, but renal composite 2 was reduced after adjustment (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.74–0.98]). Retinopathy rates did not differ by treatment group or in the HbA 1c -lowering or prior retinopathy subgroups. CV outcomes in those with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 did not differ by group. Those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 had nominal risk reductions for MACE, all-cause mortality, and CV death, but interactions by renal function group were significant for only stroke (HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.58–0.93]; P for interaction = 0.035) and CV death (HR 1.08 [95% CI 0.85–1.38]; P for interaction = 0.031).

Conclusions

EQW had no impact on unadjusted retinopathy or renal outcomes. CV risk was modestly reduced only in those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in analyses unadjusted for multiplicity.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^e48ac76a]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: we recommend starting GLP1-receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) or SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) as a second/third line therapy in patients with T2DM and who are at high risk for CVD or renal impairment (Grade A)

Patients at high risk of CVD or those with CKD and have eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 are recommended to choose SGLT2i with proven primary renal and CV benefits as second line therapy.

Firstly, in case of T2DM patients with obesity and high risk of CVD, a GLP1-RA might be a logical as a second line therapy. Argument might arise on the availability of evidence for GLP1-RA in primary prevention, as CV benefits in LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, and HARMONY trials were seen in patients with established ASCVD. However, data from the REWIND trial (Researching Cardiovascular Events with a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes) that assessed the CVOT of dulaglutide in high risk patients showed statistically significant reduction in primary CV outcome. the primary composite outcome occurred in 594 (12.0%) participants at an incidence rate of 2.4 per 100 person-years in the dulaglutide group and in 663 (13.4%) participants at an incidence rate of 2.7 per 100 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.79–0.99; p = 0.026). It is essential to mention that benefits were mainly driven by reduction in stroke, however, the rest of the results were showing tendency to benefits however they were not statistically significant. The composite primary outcome HRs is 0.91 (95% CI 0.78–1.06; p = 0.21) for cardiovascular death, 0.96 (0.79–1.16; p = 0.65) for non-fatal myocardial infarction, and 0.76 (0.61–0.95; p = 0.017) for non-fatal stroke. In the sub analysis obese patients (BMI > 32) benefited more than those with BMI < 32.

### Personalizing glucose-lowering therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [^152ce708]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Twelve drug categories are marketed in the United States to lower blood glucose concentrations in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). After metformin, there is disagreement about the optimal next choice for combination therapy. Guidelines advise balancing potency, risks, benefits, and costs. For T2DM and cardiovascular disease (CVD), emerging evidence suggests that certain options may have specific advantages. Specific members of the thiazolidinedione, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist classes have been associated with significant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events, generally in those with established CVD. A personalized approach should consider these evidence-based therapies to optimize clinical outcomes.

### Indirect comparison of glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists regarding cardiovascular safety and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: network meta-analysis [^7faa2585]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus is a major health condition that affects more than 382 million adults worldwide, and this number is expected to reach 592 million by 2035. Patients with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular (CV) complications, which can be fatal. Cardioprotective effects of some antidiabetic drugs, along with the improvement in the provided care, has led to the reduction in the rate of CV events over the years. However, the rate of the CV events remains significantly higher in diabetic patients than in the general population.

Glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1RA) based therapies have been in use since 2005 and GLP1RAs have been extensively studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Most of the GLP1RAs, including lixisenatide (short-acting) and dulaglutide (long-acting), are administered as a subcutaneous injection either once daily or weekly. Recently, the first oral formulation of a GLP1RA, daily oral semaglutide, was approved by the US food and drug administration (FDA). GLP1RAs are classified based on their structure as either exendin-4 based (e.g. lixisenatide and exenatide) or human GLP-1 analogue (e.g. liraglutide, dulaglutide, semaglutide and albiglutide). GLP1RAs act by increasing insulin secretion, decreasing glucagon secretion, and improving satiety. They have also been shown to have efficacy in reducing body weight and have potential antiatherothrombotic effects.

In 2008, the US FDA mandated that all novel antidiabetic drugs must be evaluated by manufacturers to assess their CV safety profile. Since then, several GLP1RA cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have been conducted. To date, there are a total of seven GLP1RA CVOTs published, and one trial is ongoing. The trials have shown that GLP1RAs have varying degrees of CV safety and recent meta-analyses have shown that this class has a promising CV safety profile. However, it is still not clear which GLP1RA is preferred for CV safety. Furthermore, there is a lack of any head-to-head comparative trials among GLP1RAs. Therefore, this study was conducted to indirectly compare the CV safety and mortality effects among different GLP1RAs in patients with T2DM using network meta-analysis (NMA).

Potential CV Effects of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists

Potential mechanisms of CV disease protection by GLP-1 in humans have been proposed but not established. One possibility is glycemic control, given the positive correlation between HbA 1C and CV events. Another possibility is the association of GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment with weight stability or reduction. Although the effects of weight gain in treated patients with type 2 diabetes have not been thoroughly investigated, an observational study showed that CV disease risk in patients with type 2 diabetes increased with increasing BMI. Although the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes are overweight and at greater risk of CV disease than are patients without type 2 diabetes, most conventional diabetes medications are weight neutral or induce weight gain.

Improving glycemic control, supporting weight loss, and minimizing hypoglycemia are the clinical priorities in the management of most patients with type 2 diabetes. During the last decade, exenatide BID therapy has been consistently associated with improvements in glycemic control coupled with weight loss in clinical and observational studies of patients with type 2 diabetes. Importantly, exenatide therapy does not increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia when used in the absence of agents commonly associated with hypoglycemia, primarily SFU and insulin. In several small studies, insulin-induced hypoglycemia was associated with lengthened QT intervals, which may increase the risk of arrhythmia. It is possible that the low risk of hypoglycemia with GLP-1 receptor agonist treatments may contribute to a lower risk of CV events.
