## Question

What factors lead to avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what factors lead to avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the core ARFID presentations and whether they co-occur. Then, I should verify genetic and neurobiological vulnerabilities. Next, I will examine medical and gastrointestinal precipitants and maintaining factors, including medication effects. After that, I need to assess developmental and skill acquisition disruptions. Then, I will review psychological, neurodevelopmental, and executive functioning contributions. Next, I should consider environmental, cultural, and healthcare system influences. Finally, I will synthesize an etiological model and address diagnostic overlap with pediatric feeding disorder (PFD), along with key assessment implications [^111QiL4x] [^1136v8Rg].

> Let me first confirm the foundational framework of ARFID presentations. ARFID consistently manifests via three primary motivational pathways: sensory-based avoidance, low appetite/lack of interest in eating, and fear of aversive consequences like choking or vomiting, and I should note these dimensions are not mutually exclusive and often co-occur within the same individual, which has implications for tailoring interventions and for differential diagnosis with other restrictive eating disorders, so I need to keep that heterogeneity in mind during synthesis [^111QiL4x] [^1136v8Rg].

> Wait, let me verify genetic and biological vulnerabilities before attributing causality to environment alone. High-quality twin data indicate substantial heritability of ARFID phenotypes around 79%, suggesting strong biological liability with nonshared environment accounting for the remainder, and this magnitude is comparable to other eating and neurodevelopmental disorders; mechanistically, proposed neurobiological contributions map onto sensory processing, homeostatic appetite regulation, and negative valence systems that may differentially drive the sensory, interest/appetite, and fear-based pathways, respectively; additionally, I should consider emerging evidence for microbiota–gut–brain axis involvement as a plausible modulatory pathway influencing appetite, interoception, and anxiety relevant to ARFID presentations [^111Tpnj3] [^115b3iTa] [^111QiL4x] [^111hyfsq].

> Hold on, I should review medical and physical health precipitants and their bidirectional relationship with restrictive eating before concluding they are merely comorbid. Congenital or critical care conditions can disrupt early feeding skill acquisition and condition aversive responses to oral intake; in GI and neurogastroenterology contexts, fear of GI symptoms is a dominant motivation for avoidance, with studies showing very high proportions endorsing GI-symptom fear, and ARFID-like restriction is prevalent across achalasia, eosinophilic esophagitis, celiac disease, and IBD; the directionality appears bidirectional, with some patients developing ARFID before GI consultation and others after the onset of GI disease, so I need to be cautious in inferring causality; moreover, I should not overlook iatrogenic factors such as stimulant-treated ADHD where appetite suppression can exacerbate restrictive intake and growth compromise, indicating that medication review is essential in ARFID evaluations [^1138RSdN] [^112vZ1LD] [^1118VwYL] [^115LZFfp] [^114iaXGM] [^116KdXUX] [^113krAge].

> I need to check developmental and skill acquisition factors next, because timing and learned associations can pivot a feeding problem into ARFID. Feeding skill impairments that make eating unsafe or painful, like aspiration risk or unmanaged reflux, can precipitate refusal and nutritional dysfunction; difficulties with transitions from liquids to solids or purees to table foods, especially in children with motor and cognitive delays, can widen the gap between nutritional needs and feeding ability; critically, repeated pairing of pain, choking, vomiting, or invasive medical procedures with mealtimes can create durable conditioned food aversions that persist even after the medical issue remits, thereby shifting the clinical picture from PFD toward ARFID and necessitating psychological intervention [^1173Yggr] [^1138RSdN].

> Next, I should review psychological and neurodevelopmental contributions to refine phenotypic mapping. Sensory processing differences correlate specifically with the sensory sensitivity ARFID dimension, supporting construct validity for subtyping, and anxiety maps more tightly onto the fear-of-aversive-consequences dimension, while disgust sensitivity may uniquely sustain selective eating given its resistance to extinction compared to fear; I should also confirm the elevated co-occurrence with autism spectrum disorder, which is clinically observed and linked to sensory features and rigidity, and consider an executive functioning lens, where lower cognitive flexibility, working memory differences, and inhibitory control challenges may maintain rigid food rules and limit generalization across foods [^1136v8Rg] [^1139nQFz] [^1177dyfH] [^111yedoF].

> I will now examine environmental and experiential drivers, because context often acts as both a precipitant and a maintainer. Negative learning experiences such as choking, severe vomiting, allergic reactions, repeated force-feeding, or stressful mealtimes commonly seed fear-based or disgust-mediated avoidance, and prolonged hospitalizations can entrench these patterns; cultural context modulates both presentation and detection, with Western settings often normalizing individual preferences (potentially masking sensory-based ARFID), while collectivist meal practices can amplify social impairment and delay recognition, and broader social structural factors like food insecurity and limited healthcare access can tilt presentations toward low-appetite phenotypes and entrench chronicity, so I should factor these into case formulation and screening choices [^1138RSdN] [^1125QA1x] [^1137GcUK].

> But wait, what if these factors interact differently across development and comorbidity profiles; let me synthesize a working etiological model to check for coherence. ARFID likely arises from the interaction of a strong genetic/biological substrate shaping sensory, appetite, and threat systems; precipitating medical or traumatic feeding events that condition avoidance; developmental stage that determines whether feeding skill deficits or cognitive-affective factors dominate; and maintaining processes including ongoing GI symptoms, sensory hypersensitivity, anxiety or disgust, and executive rigidity, often in the context of comorbid ASD, ADHD, or GI disorders; this synthesis aligns with observed heterogeneity and supports individualized, mechanism-targeted interventions across the lifespan [^111Tpnj3] [^111QiL4x] [^1149ws4y].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic complexity with Pediatric Feeding Disorder (PFD), because failing to disentangle them risks misattribution. PFD can occur in isolation when a medical condition fully accounts for feeding dysfunction, but transitions to ARFID when conditioned aversion persists beyond medical resolution, and co-occurrence is possible when multiple etiological pathways are active; importantly, DSM-5 logic requires that ARFID not be better explained by a medical condition, underscoring the need for multidisciplinary evaluation to determine whether ongoing restriction reflects current medical constraints, residual conditioned avoidance, or both, and to guide whether PFD, ARFID, or both diagnoses are warranted [^1173Yggr] [^111An8t4] [^114oR9no] [^113Q3w7L].

ARFID has a **multifactorial etiology** spanning genetic, neurobiological, psychological, and environmental domains [^113fnhSK]. The strongest evidence supports **high heritability** (≈79%) [^111Tpnj3], with additional roles for sensory sensitivity [^111QiL4x], anxiety [^1118VwYL], neurodevelopmental conditions (notably autism) [^1177dyfH] [^111yedoF], gastrointestinal symptoms [^112vZ1LD], and learned aversions from negative feeding experiences [^1138RSdN] [^111mUkLj]. These factors interact to produce the **three core ARFID profiles**: sensory-based avoidance, fear of aversive consequences, and lack of interest in eating [^1136v8Rg] [^111QiL4x].

---

## Genetic and neurobiological factors

- **Genetic predisposition**: Twin data show high heritability (~79%) [^111Tpnj3], indicating strong genetic liability with additional nonshared environmental effects [^115tDWHW].

- **Neurobiological mechanisms**: A three-dimensional model [^111QiL4x] implicates sensory processing, homeostatic appetite, and negative valence (threat) systems [^111hyfsq], aligning with the sensory, fear, and low-interest profiles.

- **Neurodevelopmental disorders**: Autism and ADHD are common in ARFID [^1177dyfH], likely via sensory sensitivity, rigidity, and executive functioning differences [^111yedoF].

---

## Psychological factors

- **Anxiety and fear**: Anxiety, especially fear of choking, vomiting, or GI distress [^112vZ1LD] [^1118VwYL], is a key driver of avoidance and restriction.

- **Disgust sensitivity**: Heightened disgust responses to sensory properties of food contribute to selective eating and are resistant to extinction [^1139nQFz].

- **Learned aversions**: Negative feeding experiences (e.g. choking, vomiting) [^1138RSdN] can condition persistent avoidance [^111mUkLj].

---

## Environmental and social factors

- **Family dynamics**: Parental anxiety, overprotection [^1138RSdN], and negative mealtime interactions can reinforce avoidance and restriction [^113fnhSK].

- **Cultural influences**: Cultural norms and food practices [^1137GcUK] shape the types of foods avoided and the social meaning of eating, influencing ARFID expression [^1125QA1x].

- **Medical conditions**: GI disorders (e.g. GERD, IBS, gastroparesis) [^112vZ1LD] and food allergies [^1138RSdN] can trigger or maintain restriction via fear of symptoms or required dietary changes [^114iaXGM].

---

## Interaction of factors

ARFID presentations reflect the **interaction** among sensory sensitivity, fear of aversive consequences, and lack of interest in eating [^111QiL4x]. Genetic and neurobiological predispositions [^111Tpnj3] combine with environmental exposures to produce sensory-based avoidance. Anxiety and learned aversions from negative experiences interact with medical conditions [^112vZ1LD] to drive fear-based restriction. Neurobiological differences in appetite regulation [^111hyfsq] intersect with psychological factors (e.g. low motivation) and environmental influences (e.g. limited food exposure) to result in a lack of interest in eating.

ARFID arises from **interacting genetic, neurobiological, psychological, and environmental factors** [^113fnhSK]. High heritability [^111Tpnj3], sensory processing differences [^111QiL4x], anxiety, learned aversions, family dynamics, cultural context [^1137GcUK], and medical conditions [^114iaXGM] collectively contribute to its heterogeneous presentations.

### A US-based consensus on diagnostic overlap and distinction for pediatric feeding disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder [^1138RSdN]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Infants and young children with PFD at risk for developing ARFID most often present with medical and developmental conditions that prohibit, disrupt, or interrupt the developmental process of becoming an independent eater. Dysfunction may be present at birth, such as in children with congenital heart disease who require prolonged hospitalization and critical care interventions that delay and subvert the acquisition of feeding skills. In other cases, feeding skill concerns follow difficulty making a major developmental shift — such as transitioning from liquids to solids or moving from pureed to table foods — particularly among children with severe motor and cognitive delays whose nutritional needs may eventually exceed their feeding skill.

ARFID in isolation most typically occurs in older children, adolescents, or adults with age‐appropriate, intact feeding skills, and food avoidance or restrictions may be caused by selective and neophobic eating, poor appetite or a lack of hedonic motivation to eat, or fear of aversive consequences of eating like choking and vomiting or allergic reaction.

The panel agreed that both pathways in ARFID involve an individual developing a negative association with or belief about food that drives food avoidance/restriction. The etiology likely depends on the individual's learning history, medical and psychiatric history, the cognitive features associated, and the age of onset.

### Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and autism spectrum disorder: Clinical implications for assessment and management [^1177dyfH]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

We examined clinical and neurodevelopmental presentations of children with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) to inform clinical assessment and management.

Five hundred and thirty-six patients (mean age 6 years 10 months, SD 3 years 5 months, range 10 months-20 years; 401 males, 135 females) seen by the tertiary multidisciplinary feeding service at the Evelina London Children's Hospital between January 2013 and June 2019 were included in this case-control study. These children experienced significant feeding difficulties impacting nutrition, development, and psychosocial functioning, requiring tertiary specialized input. Data on ARFID diagnosis, demographics, comorbidity, and nutrition was extracted from electronic patient records.

Forty-nine percent of children met ARFID criteria. The remaining participants had other difficulties including feeding, medical, and/or neurodevelopmental conditions. ARFID is more prevalent among younger patients (4–9 years) and in children with comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Younger age, comorbid ASD, and male sex significantly predicted ARFID. Diet range and male sex significantly predicted nutritional inadequacy, while comorbid ASD did not. A trend was seen between younger age and nutritional inadequacy.

Young children with ARFID should raise suspicion for ASD. Although significant nutritional deficiencies are common in children with comorbid ARFID and ASD, they are correctable with nutritional supplementation. Specialty perspective potentially limits generalizability of findings to community feeding services.

### Prevalence and characteristics of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder in adult neurogastroenterology patients [^112vZ1LD]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a feeding and eating disorder characterized by avoidant or restrictive eating not primarily motivated by body shape or weight concerns. We aimed to determine the frequency of ARFID symptoms and study its characteristics and associated gastrointestinal symptoms.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of charts from 410 consecutive referrals (ages 18–90; 73.0% female) to a tertiary care center for neurogastroenterology examination from January through December 2016. Blinded coders (n = 4) applied Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition criteria for ARFID, achieving substantial diagnostic agreement (κ = 0.66).

- **Results**: Twenty-six cases (6.3%) met the full criteria for ARFID, and 71 cases (17.3%) had clinically significant avoidant or restrictive eating behaviors with insufficient information for a definitive diagnosis of ARFID. Of patients with ARFID symptoms (n = 97), 90 patients (92.8%) cited fear of gastrointestinal symptoms as motivation for their avoidant or restrictive eating. A series of binary logistic regressions showed that the likelihood of having ARFID symptoms increased significantly in patients with eating- or weight-related complaints (odds ratio [OR], 5.09; 95% CI, 2.54–10.21); with dyspepsia, nausea, or vomiting (OR, 3.59; 95% CI, 2.04–6.32); with abdominal pain (OR, 4.72; 95% CI, 1.87–11.81); or with lower GI diagnoses (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.34–4.32).

- **Question**: To what extent do genetic and environmental factors contribute to the liability to avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)?

- **Findings**: In this nationwide Swedish twin study including 16,951 twin pairs aged 6 to 12 years, using parent-reported and national health register data, a composite score to identify the ARFID phenotype was developed. The heritability of ARFID was high (79%), and nonshared environmental factors played a smaller but significant role (21%).

- **Meaning**: In this study, the heritability of ARFID was comparable with the heritability of other eating disorders and similar to the heritability of neurodevelopmental disorders.

### The factor structure and validity of a diagnostic interview for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder in a sample of children, adolescents, and young adults [^1136v8Rg]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Evidence for the construct and criterion validity of the dimensional symptom subscales was partially supported. Specifically, participants with a diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and subthreshold ARFID experienced higher scores on all three subscales: concern about aversive consequences, low appetite/low interest, and sensory sensitivity, relative to control participants. These findings suggest that these subscales are measuring clinically relevant symptoms of ARFID and may be sensitive to subthreshold as well as full presentations, though further research is needed in a larger sample.

- **Construct validity**: The construct validity of each subscale was partially supported by correlations with self-report measures of theoretically associated constructs of interest. Specifically, a self-report of anxiety significantly correlated with the concern about aversive consequences subscale, but not with the low appetite/low interest or sensory sensitivity subscale. Similarly, self-reports of sensory threshold correlated with only the sensory sensitivity subscale of the PARDI, and not with the other two subscales. Further, self-reports of satiety responsiveness and enjoyment of food significantly correlated in the expected direction with the low appetite/low-interest subscale of the PARDI. However, self-reports of satiety responsiveness and eating speed also significantly correlated with the concern about aversive consequences subscale of the PARDI to a lesser degree. It is possible that the concern about aversive consequences subscale of the PARDI may be sensitive to increased monitoring of bodily responses.

### Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder: A three-dimensional model of neurobiology with implications for etiology and treatment [^111QiL4x]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of review is to define avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) as specified by DSM-5, which identifies it as a failure to meet nutritional needs leading to low weight, nutritional deficiency, dependence on supplemental feedings, and/or psychosocial impairment. We summarize what is known about ARFID and introduce a three-dimensional model to inform research.

Recent findings indicate that the prevalence, risk factors, and maintaining mechanisms of ARFID are not yet known; thus, prevailing treatment approaches are primarily based on clinical experience rather than data. Additionally, most ARFID research has focused on children rather than adolescents or adults. We hypothesize a three-dimensional model wherein neurobiological abnormalities in sensory perception, homeostatic appetite, and negative valence systems underlie the three primary ARFID presentations of sensory sensitivity, lack of interest in eating, and fear of aversive consequences, respectively. Now that ARFID has been defined, studies investigating its risk factors, prevalence, and pathophysiology are needed. Our model suggests testable hypotheses about etiology and highlights cognitive-behavioral therapy as one possible treatment.

### Conceptualizing the role of disgust in avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder: Implications for the etiology and treatment of selective eating [^1139nQFz]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Selective eating is a common presenting problem in Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). Understanding the etiology of selective eating will lead to the creation of more effective treatments for this problem. Recent reports have linked disgust sensitivity to picky eating, yet the field has not fully conceptualized the role that disgust might play in ARFID. Disgust has long been tied to the formation of taste aversions and is considered at its core to be a food-related emotion.

A brief review of the literature on disgust reveals that disgust has a unique psychophysiological profile compared to other emotions, like anxiety, and is resistant to extinction procedures. If disgust is implicated in the etiology of selective eating, its presence would significantly impact treatment approaches.

- **Overview of research on disgust and eating**: This article provides an overview of the research on disgust and eating, a clinical example of the treatment challenges that disgust may pose, and an overview of the unique clinical features of disgust as they apply to psychopathology.

- **Research questions and hypotheses**: Several research questions related to disgust and selective eating are posed, and initial hypotheses for pursuing this line of inquiry are discussed.

Finally, the possible implications of this line of research for treatment are considered.

### Latent trajectories of change in dietary restriction during treatment in avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and anorexia nervosa [^116Vy5Lt]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and anorexia nervosa (AN) are both low‐weight restrictive eating disorders, but dietary restriction in ARFID is not motivated by body image. To understand how restriction differs between diagnoses, we examined trajectories of change in restriction during and after treatment.

Three subgroups emerged: "good response", "good response, rebounding", and "gradual response, low symptoms". These subgroups did not differentiate diagnoses, supporting the transdiagnostic consideration of restriction across these diagnoses.

### The association of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and neurogastroenterology disorders (including disorders of gut-brain interaction [DGBI]): A scoping review [^115LZFfp]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

- **Studies in pediatric populations**: To our knowledge, there was no study evaluating the prevalence of DGBI in the pediatric ARFID population. However, in a study previously cited in Section 3.1.1, 60% of pediatric neurogastroenterology patients with ARFID symptoms had chronic constipation, 23% had functional abdominal pain, 10% had GERD, 7% had IBS, and 3% had gastroparesis. In a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with ARFID in an eating disorder partial hospitalization program, it was found that medical comorbidities like gastroesophageal reflux, gastroparesis, and abdominal pain were most commonly reported. These symptoms were reported in 63.6% of patients with a low appetite presentation, 47.4% of patients with appetite disturbance and food selectivity, 20% of patients with food selectivity, and 18.75% of patients with fear of aversive consequences.

- **Direction of the association between ARFID and GI symptom occurrence**: Regarding the timeline of eating difficulties in relation to GI symptoms, one study retrospectively reviewed medical charts of patients with an eating disorder diagnosis and found that 74.2% of them had a pre-existing eating disorder (including ARFID) before their GI consult, while 23.8% developed an eating disorder afterward. Unfortunately, this study did not specify how many of the ARFID patients received their diagnosis before or after their GI consult. Conversely, in another study where gastroparesis patients were asked about their perception of the timeline between gastroparesis and ARFID symptoms, 17.1% reported experiencing eating difficulties before the onset of gastroparesis.

### A US-based consensus on diagnostic overlap and distinction for pediatric feeding disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder [^1133Nwsx]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

As diagnoses covering dysfunctional feeding and eating in pediatrics, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and pediatric feeding disorder (PFD) contain inherent areas of overlap in their diagnostic criteria. Areas of overlap include criteria regarding nutritional consequences associated with feeding/eating dysfunction and shared emphasis on possible psychosocial impairment associated with restricted food intake. Complicating the differential diagnosis process is a lack of guidance regarding when the two conditions occur independently, co-qualify, and/or transition into the other. Feeding Matters' Research Initiatives Task Force planned and hosted a PFD-ARFID consensus meeting, with the aim of reaching a consensus regarding diagnostic clarity on PFD and ARFID.

- **Method**: Criteria for participation focused on US residents who either: (a) served as an author on the ARFID workgroup or PFD consensus papers, or (b) provided community representation via board or committee roles. The consensus process followed three stages: prework, the meeting, and post-work/writing. Twelve participants were present for the meeting, with 14 involved in pre- and post-work/writing.

- **Results**: The final panel included four psychologists representing the ARFID community and seven multidisciplinary members representing PFD's four domains (medical, nutrition, skill, and psychosocial) plus a Zero-to-Three community representative and two representatives from Feeding Matters. Results yielded 10 consensus statements and visuals to support the consensus statements.

### Characteristics of outpatients diagnosed with the selective/neophobic presentation of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder [^116ektK2]. International Journal of Eating Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The study aims to provide an initial descriptive analysis of the psychopathology associated with the primary selective/neophobic symptom presentation of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) in an outpatient setting. While ARFID has been recognized since the publication of DSM-5 in 2013, research on patients seeking treatment with formal ARFID diagnoses remains sparse. Previous research is mostly limited to tertiary eating disorder-focused treatment settings where patients typically present with weight loss or malnutrition. In such settings, the selective/neophobic symptom presentation is rare compared to other primary eating restrictions. This study explores the prevalence of core ARFID symptoms and clinical differences among patients who meet criteria based on weight/nutritional symptoms versus those based solely on psychosocial impairment.

- **Method**: The study conducted a chart review of 22 consecutive outpatients diagnosed with ARFID due to selective/neophobic eating. It describes symptoms, impairments, illness trajectories, and demographic features. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients meeting ARFID criteria because of weight loss/nutritional problems were compared to those meeting criteria for psychosocial impairment only.

- **Results**: Patients were predominantly male (81.8%) and school-aged (4–11 years). A significant 81.8% had no weight/nutritional symptoms documented by a medical provider, yet all met criteria for significant psychosocial impairment. Notably, there were few differences between patients who met weight loss/nutritional criteria and those who did not, with differences mainly in age and the presence of appetite disturbances.

### Rethinking screening, and considering cross-cultural similarities and differences in the clinical presentation of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID): A commentary building upon Presseller et al. (2024) [^1125QA1x]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Cultural variations in food norms and dietary practices may influence both the recognition and treatment of ARFID. In Western countries, where individual food preferences may be more accepted, ARFID is increasingly diagnosed based on sensory aversions and avoidance behaviors. In collectivist cultures, where shared meals are the norm, individuals with ARFID may develop additional social anxieties or receive alternative labels, such as "fussy eating", delaying proper diagnosis.

At the same time, ARFID-related research on prevalence and phenomenology is overrepresented in high-income countries, and most prevalence estimates come from clinical samples, not population-based studies. Also, the NIAS' focus on sensory aversion may misfire in countries where ARFID presents as fear of choking (e.g. East Asia) or low appetite (e.g. food-scarce regions).

### Rethinking screening, and considering cross-cultural similarities and differences in the clinical presentation of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID): A commentary building upon Presseller et al. (2024) [^1137GcUK]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

ARFID shares common clinical characteristics across cultures. The core symptoms of the disorder — significant dietary restriction, nutritional deficiencies, and psychosocial impairment — are observed worldwide. Studies indicate that ARFID frequently coexists with anxiety disorders and sensory processing issues, regardless of cultural context. This suggests a neurobiological underpinning to the disorder that is not confined to specific societies. Across cultures, ARFID is characterized by food avoidance due to sensory sensitivities, lack of interest in eating, or fear of aversive consequences such as choking. These motivations appear to be universal, as studies from various countries, including the United States, Canada, and Japan, describe similar patterns. The difficulty in distinguishing ARFID from other restrictive eating disorders, as noted in the Presseller et al. study, is also a global issue.

Despite these similarities, ARFID's clinical presentation and prevalence seem to vary across cultures due to sociocultural factors, such as shared values, norms, and practices that script feeding and dietary practices and priorities. On the other hand, social structural factors like poverty, food insecurity, and weak healthcare delivery systems can also influence ARFID's presentation. Regarding cultural factors, anecdotal evidence indicates that the types of foods avoided in ARFID differ based on dietary staples and cultural eating habits. Furthermore, it can be generally assumed that food culture plays a significant role in shaping the present.

(2024) [^113ep6wU]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

The authors further explored the overlap between ARFID symptoms, as measured by the NIAS, and general eating disorder pathology, as assessed by the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE‐Q). Their analysis revealed small to moderate correlations between all subscales of the NIAS and the EDE‐Q, indicating a degree of shared variance between ARFID‐related eating behaviors and broader eating disorder symptomatology. These correlations suggest that individuals with eating disorders other than ARFID may exhibit restrictive eating patterns, low appetite, or fears of aversive consequences related to food intake, potentially complicating the diagnostic process.

### Etiology of the broad avoidant restrictive food intake disorder phenotype in Swedish twins aged 6 to 12 years [^115tDWHW]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Identification of the ARFID Phenotype

Of the 33,902 included children, 17,151 (50.6%) were male. We identified 801 children (2.4%) who met criteria for case definition 1 (ARFID criterion A). After excluding children with parent-reported fear of weight gain, 682 children were classified as having the ARFID phenotype (case definition 2), corresponding to a population prevalence of 2.0% (267 of 682 [39.1%] female). Of these, 458 (67.2%) met DSM-5 ARFID criterion A1 (weight loss or failure to gain weight/grow) and 345 (50.6%) met DSM-5 ARFID criterion A4 (interference with psychosocial functioning). Only a small minority met DSM-5 ARFID criterion A2 (nutritional deficiency; 4 [0.6%]) or DSM-5 ARFID criterion A3 (dependence on supplements/enteral nutrition; 58 [8.5%]).

To control for medical conditions that could potentially explain the eating disturbance, we further excluded 130 children who met ARFID criteria A and C (case definition 3; 552 of 33,902 [1.6%]), and to control for the high heritability of autism, we excluded 128 children with autism from case definition 2 (case definition 4; 554 of 33,902 [1.6%]).

### The association of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and neurogastroenterology disorders (including disorders of gut-brain interaction [DGBI]): A scoping review [^111gf5Vb]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with neurogastroenterology disorders, such as disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) and gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, often adopt restrictive diets to manage symptoms. Without professional guidance, these patients may risk developing avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), potentially affecting their physical and mental health.

This scoping review aimed to explore the prevalence of ARFID in patients with neurogastroenterology disorders and vice versa, examine the direction of their association, identify potential risk factors, and evaluate available treatments. Following PRISMA‐ScR guidelines, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane. Abstracts were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers.

Eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria. The prevalence of ARFID symptoms in neurogastroenterology patients ranged from 10% to 80%, while the prevalence of neurogastroenterology disorders and related GI symptoms in ARFID patients ranged from 7% to 60%. Findings on the direction of the association between eating difficulties and GI symptom occurrence were conflicting. Patients with ARFID-neurogastroenterology disorder overlap were more likely to be female, have a lower BMI, higher anxiety and depression levels, and poorer quality of life. Two small studies evaluating treatment for this overlap suggested promising effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

This review highlights heterogeneity in study designs and questions the suitability of ARFID assessment tools in this context.

### Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder: An illustrative case example [^116cDevG]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a new diagnostic category in DSM-5. Although it replaces the Feeding Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood, ARFID is not restricted to childhood presentations. ARFID is a diagnosis relevant to children, adolescents, and adults, in line with the broader aim of revising and updating criteria to better reflect lifespan issues and clinical expression across all ages.

This case example of a 13-year-old boy with ARFID illustrates key issues in diagnosis and treatment planning. While the issues discussed are not exhaustive, they serve as a guide for central diagnostic and treatment issues to be considered by clinicians. It is anticipated that the inclusion of specific criteria for ARFID within the Feeding and Eating Disorders category in DSM-5 will stimulate research into its typology, prevalence, and incidence in different populations, and facilitate the development of effective, evidence-based interventions for this patient group.

### A new cognitive behavior therapy for adolescents with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder in a day treatment setting: A clinical case series [^112nH2yi]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2019). High credibility.

A new cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been developed for adolescents with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), a condition newly recognized in the DSM‐5 Feeding and Eating Disorders section. Despite limited research on treatment, this 4‐week, exposure-based CBT program integrates inhibitory learning principles and was tested in a study to assess its effectiveness.

A nonconcurrent multiple baseline design was used involving a clinical case series of eleven patients aged 10 to 18 years. After an initial baseline assessment, the adolescents underwent a 4‐week CBT program. Key measurements, including the DSM‐5 ARFID diagnosis, food neophobia, and patient metrics like body weight and length, were recorded at baseline (T1), at the conclusion of the 4‐week treatment (T2), and at a 3-month follow-up (T3). Additional assessments included a food selectivity test, a 1‐week food diary, and behavioral measures on food intake, both at baseline and follow-up. Continuous records of the believability of dysfunctional cognitions, anxiety, and food acceptance were maintained throughout the treatment duration.

At the 3-month follow-up, 10 out of 11 patients were in remission, demonstrating healthy body weight and age-appropriate nutritional intake, with food neophobia scores reducing to a nonclinical range for most patients. Furthermore, there was a notable decrease in the belief in dysfunctional cognition and anxiety levels during the treatment.

This new exposure-based CBT for adolescents with ARFID shows promise. The results could significantly inform clinical practice and encourage further development of effective treatment modalities.

### Etiology of the broad avoidant restrictive food intake disorder phenotype in Swedish twins aged 6 to 12 years [^116wuuVi]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). Low credibility.

This study shows that, given the similar prevalence figures and sex distribution, existing register-based epidemiological data may be used to approximate ARFID, and that the resulting broad ARFID phenotype is highly heritable, with significant contributions from nonshared environmental factors. It is distinguishable from other eating disorders characterized by fear of weight gain and older average age of onset. The high heritability of the ARFID phenotype provides strong support for future twin and molecular genetic studies of ARFID.

### Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder plus eating disorder comorbidity: Are two diagnoses better than one [^113rg6Jz]? The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Zickgraf and colleagues propose an elegant revised framework for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) that recognizes it as a diagnosis based on the presence of specific eating behaviors. Importantly, this framework allows for ARFID to be diagnosed alongside other medical and psychiatric conditions, including other eating disorders. While likely to have good ecological validity, this radical proposal challenges the general conceptualization of ARFID as the eating disorder in which weight and shape concerns are not present.

Here, we examine whether two diagnoses are indeed better than one, noting the challenges observed in clinical and research practice. We offer an alternative hybrid categorical-dimensional framework for considering ARFID and co-occurring eating disorder symptoms. We also encourage a set of next steps for research in this nosological arena.

### Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder: First do no harm [^111mUkLj]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

This opinion piece offers some considerations, both medical and psychological, for the use of nasogastric tube (NGT) feedings in the treatment of avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) in children and adolescents. Although there is empirical support for the use of NGT feedings in the treatment of anorexia nervosa, this evidence base does not exist for the treatment of ARFID. As such, there is a need to delineate pragmatic considerations in the use of this procedure.

Issues of medical necessity notwithstanding, we advise that the use of this procedure be considered more cautiously due to the oral sensitivities inherent in many individuals with ARFID and the potential psychological consequences. These sensitivities may make the experience of NGT feedings particularly aversive, with the potential of creating iatrogenic conditioned food aversions.

This article encourages clinicians to give careful thought and attention when considering NGT feedings in children and adolescents with ARFID.

### A US-based consensus on diagnostic overlap and distinction for pediatric feeding disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder [^1149ws4y]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). High credibility.

In the pediatric feeding community, the introduction of pediatric feeding disorder (PFD) emphasized the benefit of a multidisciplinary lens for assessing feeding concerns in pediatric populations. This includes the recognition that the feeding skill and medical domains represent critical etiological factors to consider when evaluating and treating infants and young children who restrict their food intake. PFD was not intended to bifurcate the field or create diagnostic confusion in the broader clinical and research communities; however, the impetus for this consensus highlights likely challenges in the differential diagnosis process now that both conditions are in the diagnostic ecosystem.

Prevalence estimates suggest that both PFD and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) are common. PFD impacts one in 37 children under the age of 5, and ARFID affects 0.3%–15.5% of children and adolescents. This suggests healthcare providers will be increasingly called upon to support families as they navigate the complexities of the assessment and treatment landscape.

Continued efforts to enhance our understanding of PFD and ARFID should also coincide with building knowledge, capacity, and resources to effectively manage these conditions. This must come with education that those with PFD and ARFID may also present as normal and/or overweight, and one cannot rely on growth charts alone as a reflection of successful feeding. Awareness is also needed to promote the detection of significant detrimental outcomes associated with both conditions, including impaired cognitive and emotional development.

### Prevalence, phenotype, and correlates of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder symptoms in the gulf cooperation council: An underserved region [^117TH1Qr]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is characterized by restrictive eating patterns associated with significant physical and/or psychosocial consequences. ARFID is driven by three primary profiles, namely:

- **Avoidance based on sensory characteristics**: This pertains to food's taste, smell, color, and texture.
- **Lack of interest in food or eating**: This profile reflects a general disinterest in consuming food.
- **Avoidance based on concern over aversive consequences**: This involves fears such as choking, gastrointestinal discomfort, or vomiting (APA).

Consequently, individuals with ARFID may become malnourished, exhibit weight loss, or have an increased body mass index (BMI) due to selectively eating energy-dense products.

### The association of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and neurogastroenterology disorders (including disorders of gut-brain interaction [DGBI]): A scoping review [^114iaXGM]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). High credibility.

This is the first scoping review to examine the association between ARFID and neurogastroenterology disorders. While we identified interesting findings regarding the prevalence of overlaps between these conditions, our review also highlights a lack of studies on the mechanisms underlying this overlap, as well as on its treatment. Additionally, the heterogeneity in methods used across studies makes it challenging to obtain accurate and generalizable data. The suitability of assessment tools for this population also requires further evaluation.

### Severe avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and coexisting stimulant treated attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^113krAge]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

There is a growing body of literature describing the development, clinical course, and treatment of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), a diagnostic category introduced in the DSM-5. However, information surrounding complex cases of ARFID involving coexisting medical and/or psychiatric disorders remains scarce. Here, we report on two cases of young patients diagnosed concurrently with ARFID and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who both experienced significant growth restriction following the initiation of stimulant medication.

The appetite suppressant effect of stimulants exacerbated longstanding avoidant and restrictive eating behaviors, resulting in growth restriction and admission to an inpatient eating disorders unit. The implications of ARFID exacerbated by stimulant-treated ADHD are explored, as well as the treatment delivered. These cases suggest that further research is needed to explore management options to counteract the appetite suppression effects of stimulants while simultaneously addressing attention deficit symptoms and oppositional behavior.

### Etiology of the broad avoidant restrictive food intake disorder phenotype in Swedish twins aged 6 to 12 years [^115b3iTa]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

The genetic epidemiology of ARFID is currently unknown, as validated ARFID screening instruments are only starting to emerge. Until these measures are fully developed and deployed, we can optimize available resources, such as those held by the Swedish Twin Registry, to create a diagnostic algorithm to identify an ARFID phenotype and study its prevalence, correlates, and etiology. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which genetic and environmental factors contribute to the liability to ARFID. Given the moderate to high heritability of other eating disorders (anorexia nervosa: range, 0.48–0.74; bulimia nervosa: range, 0.55–0.61; binge-eating disorder: range, 0.39–0.45) and the reported heritability estimates of ARFID-related traits, we anticipated at least moderate heritability of ARFID.

### Editorial: Limitations on the Predictive Validity of the Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder Diagnosis [^116EXaUx]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) first entered the psychiatric nosology with the 2013 publication of DSM-5. Unlike binge eating disorder (BED), which was also new to DSM-5 but which had first been described by Stunkard in 1959, 1, 2 ARFID had never been described in the psychiatric literature as a single diagnostic entity. The new diagnosis encompassed clinical constructs that were previously proposed and studied but not described in DSM (ie, causes of "non-organic failure to thrive" including infantile anorexia and post-traumatic feeding disorder, 3 and extreme food selectivity in children with autism spectrum disorder 4) and the DSM-IV Feeding Disorder of Infancy and Early Childhood (FDIEC). 5 The ARFID diagnosis supplanted FDIEC and incorporated earlier descriptions of pediatric feeding problems into a lifespan diagnosis for patients with restrictive eating characterized by food selectivity, poor appetite/lack of interest in eating, or fear of aversive consequences of eating that led to significant weight loss or failure to grow, nutritional deficiency, supplement dependence, and/or psychosocial impairment. Because the diagnosis was so new when DSM-5 was published, the ARFID criteria were not yet supported by descriptive psychopathology research in population-based or clinical samples. Kambanis et al. 6 have made an important contribution to the descriptive psychopathology of ARFID by describing the naturalistic illness course over 2 years in a well-characterized adolescent and adult sample. 6 In addition to providing novel information about the course

### The association of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and neurogastroenterology disorders (including disorders of gut-brain interaction [DGBI]): A scoping review [^116YDZyp]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with neurogastroenterology disorders, such as disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) and gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders, often adopt restrictive diets to manage symptoms. Without professional guidance, these patients may risk developing avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), potentially affecting their physical and mental health.

- **Purpose**: This scoping review aimed to explore the prevalence of ARFID in patients with neurogastroenterology disorders and vice versa, the direction of their association, potential risk factors, and available treatments.

- **Methods**: Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane. Abstracts were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers.

- **Key results**: Eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria. The prevalence of ARFID symptoms in neurogastroenterology patients ranged from 10% to 80%, while the prevalence of neurogastroenterology disorders and related GI symptoms in ARFID patients ranged from 7% to 60%. Findings on the direction of the association between eating difficulties and GI symptom occurrence were conflicting. Patients with ARFID-neurogastroenterology disorder overlap were more likely to be female, have a lower BMI, higher anxiety and depression levels, and poorer quality of life. Two small studies evaluating treatment for this overlap suggested promising effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

- **Conclusions and inferences**: This review highlights heterogeneity in study designs and questions the suitability of ARFID assessment tools in this context.

### Prevalence of DSM-5 avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder in a pediatric gastroenterology healthcare network [^115FaZra]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Few published studies have evaluated the clinical utility of new diagnostic criteria for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), a DSM-5 reformulation of the feeding and eating disorder of infancy or early childhood. We examined the prevalence of ARFID and inter-rater reliability of its diagnostic criteria in a pediatric gastrointestinal sample.

We conducted a retrospective chart review of 2,231 consecutive new referrals (ages 8–18 years) to 19 Boston-area pediatric gastroenterology clinics for evidence of DSM-5 ARFID. We identified 33 (1.5%) ARFID cases; 22 of whom (67%) were male. Most were characterized by insufficient intake/little interest in feeding (n = 19) or a limited diet due to sensory features of the food (n = 7). An additional 54 cases (2.4%) met one or more ARFID criteria, but there was insufficient information in the medical record to confer or exclude the diagnosis. Diagnostic agreement between coders was adequate (κ = 0.72).

- **Common challenges**: These included (i) distinguishing between diagnoses of ARFID and anorexia nervosa or anxiety disorders; (ii) determining whether the severity of the eating/feeding disturbance was sufficient to warrant a diagnosis in the presence of another medical or psychiatric disorder; and (iii) assessing psychosocial impairment related to eating/feeding problems.

In a pediatric treatment-seeking sample where ARFID features were common, cases meeting full criteria were rare, suggesting that the diagnosis is not over-inclusive even in a population where eating/feeding difficulties are expected.

### A role for the microbiota-gut-brain axis in avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder: A new conceptual model [^111hyfsq]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is characterized by a persistent failure to meet adequate nutritional and/or energy needs due to restricted food intake, which results in severe physical and/or psychosocial consequences. Dietary restriction in ARFID manifests as a limited amount and/or variety of food intake and can be driven by a range of factors, including complaints of feeling full, sensory-based avoidance, neophobia, and fears of swallowing, choking, and/or vomiting. Notably, restriction is not motivated by body image disturbances or weight-loss intentions. Likely due to the heterogeneity in etiology, the causal mechanisms that underlie ARFID are still poorly understood.

Intriguingly, there is growing support that the gut microbiota, the vast community of microorganisms within the gastrointestinal tract that communicate bidirectionally with the brain along the microbiota-gut-brain axis to influence feeding, emotion, and cognition, is involved in the modulation of brain and behavior and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of eating disorders.

### Validation study on the child, adult, and parent version of the ARFID module 2.0 for the eating disorder examination [^116eE74V]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

This study presents a psychometric evaluation of the avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) module 2.0 for the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE), including its child (ChEDE) and parent versions. Conducted within a pediatric sample seeking treatment for restrictive feeding or eating disorders, and non-treatment-seeking controls, the module's interrater reliability, parent-child agreement, and its convergent, divergent, and discriminant validity were examined.

The child, adult, and/or parent version of the German ARFID module was administered to 176 children and adolescents (ages 0–17) and their parents, along with (Ch)EDE, well-established measures on food-avoidance behaviors, food variety, body esteem, and objective anthropometric measures.

Across all versions of the ARFID module, substantial to almost perfect interrater reliability was shown. Parent-child agreement for ARFID diagnosis was substantial. Based on medium-to-large associations between interview-assessed avoidant/restrictive food intake and questionnaire-assessed food-avoidance behaviors, food variety, and objective weight status, the module showed high convergent validity, especially for the child and parent versions. Low associations of avoidant/restrictive food intake with weight and shape concern demonstrated divergent validity. Individuals with ARFID differed significantly from those with anorexia nervosa and individually matched controls in a range of clinical characteristics, indicating discriminant validity.

This comprehensive validation supports the EDE ARFID module's reliability and validity across different versions.

### Latent trajectories of change in dietary restriction during treatment in avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and anorexia nervosa [^115jTEpt]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Low-weight restrictive eating disorders include avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and anorexia nervosa (AN). AN treatment response is heterogeneous, with some individuals improving and others developing a chronic course. However, much less is known about treatment response in ARFID. Prior research in AN has emphasized rapid versus non-rapid responders to treatment, but response may be more nuanced. Examining change trajectory using multiple timepoints — rather than relying on data at baseline and one end-of-treatment or naturalistic follow-up timepoint — may aid treatment personalization.

Past work has examined latent trajectories of behavioral change during eating disorder (ED) treatment using latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM), a statistical method allowing for the identification of subgroups with specific change trajectories. Espel-Huynh et al. examined trajectories of change in overall ED symptoms in a mixed sample of AN, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and other specified feeding or eating disorder during residential ED treatment. They found gradual response, rapid response, and static response classes, supporting that binary distinctions between rapid and non-rapid treatment responders may miss some trajectories of change. Presseller et al. examined trajectories of change in binge eating, compensatory behaviors, and regular eating among bulimia nervosa-spectrum EDs during outpatient treatment and found static and moderate response trajectories.

### Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) [^111GLLCG]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2017). Low credibility.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is an entirely new diagnosis in the DSM-5. ARFID replaces "feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood", a diagnosis in the DSM-IV restricted to children 6 years of age or younger; ARFID has no such age limitations and is distinct from anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa in that there is no body image disturbance. ARFID involves a complex and heterogeneous etiology, which is reviewed herein. What is known at the time of writing regarding the characteristics and medical and psychiatric comorbidities of this patient population are described and compared to other eating disorders. Evaluation and management strategies are also discussed. No data yet exist regarding ARFID's prognosis and prevention; however, recommendations to guide parents in establishing appropriate infant and child feeding practices are provided.

### When is patient behavior indicative of avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) vs reasonable response to digestive disease [^1118VwYL]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Aims: Dietary modification is common in patients with digestive diseases to improve symptoms; however, food avoidance can become problematic. Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is characterized by the failure to meet one's nutritional needs due to sensory hypersensitivity, lack of interest in eating, or fear of aversive consequences from eating, and is associated with negative medical and psychosocial outcomes. This study characterizes ARFID behaviors in adults with achalasia, celiac sprue, eosinophilic esophagitis, and inflammatory bowel disease.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 289 adults aged 18 and older completed self-report measures evaluating use of dietary treatment, ARFID symptoms, and psychosocial outcomes. Primary analyses investigated the occurrence of ARFID in patients with achalasia, celiac, eosinophilic esophagitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Secondary analyses explored the associations between ARFID symptoms and clinical and psychosocial outcomes.

Results: More than half (53.7%) of the total sample met the diagnostic criteria for ARFID based on the Nine-Item ARFID Screen (NIAS), with 78.4% of patients with achalasia meeting criteria. Patients on a physician-directed diet showed greater fear of gastrointestinal symptoms (P = .025), less interest in food (P = .046), and a higher total NIAS score (P = .045). For patients using dietary therapy, those who had met with a dietitian reported higher NIAS scores (P = .039). Food avoidance/restriction was associated with increased anxiety and depression, and diminished health-rel.

### Health related quality of life of infants and children with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder [^111veatd]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of "avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)" was introduced in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), in 2013. It extended and replaced the formerly used DSM-IV diagnosis "feeding disorder of infancy and early childhood" [American Psychiatric Association & DSM‐5 Task Force, 2013; Bryant‐Waugh, 2013; Kerzner et al, 2015]. ARFID describes an eating/feeding disturbance, such as a lack of interest in eating or food, avoidance based on the sensory characteristics of food, or concern about aversive consequences of eating. This is manifested by a persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional/energy needs associated with one or more of the following: significant weight loss, failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering growth in children, significant nutritional deficiency, dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements, or a marked interference with psychosocial functioning [American Psychiatric Association & DSM‐5 Task Force, 2013].

ARFID is a common clinical entity, with a point prevalence rate of 3.2% in a general pediatric population [Kurz, van Dyck, Dremmel, Munsch, & Hilbert, 2015]. Earlier studies found ARFID patients to be younger, with a higher proportion of males, and more commonly diagnosed with comorbid psychiatric and/or medical symptoms compared to other DSM-5 eating disorders [Norris, Spettigue, & Katzman, 2016]. However, ARFID represents a heterogeneous clinical group including all age groups, from young children to adults. In a study including ARFID patients aged 10–18 years, 30% were male.

### Prevalence, phenotype, and correlates of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder symptoms in the Gulf Cooperation Council: An underserved region [^114NQkw1]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

The present study found a positive association between ARFID psychopathology severity and eating disorder pathology driven by overvaluation of shape and weight. In the complete sample aged ≥ 14 years old, 5.1% of individuals exhibited symptoms for both types of eating disorder psychopathology. Despite eating disorders driven by overvaluation of shape and weight being an exclusion criterion for ARFID (APA), comorbid pathology is frequently observed, with up to 14% of patients seeking treatment for eating disorders and 32% of those with feeding problems also meeting ARFID criteria [Hay et al; Williams et al.]. This overlap suggests that brief screening tools such as the NIAS [Zickgraf and Ellis] and the 7-item EDE-Q [Fairburn and Beglin] may be useful in clinical practice within the GCC. These tools could enhance the identification of ARFID symptoms in patients presenting with broader eating disorder symptoms, potentially facilitating earlier prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

In the present study, females reported higher ARFID psychopathology severity. Interestingly, a larger proportion of females appeared to exhibit ARFID symptoms compared to males, which contrasts with prior research indicating that ARFID is more common in males [Cooney et al; Forman et al; Norris et al; Wong et al.]. The higher prevalence among females in the present study may reflect sample bias. Females in the GCC may have been more proactive in seeking information for eating-related issues, potentially leading to higher ARFID scores in the present study.

### Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder and suicidal ideation [^111HmSqN]. Psychiatry Research (2022). Low credibility.

Most DSM-5 eating disorder diagnoses are associated with elevated suicide risk; however, little is known about the relationship between avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and suicidal ideation. The aim of the study was to examine suicidal ideation within an adult ARFID sample. Patients with eating disorders (N = 936), some of whom met the criteria for a DSM-5 diagnosis of ARFID (n = 79), completed the Beck Depression Inventory II Item 9, which pertains to suicidal ideation. The study was conducted within an eating disorder treatment facility that offers inpatient, residential, partial hospitalization program, and intensive outpatient levels of care.

Findings suggest no significant pairwise differences in suicidal ideation prevalence between participants with ARFID and those with any other eating disorder diagnosis. Thorough screening for suicidal thoughts and risk among those with ARFID is warranted at all levels of care. We suggest that future research expand upon this work in a larger adult ARFID sample.

### Feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial using family-based treatment for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder [^111FcLj4]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Treatments for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) lack strong empirical support. There is a critical need to conduct adequately powered studies to identify effective treatments for ARFID. As a first step, the primary aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing family-based treatment for ARFID (FBT-ARFID) to usual care (UC).

- **Primary outcomes**: Recruitment, attrition, suitability, and expectancy rates.
- **Secondary aim**: Assess changes in percent estimated body weight, eating-related psychopathology, and parental self-efficacy from baseline to end of treatment/UC period in both groups. Recruitment rates were 1.87 per month; 28 children with ARFID and their families were randomized, and attrition rate was 21%. Therapeutic suitability and expectancy rating suggested that FBT-ARFID was acceptable to families.

	- Effect size (ES) differences on measures of weight and clinical severity were moderate to large, favoring FBT-ARFID over UC.
	- Parental self-efficacy improvement also demonstrated a large ES favoring FBT-ARFID, which correlated with improvements in ARFID symptoms.

There is a research gap between our knowledge base on how to treat children with ARFID and clinical need. The data presented suggest that an RCT comparing FBT-ARFID and UC is feasible to conduct.

### A US-based consensus on diagnostic overlap and distinction for pediatric feeding disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder [^114WMH1Q]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

As diagnoses covering dysfunctional feeding and eating in pediatrics, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and pediatric feeding disorder (PFD) contain inherent areas of overlap in their diagnostic criteria. Areas of overlap include criteria regarding nutritional consequences associated with feeding/eating dysfunction and shared emphasis on possible psychosocial impairment associated with restricted food intake. Complicating the differential diagnosis process is a lack of guidance regarding when the two conditions occur independently, co-qualify, and/or transition into the other. Feeding Matters' Research Initiatives Task Force planned and hosted a PFD-ARFID consensus meeting, with the aim of reaching a consensus regarding diagnostic clarity on PFD and ARFID.

- **Method**: Criteria for participation focused on US residents who either (a) served as an author on the ARFID workgroup or PFD consensus papers, or (b) provided community representation via board or committee roles. The consensus process followed three stages: prework, the meeting, and post-work/writing. Twelve participants were present for the meeting, with 14 involved in pre- and post-work/writing.

- **Results**: The final panel included four psychologists representing the ARFID community and seven multidisciplinary members representing PFD's four domains (medical, nutrition, skill, and psychosocial) plus a Zero-to-Three community representative and two representatives from Feeding Matters. Results yielded 10 consensus statements and visuals to support the consensus statements.

### A response to "Should children under 5 and those with constipation be overlooked from ARFID research?" [^114oR9no]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

In our study, we identified children and adolescents with ARFID attending secondary care across the UK and Ireland using active surveillance methodology in collaboration with the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU) and the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Surveillance System (CAPSS). As explained in the paper, these paediatric surveillance units work by surveying consultant paediatricians and child and adolescent psychiatrists who see patients from different age ranges (i.e. child and adolescent psychiatrists see patients from 5 years of age). Picky or fussy eating is common in younger children and therefore may be more difficult to differentiate from cases of ARFID, carrying the risk of overreporting in children under 5 years of age. In addition, our study had the secondary objective to compare rates of ARFID with other countries, such as Canada, where another surveillance study of ARFID in children and adolescents aged 5–18 years was conducted. We agree that ARFID can be diagnosed across the lifespan, and in the future, further surveillance studies of ARFID including younger children should be conducted, which will help to better understand early presentations of this disorder.

According to the DSM-5, an eating disturbance categorized as ARFID should not be attributable to a medical condition.

### A US-based consensus on diagnostic overlap and distinction for pediatric feeding disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder [^111An8t4]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Feeding Matters' Research Initiatives Task Force planned and hosted the PFD‐ARFID consensus meeting. Criteria for participation focused on US residents who either: (a) served as an author on the ARFID workgroup (Eddy et al.) or PFD consensus (Goday et al.) papers, or (b) provided community representation via board or committee roles in Feeding Matters. Invitations were sent to 19 potential participants based on these criteria; 14 (74%) agreed to participate.

The final panel included four psychologists from the ARFID community and seven multidisciplinary members from the PFD community: two psychologists, two pediatricians, two speech‐language pathologists, and an occupational therapist. The group also included two Feeding Matters' Task Force facilitators and community representatives, along with a Zero‐to‐Three community representative (a national nonprofit organization focused on early child development). Following confirmation of the expert panel, the development of the 10 consensus statements involved three major stages (see Appendix S2 for details).

### Rethinking screening, and considering cross-cultural similarities and differences in the clinical presentation of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID): A commentary building upon Presseller et al. (2024) [^113nhakk]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). High credibility.

The EDE-Q is effective at identifying whether someone holds serious concerns regarding weight, shape, and eating behavior. Additionally, it inquires about binge episodes and purging behaviors. However, our clinical experience suggests individuals with ARFID may also score high on the weight, eating, and shape concern subscales of the EDE-Q, even when they do not have another eating disorder driven by shape or weight concern. This means that individuals with ARFID interpret EDE-Q questions from an ARFID perspective, similar to how individuals with weight/shape-driven eating disorders interpret NIAS questions from their perspective.

For example, questions from the "weight concern" subscale, such as "Have you had a definite fear of gaining weight?" and "Have you had a strong desire to lose weight?" may be scored high by people with ARFID who are overweight. Similarly, questions from the "eating concern" subscale, such as "Has thinking about food, eating, or calories made it very difficult to concentrate on things you are interested in (e.g. working, following a conversation, or reading)?" may also receive high scores from individuals with ARFID, as they face significant challenges with food and eating. Finally, the question "How concerned have you been about other people seeing you eat?" can be as crucial for someone with ARFID, particularly those with extreme psychosocial difficulties related to eating, as it is for someone with an eating disorder driven by shape or weight concerns.

### Beyond picky eating: avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder [^115Xuct1]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Disorders related to ingesting an adequate variety and amount of food are often categorized into feeding or eating disorders, based on whether affected individuals require feeding by others or can eat independently. These disorders encompass a wide range of conditions. This paper focuses on disorders that are not associated with weight-control behaviors or self-concept influenced by body weight or shape, as seen in anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.

In contrast to eating disorders, there is a relatively sparse body of literature, inconsistent and confusing terminology, and conflicting classification schemes applied to feeding and eating disturbances.

A new scheme is proposed to improve clinical utility and to include individuals who experience morbidities that could benefit from diagnosis and treatment but are presently excluded from classification. Key research findings are highlighted, and core clinical features regarding diagnosis and treatment are detailed. Two illustrative cases frame the clinical aspects of these conditions.

### The association of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and neurogastroenterology disorders (including disorders of gut-brain interaction [DGBI]): A scoping review [^116KdXUX]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). High credibility.

Only two studies were identified that evaluated the direction of the association between eating difficulties and GI symptoms, and their results were conflicting. However, these studies were conducted on different populations and used varying methods, including self-reported data. Therefore, further longitudinal cohort studies are necessary to obtain more accurate findings on this association. Notably, such bi-directionality had also been previously discussed in relation to other eating disorders, as eating disorders can lead to GI symptoms, and GI disorders can be a risk factor for eating disorder development.

This scoping review found that neurogastroenterology patients with ARFID symptoms were more likely to be female. While ARFID prevalence is typically similar between males and females, the higher prevalence of neurogastroenterology disorders in females may explain the high prevalence of ARFID symptoms observed in females with these disorders. Neurogastroenterology patients with ARFID symptoms were also found to have lower BMI than those without ARFID. However, it is important to note that it does not necessarily imply these patients are underweight, as the mean BMI was within the normal or even overweight/obese ranges. Neurogastroenterology patients with ARFID symptoms were also found to have a lower quality of life and higher levels of anxiety and depression compared to those without ARFID symptoms. Psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depressive disorders, as well as poor quality of life, are common in neurogastroenterology disorders.

### A moving target: How we define avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can double its prevalence [^114nHnB4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of ambiguities in the DSM-5 criteria for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). These ambiguities influence clinical practice by affecting treatment access, comparability, and the generalizability of research studies. The study aimed to identify how different operationalizations of the diagnostic criteria for ARFID affect the prevalence of the diagnosis.

The methods focused on criterion A of ARFID, considering rules B, C, and D as rule-outs. Nineteen potential operational definitions were identified to evaluate their effect on the prevalence of ARFID in a sample comprising children, adolescents, and young adults (n = 80) enrolled in an avoidant/restrictive eating study between September 2016 and February 2020.

The results indicated significant differences in the proportion of individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria across various methodologies (all P values < .008). Employing the strictest definition, 50.0% (n = 40) of participants met the criteria for ARFID, whereas under the most lenient definition, the prevalence increased to 97.5% (n = 78).

The comparison of diagnostic definitions among different age groups demonstrated a wide range of statistically distinct proportions within a single sample. These findings highlight the necessity for further content-specific evaluations to enhance diagnostic consistency.

### Assessing avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) symptoms using the Nine Item ARFID screen in > 9000 Swedish adults with and without eating disorders [^111QirdY]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The Nine Item ARFID Scale (NIAS) is a widely used measure for assessing symptoms of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). Previous studies suggest that individuals with eating disorders driven by shape/weight concerns also have elevated scores on the NIAS. To further describe NIAS scores among individuals with diverse and previous eating disorders, we characterized NIAS scores in a large sample of individuals with eating disorders and evaluated overlap in symptoms measured by the NIAS and the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) version 6.0.

Our sample comprised 9,148 participants from the Eating Disorders Genetics Initiative Sweden (EDGI-SE), who completed surveys including the NIAS and EDE-Q. NIAS scores were calculated and compared by eating disorder diagnostic group using descriptive statistics and linear models.

Participants with anorexia nervosa demonstrated the highest mean NIAS scores and had the greatest proportion (57.0%) of individuals scoring above a clinical cutoff on at least one of the NIAS subscales. Individuals with bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and other specified feeding or eating disorders also demonstrated elevated NIAS scores compared to individuals with no lifetime history of an eating disorder (ps < 0.05). All subscales of the NIAS showed small to moderate correlations with all subscales of the EDE-Q (rs = 0.26–0.40).

Our results substantiate that individuals with eating disorders other than ARFID demonstrate elevated scores on the NIAS, suggesting that this tool is indeed valuable in capturing a range of eating disorder symptoms.

### Rethinking screening, and considering cross-cultural similarities and differences in the clinical presentation of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID): A commentary building upon Presseller et al. (2024) [^117MPsR3]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). High credibility.

The special issue of the International Journal of Eating Disorders dedicated to avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) in 2025 marks a significant step forward in our understanding of this eating disorder, which can be so varied regarding its clinical picture. The study by Presseller et al, included in this issue, assesses ARFID symptoms using the nine-item ARFID screen (NIAS) in a large Swedish sample. This provides valuable insights into the challenges of ARFID assessment. Their findings, demonstrating that individuals with eating disorders other than ARFID also exhibit elevated scores on the NIAS, underscore the need for caution when using this tool in isolation. The results suggest that the NIAS may not adequately differentiate ARFID from shape/weight-motivated eating disorders, highlighting the complexities of diagnosis and the need for comprehensive assessment approaches.

Presseller et al. analyzed data from a large cohort within the Eating Disorders Genetics Initiative Sweden (EDGI-SE), comprising over 9000 participants. This cohort included individuals with previous diagnoses of anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED), and other specified feeding or eating disorders (OSFED), as well as individuals with no history of eating disorders. The study utilized the NIAS, a widely adopted nine-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess symptoms of ARFID, including picky eating (3 items), low appetite (3 items), and fear of aversive consequences (3 items).

### Long-term follow-up study of low-weight avoidant restrictive food intake disorder compared with childhood-onset anorexia nervosa: Psychiatric and occupational outcome in 56 patients [^111AfmB9]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

In this study, at the start of treatment, 37 cases were diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (AN) and 19 with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). The AN group had a mean expected body weight (EBW%) of 77.6% (range 64.8–91.1; SD 7.97), while the ARFID group had a mean EBW% of 78.2% (range 68.8–86.9; SD 5.17).

At follow-up, there were no reported deaths. Descriptive information at follow-up indicates a mean body mass index (BMI) for the AN group of 21.5 kg/m² (range 17.4–28.0; SD 2.61) and for the ARFID group, 21.9 kg/m² (range 16.5–29.9; SD 3.33). The mean age for the AN group was 28.4 years (range 18.9–42.2; SD 6.58), while the ARFID group had a mean age of 25.5 years (range 19.4–40.7; SD 5.35).

### Exploring avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder in eating disordered patients: A descriptive study [^116J25ga]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess and compare the clinical characteristics of patients with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) to those with anorexia nervosa (AN).

The method involved a retrospective review of adolescent eating disorder (ED) patients assessed between 2000 and 2011 who qualified for a diagnosis of ARFID. A matched AN sample was used to compare characteristics between groups.

Results indicated that 205 patients met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in detail. Of these, 34 (5%) patients met the criteria for ARFID. A matched sample of 36 patients with AN was used to draw comparisons. Patients with ARFID were younger than those with AN, more likely to present before age 12, and more likely to be male. Patients in both groups presented at low weights. Common eating-specific behaviors and symptoms in the ARFID group included food avoidance, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and fear of vomiting. The rates of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses and medical morbidity were high in both groups. Almost 80% of AN patients and one-third of ARFID patients required hospital admission due to medical instability. Symptom profiles in 4 out of 34 ARFID patients resulted in eventual reclassification to AN.

The discussion supported the notion that a small percentage of adolescent patients presenting with restrictive eating disorders meet the criteria for ARFID. These patients are younger than average, more likely to be male compared to adolescent AN samples, and have high rates of psychiatric and medical morbidity. The study also suggests that a proportion of patients evolve into AN.

### A US-based consensus on diagnostic overlap and distinction for pediatric feeding disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder [^1173Yggr]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

The panel agreed that future iterations of both diagnoses should reference each other in a structured manner. This approach will reduce confusion, improve the precision of research studying both conditions, and may yield insights into underlying mechanisms and etiologies.

- **Statement 3**: The relationship between PFD and ARFID is such that they can influence one another, criteria can be met for both conditions, or they can exist in isolation.

- **PFD occurs in isolation**: PFD often involves medically complex infants and young children with conditions prohibiting safe feeding (e.g. aspiration), contributing to feeding fatigue (e.g. oral motor deficits), and/or resulting in painful eating (e.g. unmanaged reflux). In such cases, clinical manifestations may include psychosocial dysfunction in the form of feeding refusal in infancy and/or nutritional dysfunction (e.g. the need for enteral feeding). This dysfunction, however, can be directly attributed to a medical condition, thus consistent with a diagnosis of PFD but potentially excluding a diagnosis of ARFID if medical management of the underlying condition or clearance to begin oral feeding (e.g. after passing a swallow study) resolves the PFD without the need for other therapeutic intervention.

- **PFD transitions into ARFID**: Some medically complex children, however, may develop conditioned food aversion when unpleasant consequences are repeatedly paired with eating over several years.

### A US-based consensus on diagnostic overlap and distinction for pediatric feeding disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder [^113Q3w7L]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

A multidisciplinary lens is beneficial for evaluating and treating both PFD and ARFID; however, the involvement and relative contribution of disciplines differ by treatment setting. The recommended standard of care for PFD parallels its multidisciplinary framework, with contributions from a provider team that includes a physician, dietitian, speech/language pathologist or occupational therapist, and psychosocial specialist (e.g. psychologist). In this multidisciplinary model, professionals individually assess the child according to their given domain and then collectively determine if the child can eat safely, functionally, and efficiently as expected for age. The risk of dysfunction or the presence of impairment in more than one domain is particularly salient at younger ages and in children with higher levels of medical severity and complexity. Multidomain screening and/or assessment provides necessary safeguards for introducing and/or advancing foods with medically complex, developmentally delayed, and/or feeding skill‐impaired patients.

Among older patients, ARFID diagnostic criteria do not directly speak to multidisciplinary assessment; however, at a minimum, expert consensus recommends the involvement of a medical professional and mental health clinician as part of routine evaluation and diagnosis. Further, given an older age of treatment presentation for patients with ARFID (in isolation) relative to PFD (in isolation or PFD that transitions to ARFID), more than half of individuals with ARFID meet these criteria.

### Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder: A diagnosis at the intersection of feeding and eating disorders necessitating subtype differentiation [^111Cfh15]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a diagnosis that sits squarely at the crossroads of feeding disorders and eating disorders. It is historically tied to feeding disorders as a replacement for the DSM-IV diagnosis of feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood. The revision process, however, extended the diagnostic umbrella by removing its predecessor's weight loss requirement and age of onset restriction (i.e. 6 years).

Implications of this extension include capturing an older cohort of patients with ARFID accessing care at eating disorders clinics and providing a diagnostic home to previously orphaned pediatric subgroups with feeding disorders that lacked a diagnostic home prior to DSM-5.

While recognizing notable strengths of this now 5-year-old diagnostic entity, ARFID is largely recognized as a very heterogeneous condition that lacks specificity to best guide clinical and research activities. The commentary discusses the implications of ARFID as a replacement and extension of the DSM-IV diagnosis of feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood and provides the rationale and guidance for developing a subtype taxonomy.

### A useful and timely proposal to amend diagnostic criteria for ARFID: Commentary on Zickgraf et al. (2025) [^112cj8NX]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) were introduced in DSM-5 in 2013. In the ensuing years, substantial research has clarified the clinical characteristics, complications, and possible treatments for individuals with ARFID. On the basis of this emerging knowledge, in the issue of the International Journal of Eating Disorders, Zickgraf et al. usefully propose a revision of the diagnostic criteria. The proposed revisions would bring the structure of the criteria more in line with the criteria for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. Zickgraf et al. also propose that ARFID could be diagnosed in the presence of another eating disorder, thereby differing from the nosological hierarchy for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. Zickgraf et al. have done our field a significant service with their thoughtful proposal. Research is now needed to evaluate the performance of the suggested criteria.

### Health related quality of life of infants and children with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder [^115tP2Jp]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of children with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is lower compared to both healthy and chronically ill controls. The subgroup of ARFID patients receiving tube feeding did not differ significantly from those not receiving tube feeding. We recommend adding HRQOL as an outcome measure in clinical studies.

Assessing the HRQOL of children with ARFID in daily practice can detect problems on the affected subscales. Personalized care from appropriate disciplines should focus on these problems to improve HRQOL. Especially, the psychologist may play a key role in evaluating and treating psychosocial problems and HRQOL. Further studies should determine if this leads to an improvement of HRQOL by measuring it in a standardized way before and after treatment.

The HRQOL of children with tube feeding should be measured in a larger sample size. Furthermore, the parental HRQOL of children with ARFID compared to healthy and chronically ill children should be measured. Future studies should also assess the behavior and psychopathology of children with ARFID and their parents in order to target treatment and improve care.

### Assessment and treatment of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder [^113fnhSK]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to examine the literature concerning the assessment and treatment of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) a decade after its inclusion in the DSM-5. Recent findings indicate the development of several structured clinical interviews for assessing ARFID, each with distinct strengths and limitations. However, there is currently no definitive self-report measure for monitoring treatment progress and outcomes in ARFID.

Medical assessments involve examining anthropometrics, vitamin deficiencies, and other comorbidities associated with ARFID. Recent studies have explored cognitive behavioral therapy, family-based treatment, and other approaches to managing ARFID. While these treatments show promise, they are largely based on data from clinical case series and small randomized controlled trials.

Several promising assessments and treatments for ARFID are in the early research stages. Nonetheless, some controversies persist, including:

- **Overlap with criteria**: There is ongoing debate over the overlap with criteria for pediatric feeding disorder.
- **Nutrient deficiencies**: The optimal method for assessing nutrient deficiencies remains under discussion.
- **Disciplines involved in treatment**: There is uncertainty regarding which professional disciplines should be involved in treatment.

Future research is essential to enhance the psychometric properties of ARFID assessments and to evaluate treatment efficacy through larger samples and randomized designs.

### Conceptualizing avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder via an executive functioning lens [^111yedoF]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a heterogeneous disorder wherein restrictive eating is primarily attributed to non-shape/weight-based reasons (e.g. sensory sensitivity) that empirical research continues to explore. Mounting evidence suggests that ARFID often presents alongside neurodevelopmental diagnoses (NDs) or divergent neurodevelopment broadly. Executive functioning (EF) differences often characterize divergent neurodevelopmental trajectories. Additionally, restrictive eating in anorexia nervosa has been conceptualized as related to EF factors (e.g. set shifting). Given the neurodevelopmental phenotype that may be associated with ARFID and the role of EF in anorexia nervosa, this paper proposes EF as a potentially important, yet understudied factor in ARFID pathology.

We posit that various observed ARFID behavioral/cognitive tendencies can be conceptualized in relation to EF differences. We contextualize commonly observed ARFID presentations within "core" EF components (i.e. cognitive flexibility, working memory, inhibitory control), leading to hypotheses about EF in ARFID. Finally, we offer additional considerations/directions for future research on EF in ARFID. Increased research on EF in ARFID is needed to consider this potential common factor in the etiology and maintenance of this heterogeneous disorder. We aim to promote further consideration of EF in ARFID etiology, maintenance, and treatment-outcome research.

- **Public significance**: This article proposes that aspects of executive functioning (EF) may play a role in the onset and maintenance of ARFID, highlighting the need for further exploration in this area.
