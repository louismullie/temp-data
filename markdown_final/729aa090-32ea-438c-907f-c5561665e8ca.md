## Question

Is right flank pain a possible symptom of gallstones?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether right flank pain can be a symptom of gallstones and how to interpret it clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic symptom pattern and location of biliary colic. Then, I should verify documented radiation patterns and whether the flank is described as primary or secondary pain. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis for flank pain and the imaging algorithms that distinguish biliary from renal etiologies. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious clinical answer with practical next steps and caveats anchored to guidelines and trials [^112ZUeFZ] [^1115ZyaN].

> Let me first confirm the typical pain pattern for gallstone disease before drawing conclusions. The hallmark of symptomatic cholelithiasis is biliary colic characterized by episodic severe pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium lasting at least 15–30 minutes, often with nausea and occurring at night; critically, this primary pain is anterior, not lateral or posterior, which means the RUQ/epigastric location is the defining feature rather than the flank [^112ZUeFZ] [^116LQFvF].

> Wait, let me verify the radiation patterns because that is where confusion about the flank can arise. Authoritative descriptions note that biliary colic may radiate to the right back or shoulder, and radiology reviews similarly describe posterior radiation to the back and right shoulder tip; some emergency surgery references also mention radiation toward the right flank or back, but this is framed as radiation from an anterior primary source rather than a primary flank syndrome [^112ZUeFZ] [^112FiUEo] [^111bo4Q4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about flank pain being "typical". I need to ensure we distinguish primary from radiating pain patterns used in clinical decision tools. High-quality trials and guideline-based triage instruments operationalize "typical" biliary symptoms as severe epigastric or RUQ attacks with possible radiation to the back, reinforcing that flank-only pain does not meet typical biliary criteria and should lower pretest probability for gallstones as the cause of the pain episode [^116KhQ8g] [^112ZUeFZ].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis for acute flank pain to avoid anchoring bias. Acute flank pain most commonly originates from renal or ureteral pathology, and comprehensive reviews list many nonurologic causes, including some gastrointestinal conditions such as choledocholithiasis, but they emphasize that the flank syndrome is primarily renal, which is why standard diagnostic pathways begin with renal-focused imaging rather than biliary imaging in patients presenting with isolated flank pain [^114Hh4Ji] [^114sk6Tz] [^111kMaDx].

> I will now examine atypical hepatobiliary presentations to see if they meaningfully change this assessment. In choledocholithiasis, the dominant symptom remains RUQ pain with nausea or jaundice, and in gallstone pancreatitis the pain is classically epigastric radiating to the back; while retroperitoneal extension can involve flank discomfort, that is secondary to pancreatic inflammation rather than primary gallbladder pain, so isolated right flank pain without an RUQ component would be unusual for straightforward gallstone disease based on guideline and review descriptions [^113hsghK] [^116iJ9kQ]. Rare or complicated presentations exist, but guideline summaries still do not treat isolated flank pain as a typical biliary presentation, which I should keep in mind to avoid over-attribution [^112ZUeFZ].

> Let me double-check the diagnostic imaging algorithms because they reflect real-world pretest probabilities. For RUQ pain with suspected biliary disease, right upper quadrant ultrasound is first-line, with MRCP or CT reserved for equivocal cases; in contrast, for acute flank pain suspicious for stone disease, unenhanced CT or renal ultrasound is recommended first, including special pathways in pregnancy, underscoring that flank and RUQ syndromes are triaged differently from the outset [^1115ZyaN] [^111s74rW] [^114sk6Tz].

> But wait, what about anatomical plausibility of referred flank pain from the gallbladder. Let me think about the innervation and referral patterns. The gallbladder's visceral afferents via the celiac plexus and phrenic nerve explain referred pain to the right posterior back and shoulder; while some posterior or lateral radiation can occur, the anatomic position under the liver in the RUQ makes isolated lateral flank pain without RUQ tenderness or epigastric involvement physiologically atypical for primary biliary colic, which aligns with how guidelines describe "typical" pain [^112ZUeFZ] [^112FiUEo].

> Synthesis and clinical answer: I should confirm that right flank pain is not a typical primary symptom of gallstones. It may occur as a radiation pattern from classic RUQ or epigastric biliary colic, but isolated flank pain should prompt evaluation for more common etiologies such as nephrolithiasis or pyelonephritis with renal-focused imaging first; when an RUQ component, biliary risk factors, or abnormal liver chemistries are present, a RUQ ultrasound is appropriate to assess for gallstones and complications, adjusting the workup to the dominant pain pattern and objective findings [^112ZUeFZ] [^114sk6Tz] [^1115ZyaN].

---

Yes, gallstones can cause **right flank pain**, but this is **uncommon** and usually reflects radiation from the right upper quadrant or epigastrium to the right flank or back [^112ZUeFZ]. The classic presentation is biliary colic or cholecystitis with RUQ or epigastric pain radiating to the back or right shoulder; **isolated right flank pain** should prompt evaluation for renal or musculoskeletal causes [^114sk6Tz]. Ultrasound is the **first-line test** for suspected gallstones [^1115ZyaN], whereas non-contrast CT is preferred for suspected nephrolithiasis [^111kMaDx].

---

## Typical pain patterns in gallstone disease

Gallstone disease typically presents with **characteristic pain patterns** [^112ZUeFZ]:

- **Biliary colic**: Intermittent obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone causes severe, cramping RUQ or epigastric pain that typically radiates to the back or right shoulder; the pain is usually temporary and subsides when obstruction resolves [^112ZUeFZ].

- **Acute cholecystitis**: Persistent cystic duct obstruction with gallbladder inflammation causes constant RUQ pain, often with radiation to the back or right shoulder, and is associated with fever, nausea, and vomiting.

- **Choledocholithiasis**: Stones in the common bile duct cause RUQ pain, jaundice, and sometimes pancreatitis or cholangitis [^113hsghK].

---

## Mechanisms of right flank pain in gallstone disease

Right flank pain in gallstone disease is **uncommon** but may occur via radiation or referral, as biliary colic or cholecystitis can extend to the right flank or back due to shared neural pathways and **referred pain** patterns [^112ZUeFZ]. Complications involving adjacent structures — such as Mirizzi syndrome, gallstone ileus, or pancreatitis — may affect nearby organs and produce pain that extends to the flank or back [^112FiUEo] [^116eKPwD]. Additionally, post-cholecystectomy syndrome with persistent or recurrent pain — sometimes from retained stones or biliary dyskinesia — may present as right flank pain [^116xTYPa] [^111KwoA2].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting gallstones as a cause of right flank pain

Clinical guidelines and studies support that gallstone-related pain can involve the right flank. The EASL guidelines describe episodic severe RUQ or epigastric pain often radiating to the right back or shoulder [^112ZUeFZ], and the SECURE trial defines symptomatic gallstone disease as severe epigastric or RUQ pain lasting 15–30 minutes or longer, often **radiating to the back** [^116KhQ8g]. Rare case reports also describe presentations primarily as right flank pain, particularly in the setting of complications or atypical features.

---

## Diagnostic approach to right flank pain suspected to be caused by gallstones

When assessing right flank pain potentially related to gallstones, use a systematic approach that begins with clinical history and physical examination to identify characteristic biliary symptoms — episodic severe pain radiating to the back or shoulder, with associated nausea or vomiting [^112ZUeFZ]. Order laboratory tests, including liver function tests, bilirubin, and inflammatory markers, to evaluate for biliary obstruction or inflammation. For imaging, select **abdominal ultrasound** as the initial modality [^114XCxpK] due to its high sensitivity and specificity for gallstones and related complications [^1115ZyaN], and consider MRI with MRCP or contrast-enhanced CT if ultrasound is inconclusive or complications are suspected [^1124zXSb].

---

## Differential diagnosis of right flank pain

Right flank pain has a **broad differential**, including [^114Hh4Ji]:

- **Renal causes**: Nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, renal colic [^114sk6Tz].

- **Musculoskeletal causes**: Muscle strain, rib fractures, spinal disorders.

- **Gastrointestinal causes**: Appendicitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis.

- **Other causes**: Herpes zoster, retroperitoneal fibrosis, adrenal disorders [^1152jgsx].

---

## Management of gallstone-related right flank pain

Management of gallstone-related right flank pain **depends on severity** and the presence of complications:

- **Conservative management**: NSAIDs are recommended for pain relief in uncomplicated biliary colic or acute cholecystitis [^1129skaj] [^111kF8FT].

- **Surgical intervention**: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment for symptomatic gallstones or complicated gallstone disease [^1111CP8n].

- **Endoscopic procedures**: ERCP with stone extraction is indicated for choledocholithiasis or retained common bile duct stones [^112nT7i9] [^114fnToN].

---

Gallstones can cause right flank pain, typically via **radiation from the RUQ or epigastrium** and, less commonly, through complications involving adjacent structures. A systematic diagnostic approach — clinical assessment, laboratory tests, and imaging — is essential to differentiate gallstone-related pain from other causes of right flank pain [^112ZUeFZ] [^1124zXSb].

The broad spectrum of gallstone-related disease can be broken down based on the anatomical locations in which they occur.

- **Gallbladder**: Unsurprisingly, the most common location for gallstones and thus gallstone-related disease is the gallbladder. Biliary colic is caused when a stone temporarily obstructs the drainage from the cystic duct, resulting in severe cramping abdominal and right upper quadrant pain that can radiate to the back and right shoulder tip as the gallbladder contracts. Typically, these symptoms are temporary and subside with resolution of the cystic duct obstruction. Ultrasonography will often demonstrate cholelithiasis without associated complications in patients with simple biliary colic.

	- Calculous cholecystitis refers to infection and inflammation of the gallbladder wall caused by irritation from gallstones, and this can be an acute or chronic process. The typical clinical presentation of acute cholecystitis is of right upper quadrant pain, with or without radiation to the right shoulder, which is more constant compared to the intermittent pain seen in biliary colic. There is usually associated pyrexia and other infective symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. The typical imaging features of acute cholecystitis are gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and a distended gallbladder.

For patients with choledocholithiasis, specifically those with acute cholangitis, the BSG 2017 guidelines recommend performing urgent biliary decompression. This includes endoscopic common bile duct stone extraction and/or biliary stenting for patients not responding to antibiotic therapy or showing signs of septic shock. If ERCP is not possible, percutaneous radiological drainage should be considered as an alternative.

### Cholecystocolonic fistula: An incidental intraoperative discovery managed laparoscopically [^113vLBxi]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Cholecystoenteric fistula is a rare complication of cholelithiasis, occurring in 3%-5% of patients with cholelithiasis. The symptoms are typically minimal and vague, with either acute or subacute presentations, rarely leading to bowel obstruction, and occasionally manifesting as chronic abdominal pain. In this case, a male patient in his early 30s presented with epigastric and right hypochondrial pain. On evaluation, he was diagnosed with gallstone disease and adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a cholecystocolonic fistula was unexpectedly discovered. The fistula was managed laparoscopically using ENDOLOOP (prelooped chromic catgut ligature) ligation of the fistulous tract. The patient recovered without complications and was discharged on the third postoperative day. This case emphasizes the importance of intraoperative vigilance and demonstrates a successful minimally invasive management approach.

### Hepato-pancreato-biliary emergencies for the acute care surgeon: Etiology, diagnosis and treatment [^111bo4Q4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) emergencies encompass a wide range of conditions with overlapping clinical presentations and diverse therapeutic options. The most common etiologies include cholelithiasis-related conditions such as acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis, as well as non-traumatic injuries to the common bile duct or duodenum. Although determining the true incidence of HPB emergencies is challenging due to selection and reporting biases, a population-based report indicated a decline in the global incidence of severe complications associated with cholelithiasis, notably a reduction in acute cholecystitis.

Despite the potential for overlapping symptoms in patients, treatment options for these conditions vary greatly. The treatment landscape continues to evolve, incorporating endoscopic, surgical, and/or percutaneous techniques as necessary. Thus, it is essential for a multidisciplinary team comprising HPB surgeons, interventional gastroenterologists, and radiologists to be available to the acute care surgeon on an as-needed basis.

This manuscript provides a contemporary review of the literature on HPB emergencies within the context of acute care surgery. The primary aim is to offer an updated perspective on diagnosing and managing HPB issues in acute care settings, ultimately enhancing the care provided to patients with potential HPB emergencies.

### Gallbladder agenesis with midgut malrotation [^111tmQ6Q]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A 28-year-old female presented with a 4-year history of intermittent right upper quadrant pain. Clinical examination and ultrasound suggested a diagnosis of cholelithiasis, and the patient was eventually booked for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperatively, the patient was found to have gallbladder agenesis and small bowel malrotation with the duodenojejunal flexure to the right of the midline. The gallbladder fossa was filled with fibrous tissue. Both gallbladder agenesis and midgut malrotation are rare congenital abnormalities. Gallbladder agenesis presents similarly to more common gallbladder pathologies, such as cholecystitis. This case illustrates the limitations of and our over-reliance on radiological imaging. Moreover, it highlights the need to have a high index of suspicion for gallbladder agenesis when ultrasound results are inconclusive. Further investigations and imaging with modalities such as MRI should be used to reduce the risks associated with unnecessary surgical intervention.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^116szmQU]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The outcome of cholecystectomy and cause of persistent abdominal pain is of significant interest. Table 2 summarizes patient characteristics and preoperative symptoms in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis. The data are drawn from three clinical trials (SECURE, PERFECT, and SUCCESS), which included patients between 2014 and 2019 in 30 Dutch hospitals.

The PERFECT and SUCCESS trials demonstrated that laparoscopic cholecystectomy effectively resolved biliary colic. However, both trials corroborated that persistent abdominal pain after cholecystectomy occurs in 40 percent of patients. Several causes of persistent abdominal pain post-surgery have been identified. The literature suggests that gastrointestinal symptoms originating from disease aetiologies other than gallstones contribute to postcholecystectomy pain. Functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have a prevalence of 20–30 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in the primary care population. Both conditions are sources of pain with similar characteristics. These typically involve similar population groups: mainly middle-aged women who are overweight. These similarities complicate the diagnosis of the condition responsible for a patient's complaints and may lead to abdominal pain being wrongfully attributed to gallstones. Consequently, this misattribution can influence the decision to proceed with cholecystectomy.

### Frequency of cholelithiasis in need of surgical or endoscopic treatment a decade or more after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^112gLBGv]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Low credibility.

We found that patients with a history of cholecystectomy had a higher frequency of self-reported abdominal pain at follow-up a decade or more after RYGB. Patients who experience abdominal pain are more likely to be referred to abdominal imaging. Sandvik et al. found that 40% of the patients had one or more CT scans and 28% had one or more ultrasound scans due to abdominal pain during a mean follow-up of 8.3 years after RYGB. Previous studies have shown that 24–48% of patients will develop cholelithiasis after RYGB, leading to a high probability of finding cholelithiasis during imaging with subsequent cholecystectomy.

- **Strengths and limitations**: The strengths of this study are the long-term follow-up and the ability to follow the patients across several institutions. The RYGB procedure was performed identically at the three participating hospitals, and the follow-up was standardized and in-office. There are limitations to this study. From a total of 930 patients, 546 patients (58.7%) participated in BAROBS. This is a high number compared to similar studies, but it may still lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the incidence of gallstone disease. No systematic screening for cholelithiasis or abdominal pain was conducted prior to RYGB. Another limitation is the lack of a comparison group with patients who did not go through RYGB.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): Pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113YkQDf]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

From a patient perspective, the defining symptom of gallstone disease is severe and lasting (i.e. > 30 minutes) abdominal pain. General abdominal symptoms commonly intensify over a period and become regular pain attacks (biliary colic) that may require medical attention.

A recent large prospective study in the UK (n = 8909 participants) showed that 10.8% of people experienced complications 30 days after surgery. Furthermore, as much as 40% of patients may continue to experience pain and abdominal symptoms after surgery. In particular, persistent pain similar to that experienced preoperatively has been reported in about 20% of people after cholecystectomy, and new pain has been reported in up to 14% of people. Based on the 61,000 episodes reported for 2018/19, 6600 people would have experienced complications from surgery and 24,400 would continue to experience pain, with a substantial impact on NHS resources and costs.

Post-cholecystectomy syndrome is an umbrella term widely used to describe the range of symptoms patients might experience after surgery. The term persistent post-cholecystectomy symptoms has been suggested as a more accurate description of these symptoms, which include biliary and non-biliary abdominal pain, dyspepsia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. Up to 40% of people may experience persistent pain and discomfort, usually described as post-cholecystectomy symptoms. Persistent diarrhoea or constipation are often reported after cholecystectomy, and flatulence may arise as a new symptom.

### Imaging of gallstones and complications [^114D1RKd]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Gallbladder pathologies caused by gallstones are commonly encountered in clinical practice, making accurate diagnosis critical for effective patient management. Radiologists play a key role in differentiating these conditions through imaging interpretation, ensuring that appropriate treatment is initiated. The imaging features of gallstone-associated diseases are classified into various categories, such as inflammatory conditions, benign lesions, malignant tumors, and associated complications. A comprehensive understanding of these categories and their radiologic manifestations is essential for accurate diagnosis and management of gallbladder pathology. By integrating clinical knowledge with radiologic findings, clinicians and radiologists will be equipped with practical tools to identify and distinguish between different gallstone-causing conditions.

### Concept of the pathogenesis and treatment of cholelithiasis [^111MYfrD]. World Journal of Hepatology (2012). High credibility.

Gallstone disease is a condition associated with various clinical manifestations and risk factors, including acute cholangitis, obesity, and coronary artery disease. Common associated conditions are hormone replacement therapy, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and bariatric surgery. Symptoms include vomiting, nausea, epigastric pain, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, rapid weight loss, and colicky abdominal pain. Gallstone disease may also lead to specific syndromes such as Mirizzi syndrome and can present with back pain, postprandial abdominal pain, diabetes mellitus type 2, shoulder pain, and gallstones. Additional symptoms can include chest pain, particularly in females, Collins' sign, acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, acute pancreatitis, and a connection to metabolic syndrome.

### Laparoscopic ureterolysis and reconstruction of a retrocaval ureter [^111KKYBR]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

A 32-year-old man was investigated for repeated episodes of right-sided flank pain. Ultrasonography showed a dilated right pelvicalyceal system and upper ureter, as well as multiple gallstones; subsequent intravenous urogram demonstrated a retrocaval ureter. At surgery, a right-sided double-J ureteric stent was placed under fluoroscopic guidance.

Initially, three laparoscopic ports were used. The dilated pelvis and upper ureter were mobilized, followed by the lower ureter. The pelvis was transected and transposed anterior to the inferior vena cava. Reconstruction was carried out with an intracorporeally sutured anastomosis over the double-J stent. A fourth port was added for completion of cholecystectomy.

The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the third day. Fourteen months later, he remains well, with a recent intravenous urogram showing regression of hydronephrosis. We review the previously reported cases of laparoscopic and retroperitoneoscopic reconstruction of retrocaval ureter to compare and contrast these minimal access approaches.

### Gallstones top to toe: What the radiologist needs to know [^112RkMn4]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Multiple imaging modalities play a role in the diagnosis of the broad spectrum of gallstone-related disease, including plain radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Ultrasound is by far the most common and useful imaging modality in assessing gallstones within the gallbladder (cholelithiasis) and associated gallbladder pathology. It offers the added benefit of no radiation dose to the patient. With ultrasound, gallstones are characteristically echogenic and demonstrate posterior acoustic shadowing regardless of the gallstone composition. As ultrasound is a bedside dynamic study, stone mobility can be demonstrated with patient maneuvering, which can help differentiate gallstones from gallbladder polyps that may mimic cholelithiasis sonographically.

- **Sagittal ultrasound image of the gallbladder**: Demonstrates the typical appearance of a gallstone that is hyperechoic with posterior acoustic shadowing (arrow).

Another principal advantage of ultrasound over other imaging techniques in the investigation of acute cholecystitis is the ability to evaluate for a sonographic Murphy's sign. This can be a reliable indicator of acute cholecystitis with high sensitivity. The sonographic Murphy's sign occurs when the patient reports maximal pain as the sonographer presses over the fundus of the distended gallbladder with the ultrasound probe, differing from the clinical Murphy's sign.

### A case of flank pain caused by ureteral intussusception accompanied with ureteral polyp [^115Frebg]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old man presented with a 1-week history of vague pain in the right flank and suprapubic region, along with intermittent haematuria. He recalled experiencing similar mild attacks periodically 2 years prior, which remitted without treatment. He denied any significant medical history, including smoking or exposure to solvents or chemicals.

Bladder neoplasm was initially suspected after outpatient color Doppler ultrasonography and cystoscopy at a local hospital 3 days before admission. Upon admission, no abnormalities were noted on physical examination, serological examination, or urine cytology.

Computed tomography (CT) revealed an enlargement in the inferior part of the right ureter, with a suspected solid mass (Fig. 1a). Further intravenous urogram (IVU) demonstrated a "sponge-like" filling defect in the right lower enlarged ureteral lumen and right ureteral orifice inside the bladder, though there was no dilation of the upper urinary tract and renal pelvis (Fig. 1b). A ureteral tumour was detected preoperatively.

### Clinical update on acute cholecystitis and biliary pancreatitis: Between certainties and grey areas [^112zhTUw]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

10–15% of the general population is affected by cholelithiasis, and 20–40% of these individuals will develop complications. In most patients, the initial presentation of gallstone-related complications is acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC), which accounts for 10–15% of symptomatic cases. The most widely used guidelines worldwide for the management of ACC are the Tokyo Guidelines (TG) and the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines. In many aspects, the TG are in alignment with the recommendations of the WSES. However, there are still some differences between the TG and the WSES guidelines.

Our review particularly focuses on the grey and controversial areas in the management of ACC and acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP). These areas remain under-addressed despite the breadth of prior published literature.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^113pQ1Xi]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation and treatment of patients with gallbladder stones and abdominal pain are subject to change. The symptom criteria for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis differ across international guidelines. Although biliary colic is frequently resolved after cholecystectomy, non-biliary symptoms persist in up to 40 percent of patients. This review guides surgeons on how to tailor diagnosis and treatment in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.

Qfitlia at a fixed dose, including 80 mg once monthly, is not approved or recommended for use. In the 270 patients in the Qfitlia clinical studies who received the fixed dose (non-AT-based dose) once monthly regimen, 17% experienced gallbladder events, and 4% (11 patients) underwent cholecystectomy.

In 286 patients who received the AT-DR, 3.8% experienced gallbladder events, and 0.3% (1 patient) underwent cholecystectomy. All but one of the patients who underwent cholecystectomy resumed Qfitlia after surgery. One patient who started on fixed dosing experienced cholangitis and pancreatitis caused by gallstone disease more than a year after cholecystectomy while receiving AT-DR.

Patients diagnosed with acute or regallbladder disease most commonly presented with epigastric pain, generalized abdominal pain, indigestion, nausea, and/or vomiting. If gallbladder disease is suspected, appropriate imaging and clinical follow-up are indicated. Consider alternative treatment for hemophilia in patients with a history of symptomatic gallbladder disease. Consider interruption or discontinuation of Qfitlia if gallbladder disease occurs.

### Gallstones top to toe: What the radiologist needs to know [^117Gskxv]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

**Key points**: Gallstone-related pathology is on the increase in the Western world. Gallstones can be located within the gallbladder, migrate into the biliary tree, or exist outside the pancreaticobiliary system, leading to associated pathology. Imaging of gallstones and related pathology requires a multimodality approach.

### An uncommon late complication of appendicitis [^114upu41]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010).

A 10-year-old boy presented with a 2.5-week history of right leg pain and limp. A right flank mass was noted by a parent on the day of presentation. The child's past medical history was remarkable for perforated appendicitis treated with an interval laparoscopic appendectomy 2 years before this presentation. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography revealed a retroperitoneal mass with calcifications, suggestive of a retained appendicolith with abscess formation. This case illustrates the importance of considering very late complications of appendicitis in patients presenting with fever and abdominal or flank pain or masses.

### Restrictive strategy versus usual care for cholecystectomy in patients with gallstones and abdominal pain (SECURE): a multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, non-inferiority trial [^116KhQ8g]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

International guidelines advise laparoscopic cholecystectomy to treat symptomatic, uncomplicated gallstones. Usual care regarding cholecystectomy is associated with practice variation and persistent post-cholecystectomy pain in 10–41% of patients. We aimed to compare the non-inferiority of a restrictive strategy with stepwise selection against usual care to assess the (in)efficient use of cholecystectomy.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, non-inferiority study in 24 academic and non-academic hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients aged 18–95 years with abdominal pain and ultrasound-proven gallstones or sludge were enrolled. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to either usual care, where the selection for cholecystectomy was at the surgeon's discretion, or a restrictive strategy with stepwise selection for cholecystectomy. For the restrictive strategy, cholecystectomy was advised for patients who met all five pre-specified criteria of the triage instrument:
	1. Severe pain attacks
	2. Pain lasting 15–30 minutes or longer
	3. Pain located in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant
	4. Pain radiating to the back
	5. A positive pain response to simple analgesics

	- Randomisation was done using an online program, implemented into a web-based application using blocks of variable sizes, and stratified for centre type (academic versus non-academic and a high vs low number of patients), sex, and body-mass index. Physicians and patients were masked for study-arm allocation until after completion of the triage instrument.

### Restrictive strategy vs usual care for cholecystectomy in patients with abdominal pain and gallstones: 5-year follow-up of the SECURE randomized clinical trial [^112q6sZS]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

- **Study design and participants**: The design of the SECURE trial study has been previously reported. In brief, the SECURE trial was a multicenter, randomized, parallel-arm, noninferiority study conducted in 24 academic and nonacademic centers in the Netherlands. The initial study and five-year follow-up were approved by the medical ethics commission (METC: 2013–129) and the boards of directors of all participating hospitals. All included patients provided written informed consent before participation in the trial. The trial was registered in the Netherlands National Trial Register and was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the updated Helsinki Declaration of 2013. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guidelines were adhered to.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Eligible participants were patients aged 18 to 95 years with abdominal pain and ultrasound-proven gallstones, who were referred to a surgical outpatient clinic to discuss cholecystectomy. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were previously detailed in the trial protocol and initial study.

- **Randomization and masking**: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either usual care or a restrictive strategy prior to their first visit at the surgical outpatient clinic. Randomization was stratified based on the center (academic vs. nonacademic and high vs. low volume), sex, and body mass index. At the first visit, the treating physician used a digital triage instrument to evaluate whether the patients met five prespecified criteria.

### Hepato-pancreato-biliary emergencies for the acute care surgeon: Etiology, diagnosis and treatment [^116eKPwD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Acute calculous cholecystitis (AC) is an acute inflammation of the gallbladder, commonly seen as a complication of cholelithiasis, affecting up to 20% of patients with symptomatic gallstones. Most patients report a history of transient colic pain in the right upper quadrant. However, acute presentations at healthcare facilities are typically more prolonged and are associated with additional symptoms, such as nausea or vomiting after consuming high-fat foods.

Obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone or sludge leads to dilation and increased internal pressure within the gallbladder. This causes biliary stasis and microbial proliferation. Persistent obstruction results in reduced venous outflow, which dilates capillaries and lymphatics, leading to gallbladder wall edema and thickening. Eventually, areas of hemorrhage and necrosis may occur due to vascular occlusion. Imaging and exploration may reveal fluid and air within the gallbladder wall. If ischemia and necrosis affect the posterior wall (adjacent to the liver), a pericholecystic abscess that erodes into the liver is common.

Notably, specific complications such as perforation, biliary peritonitis, pericholecystic abscess, and biliary fistula (occurring between the gallbladder and duodenum, colon, or stomach) can significantly alter clinical presentation and increase morbidity and mortality. Uncommon complications include Bouveret's syndrome, gastric outlet obstruction, biliary ileus, and gallstone-related small bowel obstruction.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Nrvi1]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Optimal management of acute biliary disease should include an assessment for possible choledocholithiasis (CBDS). Various diagnostic guidelines have been developed by expert bodies for this purpose, but uncertainties remain about their performance in wider practice.

For this systematic review and meta‐analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus for studies on adult populations published in English between 2000 and August 2024. All studies pertaining to the performance of diagnostic guidelines developed or adopted by regional, national, or international professional bodies were considered. However, we excluded diagnostic tools or scoring systems developed locally with limited scopes, such as those employed by a single institution or a group of related institutions.

Performance measures were extracted or derived in the forms of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative. A meta‐analysis using a multilevel random effects model was performed to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity for the reviewed guidelines. Their performance was summarized using summary ROC curves and AUCs. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the PROBAST risk of bias and applicability tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024581409).

Of 1892 records identified, 31 studies were eligible with data available, all of which had a low to moderate risk of overall bias. All studies focused on one or more of three international guidelines: the ASGE guidelines in 2010, the revised ASGE guidelines in 2019, and the ESG.

### Surgical approach to a left-sided gallbladder [^115hVbbx]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Biliary colic is a pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium thought to be caused by functional gallbladder spasm from a temporary obstructing stone in the gallbladder neck, cystic duct, or common bile duct. A 56-year-old man presented with frequent episodes of typical biliary colic. At initial laparoscopy, the gallbladder was absent from its anatomic location. Further inspection revealed a left-sided gallbladder (LSGB), suspended from liver segment 3.

Preoperative ultrasound, the most common imaging modality for symptomatic gallstones, has a low positive predictive value for detecting LSGB (2.7%). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) was delayed to attain additional imaging. A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstrated the gallbladder left of the falciform ligament with the cystic duct entering the common hepatic duct from the left. The patient underwent an elective LC 8 weeks later. The critical view of safety is paramount to safe surgical dissection and could be safely achieved for LSGB.

### Ursodiol 400 mg [^117Nn3fY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Alternative therapies:

- **Watchful waiting**: Watchful waiting has the advantage that no therapy may ever be required. For patients with silent or minimally symptomatic stones, the rate of development of moderate-to-severe symptoms or gallstone complications is estimated to be between 2% and 6% per year, leading to a cumulative rate of 7% to 27% in 5 years. Presumably, the rate is higher for patients already having symptoms.

- **Cholecystectomy**: For patients with symptomatic gallstones, surgery offers the advantage of immediate and permanent stone removal but carries a high risk in some patients. About 5% of cholecystectomized patients have residual symptoms or retained common duct stones. The spectrum of surgical risk varies as a function of age and the presence of disease other than cholelithiasis.

Mortality rates for cholecystectomy in the U.S. show that women in good health or who have only moderate systemic disease and are under 49 years of age have the lowest surgical mortality rate (0.054); men in all categories have a surgical mortality rate twice that of women. Common duct exploration quadruples the rates in all categories. The rates rise with each decade of life and increase tenfold or more in all categories with severe or extreme systemic disease.

### Honeycomb gallbladder: A very rare cause of right upper quadrant pain [^116vbLGZ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Honeycomb gallbladder is a rare congenital malformation of the gallbladder. In some cases, it may be asymptomatic, whereas in others, it may lead to symptoms consistent with biliary colic even in the absence of cholelithiasis. We present the clinical and imaging findings of a case of a 10-year-old boy who was admitted to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a honeycomb gallbladder. Honeycomb gallbladder is safely diagnosed with ultrasonography, which should be part of the investigation of patients with right upper quadrant pain in the emergency department.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® right upper quadrant pain: 2022 update [^111s74rW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Acute right upper quadrant pain is one of the most common presenting symptoms in hospital emergency departments and outpatient settings. Although gallstone-related acute cholecystitis is a primary consideration in diagnosis, various extrabiliary sources, including hepatic, pancreatic, gastroduodenal, and musculoskeletal origins, should also be considered. This document focuses on the diagnostic accuracy of imaging studies specifically evaluating acute right upper quadrant pain, with biliary etiologies, such as acute cholecystitis and its complications, being the most common.

An additional consideration of extrabiliary sources, such as acute pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, ascending cholangitis, liver abscess, hepatitis, and painful liver neoplasms, remains pertinent in the appropriate clinical context. The use of radiographs, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, CT, and MRI for these indications is discussed.

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies, such as the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence.

### A patient with abdominal pain and markedly elevated transaminase levels after cholecystectomy [^115nbJYv]. Nature Clinical Practice Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

A 33-year-old white female with a history of cholecystectomy presented to the emergency department with intermittent severe abdominal pain radiating from the left upper quadrant to the right upper quadrant, associated with nausea and emesis. Three weeks previously, the patient had presented to the emergency department with similar abdominal pain. Laboratory investigations had revealed elevated bilirubin, transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase levels. At that time, pain and liver chemistry test results improved, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 3. She denied a history of alcohol use, new medications, or the ingestion of other toxins.

- **Investigations**: History and physical examination, liver chemistry tests, viral hepatitis serology tests, autoimmune serology tests, abdominal ultrasound, liver biopsy, and an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram.

- **Diagnosis**: Choledocholithiasis.

- **Management**: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram with sphincterotomy, removal of an 8 mm distal common bile duct stone, and pancreatic stent placement.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116cT8D5]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review has two main limitations. First, the included studies have drawn on different patient sources, which can be broadly divided into three categories: (i) patients with acute biliary presentation identified via multiple records; (ii) patients who have undergone ERCP or EUS identified from an endoscopic database; and (iii) patients with certain clinical diagnoses such as pancreatitis. It is conceivable that patients from different sources may have different underlying characteristics, with perhaps the most important example being possible higher pretest probabilities for CBDS when patients were drawn from the ERCP database. However, we argue that this is unlikely to affect the outcome of the meta-analysis because sensitivity and specificity, the two measures we have focused on, are intrinsic to the guidelines and are prevalence-invariant. Moreover, although there is between-study heterogeneity, particularly with respect to the ASGE 2010 guidelines, our sensitivity analysis suggests the impact is small in magnitude; for instance, in the worst case of ASGE 2010, its AUC has changed from 0.65 to 0.71 only after excluding outliers.

Second, we have opted to test the guideline similarity using the likelihood ratio test because included studies are shared between the guidelines, making the data dependent. Although this test has indicated that the guidelines are dissimilar, we would like to note that (i) likelihood testing is inherently anticonservative and may overstate the dissimilarities, and (ii) the absolute differences in AUCs between the guidelines, even if they exist, are not substantial.

### Emergency biliary sonography: Utility of common bile duct measurement in the diagnosis of cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis [^115nf4f8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Measurement of the common bile duct (CBD) has traditionally been considered an integral part of gallbladder sonography, but accurate identification of the CBD can be difficult for novice sonographers.

- **Objective**: To determine the prevalence of isolated sonographic CBD dilation in emergency department (ED) patients with cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis without laboratory abnormalities or other pathologic findings on biliary ultrasound.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review on two separate ED patient cohorts between June 2000 and June 2010. The first cohort comprised all ED patients undergoing a biliary ultrasound and subsequent cholecystectomy for presumed cholecystitis. The second cohort consisted of all ED patients receiving a biliary ultrasound who were ultimately diagnosed with choledocholithiasis. Ultrasound data and contemporaneous laboratory values were collected. Postoperative gallbladder pathology reports and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) reports were used as the criterion standard for final diagnosis.

- **Results**: Of 666 cases of cholecystitis, there were 251 (37.7%) with a dilated CBD > 6 mm and only 2 cases (0.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0–0.7%) of isolated CBD dilation with an otherwise negative ultrasound and normal laboratory values. Of 111 cases of choledocholithiasis, there were 80 (72.0%) with a dilated CBD and only 1 case (0.9%; 95% CI 0.0–2.7%) with an otherwise negative ultrasound and normal laboratory values.

- **Conclusion**: The prevalence of isolated sonographic CBD dilation in cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis cases was low, with rare instances presenting without other pathological findings on ultrasound or laboratory abnormalities.

### Vomiting gallstones as a presenting feature of small bowel obstruction secondary to inflammatory stricture [^1148SsTM]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with symptoms caused by gallstones are common on a surgical take. Understanding the different ways in which this common condition can present is important to enable the correct diagnosis and thus management plan. The immediate management of gallstones depends on the presenting features and can range from analgesia to surgical intervention. Obstructive cases require intervention, either by ERCP or surgery; the non-obstructive cases are usually left to settle before an elective operation at a later date. In surgery, the presence of a clinical sign where it "should not be" can be a sign of another underlying pathology, embodying the essence of surgery — to assimilate seemingly disparate pieces of information and act in a way to treat the cause. This case study highlights a rare presentation of one disease state, in vomiting of gallstones, that raised the diagnosis of another pathology, a small bowel obstruction.

- **Pathophysiology**: Choledocholithiasis is caused by biliary stones, which can be divided into cholesterol stones (> 70% cholesterol), mixed stones (30–70% cholesterol), and pigmented stones (< 30% cholesterol).

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of choledocholithiasis include RUQ pain, nausea, and vomiting. Complications of the disease include jaundice, acute pancreatitis, and acute cholangitis.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Percutaneous biliary stone procedures in choledocholithiasis are associated with a mortality rate of 1.4%.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^117VRkes]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Worldwide, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most common abdominal surgical procedure, accounting for over 750,000 operations in the United States and approximately 70,000 operations in the UK each year. A recent study of National Health Service data showed that the total number of cholecystectomies annually increased by 72.2 percent between 2000 and 2019, rising from 39,022 to 67,204. Although the number of laparoscopic cholecystectomies has increased over recent decades, international guidelines have provided no reason to broaden the indication for surgery. The 5 percent increase in the prevalence of gallbladder stones, from 15 to 20 percent, does not explain the exponential increase in cholecystectomy numbers.

In Europe, approximately one-fifth of the population has gallbladder stones. The majority of gallbladder stones consist primarily of cholesterol (over 90 percent), whereas a minority are black (bilirubin) and brown (bacterial products) pigmented stones. Predisposing factors include obesity, female sex, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, but only one in five develops symptoms. Symptomatic patients mostly suffer from typical symptoms of biliary colic. Frequent episodes of biliary colic or complicated gallstone disease (such as choledocholithiasis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis) are accepted indications for cholecystectomy. However, in most patients, gallstones remain without symptoms and are not the primary cause of abdominal pain. Patients with abdominal pain and uncomplicated symptomatic cholecystolithiasis are confronted with two options: wait.

### Gallstones top to toe: What the radiologist needs to know [^116iJ9kQ]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

In rare cases, there can be retrograde passage of gallstones into the common hepatic duct or the right or left main hepatic ducts, or stones can form in intrahepatic ducts due to biliary stasis.

If a gallstone passes down the common bile duct and comes to rest at the ampulla of Vater, it may block the drainage of the pancreatic duct causing back pressure on the pancreatic cells and resulting in gallstone pancreatitis. These patients present with epigastric pain radiating to the back, and the severity ranges from mild to severe. There is significant mortality associated with severe pancreatitis, and critically ill patients should be managed in a high dependency or intensive care monitored environment. While imaging is not usually required or indicated to confirm the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, an ultrasound of the gallbladder can confirm or rule out the presence of gallstones. CT abdomen/pelvis is best performed 48 h after the onset of symptoms to assess for complications of pancreatitis, such as peripancreatic collections or pancreatic necrosis (Fig. 20).

- **Fig. 20**: Axial contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen (a) and axial fat-suppressed T2-weighted MRI of the abdomen (b) in the same patient demonstrating extensive inflammation and oedema of the pancreas secondary to gallstone pancreatitis with a peripancreatic collection (arrow).

In general, larger gallstones are more likely to obstruct higher in the common bile duct and, as such, are more likely to cause obstructive jaundice or cholangitis. Smaller gallstones are more likely to cause pancreatitis as they more freely pass.

### The efficacy of intravenous lidocaine and its side effects in comparison with intravenous morphine sulfate in patients admitted to the ED with right upper abdominal pain suspected of biliary colic [^117TZcjU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Intravenous (IV) lidocaine can be used as an analgesic in acute pain management in the emergency department (ED). The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of IV lidocaine in comparison with IV morphine in acute pain management in the ED.

This double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted on adult patients (18–64 years) with right upper abdominal pain suspected of biliary colic who required pain management. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either IV lidocaine (5 cc = 100 mg) or morphine sulfate (5 cc = 5 mg). In both groups, patients' pain scores were recorded and assessed by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at baseline, and at 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes after drug administration. Adverse side effects of lidocaine and morphine sulfate, as well as changes in vital signs, were also recorded and compared.

A total of 104 patients were enrolled in the study, including 49 men and 55 women. IV lidocaine reduced pain in less time compared to morphine sulfate. The mean (± SD) baseline pain score was 8.23 (± 1.76) in the lidocaine group and 8.73 (± 0.96) in the morphine group. There was no significant difference in the mean (± SD) pain scores between the two groups during the study, except at NRS2 (10 minutes after drug administration), which was 5.05 (± 2.69) in the lidocaine group compared to 6.39 (± 2.06) in the morphine group, and at NRS4 (30 minutes after drug administration), which was significantly lower in the morphine group [3.84 (± 1.73) vs. 4.41 (± 2.82), P-value = 0.01]. Only 9 patients experienced adverse effects in either group.

The findings of this study suggest that IV lidocaine can be a good choice in pain management for patients with suspected biliary colic.

### Gallstones top to toe: What the radiologist needs to know [^116A2CKz]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Sagittal ultrasound imaging of a distended gallbladder with an impacted stone in the gallbladder neck shows mild associated gallbladder wall thickening (see Fig. 17a). In Fig. 17b, axial contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen in the same patient again demonstrates a distended gallbladder with an impacted hyperattenuating stone in the gallbladder neck. There is subtle associated fat stranding. These findings are consistent with a gallbladder mucocoele. The gallbladder wall thickening and fat stranding suggest possible empyema.

Mirizzi syndrome refers to a gallstone that is impacted in the cystic duct or neck of the gallbladder, causing extrinsic compression on the common bile duct and resulting in obstructive jaundice (see Fig. 18).

- **Figure 18 details**:
	- Maximum intensity projection (MIP)
	- Axial T2-weighted MRCP image of the biliary tree: The gallbladder is distended with extensive intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The common bile duct is normal in calibre. These appearances are consistent with Mirizzi syndrome, with a stone in Hartmann's pouch of the gallbladder causing extrinsic compression of the common hepatic duct.

Both biliary dilatation and the offending gallstone can be seen on ultrasound. However, cross-sectional imaging with MRI, CT, or ERCP may be needed to confirm that biliary dilatation is secondary to compression from a gallbladder/cystic duct stone rather than secondary to a CBD calculus.

- **Pancreaticobiliary system**:
	- The next anatomical location where gallstones can be found is outside the gallbladder but within the pancreaticobiliary system. When gallstones exit the gallbladder into the common bile tract, they can obstruct the pathway…

### An unusual manifestation of acute appendicitis with left flank pain [^112Sz2gM]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2008). Low credibility.

The author presents a case with an unusual presentation of early appendicitis. The patient initially presented with left-sided flank pain. A workup for nephrolithiasis, including a non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis, was negative for renal stones or hydronephrosis. After discharge, the patient presented one week later in the ED with right lower quadrant pain. A contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen revealed perforated appendicitis.

### Unenhanced helical CT in the investigation of acute flank pain [^116tBF7J]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Unenhanced helical CT has emerged as the imaging technique of choice for investigating patients presenting with acute flank pain and suspected nephroureteric stone disease. Several signs identifiable on unenhanced CT support a diagnosis of stone disease. However, there are many pitfalls that may confound a correct diagnosis. Some common pitfalls, along with methods to avoid such occurrences, will be discussed. A review of some common alternative diagnoses that may mimic the symptoms of nephroureteric stone disease is illustrated.

### A large choledochocystolithiasis mimicking Mirizzi syndrome [^111d4k9G]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old man presented with spontaneous severe epigastric pain, progressing and radiating to the back for the past three days. It was associated with epigastric tenderness, bilious vomiting, and jaundice. He had been intermittently experiencing these symptoms for the last year. There were no known comorbidities. An ultrasound showed a poorly visualized heterogeneous focus at the porta hepatis; due to the poor visualization, this could represent an enlarged calcified lymph node, a cystic duct calculus causing extrinsic compression, or a large sludge ball within the common bile duct (CBD), leading to dilatation of the common hepatic duct and intrahepatic biliary system.

Subsequent magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed a focal saccular dilatation of the middle part of the CBD, typifying a type I-B choledochal cyst, with a large heterogeneous focus within it representing choledochocystolithiasis. Later, a CT scan was performed for further characterization of surrounding anatomy and pathology, though it confused the appearance of choledochocystolithiasis for Mirizzi syndrome. Eventually, surgery and histopathology confirmed type I-B choledochocystolithiasis and chronic cholecystitis.

### Gallstone pancreatitis secondary to a pathological cystic duct stump in a setting of chronic pain syndrome: a diagnostic dilemma [^111WjUrv]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 32-year-old woman presented with epigastric pain. She had a history of chronic pain syndrome and had visited the emergency department several times over the past year. Notably, she did not consume alcohol. Four years prior, she had undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to gallstone pancreatitis. At presentation, her lipase level was 2020, while bilirubin levels were normal. MR cholangiopancreatography revealed a cystic structure resembling a gallbladder in the gallbladder fossa, which was connected to the biliary system and contained stones. A review of the histology confirmed that the gallbladder had indeed been removed. She subsequently underwent a laparoscopic re-cholecystectomy and experienced an unremarkable recovery.

### Surgical and nonsurgical management of gallstones [^112n3CtX]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis, or gallstones, is one of the most common and costly gastrointestinal diseases. The incidence of gallstones increases with age. At-risk populations include individuals with diabetes mellitus, those who are obese, women, rapid weight cyclers, and patients on hormone therapy or taking oral contraceptives. Most patients are asymptomatic, and gallstones are often discovered incidentally during ultrasonography or other abdominal imaging. Asymptomatic patients have a low annual rate of developing symptoms (about 2% per year).

Once symptoms appear, the usual presentation of uncomplicated gallstones is biliary colic, caused by the intermittent obstruction of the cystic duct by a stone. The pain is characteristically steady, usually moderate to severe in intensity, located in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant of the abdomen, lasts from one to five hours, and gradually subsides. If pain persists with the onset of fever or a high white blood cell count, it should raise suspicion for complications such as acute cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis, and ascending cholangitis. Ultrasonography is the best initial imaging study for most patients, although additional imaging studies may be indicated.

- **Management of acute biliary colic**: Pain control is mainly achieved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or narcotic pain relievers. Oral dissolution therapy is usually minimally successful and used only if the patient cannot undergo surgery. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the surgical choice for symptomatic and complicated gallstones, offering a shorter hospital stay.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^113DjeRR]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Quality assessment of 14 international guidelines on cholecystolithiasis showed that only five guidelines were suitable for clinical practice, as most recommendations were based on a low level of evidence. For example, the definition of symptomatic gallstone disease and the indication for cholecystectomy are poorly described. Most guidelines recommend cholecystectomy in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis or biliary colic; however, both conditions are ill-defined.

Table 1 summarizes guidelines and criteria sets for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis. Most guidelines refer to the Rome criteria to define symptomatic gallstone disease: pain in severe attacks, located in the epigastrium or upper right quadrant, and lasting 15–30 minutes or longer.

- **The Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland commission (2016)**: Modified the criteria to epigastric or upper right abdominal pain, often radiating to the back, lasting from several minutes to hours, and frequently occurring during the night.
- **The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract**: Similar criteria with temporary epigastric or upper right abdominal pain, radiation to the right flank or back, and nausea.
- **The European Association for the Study of the Liver**: Reported more than 10 criteria.

The various symptoms and criteria reported in these guidelines illustrate the lack of consensus among healthcare professionals.

### Symptomatic cholelithiasis of a remnant gallbladder after open cholecystectomy [^115td62r]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain, particularly in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) in a patient with a history of cholecystectomy, known as postcholecystectomy syndrome, requires a broad differential diagnosis. Pathology of a retained gallbladder remnant is an exceedingly rare etiology of this pain.

- **Case report**: A 49-year-old woman who had previously undergone an open cholecystectomy presented to the emergency department with several hours of postprandial RUQ pain and emesis. Liver function tests and lipase were not significantly elevated. RUQ ultrasonography revealed a cystic structure containing a stone with mild prominence of the common bile duct at 7 mm, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography confirmed the presence of a remnant gallbladder without common bile duct obstruction. Her pain subsided, she tolerated a diet, and was discharged with a referral for an elective cholecystectomy.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: Abdominal pain is the most common chief complaint of patients presenting to the emergency department in the United States, and emergency physicians routinely encounter patients with postcholecystectomy syndrome. Emergency physicians should not exclude the possibility of remnant gallbladder pathology, such as symptomatic cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, in patients presenting with symptoms concerning for biliary colic, even if the patient has undergone previous cholecystectomy.

### Recurrent gallstone ileus: Beware of the faceted stone [^111oLRFi]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A 73-year-old man with gallstone disease was admitted with right upper quadrant abdominal pain. He was treated for cholecystitis with intravenous antibiotics. Two days later, he reported new onset left iliac fossa pain, with tenderness and guarding. An abdominal X-ray demonstrated small bowel obstruction, and a CT scan demonstrated an impacted gallstone within the proximal ileum. He was treated for gallstone ileus and underwent an uncomplicated laparotomy, small bowel enterotomy, and removal of a faceted gallstone.

Three months later, the patient re-presented with generalized abdominal pain, guarding, and rebound tenderness. Small bowel obstruction was again demonstrated with an impacted gallstone within the distal ileum seen on CT scan. A second laparotomy revealed two further faceted gallstones, which were removed through an enterotomy. The densely adherent gallbladder to the duodenum precluded a surgical repair of the cholecystoduodenal fistula. He made an uneventful recovery and was subsequently discharged home.

### ACR appropriateness criteria right upper quadrant pain [^115opEoo]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Although right upper quadrant pain is a very common clinical presentation, it can be nonspecific. However, acute cholecystitis is very often the diagnosis of exclusion. This review focuses on the recommended imaging evaluation in the most commonly encountered clinical scenarios presenting with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, including suspected biliary disease, suspected acute cholecystitis, and suspected acalculous cholecystitis. This document aims to clarify the appropriate utilization of the many imaging procedures that are available and commonly employed in these clinical settings. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

Guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Reltone 400 mg [^1128Cyxc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Alternative therapies include watchful waiting and cholecystectomy.

- **Watchful waiting**: This approach has the advantage that no therapy may ever be required. For patients with silent or minimally symptomatic stones, the rate of developing moderate-to-severe symptoms or gallstone complications is estimated to be between 2% and 6% per year, leading to a cumulative rate of 7% to 27% in 5 years. Presumably, the rate is higher for patients already exhibiting symptoms.

- **Cholecystectomy**: For patients with symptomatic gallstones, surgery offers the advantage of immediate and permanent stone removal but carries a high risk in some patients. About 5% of cholecystectomized patients have residual symptoms or retained common duct stones. The spectrum of surgical risk varies as a function of age and the presence of disease other than cholelithiasis. Women in good health or who have only moderate systemic disease and are under 49 years of age have the lowest surgical mortality rate (0.054); men in all categories have a surgical mortality rate twice that of women. Common duct exploration quadruples the rates in all categories. The rates increase with each decade of life and rise tenfold or more in all categories with severe or extreme systemic disease.

### Alternative diagnoses to stone disease on unenhanced CT to investigate acute flank pain [^1152jgsx]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute flank pain is a common problem in emergency medicine. Although the most frequent cause is urolithiasis, many other entities can produce the same clinical presentation. In many institutions, unenhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is employed in this setting. One of the major advantages of unenhanced CT is its ability to detect other pathologies causing flank pain. In this pictorial review, we present the CT findings of pathologies other than stone disease in patients experiencing acute flank pain.

### Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs for biliary colic [^1177RydH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis refers to the presence of gallstones, which are concretions that form in the biliary tract, usually in the gallbladder. It is one of the most common surgical problems worldwide and is particularly prevalent in most Western countries. Biliary colic is the term used for gallbladder pain experienced by a person with gallstones and without overt infection around the gallbladder. It is the most common manifestation of cholelithiasis, observed in over one-third of people with gallstones over the course of 10 or more years. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used to relieve biliary colic pain, but their role needs further elucidation. They may decrease the frequency of short-term complications such as mild forms of acute cholecystitis, jaundice, cholangitis, and acute pancreatitis, but they may also increase the occurrence of more severe and possibly life-threatening adverse events such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal function impairment, cardiovascular events, or milder events such as abdominal pain, drowsiness, headache, dizziness, or cutaneous manifestations.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of NSAIDs in people with biliary colic.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), and ClinicalTrials.gov until July 2016. We applied no language limitation.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials.

### Left flank pain as the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis: A report of a case with an initial misdiagnosis [^116RsY8r]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is not uncommon in an emergency department (ED). It typically manifests as upper abdominal pain, sometimes with radiation of pain to the back and flank region. However, isolated left flank pain as the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis is very rare and not previously identified in the literature. In this report, we present a case of acute pancreatitis presenting solely with left flank pain. Initially, negative findings on an ultrasound led to a misdiagnosis of "acute pyelonephritis or other renal diseases". A second radiographic evaluation with computed tomography revealed pancreatitis in the tail with abnormal fluid collected extending to the left peri-renal space. We performed a literature review and discussed this rare occurrence of acute pancreatitis, along with the clinical pitfalls in this case.

### A rare cause of abdominal pain with fever [^113SB7d1]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

An 89-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a one-month history of upper right quadrant pain that worsened over the last three days and was accompanied by fever and chills. On physical examination, he had scleral icterus and right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory findings showed hyperbilirubinemia, elevated liver enzymes, and C-reactive protein. The patient was admitted with suspicion of acute cholangitis and started on antibiotics. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed the presence of a juxtapapillary diverticulum in the second portion of the duodenum, which was confirmed by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, along with upstream biliary tract ectasia. The imaging findings allowed us to diagnose Lemmel's syndrome. Due to potential surgical risk, a conservative approach was decided upon. The patient had a favorable course and was discharged home.
