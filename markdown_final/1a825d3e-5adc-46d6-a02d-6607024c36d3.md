## Question

Lump on low back

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate a "lump on the low back", preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and red flags. Then, I should categorize the lump by location and likely tissue plane. Next, I will build a prioritized differential diagnosis and map it to an imaging algorithm. After that, I need to integrate guideline-based principles on when to image and when to refer. Finally, I will outline management pathways and special scenarios, and close with a concise decision framework that ties the steps together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the essentials of the initial assessment, because I need to ensure we do not miss dangerous pathology early. I should verify onset and duration, rate of growth, associated pain or neurologic symptoms, constitutional features, trauma history, and skin changes, while also checking for red flags such as fever, night pain, weight loss, progressive neurologic deficits, or bowel/bladder dysfunction that would push me toward urgent imaging and specialty referral rather than watchful waiting [^115CcUuP] [^114hvKiN] [^116xcjhc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should categorize the lump by location and tissue plane before building a differential. A superficial subcutaneous mass suggests cysts, lipomas, or cutaneous tumors, whereas a deeper paraspinal mass raises concern for hematoma, abscess, or neoplasm, and a mass directly over the spine may implicate bony or epidural processes; this anatomic framing will guide both imaging and urgency of referral, so I need to check palpability, mobility, and depth carefully on exam [^116nq8K2] [^111E9Haa].

> Next, I will construct a prioritized differential, but wait, let me verify that I am aligning likelihood with both location and clinical features. Common benign entities include epidermal inclusion cysts, lipomas, and ganglion cysts; inflammatory or infectious mimics include abscesses and atypical mycobacterial infections; traumatic mimics include hematomas, which can be misleading; and malignant considerations include soft-tissue sarcomas and metastases, with pain, rapid growth, firmness, and fixation increasing suspicion and lowering the threshold for advanced imaging and biopsy [^116nq8K2] [^111E9Haa].

> I will now examine the imaging algorithm, and I need to ensure it matches evidence-based practice. For a superficial, mobile, long-standing, painless lesion under about 5 cm without concerning features, ultrasound is a reasonable first-line to characterize cystic versus solid and to assess vascularity; for indeterminate or larger lesions, or when malignancy is a concern, MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast and mapping for surgical planning; plain radiographs are generally low yield for soft-tissue masses but may help if calcifications or bony involvement are suspected; and I should double-check that I am not over-ordering imaging in the absence of red flags, given the risk of incidental findings and overtreatment [^115v6i5N] [^115zTgRL] [^117HsUw6].

> But wait, what if the "lump" is actually a manifestation of spinal pathology rather than a primary soft-tissue mass; I should confirm that I am not conflating radicular pain syndromes with a mass. If the clinical picture is dominated by low back pain with leg pain, paresthesias, or weakness, I need to screen for lumbosacral radiculopathy and use MRI selectively when symptoms persist beyond about 4–6 weeks or when progressive neurologic deficits or surgical candidacy emerge, recognizing that early routine imaging does not improve outcomes in non-specific low back pain [^116p5cdo] [^116xcjhc] [^113cvKB1].

> Let me consider special scenarios that change pretest probabilities and urgency. In children, I should keep infantile hemangioma on the differential, especially lumbosacral or perineal lesions that carry higher risks of ulceration and associated structural anomalies; in post-traumatic presentations, I must be cautious not to mislabel a sarcoma as a hematoma, and if the story does not fit or the mass persists, I should escalate to MRI and consider biopsy; in immunocompromised hosts, I should broaden infectious differentials and lower thresholds for imaging and culture; and in pregnancy, I need to avoid ionizing radiation and favor ultrasound and MRI when indicated [^115PW6xU] [^111E9Haa] [^115v6i5N].

> I should confirm management pathways now that the diagnostic steps are clearer. For benign-appearing lesions with reassuring imaging, observation or simple excision under local anesthesia is reasonable; for indeterminate or suspicious lesions, core needle biopsy provides tissue diagnosis and guides definitive management; and for confirmed malignancy, referral to a musculoskeletal oncologist and staging with MRI of the whole compartment and chest CT are standard, with surgical planning integrated with oncology and radiology teams [^117Fte4M].

> Hold on, I should verify that my imaging discipline aligns with high-value care principles. I need to avoid routine imaging for non-specific low back pain without red flags, because it does not improve outcomes and may drive unnecessary procedures; instead, I should reserve MRI for severe progressive neurologic deficits, suspected serious pathology, or persistent symptoms beyond about 4–6 weeks, and I should communicate clearly with patients about the risks of incidental findings and the limited yield of early imaging in straightforward cases [^113cvKB1] [^114hvKiN] [^116xcjhc].

> Let me reconsider the decision framework to ensure internal consistency. If the mass is superficial, long-standing, mobile, and painless, ultrasound is a sensible first step; if ultrasound is indeterminate or features are concerning, proceed to MRI; if the mass is deep, fixed, painful, rapidly growing, or associated with systemic symptoms, go directly to MRI and expedite referral; and if the presentation is primarily low back pain with leg symptoms rather than a discrete mass, follow radiculopathy pathways with selective MRI rather than mass-directed algorithms [^115v6i5N] [^117HsUw6] [^116p5cdo].

> Finally, I need to ensure the patient receives clear counseling on red flags and follow-up. I should instruct the patient to seek urgent care for new fever, night pain, weight loss, rapidly enlarging mass, new neurologic deficits, or bowel/bladder changes, and I should arrange timely reassessment if the lump changes character or fails to behave as expected on imaging, because early recognition of atypical evolution can prevent delays in diagnosing aggressive disease [^115CcUuP] [^114hvKiN].

A lump on the low back is most often a **benign soft-tissue mass** such as a lipoma, epidermal inclusion cyst, or sebaceous cyst, but it can also represent a pilonidal cyst, abscess, or, less commonly, a malignancy like sarcoma or metastasis [^116nq8K2]. Evaluation should start with a **focused history and exam** to assess pain, size, mobility, skin changes, and systemic symptoms, followed by **ultrasound for superficial lesions** and MRI for deep, large, or suspicious masses [^115v6i5N] [^115zTgRL]. Management is guided by diagnosis: benign lesions may be observed or excised, while suspicious or symptomatic masses warrant biopsy and oncologic referral [^113XrvmZ] [^117Fte4M].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for a low back lump includes:

| **Category** | **Common lesions** | **Less common lesions** |
|-|-|-|
| Benign soft-tissue tumors | - Lipoma <br/> - Epidermal inclusion cyst <br/> - Sebaceous cyst <br/> - Ganglion cyst | - Fibroma <br/> - Neurofibroma <br/> - Hemangioma |
| Infectious/inflammatory lesions | - Pilonidal cyst <br/> - Abscess <br/> - Cellulitis | - Tuberculosis <br/> - Atypical mycobacterial infection |
| Malignant tumors | - Sarcoma (e.g. liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma) <br/> - Metastatic carcinoma | - Lymphoma <br/> - Melanoma |
| Traumatic lesions | - Hematoma <br/> - Seroma | - Foreign body granuloma |
| Congenital/developmental lesions | - Dermoid cyst <br/> - Teratoma | - Extramedullary hematopoiesis |

---

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough **clinical evaluation** should include:

- **History**: Onset, duration, growth rate, pain, trauma, infection, systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss), family history.
- **Physical examination**: Size, consistency, mobility, tenderness, skin changes (erythema, sinus tract), temperature, pulsatility.
- **Red flag symptoms**: Rapid growth, firm/fixed mass, night pain, weight loss, fever, neurologic deficits.

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is essential for **characterization and diagnosis**:

- **Ultrasound**: First-line for superficial lesions; distinguishes cystic vs solid, vascularity, and guides biopsy [^1125MkZU].
- **MRI**: Gold standard for deep, large, or suspicious masses; evaluates extent, neurovascular involvement, and malignancy risk [^115v6i5N].
- **CT**: Useful for bony involvement or calcified lesions.
- **Plain radiography**: Limited utility; may show calcifications or bony abnormalities.

---

## Indications for biopsy

Biopsy is indicated for:

- Suspicious malignancy (rapid growth, firm/fixed, size > 5 cm, deep location).
- Persistent or recurrent lesions after conservative management.
- Lesions with atypical imaging features.

Biopsy options include **fine-needle aspiration (FNA)** for cytology and **core needle biopsy** for histopathology.

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **diagnosis and clinical context**:

- **Benign lesions**: Observation, aspiration, or surgical excision.
- **Malignant lesions**: Wide local excision, oncologic referral, adjuvant therapy (radiation, chemotherapy).
- **Infectious lesions**: Antibiotics, incision and drainage, debridement.
- **Pilonidal cyst**: Surgical excision, hygiene measures, hair removal.

---

## Potential complications

Potential complications vary by **lesion type and management**. Untreated benign lesions may enlarge, become infected, or cause cosmetic deformity, whereas malignant lesions can metastasize and lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Infectious lesions may progress to sepsis or chronic infection, and surgical interventions carry risks of infection, recurrence, and nerve injury.

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent for benign lesions** after complete excision, whereas malignant lesions have a guarded prognosis that depends on tumor type, stage, and treatment response. Infectious lesions generally have a good prognosis with appropriate treatment.

---

A low back lump is most often benign, but a **systematic approach** — history, exam, imaging, and selective biopsy — is essential to exclude malignancy or infection and guide management [^117HsUw6].

### Musculoskeletal mimics for lumbosacral radiculopathy. part 1: theoretical considerations [^116p5cdo]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy includes the exclusion of common musculoskeletal conditions that can cause similar symptoms. Neurology and physiatry physicians use history taking and physical examination findings to develop a differential diagnosis. Appropriate diagnostic testing is then utilized to narrow down this differential diagnosis to determine a working hypothesis of the cause of a patient's symptoms, leading to a treatment plan. There are stark limitations of patient symptoms and physical examination findings in making the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy and added value of a combination of symptoms and signs to distinguish patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy from patients with mimic disorders. Diagnostic tests have variable strengths and limitations in helping to confirm this diagnosis, contrasting the high sensitivity and lower specificity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the high specificity but lower sensitivity of electromyography (EMG). Further complexity is added to the task of making a diagnosis and setting a treatment plan by the fact that these disorders are common and interact with each other; they are present concomitantly in up to 25% of patients presenting for electrodiagnostic evaluation. A companion paper will review common musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy and provide tools to anchor testing for those conditions to the traditional neurological evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathy.

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^116xcjhc]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Diagnostic tests for low back pain (LBP) — imaging and other diagnostic testing: Lumbar spine x-rays are not recommended in patients with LBP without red flags for serious spinal pathology within the first 4 to 6 weeks, and among patients with evidence of radiculopathy, imaging in the acute setting is also not recommended; however, an imaging study may be appropriate when limitations from consistent symptoms have persisted for 1 month or more or when potentially serious pathology or progressive neurologic deficit(s) are concerns. Pretest probability and test characteristics are critical, as lumbosacral spine MRIs are more likely to be "abnormal" by age 40 in normal individuals and herniated discs are not infrequently found in asymptomatic teenagers and young adults; at present, no single imaging modality shows a clear overall advantage, though MRI is superior for soft tissues including intervertebral disc herniations. In the absence of moderate- to high-quality studies, additional diagnostic tests for LBP and spinal conditions are Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I), Low Confidence.

### MRI features of soft-tissue lumps and bumps [^115zTgRL]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Superficial soft-tissue lesions are frequently encountered by radiologists in everyday practice. Characterization of these soft-tissue lesions remains problematic, despite advances in imaging. By systematically using clinical history, anatomical location, and signal intensity characteristics on MRI images, one can determine the diagnosis for the subset of determinate lesions that have characteristic clinical and imaging features as well as narrow the differential diagnoses for lesions with non-specific or indeterminate characteristics. In this review, a spectrum of histologically proven benign and malignant superficial soft-tissue lesions from a single institution will be presented. In addition, a few tumour-like conditions will be included as they can be encountered during imaging of soft-tissue masses.

Paraspinal tumour-like lesions

Paraspinal tumour-like lesions are more common than primary paraspinal and spinal neoplasms. Where imaging, medical history and biological assessments are in agreement, traumatic disorders, degenerative disorders, infections and extramedullary haematopoiesis (EMH) can be easily diagnosed. Table 5 summarises clinical and imaging findings of paraspinal tumours mimics.

y, years; WI, weighted imaging

Traumatic disorders

The back, and especially the lower back, is subject to direct trauma. Diagnosis of a traumatic lesion is easy when there is a history of a traumatic event ahead of the appearance of a painful soft tissue mass with lesions on the overlying skin. In contrast, diagnosis becomes challenging when the interval between the traumatic event and observation of a palpable lump is prolonged; trauma is often underreported. Several types of lesions can occur.

Haematomas are the most frequent complication of soft tissue injury and exhibit characteristic features in all imaging modalities (Fig. 33). US demonstrates a well-defined, compressible fluid collection, which has low echogenicity and contains septa. Haemoglobin breakdown products produce a characteristic T2 hypointense signal on MRI. This effect is magnified by gradient-echo sequences, on which a 'blooming' artefact can be seen. The T1 and T2 signal intensities of haematomas evolve over times in line with evolving haemoglobin breakdown products. One should be cautious when diagnosing haematomas, because haematomas and soft tissue sarcomas can be difficult to differentiate clinically and radiologically. There are several case reports of sarcomas being misdiagnosed as haematomas, most commonly when the patient has a history of mild trauma.

### Low back pain [^1179CjUZ]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Imaging studies in low back pain — overall role and indications emphasize limited diagnostic value for routine use: Imaging modalities have frequent false positive and negative results, the primary utility of imaging lies in interventional and/or surgical planning or in determining the presence of serious medical conditions, and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the most useful tool. Routine ordering of imaging for low back pain should be discouraged, and current recommendations from the American College of Physicians are that (1) imaging is only indicated for severe progressive neurological deficits or when red flags are suspected, and (2) routine imaging does not result in clinical benefit and may lead to harm.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^117PxGrA]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for low back pain, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, NASS 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that there is no evidence whether:

- imaging findings, including spondylosis, correlate with the presence of LBP

- imaging findings contribute to decision-making in management

- lumbar spine X-ray is cost-effective for LBP lasting > 6 weeks in the absence of red flags

- unique MRI sequences can be considered preferential or optimal.

### Lumbar spine MRI for low back pain: indications and yield [^116i7t8Z]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Low back pain is one of the most common causes of physician visits in the United States with an enormous socioeconomic burden. Because of this burden, numerous studies have focused on its diagnosis and management. New technologies have been quickly adopted with the hope that they will improve our understanding of the physiopathology of the disease and assist us in alleviating patients' pain and discomfort. Unfortunately, previous studies have not been able to show that higher utilization of advanced imaging technology is associated with improvements in patient outcome. This article highlights practices that are evidence-based versus those that are common, or heterogeneous, but not supported by existing evidence. We also highlight outstanding areas for further research.

Conclusion

Clinicians and researchers should be encouraged to follow standardized practices in accordance with evidence-based medicine guidelines. The use of such guidelines will decrease variation in care, allowing researchers to more easily design and conduct comparative effectiveness studies of diagnostic imaging.

### Non-specific low back pain [^1118scP2]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Non-specific low back pain has become a major public health problem worldwide. The lifetime prevalence of low back pain is reported to be as high as 84%, and the prevalence of chronic low back pain is about 23%, with 11–12% of the population being disabled by low back pain. Mechanical factors, such as lifting and carrying, probably do not have a major pathogenic role, but genetic constitution is important. History taking and clinical examination are included in most diagnostic guidelines, but the use of clinical imaging for diagnosis should be restricted. The mechanism of action of many treatments is unclear, and effect sizes of most treatments are low. Both patient preferences and clinical evidence should be taken into account for pain management, but generally self-management, with appropriate support, is recommended and surgery and overtreatment should be avoided.

Incidence

Among all the relevant studies, the incidence of PPGP ranges from 4% to 76.4% depending on the definition used, the diagnostic means utilised (for example, patient history, pain questionnaires, clinical tests) and the design of the studies (retrospective or prospective).

As reported by Wu et al. on average, doctors' files verify the syndrome in about 20% fewer cases than patients' reports. The apparent geographical variation of reported PPGP incidence and severity, with higher rates in Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands, should be attributed to the increased awareness regarding this condition by healthcare providers and the public. However, the reported cases are spread among a wide variety of countries (Table 1) and across all continents, indicating that PPGP is a universal problem.

Using the definition described above and including only prospectively designed studies of large series of patients with objectively verified symptoms, the prevalence of PPGP is between 16% and 25%. Over the same large samples of pregnant women, the clinically persistent PPGP from the postpartum stage to 2 years after childbirth has a reported incidence of 5% to 8.5%.

Differential diagnosis

The PPGP diagnosis should be considered after the exclusion of painful visceral pathologies of the pelvis (urogenital, gastrointestinal), lower-back pain syndromes (lumbar disc lesion/prolapsed, radiculopathies, spondylolisthesis, rheumatism, sciatica, spinal stenosis or lumbar spine arthritis), bone or soft tissue infections (typical or atypical such as tuberculosis or syphilitic lesions of pubis), urinary tract infections, femoral vein thrombosis, obstetric complications (preterm labour, abruption, round ligament pain, chorioamnionitis), rupture of symphysis pubis, and bone or soft tissue tumours.

A thorough medical history, physical examination and appropriate laboratory tests should always be performed to successfully reach the diagnosis of PPGP. Obviously, a multidisciplinary approach and consultation may be needed, as this syndrome expands to a wide field of anatomically related medical specialties. An algorithm of the necessary diagnostic workup is presented in Figure 1.

### Thenar lumps: a review of differentials [^1152sYrY]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Most soft-tissue lumps in the hand are benign, with ganglions being the commonest, but in the thenar region, solid soft-tissue masses are more common than a ganglion. In this review, we focus on soft-tissue lesions (neoplastic and non-neoplastic) presenting as a palpable lump in this region. A specific diagnosis can often be reached using ultrasonography and/or magnetic resonance imaging. Most of these lesions are managed in local hospitals or primary care, whereas some are referred to specialist centres. This review article will help both general and musculoskeletal radiologists to diagnose and characterise these lesions, provide a guide for further imaging, and provide an insight into imaging features that may need specific investigations such as core biopsy, tertiary referral, and further review at multidisciplinary meetings.

### Ultrasound versus magnetic resonance imaging of soft-tissue lesions: competitive or complementary? [^115v6i5N]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Soft-tissue lumps and bumps are a common referral for imaging in children and adolescents. The etiology of these lesions includes benign non-tumorous lesions, as well as benign and malignant tumors. Some of these lesions have a characteristic imaging appearance but others do not and require tissue sampling to make a diagnosis. MRI typically provides the best overall characterization of soft-tissue masses; however, in some cases US provides complementary information to that provided by MRI that can help make a diagnosis.

### A subcutaneous nodule on the mid back [^111nXRC3]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely clinical diagnosis?
A. Epidermal cyst
B. Cutaneous dermoid cyst
C. Cutaneous Müllerian cyst
D. Apocrine hidrocystoma
E. Hidradenoma papilliferum

Answers:

A. Epidermal cyst–Incorrect. An epidermal cyst is a flesh-colored to yellowish, fluctuant cystic nodule with an overlying punctum representing the follicle from which the cyst develops. They commonly present on the trunk, but these cysts contain keratin debris rather than clear fluid as seen in this patient.
B. Cutaneous dermoid cyst–Incorrect. A cutaneous dermoid cyst is a firm, cystic nodule that generally presents in the first 5 years of life and can persist into adulthood. Dermoid cysts are the result of incomplete closure of the embryonic zones. They commonly present on the nasal root or lateral end of the eyebrow. Dermoid cysts can present on the trunk as well. These lesions contain other cutaneous appendages such as hair, sebaceous lobules, and eccrine glands.
C. Cutaneous Müllerian cyst–Correct. Cutaneous Müllerian cysts are rare, benign, solitary lesions that typically occur on the lower extremities of young women. Rarely, these cysts may present in unusual locations such as the back. They are theorized to develop from heterotopic fimbrial type Müllerian epithelium that form a cyst under the influence of ovarian hormones after puberty. Similar cysts occurring in males have been reported, but these are recognized as a distinct subtype of cutaneous ciliated cysts theorized to be of eccrine origin.
D. Apocrine hidrocystoma–Incorrect. Apocrine hidrocystomas are usually solitary lesions with a cystic cavity containing clear fluid and are more common in women. However, most hidrocystomas are smaller, about 1 to 3 mm in size. They generally present around the eyelids but have also been reported on the face and scalp as well.
E. Hidradenoma papilliferum–Incorrect. Hidradenoma papilliferum is a benign adenoma arising in the vulvar and perianal areas. Ectopic locations have been reported. The nodule itself is firm and not fluid filled despite pathology results showing cyst-like spaces with villi.

### Differentiating hip pathology from lumbar spine pathology: key points of evaluation and management [^1124MX3s]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of patients who have both hip and lumbar spine pathologies may be a challenge because overlapping symptoms may delay a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Common complaints of patients who have both hip and lumbar spine pathologies include low back pain with associated buttock, groin, thigh, and, possibly, knee pain. A thorough patient history should be obtained and a complete physical examination should be performed in these patients to identify the primary source of pain. Plain and advanced imaging studies and diagnostic injections can be used to further delineate the primary pathology and guide the appropriate sequence of treatment. Both the surgeon and the patient should understand that, although one pathology is managed, the management of the other pathology may be necessary because of persistent pain. The recognition of both entities may help reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosis, and the management of both entities in the appropriate sequence may help reduce the likelihood of persistent symptoms.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^111BgDf3]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis & treatment of low back pain — pain diagrams and assessment tools: In patients with low back pain (LBP), the guideline asks whether pain diagram findings differentiate the pain‑causing structure and whether assessment tools or questionnaires identify the cause of acute, subacute or chronic LBP; a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address these questions in this patient population, and the work group feels that in the specifically defined patient population it is unlikely that pain diagrams are going to elucidate the cause of LBP.

### Inflammatory back pain: the United States perspective [^113MWbVE]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Inflammatory back pain (IBP) is a relatively recent and well-accepted concept whose precise definition remains elusive. The definition of IBP varies by criteria set, as does its sensitivity and specificity regarding screening and case ascertainment in various clinical or epidemiologic settings. This article reviews the history of efforts to define IBP, particularly the criteria sets that have been built around its measurement, describes assessment of IBP in the clinical setting, and illustrates how IBP has been used in epidemiologic and clinical research.

### Low back pain [^112LAe3S]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain with radiating pain — imaging recommendations specify targeted use: In patients with severe or progressive neurologic deficits, prompt workup with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) is recommended. If patients are potential candidates for surgery or epidural steroid injections, MRI (or CT if unable to undergo MRI) is recommended. In the absence of these findings, there is no evidence that routine imaging affects treatment decisions or outcomes in these patients.

### Diagnostic imaging for low back pain: advice for high-value health care from the American College of Physicians [^114hvKiN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnostic imaging is indicated for patients with low back pain only if they have severe progressive neurologic deficits or signs or symptoms that suggest a serious or specific underlying condition. In other patients, evidence indicates that routine imaging is not associated with clinically meaningful benefits but can lead to harms. Addressing inefficiencies in diagnostic testing could minimize potential harms to patients and have a large effect on use of resources by reducing both direct and downstream costs. In this area, more testing does not equate to better care. Implementing a selective approach to low back imaging, as suggested by the American College of Physicians and American Pain Society guideline on low back pain, would provide better care to patients, improve outcomes, and reduce costs.

### Nociceptive, neuropathic, or nociplastic low back pain? The low back pain phenotyping (BACPAP) consortium's international and multidisciplinary consensus recommendations [^112Hut8Y]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

The potential to classify low back pain as being characterised by dominant nociceptive, neuropathic, or nociplastic mechanisms is a clinically relevant issue. Preliminary evidence suggests that these low back pain phenotypes might respond differently to treatments; however, more research must be done before making specific recommendations. Accordingly, the low back pain phenotyping (BACPAP) consortium was established as a group of 36 clinicians and researchers from 13 countries (five continents) and 29 institutions, to apply a modified Nominal Group Technique methodology to develop international and multidisciplinary consensus recommendations to provide guidance for identifying the dominant pain phenotype in patients with low back pain, and potentially adapt pain management strategies. The BACPAP consortium's recommendations are also intended to provide direction for future clinical research by building on the established clinical criteria for neuropathic and nociplastic pain. The BACPAP consortium's consensus recommendations are a necessary early step in the process to determine if personalised pain medicine based on pain phenotypes is feasible for low back pain management. Therefore, these recommendations are not ready to be implemented in clinical practice until additional evidence is generated that is specific to these low back pain phenotypes.

### Novel approach to characterising individuals with low back-related leg pain: cluster identification with latent class analysis and 12-month follow-up [^1138GCVm]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Trials evaluating treatments for low back pain (LBP), show at best moderate effect sizes. The heterogeneity of LBP patients within studies is one explanation for these results. This has stimulated research aiming to identify more homogeneous, clinically relevant subgroups of LBP patients, with the hope that these subgroups might respond more favourably to interventions or management approaches matched to the subgroup's characteristics or presenting symptoms.

One of the most common subgroup of LBP is back pain radiating to the leg, which represents about two thirds of back pain patients, in both primary and secondary care settings. Patients with low back-related leg pain (LBLP) suffer more severe pain and disability, take longer to recover and lose more time from work, compared to those with pain in the lower back alone.

When patients present with LBLP, once serious pathology (such as tumours, cauda equina compression, fracture, inflammatory causes) is ruled out, the differential diagnosis is between leg pain that is due to spinal nerve root involvement (commonly called sciatica) or to non-specific pain in the leg thought to be referred from structures in the back (e.g. disc/muscle/joint) but not involving the nerve root.

This is a rather broad brush categorisation however and currently there is a gap in the evidence regarding whether individual items from the clinical assessment, can be used to identify hitherto unrecognised subgroups of patients with LBLP who have distinct presentations of symptoms and characteristics. Early identification and differentiation of subgroups of LBLP may provide more help when informing patients about prognosis, tailoring treatment plans to match profiles and guiding the need for referrals to specialist services in a timely fashion.

The objective of this study was to use items from clinical assessment to identify new subgroups in an unselected primary care population consulting with LBLP. Statistical modelling, such as latent class analysis provides a method of classifying patients and may lead to the identification of clusters of patients with similar characteristics, over and above the binary diagnostic categories of sciatica or referred leg pain. Clusters identified in this way were compared for baseline demographic, pain, physical function, psychosocial and work features, risk of persistent disability and findings from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine. Key characteristics reflecting pain, disability, psychological status and perceived recovery were compared at 4 and 12 months and the clinical course, in terms of monthly pain and disability scores over 12 months for the individual clusters, was described and compared to that of the clinically defined groups of LBLP patients with and without a diagnosis of sciatica.

Study Design

A case of chronic low back pain caused by a glomus tumor that persisted more than 30 years is presented.

Objective

To emphasize the need to consider skin tumors in the differential diagnosis of low back pain.

Summary Of Background Data

Chronic low back pain can be caused by a myriad of factors. There are six relatively common skin tumors, which present as painful lesions. As seen in the reported case, if they occur in the lumbar region, they can cause low back pain.

Methods

A subject with low back pain underwent an excision biopsy of a localized area of tenderness where his symptoms were reproduced when light pressure was applied.

Results

Histology confirmed that a glomus tumor accounted for the subject's pain.

Conclusions

Painful skin tumors may cause low back pain and need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic low back pain.

### JOSPT perspectives for patients. low back pain: MRIs should be used sparingly in patients with low back pain [^115oiVJT]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Low back pain is very common, with 80% of people experiencing back pain at least once in their lifetimes. The good news is that a thorough physical examination can often determine the best course of management and whether you require imaging to rule out a serious problem. Often low back pain can be severe enough to make a patient think that an MRI is necessary. While MRI provides excellent pictures of your anatomy, it may not be able to pinpoint the specific source of your pain. A clinical commentary published in the November 2011 issue of JOSPT summarizes research that describes how the increased use of unnecessary imaging may lead to less than favorable results.

A 66-year-old Caucasian male was admitted following symptoms of intermittent umbilical pain aggravated after meals and associated with vomiting of contents. Physical examination revealed a tender, partially reducible swelling suspicious of complicated umbilical hernia. Abdominal x-ray revealed dilated small bowel loops which appeared consistent with clinical diagnosis. He underwent a laparotomy subsequently which revealed a small defect in the linea alba with viable small bowel and two firm mesenteric masses encroaching the lumen approximately two feet from the ileocaecal junction. The histology of the excised bowel and masses revealed that the tumour composed of bland spindle cells with slender to plump nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mesenteric fibromatosis are the most common primary tumours of the mesentery and constitute about 3.5% of all fibrous tissue tumours. Intra-abdominal desmoids are very rare and benign tumours but are very aggressive and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain.

Discussion

Clinical Course

A sexually active cisgender female adolescent with a two-week history of back pain presented to clinic with red urine, dysuria, nausea, and diarrhea. On examination, she was found to have CMT and negative STI screens. She was diagnosed with PID. The patient visited the ED for continued abdominal pain three days after initiating treatment for PID. Imaging ruled out tubular ovarian abscess (TOA). She later returned to her PCP's office with improved nausea and pain.

Final Diagnosis

Pelvic inflammatory disease.

Making a Diagnosis of PID

PID is a clinical diagnosis, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends presumptive treatment for women at risk of STIs with pelvic or lower abdominal pain AND at least one of the following four criteria: (1) no other cause for the illness can be identified, (2) CMT, (3) uterine tenderness, or (4) adnexal tenderness.

Supportive examination and laboratory findings include fever, vaginal discharge with white blood cells (WBCs) on microscopy, elevated CRP and ESR, and positive STI tests. These are not required for diagnosis. This patient had abdominal pain, CMT, and mildly elevated ESR. Timely diagnosis and prompt treatment should not wait for laboratory results and are imperative to avoid complications. Frequently, as with this patient, STI results may be negative as testing for many implicated pathogens is not readily accessible (see section "Developing a Differential for Abdominal and Flank Pain in a Sexually Active Adolescent Cisgender Female") and the available STI testing is conducted on a sample collected from the lower reproductive tract, not the upper reproductive organs.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine: recommendations for acquisition and image evaluation from the BACPAC spine imaging working group [^115gx6pQ]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality often used to depict spinal structural abnormalities that may cause low back pain (LBP). With its high soft tissue contrast, MRI allows assessment of multiple structures including intervertebral discs, nerve roots, contents of the central spinal canal, ligaments and facet joints. While MRI is superb at identifying tissue-specific pathology along the spine, the clinical relevance of these findings is often uncertain. Thus, diagnostic MRI for LBP is only recommended in certain patients. The American College of Physicians' guidelines for diagnostic imaging suggest immediate imaging when there are major risks (such as suspicion of cancer, spinal infection, cauda equina syndrome, or presence of severe neurological deficits), but advise deferral of imaging pending a trial of treatment in cases where there are weaker risk factors. Notably, only in a minority of patients can LBP be attributed to a specific pathology (e.g. vertebral fracture or disc herniation with nerve compression), while the great majority of patients are assigned a diagnosis of non-specific LBP (i.e. pain for which the distinct patho-anatomical basis cannot be determined).

Some lumbar MRI findings that are common in patients with LBP are also common in asymptomatic subjects, which makes it difficult to define a causal relationship in individual patients and has led to questions about the diagnostic value of such findings. However, some lumbar MRI findings are more prevalent in patients with LBP than in asymptomatic subjects. Those include bone marrow (BM) lesions located at the vertebral endplates, disc bulges and herniation, and spondylolysis. Such lumbar MRI findings could potentially function as biomarkers that can distinguish patients whose pain is due to a primary nociceptive process in the spine from patients with central modulating mechanisms that can be influenced by a number of psychosocial factors as well as central sensitization (i.e. increased responsiveness of nociceptors to either normal or sub-threshold afferent input, resulting in amplified pain).

Introduction

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Task Force on research standards for chronic low back pain (cLBP) defines cLBP as pain persisting for at least three months and occurring on at least half the days in the past 6 months. Key findings of the 2019 National Health Interview survey show that of the nearly 59% of adults reporting pain some, most, or every day in the past 3 months, 39% reported back pain, making it the most prevalent source of pain. Estimates of health care costs related to cLBP are variable, but some total cost estimates are greater than $100 billion per year. Despite significant investments in basic research and novel therapies, rates of cLBP continue to rise worldwide. Efforts to address this widespread issue are confounded by the fact that, for most people with cLBP, identifying a clear cause of the pain is extremely challenging, largely because back pain is the symptom of a complex, multifaceted disorder, where biological, psychological, and social factors interact to affect the onset and trajectory of pain. As a result, there is no widely accepted standard for back pain diagnoses, and without a precision medicine approach to treating the condition, there exists a dependence on trial-and-error approaches that often fail to fully alleviate the pain or improve function and simply add to the rising cost of care. One consistent observation across cLBP clinical studies is that some patients respond well to any given treatment, while others do not respond at all. This leads to the current state in which there are a wide range of available interventions, each with varying efficacy in different subsets of individuals, but little understanding regarding who will respond to a given intervention.

### Low back pain [^114GS117]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Low back pain affects individuals of all ages and is a leading contributor to disease burden worldwide. Despite advancements in assessment and treatment methods, the management of low back pain remains a challenge for researchers and clinicians alike. One reason for the limited success in identifying effective treatments is the large variation in the manifestations, possible causes, precipitating and maintaining factors, course, prognosis and consequences in terms of activity interference and quality of life. However, despite these challenges, steady progress has been achieved in the understanding of back pain, and important steps in the understanding of the psychological and social risk factors, genetics and brain mechanisms of low back pain have been made. These new findings have given impetus to the development of new diagnostic procedures, evidence-based screening methods and more targeted interventions, which underscore the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of low back pain that integrates biological, psychological and social aspects.

Though most masses that require evaluation are ultimately benign, the possibility of a more aggressive process, including borderline or malignant neoplasms, underscores the pivotal role of the pediatric dermatologist in recognizing these lesions. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of lumps and bumps that are important to recognize to prevent delay in diagnosis or treatment of a serious underlying condition. Clinical clues that may lead the pediatric dermatologist to have a higher index of suspicion for more aggressive lesions are reviewed. Suggestions for evaluation and workup, as well as tips for the difficult to discern lesion, are proposed.

2. Low back pain is still the number one cause of disability in the world

Low back pain is a common problem affecting all age groups from children to the elderly. While highly disabling in only a very small proportion of those affected, its high prevalence means that in 2015, low back pain was responsible for 60.1 million disability-adjusted life-years; a 54% increase since 1990, with the biggest increase seen in low-income and middle-income countries. In the latest data from the Global Burden of Disease Project published in 2017, the global point prevalence of low back pain was 7.8%, meaning that 577 million people are affected at any one time. Focusing on Africa, a 2018 systematic review (65 studies) found the lifetime, annual, and point prevalence of low back pain was 47% (95% confidence interval [CI] 37–58), 57% (95% CI 51–63) and 39% (95% CI 30–47), respectively, comparable or higher than what has been observed in population studies in high income countries.

A wide variety of superficial soft-tissue masses may be seen in clinical practice, but a systematic approach can help achieve a definitive diagnosis or limit a differential diagnosis. Superficial soft-tissue masses can generally be categorized as mesenchymal tumors, skin appendage lesions, metastatic tumors, other tumors and tumorlike lesions, or inflammatory lesions. With regard to their imaging features, these masses may be further divided into lesions that arise in association with the epidermis or dermis (cutaneous lesions), lesions that arise within the substance of the subcutaneous adipose tissue, or lesions that arise in intimate association with the fascia overlying the muscle. The differential diagnosis may be limited further by considering the age of the patient, anatomic location of the lesion, salient imaging features, and clinical manifestations.

### Do not routinely offer imaging for uncomplicated low back pain [^113cvKB1]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

The evidence for change

Evidence from randomised controlled trials has established that imaging does not improve clinical outcomes, and several observational studies have linked liberal imaging with greater work absence and unnecessary use of health services. Unnecessary LBP imaging has the potential for harm. Perhaps the most obvious of these harms is exposure to radiation from x rays and computed tomography. Harm is also possible if a clinician acts on incidental findings from any imaging method, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or if these findings are not appropriately explained to patients. For example, disc abnormalities such as bulging disc or degenerative disc disease are commonly seen on images but may not be the source of pain, as they are also seen on images in up to 97% of asymptomatic patients (table 1). Incidental findings may lead to further investigations, specialist referral, and more intensive treatment such as surgery, which limits access to those services for the patients who are in genuine need of such care. Incidental findings may also provoke worry or concern in patients from a labelling effect (possibly delaying recovery) if they fail to understand that these anomalies are common and benign.

Table 1
Age-specific prevalence estimates of degenerative spine imaging findings in asymptomatic people

Imaging and follow-up based on incidental findings affects the health system in terms of direct costs (such as cost of equipment, staff time to conduct the imaging, and time to interpret the image findings) and downstream costs (subsequent tests, referrals, and interventions, many of which are expensive and are of limited benefit for most patients with back pain). The downstream costs of imaging also affect patients and society due to indirect costs relating to out of pocket expenses for unnecessary interventions, as well as expenses related to lost work or household productivity. Two systematic reviews of six randomised controlled trials (1804 participants) both concluded that patients who received imaging without a clear clinical indication did not have improvements to pain, function, or quality of life compared with those who did not have imaging. Additionally, observational studies have found that those who received imaging when not indicated had greater use of health services such as injections and surgery and greater work absence than their counterparts who did not receive imaging. For example, a 2020 study of 405 965 US primary care patients found that those who had early MRI were more likely to undergo back surgery (1.48% v 0.12%) and take prescription opioids (35.1% v 28.6%), yet had higher pain score at 1-year follow-up (3.99 v 3.87) than those who did not get early MRI.

### Assessment of a simulated case-based measurement of physician diagnostic performance [^114uxMfW]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Diagnostic Performance Outcomes

Two key metrics of diagnostic performance were analyzed for each user relative to other solvers on the same case: efficiency, a percentile score calculated based on the proportion of findings revealed before the user first includes the correct diagnosis in his or her differential diagnosis; and accuracy, analyzed 2 ways: (1) a percentile calculated from how high on the differential the correct diagnosis was at the end of the case and (2) a binary measure calculated with credit given for having the correct diagnosis in the first position of the user's differential diagnosis at the end of the case (eg, with all findings revealed).

Because high efficiency can be achieved with low accuracy (thinking of a diagnosis with less information but not putting it high on the final differential) and high accuracy can occur with low efficiency (not thinking of a diagnosis until all suggestive data are provided but putting it high on the final differential), a third composite metric, Diagnostic Acumen Precision Performance (DAPP), was developed. It is calculated from an equally weighted average of the percentiles of both accuracy and efficiency for each solve attempt. This calculation for DAPP was conceived a priori, and it is consistent with the Institute of Medicine's emphasis on both timely and accurate diagnosis.

### Isolated tear of the tendon to the medial head of gastrocnemius presenting as a painless lump in the calf [^1131UyiU]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

We report on a case of isolated tear of the medial head of gastrocnemius tendon. The patient presented with a painless lump in the right calf and denied any prior history of trauma or strain to the leg. A longitudinal split of the tendon was demonstrated at ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There were no other abnormalities and the gastrocnemius muscle was normal. There are no reports in the literature of isolated gastrocnemius tendon tear. To date the calf muscle complex injury described in this area is tearing of the medial head of gastrocnemius muscle, sometimes referred to as "tennis leg". We conclude that an isolated tear of the tendon to the medial head of gastrocnemius should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a lump or swelling in the upper medial area of the calf and we recommend ultrasound or MRI as the investigations of choice.

### Sacral stress fractures: an unusual cause of low back pain in an athlete [^1156Wj7J]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case report of a sacral stress fracture causing low back pain in an athlete.

Objective

To document the occurrence of sacral stress fractures in athletes and to recommend it in the differential diagnosis of low back pain, especially in runners and volleyball players.

Summary Of Background Data

Low back pain is common both in the general population and in athletes. Athletes place high physical demands on their bodies, which often lead to stress fractures. Sacral stress fractures can cause back pain and are often not included in the differential diagnosis of back pain.

Methods

The authors were involved in the care and treatment of this patient and reviewed all medical records, radiologic tests, and related literature.

Results

In a 16-year-old volleyball player with a 4-week history of low back pain, magnetic resonance imaging of her pelvis revealed a stress fracture of the left sacral ala. She was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, rest, and conditioning exercises and had a good functional outcome.

Conclusion

Sacral stress fractures should be included in the differential diagnosis of athletes with low back pain, particularly runners and volleyball players. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first report of a volleyball player with a sacral stress fracture. A review of the literature yielded 29 cases of sacral stress fractures in athletes, mainly runners.

### Unusual intramuscular locations as a first presentation of hydatid cyst disease in children: a report of two cases [^117VGEZh]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

There are multiple treatment options for hydatid cyst. En bloc surgical resection is considered the treatment of choice with lower complications and recurrence rates. Other Options include PAIR (percutaneous aspiration injection-re-aspiration); which showed promising results lately; medical treatment (Albendazole), and watch and wait. Both patients in this series were treated with en bloc surgical resection along with Albendazole before and after surgery in the first case, while only after surgery in the second case, as the diagnosis was revealed only after surgery.

In conclusion; pediatric intramuscular hydatid cyst is rare. A painless lump is the usual clinical presentation. Radiology plays a crucial role in making the diagnosis of hydatid cyst when typical imaging features are seen. Surgery, and chemotherapy are the standard treatment options. Atypical clinical and radiological findings may result in mismanagement of the patient leading to serious complications. Intramuscular hydatid cyst should be kept in the differential diagnosis for any cystic muscular lesion in endemic areas.

### Comparative accuracy of diagnosis by collective intelligence of multiple physicians vs individual physicians [^111zbkD4]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Collective Intelligence Rule: Proportional Weighting

To create a differential diagnosis informed by the collective contributions of multiple Human Dx users, we generated a collective differential with a set of rules. In the base case used as the default for most of the analyses, we used a 1/n weighting rule. For an individual solver with n diagnoses in his or her differential diagnoses, we weighted each diagnosis by its order in the differential (ie, the n th diagnosis would be weighted 1/n) to downweight diagnoses with lower ranks in long lists. For each group of users ranging from 2 to 9 members, the weights of each diagnosis among solvers were summed to produce a ranked list of diagnoses: the collective differential. In the base case, we used the top 3 diagnoses in this collective differential to adjudicate the differential as correct if the intended diagnosis or differential diagnosis was included in the top 3 collective differential diagnoses.

We tested the performance of our collective differential approach using a range of variations on the base case rules above across 3 dimensions: the weighting rule for creating collective differentials, the number of diagnoses in the collective differential used to adjudicate success, and the number of user diagnoses used to create a collective differential. For the weighting rule, we looked at 3 other approaches: 1/n² (which heavily downweights diagnoses beyond the first 2), equal weights for all diagnoses (which does not downweight lower-ranked diagnoses), or equal weights with a randomly ordered 5 diagnoses for each user (which ignores ranking). For the number of diagnoses in the collective differential, we looked at performance using the top 1 through 5 diagnoses. For user diagnoses, we used the top 5 user diagnoses with the 1/n weighting rule to create a collective differential. The base case uses the top 3 diagnoses for both the collective differential and user diagnoses.

### Imaging of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain: differential diagnoses beyond appendicitis [^111Ttnh6]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute right lower quadrant pain remains a common and challenging clinical scenario for emergency medicine physicians due to frequent nonspecific signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Therefore, imaging has evolved to play a pivotal role in the emergency setting. While appendicitis is a common cause for acute pain, there are numerous other important differential considerations with which the radiologist must be aware. The purpose of this review is to list an anatomy-based, encompassing differential diagnosis in addition to acute appendicitis for right lower quadrant pain; demonstrate the key imaging findings of numerous differential considerations; and describe helpful imaging and clinical features useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^1177ucRV]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of male chronic pelvic pain — interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS): Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of IC/BPS in male chronic pelvic pain patients who experience an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than six weeks duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes (Expert Opinion). The cardinal symptoms of IC/BPS are bladder pain/pressure/discomfort and lower urinary tract symptoms, and these symptoms are characteristic of IC/BPS, with voiding often relieving the bladder/pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort; in the MAPP phenotyping study 75% of men with chronic pelvic pain reported painful bladder filling or painful urge to urinate.

### A possible Guillain-Barrésyndrome / transverse myelitis overlap syndrome after recent COVID-19 [^117F7Ynq]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The possible differential diagnoses for the 72-year-old man with acute proximal lower limb weakness and areflexia after COVID-19 include acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and TM.

Initially, we considered GBS (possibly motor variants) as the principal diagnosis, as the patient had sudden onset of lower limb weakness and areflexia. By contrast, acute flaccid weakness, back pain, autonomic dysfunction and hyperintense T2 MRI signals from T7 to T12 indicated a possible diagnosis of TM.

We believed that the patient's neuromuscular disorder was mostly secondary to COVID-19. We investigated whether bamlanivimab could be a factor; however, his symptoms started before he was administered bamlanivimab and we found little information regarding the adverse effects of bamlanivimab in the literature.

### Lumps and bumps on the head in children: use of CT and MR imaging in solving the clinical diagnostic dilemma [^113fVZYk]. Radiographics (2004). Low credibility.

Lumps and bumps of the scalp are a common presenting complaint in children and often pose a diagnostic dilemma. These lesions can be difficult to image, with evaluation confounded by their small size. However, accuracy in diagnosis is critical because the diagnostic and therapeutic implications can vary significantly. The clinical examination can be helpful in developing the differential diagnosis and the imaging strategy. Often, however, a single imaging study is insufficient, and the radiologist finds it necessary to image with more than one modality to correctly diagnose a lesion and provide adequate information for the surgeon. Radiography and ultrasonography are often the initial screening diagnostic tests, followed by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging or computed tomography (CT) for more detail. Multidetector thin-section CT and thin-section MR imaging with surface coils are beneficial in the work-up of these small lesions of the head and neck. The use of newer MR imaging sequences such as heavily T2-weighted single-shot turbo spin-echo imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging can improve the characterization of difficult lesions. Familiarity with the variety of new imaging tools and techniques that are available can help characterize pediatric head and neck lesions and guide clinical management.

### Lumps and bumps: late postsurgical inflammatory and infectious lesions [^114mapki]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Late postsurgical infectious or inflammatory complications after facial surgery present a difficult challenge. These complications occur at least 2 weeks after surgical procedures and are often attributable to unique causes, in contrast to complications within the first postoperative week. The most worrisome complications in this period are caused by mycobacterial infections, because these infections can be severe and require a protracted treatment course. A high degree of suspicion is required early in presentation because these lesions can be subtle and similar to other infectious or inflammatory lesions. The authors discuss the clinical manifestations and diagnostic and treatment rationale for late postoperative infectious and inflammatory lesions. The authors also demonstrate and compare the clinical manifestations of mycobacterial infections, bacterial infections, and sterile inflammatory reactions. In addition, the treatment rationale for mycobacterial infections is reviewed. Late postoperative infections caused by mycobacteria are reported with increasing frequency in the cosmetic literature. These cases illustrate diverse challenges in the identification and treatment of late postoperative lesions.

### Caecal-diverticulitis: a rare differential diagnosis for right-sided lower abdominal pain [^114K23yL]. Colorectal Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

There are several differential diagnoses for acute abdominal discomfort with pain referred to the right lower quadrant region. The objective of this report is to outline our experience with diverticulitis of the caecum, which is a rare condition that is particularly difficult to diagnose correctly pre-operatively.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of acute diverticulitis of the caecum was performed over the period from January 1992 to December 2000 within the Surgical Department of the RWTH Aachen, Germany. The progress of each patient was assessed by interviewing the patient and by telephone contact with the patient's general practitioner.

Results

Seven patients with isolated infective diverticulitis of the caecum were encountered in the course of this study. In five of these cases, the pre-operative diagnosis was either unclear or incorrect. Four patients underwent surgery for suspected appendicitis. In one patient, the diverticulitis was diagnosed during laparoscopic surgery undertaken for presumed adnexal disease. Intestinal continuity was restored in all cases. The postoperative course was uneventful.

Conclusions

Right-sided caecal diverticulitis is rare in comparison to diverticulitis of the sigmoid or descending colon. Nevertheless, it should be actively considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute tenderness in the right lower abdominal region.

### Cholecystocutaneous abscess: diagnostic difficulty in a groin lump [^1146Cg2o]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

An older patient presented with a 4-week history of tender lump in the right groin. Appearances were consistent with strangulated inguinal hernia and theatre was arranged. At operation, the lump was found to be an abscess communicating with the abdominal cavity. Alternative diagnosis requiring further operative management was considered but consent was deemed inadequate to proceed. Operation was abandoned and CT examination arranged. CT unexpectedly identified a cholecystocutaneous abscess discharging through the right inguinal region. The patient made good clinical recovery with ongoing drainage of the abscess and did not require any further operative treatment.

### Treatment of soft tissue filler complications: expert consensus recommendations [^114KYoJj]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Lumps and Bumps

Lumps and bumps are one of the most common complications associated with filler injections. They can be classified according their type (non-inflammatory, inflammatory, or infectious) as well as their time to presentation (early, late, or delayed). As they can arise from a number of causes, investigation may be required to establish a diagnosis. As a general rule, early lumps and bumps present within days or weeks, tend to be painless, and are most likely the result of suboptimal techniques such as excess filler use, superficial placement, and incorrect product for the indication. Lumps occurring in the early post-treatment period may respond to massage.

The panel recommends:
Observation: do not treat if the inflammation is improving.
If the non-inflammatory lump persists, treat the over correction: i. Needle aspiration or minimal stab wound incision with evacuation. ii. Hyaluronidase 150U/mL (be aware of possible allergic reactions). iii. To treat the post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation: intense pulsed light/laser; photo-protection; or depigment cream.

Hyaluronidase preparation, dilution, and doses are summarized in Table 5.

### Benign fibrous histiocytoma of the lower lip [^113EPPSC]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Benign fibrous histiocytoma (BFH) is one of the most common tumors of the superficial and deep soft tissues; it is commonly localized on the skin of the extremities and presents as a slow growing solitary nodule, made up of a mixture of fibroblastic and histiocytic cells. To our knowledge, involvement of the soft tissue of the oral cavity is rare. We present a case of BFH of the lower lip in a 61-year-old white woman who presented with a painless, slow-growing lump inside the lower lip. The lesion was surgically removed. Histologically, it was characterized by uniform spindle-shaped cells arranged in a prominent whorled or storiform pattern. Scattered xanthomatous cells, multinucleated giants cells, lymphocytes, and deposits of hemosiderin were noted throughout the lesion. This rare tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the oral soft-tissue neoplasms.

### Incidental DCIS within a fibroadenoma [^115i7LVM]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A female in her early 20s was referred to the breast-endocrine surgeons with a self-detected tender left breast lump on the background of a family history of breast cancer. A physical examination revealed a rubbery and mobile mass in the left upper breast. Ultrasound demonstrated a solid hypoechoic mass with a likely differential diagnosis of fibroadenoma, with a subsequent core needle biopsy (CNB) confirming a fibroadenoma. Given the size and tenderness of the lump, an excisional biopsy was performed. Histology revealed a fibroadenoma with components of low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ, contained within the fibroadenoma and excised with clear margins. Following surgical excision, a multidisciplinary review determined that no further local therapy was required and recommended a genetics referral. This case was interesting as it raised important questions, including what the best surveillance strategies are for female patients with breast cancer within fibroadenoma and determining the risk and probability of missing epithelial atypia via CNB.

### Lower leg weakness as the presentation of infective endocarditis with septic emboli [^111WfC3e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Lower leg weakness is a common and nonspecific complaint that encompasses a broad differential diagnosis at emergency department, which includes neurologic aspect and a wide range of nonneurologic conditions. Infective endocarditis usually presented with variable symptoms emphasizing constitutional complaints, or complaints that focus on primary cardiac effects or secondary embolic phenomena. Underdiagnosis of the disease can lead to clinical catastrophe and even death. By far, it is rarely considered in the differential diagnosis of lower leg weakness. Herein, we present a case of a 56-year-old man who came to our emergency department with a chief concern of lower leg weakness, which was actually the result of L-spine osteomyelitis and spondylodiscitis as complications of infective endocarditis with septic emboli.

### Breast health: follow-up after an abnormal mammogram-NCI… [^113mvnnW]. NCI (2014). Low credibility.

Breast lumps and changes during your lifetime Most women notice changes in their breasts at different times during their life. Before or during your period, your breasts may feel painful, swollen, or tender. You may feel one or more lumps before your period because of extra fluid in your breasts. During pregnancyyour breasts may feel lumpy, or you may feel breast lumps. This is usually because the glands that produce milk are increasing in number and getting larger. As you approach menopause, your hormone levels change. This can make your breasts feel tender, even when you are not having your period. Your breasts may also feel lumpier during menopause than they did before. If you are taking hormones, your breasts may become more dense. This can make a mammogram more difficult to interpret. After menopause, your hormone levels drop.

You may stop having lumps, pain, or nipple discharge. Breast lump or firm feeling, including a lump in or near your breast, a lump under your arm, thick or firm tissue in or near your breast or under your arm, or a change in the size or shape of your breast. Breast lumps come in different shapes and sizes. Most lumps are not breast cancer. Mass: The size, shape, and edges of a lump give the radiologist important information. A lump that is not cancer often looks smooth and round and has clear, defined edges. Lumps that look like this are often cysts and are not cancer. However, if the lump on the mammogram has a jagged outline, an irregular shape, or other unusual features, it is of more concern and more tests may be needed. Fat necrosis of the breast: A condition that causes round, firm, usually painless lumps. Fat necrosis may appear after an injury to the breast, surgery, or radiation therapy.

Skin around the lump may look red, bruised, or dimpled. Intraductal breast papilloma: A breast condition that causes wartlike growths in the breast duct. Single intraductal papillomas are usually close to the nipple and may cause a lump, pain, and clear or bloody discharge. Lipoma of the breast: A benign tumor made of fat cells. It's usually a painless, single, soft lump.
