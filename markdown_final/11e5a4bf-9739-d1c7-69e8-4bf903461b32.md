(C) must be an obtuse angle
(D) none of the above

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether, given the triangle side condition 2/a = 1/b + 1/c, angle A must be acute, right, obtuse, or none of these. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to translate the harmonic mean–like condition into a relationship among the sides. Then, I should verify how to connect sides to the cosine of angle A using the law of cosines. Next, I will analyze the sign of cos A to determine whether angle A is acute, right, or obtuse. After that, I should consider special cases and edge conditions to ensure there isn't a counterexample. Finally, I will synthesize the conclusion and match it to the correct option.

> Let me first rewrite the given condition algebraically so I can work with it more easily. Starting with 2/a = 1/b + 1/c, I can combine the right-hand side to get 2/a = (b + c)/(bc), and then cross-multiply to obtain 2bc = a(b + c), which rearranges to a = 2bc/(b + c). Wait, let me verify that step: yes, multiplying both sides by abc gives 2bc = a(b + c), so a = 2bc/(b + c) is correct. This shows that a is the harmonic mean of b and c scaled by 2, which already hints that a will be smaller than the arithmetic mean of b and c, but I should confirm that intuition later.

> Next, I should review the law of cosines to relate sides to angle A. The law of cosines states that cos A = (b² + c² − a²)/(2bc), so the sign of cos A determines whether angle A is acute (positive), right (zero), or obtuse (negative). I need to substitute the expression for a into this formula and simplify to see what sign emerges.

> Substituting a = 2bc/(b + c) into the numerator, I get b² + c² − a² = b² + c² − [2bc/(b + c)]². Let me compute that carefully: [2bc/(b + c)]² = 4b²c²/(b + c)², so the numerator becomes b² + c² − 4b²c²/(b + c)². To combine terms, I should put everything over a common denominator: [(b² + c²)(b + c)² − 4b²c²]/(b + c)². Expanding (b + c)² gives b² + 2bc + c², so the numerator becomes (b² + c²)(b² + 2bc + c²) − 4b²c². Hold on, I should verify the expansion: (b² + c²)(b² + 2bc + c²) = b⁴ + 2b³c + b²c² + b²c² + 2bc³ + c⁴ = b⁴ + 2b³c + 2b²c² + 2bc³ + c⁴, and then subtracting 4b²c² yields b⁴ + 2b³c − 2b²c² + 2bc³ + c⁴. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this would factor neatly as (b² − c²)², but that's not correct; (b² − c²)² = b⁴ − 2b²c² + c⁴, which is missing the cross terms I'm seeing here, so I should not jump to that conclusion. Let me reconsider and just keep the expanded form for now.

> I will now examine the sign of the numerator to determine the sign of cos A. The denominator 2bc is positive because side lengths are positive, so the sign of cos A matches the sign of b² + c² − a². Let me think about the expression b⁴ + 2b³c − 2b²c² + 2bc³ + c⁴. I can group it as (b⁴ + c⁴) + 2bc(b² + c²) − 2b²c². Since b and c are positive, b⁴ + c⁴ is positive, 2bc(b² + c²) is positive, and −2b²c² is negative, so the question is whether the positive terms outweigh the negative term. But wait, what if I try a different grouping to make this clearer? Let me try writing it as b⁴ + c⁴ + 2b³c + 2bc³ − 2b²c² = b⁴ + c⁴ + 2bc(b² + c²) − 2b²c². I should confirm that this is indeed positive definite. Notice that b⁴ + c⁴ ≥ 2b²c² by the AM-GM inequality, so b⁴ + c⁴ − 2b²c² ≥ 0, and then adding 2bc(b² + c²) keeps the entire expression strictly positive for positive b, c. Therefore, the numerator is strictly positive, which means cos A > 0, so angle A must be acute.

> Hold on, I should verify this conclusion with a concrete example to ensure there isn't a hidden flaw. Let me choose b = c = 1; then a = 2(1)(1)/(1 + 1) = 1, so the triangle is equilateral with all angles 60°, which are acute. Next, I should try b = 3, c = 6; then a = 2(3)(6)/(3 + 6) = 36/9 = 4. Now, cos A = (3² + 6² − 4²)/(2·3·6) = (9 + 36 − 16)/36 = 29/36 > 0, so angle A is acute again. Let me also check a more asymmetric case, say b = 1, c = 2; then a = 2(1)(2)/(1 + 2) = 4/3, and cos A = (1² + 2² − (4/3)²)/(2·1·2) = (1 + 4 − 16/9)/4 = (5 − 16/9)/4 = (29/9)/4 = 29/36 > 0, confirming angle A is acute. These checks reinforce that the algebraic conclusion holds in specific instances.

> But wait, what if b or c approaches zero or the triangle degenerates? I need to ensure the triangle inequality is satisfied. Since a = 2bc/(b + c), the triangle inequalities reduce to conditions like 2bc/(b + c) < b + c, which simplifies to 2bc < (b + c)², i.e., 0 < b² + c², which is always true for positive b, c. Similarly, the other inequalities hold, so non-degenerate triangles are guaranteed and the earlier analysis remains valid. I should double-check that I'm not overlooking any edge case, but this seems sound.

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the final answer. Because cos A is strictly positive under the given condition, angle A must be acute. Therefore, the correct choice is (A) must be an acute angle.

---

The correct answer is **(A) must be an acute angle**. Here's why: the given condition ([2/a] = [1/b] + [1/c]) implies (a = [2bc/(b + c)]), which is the harmonic mean of (b) and (c). By the properties of means, (a < [(b + c)/2]), so (2a < b + c). Using the law of cosines, (cos A = [(b² + c² − a²)/(2bc)]), and substituting (a = [2bc/(b + c)]) shows that (cos A > 0), which means angle (A) is acute. Therefore, angle (A) must be acute.

---

## Algebraic manipulation

Start with the given condition:

[2/a] = [1/b] + [1/c]

Combine the right-hand side:

[2/a] = [(b + c)/bc]

Solve for (a):

a = [2bc/(b + c)]

This shows that (a) is the harmonic mean of (b) and (c).

---

## Relationship between harmonic mean and arithmetic mean

The harmonic mean of two positive numbers is always less than or equal to their arithmetic mean:

[2bc/(b + c)] ≤ [(b + c)/2]

Thus:

a ≤ [(b + c)/2]

Multiplying both sides by 2:

2a ≤ b + c

This inequality is strict unless (b = c), in which case (a = b = c) and the triangle is equilateral.

---

## Application of the law of cosines

The law of cosines states:

cos A = [(b² + c² − a²)/(2bc)]

Substitute a = [2bc/(b + c)]:

cos A = [(b² + c² − [2bc/(b + c)]²)/(2bc)]

Simplify the numerator:

b² + c² − [4b²c²/(b + c)²] = [((b² + c²)(b + c)² − 4b²c²)/(b + c)²]

Expand (b + c)²:

(b + c)² = b² + 2bc + c²

So the numerator becomes:

(b² + c²)(b² + 2bc + c²) − 4b²c² = b⁴ + 2b³c + b²c² + b²c² + 2bc³ + c⁴ − 4b²c²

Combine like terms:

b⁴ + 2b³c + 2bc³ + c⁴ − 2b²c²

Factor:

(b² − c²)² + 2bc(b² + c² − 2bc) = (b² − c²)² + 2bc(b − c)²

Since (b² − c²)² ≥ 0 and 2bc(b − c)² ≥ 0, the numerator is non-negative. Therefore:

cos A ≥ 0

Equality holds only when (b = c), in which case the triangle is equilateral and angle (A) is (60°). Otherwise, (cos A > 0), meaning angle (A) is acute.

---

## Conclusion

Since (cos A > 0) in all cases, angle (A) must be acute. Therefore, the correct answer is **(A) must be an acute angle**.

### Experimental nonclassicality in a causal network without assuming freedom of choice [^e83d6c77]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Violation of a causal compatibility inequality

In order to demonstrate the nonclassicality of the experimental data relative to the triangle causal network, we seek to identify some causal inequalities, which must be satisfied by all distributions compatible with the classical triangle network but which are violated by our experimental statistics. To this end, we turn to the inflation technique for causal inference introduced in ref.

As detailed in the Methods, the inflation technique relates compatibility with a given causal structure to feasibility of a linear program (LP). If the LP related to an inflation of(see Fig. 5 (a)) is found to be infeasible, then evidently p is incompatible with. In our case, is taken to be the classical triangle scenario causal structure depicted in Fig. 1 (b).

Inflation technique for the triangle network.

a The second order inflation graph of the triangle network. Such an inflation doubles the number of latent variables relative to the triangle scenario, having six latent variables. The inflation quadruples the number of observable random variables of the triangle scenario, having twelve observable random variables { a (1), b (1), c (1), a (2), b (2), c (2), a (3), b (3), c (3), a (4), b (4), c (4) }. Distributions compatible with this inflated structure satisfy symmetry properties, and have marginals corresponding to products of triangle-compatible distribution. This can be exploited to derive suitable causal compatibility inequalities that are violated by the experimental data. b This plot depicts the 64 × 64 coefficientsfor a quadratic inequality of the form of Eq. (7) such that the left-hand side is nonnegative on all distributions compatible with the classical triangle scenario, but which evaluates to the negative number V e x p = − 0.02436 ± 0.00016 on our experimental data. The x -axis ranges over the values of (a 1, b 1, c 1) while the y -axis ranges over the values of (a 2, b 2, c 2), and the color at a given point denotes the value ofaccording to the mapping set out in the legend.

### Experimental nonclassicality in a causal network without assuming freedom of choice [^139235a9]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We employed the "hierarchy" version of inflation defined in ref.due to its computationally efficient and data-agnostic implementation.

The second order inflation graph of the classical triangle network is depicted in Fig. 5 (a), and the, which is posited to exist would pertain to the twelve observable random variables depicted in Fig. 5 (a), namely { a (1), b (1), c (1), a (2), b (2), c (2), a (3), b (3), c (3), a (4), b (4), c (4) }.

The LP implied by inflation is as follows. The condition for the existence ofcan be understood as a collection of very many inequality constraints (every probability, which makes upmust be nonnegative) along with one equality constraint (the sum of all probabilities comprisingtotals unity). The symmetry requirements ofcan be understood as equality constraints relating the various probabilities comprising. Finally, the requirement that p ⊗2 is a marginal ofcan be understood as equating p ⊗2 evaluated at a particular set of values for its arguments to a sum over all those probabilities of, which agree on these values. In other words, if p is compatible with, then some collection of equality and inequality constraints are simultaneously satisfiable; i.e. some LP should be feasible.

The Farkas infeasibility certificate of the LP defined by inflation constitutes quadratic inequalities, which are satisfied by all triangle-compatible distributions but violated by the nonclassical distribution whose triangle-incompatibility is witnessed by inflation. See Supplementary Note 4 for an explicit walk-through of the inflation technique in full detail.

Visualizing a self-similar propagating ellipse

Figure 5a shows the geometry of an ellipse under the assumptions described above. The R (t) of the ellipse apex (the point of the ellipse farthest from the Sun along the ellipse central direction) is given by DBM. In this section, we derive equations for the ellipse semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b as a function of R (t), the inverse aspect ratio f and the half width λ. We use f = b/a rather than a r = a/b because it simplifies the following calculation. The equations

follow from the definition of f and the definition of angle β, which is the angle between the semi-major axis a and the normal to the tangent at point T (Fig. 5a). The location of T is the point of tangency on the ellipse for a line originating at the Sun. It can be easily seen that β = λ by checking the sum of the angles of the small orange triangle in Fig. 5a in relation to a larger triangle (not highlighted) containing the angles λ and η. The polar angle of the ellipse θ is given by a relationship from general ellipse geometry between β and θ. It is important to emphasize that we further construct the ellipse based on this particular value of θ, for which a line with distance r connects the ellipse center C to point T. Combining equation (2) gives a relationship for the polar angle θ based on known parameters,

From the law of sines on the large orange-shaded triangle in Fig. 5a we derive:

Angle α follows from the angles of the orange-shaded triangle, and distance r from the definition of an ellipse in polar coordinates:

The last equation can be rewritten with the definition of f as

Introducing α from equation (5) and the last equation for r into equation (4) then eliminates the unknowns (α, r) and expresses b in function of known variables:

Equations (7) are the final description of the ellipse parameters. The minor axis b of the ellipse depends on all known variables (R (t), f, λ) through θ and ω, from equations (3) and (6). The major axis a then simply follows from the definition of f in equations (2). The heliocentric distance of the centre of the ellipse is parameter c (Fig. 5b), closing the model equations necessary for visualizing the ellipse.

### Increased tortuosity of basilar artery might be associated with higher risk of aneurysm development [^b21fb957]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The fourth is triangular index (TI), for which the curve is again divided into equal subcurves. Then, a triangle is built with vertices on each end of the subcurve and in its middle point. TI is defined as:where n is the number of subcurves, a and b are sides of triangles and c is its base. The last of the tortuosity descriptors is the inflexion count metrics (ICM), defined as:where n I represents the number of the curve's inflexion points. All used tortuosity descriptors are all presented in Fig. 1.

Additional measurements

We additionally measured diameters of both P1 segments of posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) and diameters of both vertebral arteries (VAs) at a distance of 5 mm from the origin of BA. We also measured the diameter of BA in three locations: 2 mm from its origin, 2 mm before its bifurcation and halfway between those two locations. Additionally, we obtained the angle of BA bifurcation and its configuration, introduced by Rashad et al including hands-up, hands-neutral and hands-down configurations, as well as its mixed variants (hands-up/hands-neutral, hands-up/hands-down, hands-neutral/hands-down). Among patients with BA aneurysm, we measured aneurysm dome height and width, as well as its neck size. We also calculated dome-to-neck ratio, defined as aneurysm dome height/neck size.

### Electric control of magnetic exchange in a molecular spin triangle [^2d5317e6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Results

Cu 3 crystallizes in the P 31 c non-centrosymmetric polar space group. Each copper(II) ion is coordinated by four nitrogen and one oxygen donor. It adopts a distorted trigonal bipyramidal (tbp) geometry, with the axis of the tbp lying in the plane of the triangle. The three-fold symmetry axis at the center of the triangle relates the three copper(II) ions. The unit cell contains two crystallographically independent copper triangles (labeled A and B in Fig. 1a) and two mirror symmetry-related molecules (A' and B') (Fig. 1b). We note that A' and B (or A and B') are almost centrosymmetric images of each other (see Supplementary Fig. 1), making their subtle differencescrucial for detecting the SE effect by EFM-EPR. Nevertheless, A' and B exhibit different packing along the polar c axis due to co-crystallized solvent molecules and the disordered perchlorate anions (see Supplementary Note 1).

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^55f4a482]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Sequential Bayesian inference can be rewritten in a form that more closely resembles a sum of evidence by taking the logarithm of equation (8):For each of the n -choices, the accumulated evidence is the log posterior, with n distinct evidence incrementsand a common subtractive log-marginal term. Calculation of this log-marginal is necessary for multiple (n > 3) choice optimal decision-making, but can be avoided for n = 2 by using the SPRT as mentioned above. A similarterm in a theory of basal ganglia function has been interpreted as suppressing evidence accumulation when choices are ambiguous –.

Within this framework, using that probabilities sum to unity ∑ i P i (t) = 1, the evidence accumulation takes place within an (n − 1)-dimensional linear subspace spanning n vertices { P i = 1, P j ≠ i = 0} of an N -dimensional unit hypercube. This is most easily seen for N = 3 choices, where the decision variables P = (P 1, P 2, P 3) vary within a triangle passing through three vertices {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} of the unit cube (Fig. 1, top right panel). So rather than representing evidence accumulation trajectories as a random walk constrained to two dimensions, for multiple alternatives the random walk moves in higher dimensions (a line for two alternatives, a plane/triangle for three, and so on). For simplicity, this vector is initialized with equal prior probabilities 1/ n and updated sequentially until one of the elements reaches a boundary, P i > θ.

Both the SPRT and two-choice sequential Bayesian inference give optimal decisions in that they give the fastest decisions for a given level of accuracy on single trials of known difficulty. Formally, they optimize a cost function, the Bayes risk, that is linear in the mean error rate e and mean decision time T over many trialswith error costs W i > 0 and cost of time c, scaling the expected error and decision time,… This cost function represents the trade-off between speed and accuracy of decision-making: slow but accurate or fast but inaccurate decisions are both costly, and so a balance must be found. For equal decision costs, W 0 = W 1, there is a single threshold that is free parameter, which for optimal decision-making is tuned according to the relative cost c / W of accuracy and time.

### Boundary conductance in macroscopic bismuth crystals [^8eeef8d9]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 3
The emergence of shape dependence with cooling.

The evolution of angle-dependent magnetoresistance with cooling for B = 14 T (top panels) and for B = 0.2 T (bottom panels). Note the emergence of a difference at low temperatures in both cases.

As can be seen in Fig. 3, at both fields, the two samples show an identical angle-dependent conductivity at 40 K, but not at low temperature. Upon cooling, additional features emerge in the first triangular prismatic crystal, which are absent in the second one. Now, at B = 14 T, all electrons are confined to their lowest Landau level, but not at B = 0.2 T. This implies that the observed shape dependence of magnetoconductivity does not require proximity to the quantum limit ℏ ω c ≈ E F, but the passage to the high-field limit ω c τ > 1.

As for the high-field limit, two relaxation times are to be distinguished. The Dingle scattering time τ D, extracted from quantum oscillations is almost fifty times shorter than the transport scattering rate τ t r in Bi. Such a large difference between τ t r and τ D has been observed in several other dilute metals. The semiclassical high-field limit (ω c τ t r ≈ 1) is satisfied when the cyclotron radius becomes shorter than the mean free path. The quantum high-field limit (ω c τ D ≈ 1) is satisfied when the distance between Landau levels becomes smaller than the broadening caused by temperature and disorder. At T = 40 K, the first criterion is satisfied, but not the second and there is no shape dependence. As the sample is cooled down, the shape dependence and quantum oscillations emerge concomitantly (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1, see Supplemental Material for more details). Therefore, one can safely conclude that what matters is the ω c τ D ≈ 1 criterion.

### Universal non-hermitian skin effect in two and higher dimensions [^9618dcd5]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 3
The corner-skin effect and the geometry-dependent-skin effect.

The universal skin effect can be further classified into two types by the current functional, that is, non-reciprocal skin effect (∃ α, n, J α [n] ≠ 0) and generalized reciprocal skin effect (∀ α, n, J α [n] = 0). CSE (a)–(d) and GDSE (e)-(h) are representatives of these two types of skin effects, respectively. In (a, b, e, f), the light blue regions represent the spectrum under periodic boundary, where 200*200 k -grid is used, and the red points represent the eigenvalues under different open-boundary geometries. The system size under square geometry in (c, g) is L x × L y = 60 × 60, and each triangle geometry in (d, h) has the same right-angled side length L x = L y = 60. The spatial distributions of eigenstates W (x) are plotted in (c, d, g, h) with the color bars. In the system with GDSE, the skin effect disappears under square geometry (geometry 1) in (g), and reappears under triangle geometry (geometry 2) in (h).

### Corneal cross-linking induces increased corneal refractive index, which generates measurement error of central corneal thickness [^426c2abe]. Ophthalmology Science (2026). Medium credibility.

Model 1: Side View

The camera image in the side view of an illuminated optical section of the cornea used by imaging technologies based on Scheimpflug geometry is illustrated in Figure 2. In this model, measurements of corneal thickness are obtained by extracting the apparent thickness of the slit-illuminated cornea and calculating the thickness of the cornea based on the refractive distortion present as viewed by a camera at a fixed, known observation angle. This is accomplished using principles of geometric optics and trigonometry. Major equations are provided here with details included in the Appendix.

The variable d s is the apparent corneal thickness in the Scheimpflug image, angle θ is the constant observation angle (45 o), and r is the known radius of curvature of the anterior cornea. The unknowns are the index of refraction of the cornea, n c and corrected CCT side view, t cs. CCT = central corneal thickness.

Based on triangle BGO in Figure 2, with angles, θi, (180−θ), and angle α, which can be defined by (α = θ – θi), the following equation results.where θi is the angle of incidence of a parallel light ray at point B, d s is observed apparent corneal thickness in the image, angle θ is the constant observation angle (45 o), and r is the known radius of curvature of the anterior cornea. Based on Snell's Law, angle θ r is defined by the following equation.where n c is the index of refraction of the cornea.

Based on triangle BCO in Figure 2, the corrected CCT from side view images, t cs can be calculated by substitution from previous equations for angles, θ r and α.

The unknowns in the previous series of three equations are index of refraction of the cornea, n c, and corrected CCT-side-view, t cs.

### Distribution of angle alpha in a large population in Eastern China: an analysis of the 30705 eyes using the ray tracing aberrometer [^a0fbd68b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Reflecting the current state of knowledge, this study represented the most comprehensive investigation into angle alpha globally to date. By evaluating angle alpha's distribution within a substantial cohort, this research offered critical insights into its variability. Crucially, it established a clear correlation between the magnitude of angle alpha and key demographic factors, including ocular laterality, gender, and age, thereby enriching our understanding of its clinical significance.

In terms of the orientation of angle alpha, the predominant alignment was horizontal, with a particular emphasis on the temporal side, corroborating the findings of several previous research. However, discrepancies emerged in comparing of the magnitude with prior studies, in which the average magnitude of angle alpha was estimated to be around 0.44 and 0.45 mm.

In our study, the overall sample's results showed an average angle alpha magnitude of about 0.30 mm, which is smaller than those observed in other studies. A summary of the angle alpha magnitude in previous studies were shown in Table 4. Our findings indicate that the magnitude of angle alpha is associated with factors such as age, refractive status, and ethnicity. The participants in our study ranged from 10 to 99 years of age, with a large number of myopic young patients. Both the wide age span and the proportion of myopia patients were the major factors leading to the differences with other previous studies. Geometrically, this difference can be intuitively understood, considering that angle alpha represents one side of a right triangle defined by the axial length and the transverse displacement of the fovea of the macula. Consequently, patients with high myopia frequently exhibit a smaller angle alpha.

### Efficient molecular doping of polymeric semiconductors improved by coupled reaction [^ad11587c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We further calculated the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of the related reactions to understand the significant improvement of the electrical conductivity in DPP4T-D1A1 films (Fig. 3c). Detailed information is described in the Supplementary Information. For the original doping reaction process, the Gibbs free energy change is calculated to be ΔG 1 = 244.53 kJ·mol −1 as shown in Eq. (1):where the DPP4T + is the cation when DPP4T loses an electron and the D1 − is the anion when D1 receives an electron. The positive ΔG 1 shows that the original doping reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable. After A1 is added, it forms a complex with D1 − as shown in the Eq. (2):

The formation of the complex A1·D1 − is more favorable than the formation of A1·D1. Figure 3e shows the theoretically optimized structure of the complexes A1·D1 and A1·D1 −, which demonstrate that A1·D1 − is more stable than A1·D1. The original A1 is a planar triangle configuration with boron B at the center according to the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory (VSEPR). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates that the angle for the carbon-boron-carbon bonds (C-B-C) in the original A1 tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane is 120°. After coordinating with D1 and D1 −, the angles of the C-B-C become 112° and 108° in the complexes A1·D1 and A1·D1 −, respectively. The formation of the coordination B-O bond turns the tri-coordinate B into the quadri-coordinate B whose ideal bond angle is 109.5°. The C-B-C bond angle in A1·D1 − is closer to the ideal bond angle, which indicates that A1·D1 − is more stable than A1·D1. In addition, the coordination binding energy of A1·D1 − is −587.63 kJ·mol −1, which is about an order in magnitude higher than that of A1·D1(−62.39 kJ·mol −1). In the meanwhile, the calculated coordination B-O bond in the optimized A1·D1 − structure is 1.47 Å, which is close to the covalent B-O bond length in the range of 1.34–1.47 Å. While the calculated coordination B-O bond for A1·D1 is 1.58 Å. The shorter the B-O bond is, the higher the bond energy it will have. The results demonstrate the ease of the formation of A1·D1 − in the doping process. Experimental identification of the formation of A1·D1 − has also been reported with X-ray crystallography data in previous works.

In all panels, a right-angle triangle represents biocide concentration gradients, where the increasing biocide (blue) intensifies as its concentration increases. Bacterial colonies (panels B – E) are colored in pink for clarity. A The test tube biocide adaptation experiment core design is shown based on previously published methods listed in Table 2. Numbers above Day 1 and Day 2 subcultures represent gradually increasing arithmetic dilutions of a given biocide and red boxes show an example of a culture with the highest measured growth. B Cup plate dilution agar experimental design; black dotted arrows shown on the agar plate after the step 2 represents the zone of biocide growth inhibition. C The gradient agar biocide adaptation method is shown. D The spot gradient biocide agar technique at step 1, requires a ≥ 1 h time incubation for spotted biocides to adsorb into the agar. E A continuous culture biocide adaptation technique is shown. Continuous culture designs can be machine-automated or operated manually with peristaltic pumps. The duration of the culture incubation period and when to sample adapted isolates are determined by the operator (ranges from days-years). The images shown in this diagram were generated using Inkscape v. 1.4 graphic design tools.

### Collective self-caging of active filaments in virtual confinement [^e95cab44]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

For shapes with straight edges and convex corners, as in regular polygons, curvature is focused to singular points. Also for these cases (Fig. 4 d–g), accumulation at the boundaries is systematically observed. In addition, the corner angle determines the local nematic order pattern formed by the accumulated filaments. For obtuse angles down to right angles (see the trapezoid and square in Fig. 4 d, e), the filament bundles bend to follow the edge, leaving a slight gap right in the corner. For acute angles (see the trapezoid, triangle and teardrop in Fig. 4 e–g), however, filaments splice into the corner. The resulting splay deformation pattern then leads to a sudden reversal of the direction of rotation of the nematic order along the mask edge (Fig. 4 a). In both simulations and experiments, the corner angle at which the filament deformation transitions from bend to splay is found to be about 90 ∘.

To quantitatively relate the geometry of the virtual confinement to the morphology of the bacterial pattern, we consider the winding number associated with the circulation of the filament orientation along the boundary of the illuminated region. Since a bend (splay) deformation corresponds to a rotation of the filament pattern by an angle π − α (− α) at a vertex with opening angle α (Fig. 4 a), simple geometric arguments predict that the total rotation along a closed curve defining the boundary is given by 2 π w, where the winding number isHere, n a stands for the number of acute angles in the polygon (details in "Methods"). As shown in Fig. 4, Equation (2) is verified for all shapes previously described, so that the structure of the colony is fully determined by the geometry of the illumination pattern. Namely, in the absence of acute angles w = 1 (Figs. 1 c, d and 4 b, d), while for the flattened ellipse of Fig. 4 c the two apices with high local curvature behave similarly to acute angles, leading to w = 0. A zero winding number is also obtained for trapezoids (Fig. 4 e), while equilateral triangles and teardrop-like shapes give rise toand, respectively (Fig. 4 f, g). Note that, as convex polygons satisfy n a ≤ 3, the shapes displayed in Fig. 4 cover all possible values of w.

### Stabilization mechanism accommodating genome length variation in evolutionarily related viral capsids [^2b4b99bd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We proved the theorem as follows. In capsids with hexamers centered on a true 3-fold axis, one can define h H and k H as the hexagonal lattice steps joining a pentamer with the hexamer sitting on a global 3-fold axis, as illustrated for T = 12 in Fig. 4b. By symmetry, the triangle formed by three pentamers is three times larger than the triangle formed by one pentamer and the two vertices placed on nearby 3-fold axes. The normalized area of the small triangle formed by the central hexamer follows the same expression as the classical T-number sequence given by Eq. (1), except that the steps used are h H and k H instead of h and k. The final triangulation number is three times this small triangle, leading to the T-number, T H, for capsids with hexamers centered on global 3-fold axes:

The associated steps h and k can be expressed as a function of h H and k H by h = 2 h H + k H and k = k H − h H (Fig. 4b). Introducing these expressions in Eq. (1) offers an alternative way to derive T H:

Equations (2) and (3) imply that any T-number multiple of three is associated with a capsid with centered hexamers on the global 3-fold axes. This is equivalent to say that any T-number multiplied by three leads to another T-number with hexamers centered on the 3-fold axes. For example, T = 1 leads to T = 3, T = 3 to T = 9, T = 4 to T = 12, etc. This theorem predicts that capsids and procapsids (immature capsids) of tailed phages forming, e.g. T = 3, 9, or 12, will display at least 20 hexamers with 3-fold (or 6-fold) symmetry on the global 3-fold icosahedral axes. This prediction was supported empirically by the published reconstruction of the procapsid of SIO-2 tailed phage, which adopts a T = 12 capsid with non-split hexamers at the true 3-fold axes(Fig. 4c).

### The emergence and transient behaviour of collective motion in active filament systems [^2efbc4d2]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Time trace of 'seeds'. Premature and unstable small clusters, termed 'seeds' contain several filaments, which display a coordinated motion that persists only for a short while. Even before the transition of the system to the distinctive polar ordered state — stable clusters — there are signs of local ordering. However, the direct visualization and hence the quantitative analysis of such seeds are unrealistic due to the absence of significant intensity difference (see Supplementary Movie 1 for the movie of the time trace; the seeds are barely visible).

### Multiple tipping points and optimal repairing in interacting networks [^d95be1ee]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Despite the seeming complexity of equations (1) and (2), it is noteworthy that there are only two unknown variables, a A and a B, and that all other parameters are fixed. These two equations define two curves in the (a A, a B) plane.

Figure 1a shows a graphical representation of the curves for a random regularnetwork (in which all the nodes have the same degree) with degree of k = 16 and threshold m = 8, for the symmetric parameter values, r A = r B = 0.60 and r d = 0.15. The size of each network is N = 2 × 10 4. The blue curve is a graphical representation of equation (1) and the brown curve is defined by equation (2). The curves, similar to two 'ropes', create a 'knot' that can have up to nine intersections, representing mathematical solutions of the system of equations. However, not all of these solutions represent observable and stable physical states. To see that, observe one of the curves in Fig. 1a, for example, the blue curve described by equation (1). If we increase damage done to network B (that is, we increase a B) and keep everything else constant, some damage will undoubtedly spread to network A. Thus, we expect that when a B is increased, a A must also increase (it would be very unusual if one network improves its activity as a result of damaging the other network). We conclude that the parts of the blue and brown curve that produce physical solutions are only those where a A and a B increase together or decrease together along the curve. This elimination leaves only four states in Fig. 1a that are stable (green circles), whereas the other five states are unstable (red crosses), for this particular choice of parameters. In simulated finite networks, when the network system evolves according to the rules of the model, at t = 0 we have a freedom to set initial conditions for the activities. Systems initially prepared to have a pair of values (a A, a B) corresponding to an unstable solution of equations (1) and (2) will be disturbed by a small fluctuation of a A or a B, owing to the system dynamics, and the values of a A or a B will rapidly change until one of the stable states is reached. Systems that are initially prepared to have values of a A or a B corresponding to a stable solution will fluctuate around these values, until perhaps a large finite fluctuation occurs and the system 'jumps' to another stable state. In general, for any choice of parameters, we have between one and four stable (physical) states. Figure 1b shows the scenario for the same network system when, r A = r B = 0.60 and r d = 0.15. In this case we have two stable states and one unstable state.

### Twist angle-dependent conductivities across MoS / graphene heterojunctions [^e6593b66]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Twist-angle-dependent conductivities of MoS 2 /Gr heterojunction

To achieve different twist angles between the MoS 2 domains and the graphene substrates underneath, we rotated these as-grown MoS 2 domains via AFM-tip manipulation technique. This manipulation process is like that reported in our previous work. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, during the rotation process, we firstly engaged the AFM tip to the graphene surface with a load of tens of nN and then pushed the MoS 2 triangle from its corner to actuate its rotation. By controlling the tip moving direction and length, we thus can rotate the MoS 2 domains on graphene with any deterministic twist angles, as illustrated in Fig. 2b–f. The heights of this MoS 2 domain under different twist angles are likely to be different if considering the interlayer coupling; however, due to the probing limit (no more than 60 pm) of our AFM, these height variations were not observed in our experiments.

Fig. 2

Blue dash lines indicate the original direction of the MoS 2 domain, while white arrows indicate the rotation directions. Green rectangles represent the scan area during C-AFM measurements

Since MoS 2 /Gr heterostructures with deterministic twist angles are available, we thus measured their vertical conductivities to investigate the twist-angle dependence. In our experiments, the conductivity was directly measured under the C-AFM mode. During C-AFM scanning, a metal-coated AFM tip was placed in direct contact with the sample surface under a controlled load of ∼23 nN (cantilevers were calibrated by Sader's method). The bias applied to the measurement circuit was fixed to be 1.5 V, and a 110-MΩ resistor was connected into the circuit to prevent current overload to our C-AFM holder, which has a measuring range of ± 20 nA and a noise level of 1.5 pA, as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 3a. Note that, during scanning, we adjusted the fast scan direction of the AFM tip in parallel to one edge of the MoS 2 triangle to reduce the feedback noise.

### In-plane uniaxial pressure-induced out-of-plane antiferromagnetic moment and critical fluctuations in BaFeAs [^aa252e09]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Determination of M a, M b, and M c

In our previous polarized neutron scattering studies of iron pnictides, we have established the method for determining the spin-fluctuation components M β (β = a, b, c) along the lattice axes via comparing the SF scattering(γ = x, y, z) at two equivalent magnetic wave vectors (such as Q 1 = (1, 0, 1) and Q 2 = (1, 0, 3) as shown in Fig. 1 of the main text). The definition of the directions x, y, and z is described in Fig. 1.is directly related to the spin-fluctuation components by:where α is the angle between (1, 0, 0) and Q (Fig. 1), F (Q) is magnetic form factor of Fe 2+, R is the flipping ratio, and B is the polarization-independent background scattering.

From Eq. (1), we can get four equations for our results on Q 1 and Q 2 :in which r is the intensity ratio factor between Q 1 and Q 2 to account for the differences in sample illumination volume and the convolution with instrumental resolution. The third and fourth equations in Eq. (2) can be used to determine the ratio r and M b, and the first two equations for M a and M c. More details concerning the determination of the spin-fluctuation components M a, M b, and M c can be found elsewhere. Although this method can determine the values of M a, M b, and M c, it also results in large error bars of their values. To more accurately determine the effect of uniaxial pressure on M a and M c, we consider the differences betweenat Q 1 and Q 2.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### Theory of branching morphogenesis by local interactions and global guidance [^34973bae]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Comparison between analytical model and simulations

Importantly, Eq. (1) describing the probability of branch orientation attains a steady-state solution (∂ t P st (ψ, t) = 0) that is largely independent of the form of the external field, i.e. it applies generically to different geometries after defining the relative branch alignment with respect to the external field. This solution predicts that the alignment of angles with respect to the polarity of the external field will be determined by the von Mises distribution (circular normal distribution):with a concentration parameter given by ν ≡ μ f c / D, and I 0 (ν) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero. The fluctuations in the angular alignment as determined by the variance will thus follow a universal scaling approximately given by σ 2 ∝ D / μ f c that underlines the relative contribution of the local noise to the external guidance. For an axial (linear) field parallel to the horizontal axis, for instance, the above solution applies to the distribution of the local angles φ of the branch segments (Fig. 1 d). In a radial external field emerging from a central point of origin, however, the alignment of a branch is determined by the angle difference ψ ≡ φ − θ between its local angle φ and its angle θ with respect to the origin of the external field, and thus ψ, rather than φ, is predicted to follow the von Mises distribution (see Supplementary Figs. 4–9 for the alignment angles for different model assumptions). Comparing these analytical criteria with the numerical simulations led to excellent agreement without using any fit parameter (Fig. 1 d–f).

To summarize, the combination of analytical modelling and numerical simulations allows us to make a number of predictions for different topological and geometrical properties of branched structures: A key signature of external guidance is that branching angles should conform to a von Mises distribution while the overall branching structure in an axial field can adopt a well-defined conical domain in the absence of defined boundaries. Furthermore, a signature of the stochastic nature of branching and annihilating random walks is that even with external guidance, the local branch length or overall network size and shape should be highly variable to random branching events and local density-driven termination of tip growth.

### Robust testimation with balanced steady state free precession [^20f2a63d]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To develop a novel signal representation for balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) displaying its T 2 independence on B 1 and on magnetization transfer (MT) effects.

Methods

A signal model for bSSFP is developed that shows only an explicit dependence (up to a scaling factor) on E 2 (and, therefore, T 2) and a novel parameter c (with implicit dependence on the flip angle and E 1). Moreover, it is shown that MT effects, entering the bSSFP signal via a binary spin bath model, can be captured by a redefinition of T 1 and, therefore, leading to modification of E 1, resulting in the same signal model. Various sets of phase-cycled bSSFP brain scans (different flip angles, different TR, different RF pulse durations, and different number of phase cycles) were recorded at 3T. The parameters T 2 (E 2) and c were estimated using a variable projection (VARPRO) method and Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to assess T 2 estimation precision.

Results

Initial experiments confirmed the expected independence of T 2 on various protocol settings, such as TR, the flip angle, B 1 field inhomogeneity, and the RF pulse duration. Any variation (within the explored range) appears to directly affect the estimation of the parameter c only-in agreement with theory.

Conclusion

BSSFP theory predicts an extraordinary feature that all MT and B 1 -related variational aspects do not enter T 2 estimation, making it a potentially robust methodology for T 2 quantification, pending validation against existing standards.

### A flat carborane with multiple aromaticity beyond wade-mingos' rules [^88a3240d]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Synthesis and structural analysis of spiral carborane 3

Interestingly, when compound 1 was reacted with four equivalents of tert -Butyl isonitrile (t BuNC) in benzene at ambient temperature, a deltahedron carborane derivative 3 was obtained in 26% isolated yield (Fig. 2a). The 11 B NMR spectrum of 3 shows broad singlets at δ = −12.2 ppm for B –C≡N and at δ = 12.2 ppm for BBNC3-ring, respectively. Orange single crystals of 3 were obtained by recrystallization from a saturated toluene solution, and the solid-state structure determined by X-ray diffraction analysis shows that 3 with the 7-SEP system features a spiral triangle-strip structure (Fig. 2c), rather than octahedron predicted for the 6-vertex and 7-SEP closo -carboranes according to Wade–Mingos' rules. The solid-state structure of 3 also differs from trigonal bipyramidal and butterfly shapes corresponding to the global minima of the substituted dicarboranes (C 2 B 4 R 6), suggesting the pronounced kinetic effect by the bulky substituents of 3. The central C 2 B 4 moiety is significantly twisted with the C2–B2–B3–B1, B2–B1–B3–B4 and B3–B1–B4–C1 torsion angles of 144.5°, 117.4°, and 141.1°, respectively. The B–B distances of B1–B2 (1.767(3) Å), B1–B3 (1.765(3) Å), B1–B4 (1.852(3) Å) B2–B3 (1.863(3) Å), and B3–B4 (1.762 (3) Å) fall into the typical range of B–B bonds (1.674–2.089 Å) reported for the small carborane clusters. The B–C distances of B1–C1 (1.545(3) Å), B2–C2 (1.529(3) Å), B3–C2 (1.540(3) Å), and B4–C1 (1.517(2) Å) are comparable to those found in small carboranes (1.512–1.817 Å). The observed structural change from 2 to 3 confirms that the removal of two electrons from the C 2 B 4 skeleton may decrease the electron delocalization and therefore the stability of the flat core, which leads to distortion from the planar ribbon-like geometry, consistent with Jemmis' prediction. We have also investigated the reaction of 1 and CO, which however gave a complex mixture and no identifiable product was obtained from the mixture.

### High tip angle approximation based on a modified bloch-riccati equation [^346f756b]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

When designing a radio-frequency pulse to produce a desired dependence of magnetization on frequency or position, the small flip angle approximation is often used as a first step, and a Fourier relation between pulse and transverse magnetization is then invoked. However, common intuition often leads to linear scaling of the resulting pulse so as to produce a larger flip angle than the approximation warrants — with surprisingly good results. Starting from a modified version of the Bloch-Riccati equation, a differential equation in the flip angle itself, rather than in magnetization, is derived. As this equation has a substantial linear component that is an instance of Fourier's equation, the intuitive approach is seen to be justified. Examples of the accuracy of this higher tip angle approximation are given for both constant- and variable-phase pulses.

### The alpha angle [^b49a0091]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

➢ The alpha angle was originally defined on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, using a plane, parallel to the axis of the femoral neck. However, much of the literature on the alpha angle has used radiographs or other imaging modalities to quantify the alpha angle.
➢ The measurement of the alpha angle can be unreliable, particularly on radiographs and ultrasound.
➢ If radiographs are used to measure the alpha angle, the circle of best-fit method should be used on multiple different views to capture various locations of the cam lesion, and "eyeballing" or estimating the alpha angle should be avoided.
➢ The cam lesion is a dynamic and 3-dimensional (3D) problem and is unlikely to be adequately defined or captured by a single angle.
➢ Modern technology, including readily available 3D imaging modalities, as well as intraoperative and dynamic imaging options, provides novel, and potentially more clinically relevant, ways to quantify the alpha angle.

The band dispersion is color-coded with the layer polarization: P L = 1 (−1) for Bloch states fully polarized on layer T(B). e Dipole Hall conductivity as a function of twist angle and E ⊥, where the abrupt sign changes mark the topological phase boundaries.

The simultaneous abrupt change in the charge and dipole Hall conductivities is not a coincidence. The band geometric properties arising from layer pseudospin textures underly both quantities, which become noncontinuous at the band inversion induced by the interlayer bias. To see this, we introduce layer-projected Berry curvature Ω L (L = T, B) which satisfies Ω T + Ω B = Ω and Ω T − Ω B = Υ D (see Supplementary Note 1), where Ω is the usual k -space Berry curvature. Figure 2 b and c show the Berry curvatures (upper panels) and band dispersion (lower panels) before and after the topological phase transition, respectively. Notably, at these positive interlayer biases, the filled band predominantly occupies layer B, and Ω B dominates over Ω T in magnitude. When E ⊥ crosses the transition point, band inversion occurs in the vicinity of − κ point, where the Berry curvatures all get reversed. As a result, an abrupt change of σ D accompanies the change of Chern number. The reversal of the associated in-plane orbital magnetization (Fig. 1 c and d) enables contact-free detection of this topological transition.

The phase diagram for the dipole Hall conductivity as a function of twist angle and bias is presented as Fig. 2 e. One observes that as the twist angle decreases, the critical bias for dipole-Hall jump decreases. This is because as the twist angle decreases, the energy band also narrows, and the critical bias decreases accordingly.

### Actomyosin pulsation and flows in an active elastomer with turnover and network remodeling [^5630f234]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The affine theory predicts that the myosin density profile is asymmetric and moves as a traveling front, with a constant velocity while maintaining its shape (as long as there are no further coalescence events). We confirm this using a variety of initial conditions of the bound myosin density ρ b, including starting with a single symmetric gaussian profile. We analyze the asymmetric profile of the traveling front by transforming to the co-moving frame x ± vt (Fig. 5).

Horizontal axis is distance from centre of mass position, x CM. Here B = 6.0, − ζ 1 Δ μ = 4.8, k = 0.2, α = 1.0 and D = 0.25. d Theory predicts that the traveling front velocity is proportional to the net active force integrated over the front profile across the moving front. We demonstrate this fact from a numerical solution of the dynamical equations by varying the parameters of the active stress (circle) and the elastic stress (triangle). for different values of B (with − ζ 1 Δ μ = 6.0, k = 0.2 and D = 0.15 fixed) and − ζ 1 Δ μ (with B = 8.0, k = 0.2 and D = 0.15 fixed).

### J-shapedness: an often missed, often miscalculated relation: the example of weight and mortality [^9e991138]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2014). Low credibility.

We present three considerations in analysing the association between weight and mortality, as well as other relations that might be non-linear in nature. First, authors must graphically plot their independent and dependent variables in a continuous manner. Second, authors should assess the shape of that relation, and note its shape. If it is non-linear, and specifically, J-shaped or U-shaped, careful consideration should be given to using the 'best' statistical model, of which multivariate fractional polynomial regression is a reasonable choice. Authors should also refrain from truncating their data to avoid dealing with non-linear relations.

Achieving high spectral selectivity means that this linear combination function should mimic as closely as possible a discrete bandpass filter, whose line shape will define the "peaks". Based on filter response theory, this filter can be written aswhere the { C k } -N/2 ≤ k ≤ N/2–1 coefficients can be calculated based on a desired response (e.g. using the Finite Impulse Response script in Matlab's signal processing toolbox). Finding the linear combination that makes F(f) as close as possible to R(f) then demands solving a series of linear equations

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^6517cbfd]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### Preventing soft-tissue triangle collapse in modern rhinoplasty [^2698fdea]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The unique anatomy of the soft-tissue triangle makes it prone to notching in primary, secondary, and reconstructive rhinoplasty. Understanding the anatomy of the region is critical to appropriate treatment. This article is meant to further clarify the anatomy of the soft-tissue triangle and to present the senior author's (R.J.R.) approach to proactive correction and prevention of soft-tissue triangle notching through five key steps: (1) precise dissection and incision placement, (2) providing internal support with cartilage grafting if needed, (3) closure of dead space, (4) avoiding undue tension during closure, and (5) providing external support postoperatively.

### Residual astigmatism produced by toric intraocular lens rotation [^0ec86701]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To analyze changes in the eye's refractive properties when a toric intraocular lens (IOL) rotates.

Setting

Fundación Oftalmológica del Mediterráneo, Valencia, Spain.

Design

Experimental study.

Methods

The matrix definition of astigmatism was used in this theoretical study and compared with another vector representation. Two methods were compared: (1) The cylinder, C, resulting from the addition of 2 cylinders C(1) and C(2) whose axes form an angle a, is obtained by the addition of 2 vectors of values C(1) and C(2) forming an angle 2a; (2) the power matrix, F, of a thin astigmatic dioptric system that decomposes naturally into 3 orthogonal components: the purely spherical part F(nes,) the ortho-astigmatism F(or), and oblique astigmatism F(ob).

Results

The residual cylinder was one third of the corneal astigmatism when a toric IOL rotated ± 10 degrees when the cylinder values for the cornea (C(1)) and IOL (C(2)) were equal. Nevertheless, in most cases C(1) is greater than C(2); therefore, the residual astigmatism did not change noticeably with small rotations. The angle of rotation, b, which annuls the astigmatism correction, could be obtained from the following: cos(π + 2b) = -r/2, with r being the ratio between the IOL and cornea cylinders.

Conclusions

The 2 methods gave equivalent results. When the IOL cylinder had a value different from that of the corneal astigmatism, a better choice would be a lower, rather than higher, cylinder value to reduce residual astigmatism. In general, toric IOL rotations less than 10 degrees changed the eye's refraction less than 0.50 diopter. Thus, small axis rotations are not an obstacle for satisfactory astigmatism correction with toric IOLs.

### Using grid cells for navigation [^f5d9ba0e]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

Algorithmic Solution in 1D

The cyclical nature of the grid representation within each module i is such that an activity bump at phase p i implicitly represents an infinite set of "unwrapped" phases p i + 2 πn i, where n i can take any integer value, corresponding to an infinite set of distances s i (p i /2 π + n i) along that 1D axis that are separated by the scale s i of module i. Initially, we assume that all phases are zero at the current location a and the distance d to a goal location b must be inferred from the grid cell representation across modules at that location { p i (b)} = { p 1 (b), p 2 (b), …, p M (b)}. The grid representation of the goal location b is such that there is a set of unwrapped phases (one for each module) that explicitly represent the same distance — i.e. there is a set of integers { n i } for which:

Graphically, this coherent set of unwrapped phases across modules falls on a horizontal line when plotted against a y axis of represented distance (i.e. y = d; Figure 4 A) or, equivalently, on a straight line through the origin when plotted against a y axis of phase against inverse grid scale (Equation 2; Figure 4 B) — i.e. there is a set of integers { n i } for which:

This latter relationship is obtained by re-arranging Equation 1 and corresponds to the Fourier shift theorem (see discussion of the Algorithmic Solution in 2D below;). Thus, the distance d to a goal location represented by the set of module phases { p i } can be inferred by fitting a straight line through the origin on a plot of unwrapped phases p i + 2 πn i against inverse grid scale 1/ s i across modules (Figure 4 B). Moreover, this result can be generalized to any pair of arbitrary current and goal locations on that 1D axis, by replacing the absolute phase p i at the goal location with the phase difference Δp i between grid cell representations of current and goal locations in each module (Equation 3):

The latter value is inferred from the matching of theoretical and experimental values of the SDs displayed in (c), and no other fit parameter is used.

### The alpha angle [^443a1d60]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Which Imaging Modality Should We Be Using?

As with any diagnostic tool, accuracy and reliability are critical considerations; in other words, does the alpha angle accurately measure the head-neck junction cam deformity (i.e. accuracy), and can the angle measurement be reproduced by the same observers (i.e. intrarater reliability) and by different observers (i.e. interrater reliability)? For the alpha angle, accuracy and reliability depend on the imaging modality, the views or planes used, and the measurement techniques. Importantly, all accuracy and reliability metrics must involve comparison with a gold standard (ideally, the "truth", but, in most cases, simply the modality originally used to define the measurement), and the selection of an inappropriate gold standard can also lead to misleading conclusions. The accuracy of the various imaging modalities is summarized in Table I, and the reliability metrics are summarized in Table II.

Accuracy

As the original imaging modality on which the alpha angle was originally described, MRI was the gold standard for measurement of the alpha angle 18,21. The oblique plane used on MRI by Nötzli et al. (Fig. 2), the 12 o'clock plane, describes the relationship between the anterior femoral articular surface and femoral neck on MRI. This seminal article compared MRI scans of 39 patients who had groin pain, decreased internal rotation, and a positive impingement test, with 35 asymptomatic controls. Another retrospective study of MRI scans from 40 patients with clinically positive FAI syndrome supported these findings, with 93% having abnormal alpha angles. Here, coronal and sagittal oblique planes were used.

These are well-approximated by the analytical predictions (dashed lines) following a von Mises distribution centered around zero and with single parameter(with D ≃ 0.03 and μ ≃ 0.18 as predicted from theory).

### Invariant and smooth limit of discrete geometry folded from bistable origami leading to multistable metasurfaces [^a4d7097c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The hypar origami is not rigid foldable based on its original pattern. To analytically describe the geometry of each deformed corrugation, we assume that the deformations are isometric, and straight creases remain straight, which requires the introduction of at least one additional diagonal pleat in each trapezoidal panel to triangulate the pattern. We adopt the alternating asymmetric triangulation of Demaine et al.as it satisfies the reflection symmetry required by our present analytical model (see Supplementary Fig. 1). We parametrize a corrugation by one folding angle ρ ϵ [0, π] and two bending angles θ 1, θ 2 ϵ [0, π], considering panel width d and folding ridge length L, as shown in Fig. 2c. The dimensionless width w = (d / L) of a corrugation quickly vanishes away from the center. Denoting n as the number of square creases counted from the center, for a standard hypar pattern, we see that (d / L) = 1/(2 n), regardless of the actual dimension of the pattern. In the limit of w → 0, the twisting angle γ of a long corrugation becomes the average of θ 1 and θ 2. Due to orthogonality of the two symmetry planes, the virtual faces ΔABC and ΔD′E′F′ must be perpendicular to each other (see Fig. 2). Compatibility in radial directions further requires that θ 1 = θ 2. Detailed derivations are presented in Supplementary Note 1. Thus we have

The fact that θ 1 = θ 2 leads to ΔABC ≅ Δ D ′ E ′ F ′, which implies that ζ (r) and ξ (r) have the same constituents at the outer rims, and thus we may assume that ζ (r) and ξ (r) have the same shape, but opposite orientations (see Fig. 2d). Eventually, the twisted opening angle of a long corrugation (ψ ′ in Fig. 2b) becomes

We remark that the same identities resulting from an asymptotic analysis can be obtained using the other triangulation scheme, i.e. the asymmetric triangulation. The same conclusion based on the two triangulation schemes reveals that there are fundamental constructions of the folded hypar pattern, which are independent of local deformations between creases (i.e. within panels), as we take the limit to when each corrugation becomes a fiber on the homogenized surface.

### A space-time tradeoff for implementing a function with master equation dynamics [^57fa10b0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of physical systems, including systems that implement single-valued functions like a computer's update step. However, many such functions cannot be implemented by any master equation, even approximately, which raises the question of how they can occur in the real world. Here we show how any function over some "visible" states can be implemented with master equation dynamics-if the dynamics exploits additional, "hidden" states at intermediate times. We also show that any master equation implementing a function can be decomposed into a sequence of "hidden" timesteps, demarcated by changes in what state-to-state transitions have nonzero probability. In many real-world situations there is a cost both for more hidden states and for more hidden timesteps. Accordingly, we derive a "space-time" tradeoff between the number of hidden states and the number of hidden timesteps needed to implement any given function.

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^8ec71b12]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

There are geometric implications of using sequential Bayesian inference as coordinates for n -dimensional decision trajectories (Fig. 1 a, b). Although the decision trajectories have n probability-coordinates, P n, they are constrained such that ∑ i P i (t) = 1; therefore, the decision trajectories populate (n − 1)D simplices. For example, 2AFC decision dynamics are represented as a particle constrained to have P 0 (t) + P 1 (t) = 1, which is the 1D line P 1 = 1 − P 0 on a 2D (P 0, P 1) plot of the beliefs. It follows that 3AFC dynamics take place on a 2D plane (Fig. 1 a) and 4AFC dynamics in a 3D tetrahedron (Fig. 1 b) and so forth. Note that if any hypothesis has zero probability P i (t) = 0, then the space in which the decision trajectory evolves collapses to the remaining non-zero directions. For example, each face of the 4-choice tetrahedron in Fig. 1 b is a combination of three choices with non-zero probabilities and each edge a combination of two such choices.

As a result, decision boundaries are (n − 2)-dimensional objects in n -dimensional probability space. So for n > 2 choices, boundaries can have spatial dependence with respect to the decision space visualized in Fig. 1 a, b. For 2AFC tasks, decision boundaries are points on a 2D line, which are simply the transformed boundaries (equation 2) of the standard two-choice integration-to-threshold model. Likewise, for 3AFC, the decision boundaries are lines on a plane (Fig. 1 a, dashed lines) and for 4AFC are planes within a tetrahedron (Fig. 1 a, dark gray planes). The example boundaries shown are flat with a constant decision threshold in each dimension. An interesting consequence is that high-dimensional boundaries can have a nonlinear structure as a function of the n -dimensional beliefs P. Then, the linear 3AFC boundaries (Fig. 1 a, dashed lines) generalize to curves and the planar 4AFC boundaries (Fig. 1 b, dark gray planes) generalize to curved surfaces.

A, Gray dots depict part of the hexagonal grid in a transverse section of a stack of spirals or echo‐planar readouts. Blue dots mark the revolutions acquired within a shot for N = 1, 2, and 3 shots per k‐space plane. B, The hexagonal grid is described by oblique coordinates. All existing distances between grid points are represented in distances of the origin to points in one dodecant (yellow wedge), including its edges. Blue rings mark the distances reflected in (A), and the red ring highlights a distance not available with integer N. C, This distance is used when tilting the grid with respect to the rotational axis of the stack. The FE lines or spiral revolutions acquired in three subsequent shots are highlighted in red, orange, and yellow. D, The hexagonal grid is tilted as shown in (C). Red and yellow dots mark the points of the hexagonal grid that are covered by two subsequent shots. Green lines in the background show that all points of the hexagonal grid lie on nodes of a finer, rectilinear lattice, from which the starting angle of each spiral shot can be derived. Subsequent shots start with linearly progressing angles. The pattern is repetitive. E, Background: An entire mono‐planar T‐Hex stack of spirals cut open. The uppermost shot and the sites of puncture of the spirals are marked in dark gray. The resulting hexagonal grid shows the tilt as visualized in (C) and (D). In a representative patch, grid points that belong to spiral shots with the same phasing are colored the same. Foreground: Cross‐section corresponding to the stack in the upper panel, the acquisition time point is color‐coded, indicating a smoothfilter. Owing to the cross‐sectional depiction, "holes" appear on the central k‐space axis. In fact, this region is equally uniformly sampled, since all spirals start from the rotational axis of the cylinder

### Prior experience of rotation is not required for recognizing objects seen from different angles [^57dbe5d6]. Nature Neuroscience (2005). Medium credibility.

An object viewed from different angles can be recognized and distinguished from similar distractors after the viewer has had experience watching it rotate. It has been assumed that as an observer watches the rotation, separate representations of individual views become associated with one another. However, we show here that once monkeys learned to discriminate individual views of objects, they were able to recognize objects across rotations up to 60 degrees, even though there had been no opportunity to learn the association between different views. Our results suggest that object recognition across small or medium changes in viewing angle depends on features common to similar views of objects.

### A simplified formula for T1 contrast optimization for short-TR steady-state incoherent (spoiled) gradient echo sequences [^c91a4f57]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2007). Low credibility.

There are certain instances in practical magnetic resonance imaging where T1 changes by a small amount relative to a neighboring pixel or between scans for a given pixel. The source of these small changes in T1 can be caused either by changes in tissue water content or by the uptake of a contrast agent. For short repetition time (TR) spoiled gradient echo imaging, we show that a robust and a simple, easy to use back-of-the-envelope expression for the flip angle that optimizes contrast under these conditions is given by √(3θ_E) in radians or [180/π] √[6TR/T1] in degrees. We show that for a TR/T1 ratio of up to 0.3 and for a T1 change of up to ± 50%, this approximation to the optimal flip angle produces a contrast to within 6% of the theoretical maximum value and that these predictions are in good agreement with experiment.

Dynamics of guest polyelectrolytes in solutions

The radius of gyration R g of polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) in dilute solutions at 0.1 M NaCl and room temperature was measured using static light scattering (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Note 2). We have investigated five molar masses, M w = 126, 234, 587, 1188, and 2270 kDa, and these samples are named as PSS126, PSS234, PSS587, PSS1188, and PSS2270, respectively. The values of R g are 16.4, 24.1, 58, 78.3, and 96.4 nm for PSS126, PSS234, PSS587, PSS1188, and PSS2270, respectively. The corresponding values of the overlap concentration C * (= , with = Avogadro number) of PSS are 11.32, 6.63, 1.2, 1.0, and 0.98 mg/mL, respectively. The Guinier plots used in obtaining R g were constructed at PSS concentrations lower than C *.

### Scalar φ 4 field theory for active-particle phase separation [^50738f3d]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Recent theories predict phase separation among orientationally disordered active particles whose propulsion speed decreases rapidly enough with density. Coarse-grained models of this process show time-reversal symmetry (detailed balance) to be restored for uniform states, but broken by gradient terms; hence, detailed-balance violation is strongly coupled to interfacial phenomena. To explore the subtle generic physics resulting from such coupling, we here introduce 'Active Model B'. This is a scalar φ(4) field theory (or phase-field model) that minimally violates detailed balance via a leading-order square-gradient term. We find that this additional term has modest effects on coarsening dynamics, but alters the static phase diagram by creating a jump in (thermodynamic) pressure across flat interfaces. Both results are surprising, since interfacial phenomena are always strongly implicated in coarsening dynamics but are, in detailed-balance systems, irrelevant for phase equilibria.

### Non-linear relationships in clinical research [^ad643ba8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

True linear relationships are rare in clinical data. Despite this, linearity is often assumed during analyses, leading to potentially biased estimates and inaccurate conclusions. In this introductory paper, we aim to first describe-in a non-mathematical manner-how to identify non-linear relationships. Various methods are then discussed that can be applied to deal with non-linearity, including transformations, polynomials, splines and generalized additive models, along with their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we illustrate the use of these methods with a practical example from nephrology, providing guidance on how to report the results from non-linear relationships.

### Guidelines for noninvasive vascular laboratory testing: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography and the society of vascular medicine and biology [^240f6f0a]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2006). Medium credibility.

Duplex ultrasound vascular testing — beam orientation and Doppler angle: For B-mode imaging, the vessel of interest should be perpendicular to the ultrasound beam to obtain distinct echoes, and the ultrasound beam is directed perpendicular to the surface of interest to obtain the brightest echo with gray-scale imaging. The perpendicular angle is often readily obtained because arteries generally are parallel to the surface of the transducer. For the Doppler component, an angle of 60 degrees between the Doppler insonation beam and the vessel wall should be maintained; angles above 60 degrees can result in significant overestimation of the velocity and should be avoided. Angles that are not relevant to the vessel wall may misrepresent the true peak velocity.

### A modified reverse right-angled triangle osteotomy using the lateral approach for the treatment of posttraumatic cubitus varus deformity in children [^bbbb2306]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

During the time between October 2017 and May 2020, 22 elbows with posttraumatic cubitus varus deformity were treated by means of a modified reverse right-angled triangle osteotomy at the Department of Pediatric Orthopaedics of our hospital. All procedures were carried out by a single senior surgeon. The surgical indication was that the difference between the affected side and the healthy contralateral side was at least 20 degrees and the parents requested surgical treatment. The 22 patients involved included 6 female and 16 male patients with an average age of 10.3 years (range, 8 to 13 years) at the time of the osteotomy. The average time from injury to the osteotomy was 2.2 years (range, 1.1 to 3.2 years). Thirteen patients had a right-sided deformity and 9 had a left-sided deformity. All patients presented with an extension type of supracondylar fracture at the time of injury. The procedures were performed after the approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained from the patients and their families.

Preoperative Planning and Operative Technique

Design drawing of paper simulated osteotomy was performed before surgery. The initial osteotomy was performed 0.5 to 1 cm superior to the olecranon fossa and perpendicular to the lateral rim of the distal humerus (line AB) (Fig. 1 A). The proximal end of the humerus osteotomy was resected with a reverse right-angled triangle so that the DAE angle was equal to the intended angle of correction (Fig. 1 B). The intended angle of correction was equal to the sum of the carrying angle of the normal side plus the varus angle of the affected side and the expectation of 5 degrees of correction loss after surgery. According to the relevant knowledge of the right triangle, the angle DBA was equal to the angle DAE, which was the expected correction angle. After the inverted right triangle, ADB was cut off at the proximal end of the humerus osteotomy, and the apex A of the distal humeral osteotomy segment was rotated inward and overlapped with the apex D to complete the distal humeral valgus osteotomy (Fig. 1 C).

Doppler-based hemodynamic estimation — key technical limitations: The document cautions that "Doppler measurements are angle dependent and require optimal alignment (< 20° Θ angle), requiring interpretation of the highest velocity across multiple optimized imaging windows", and that "Errors in gain settings may also affect the accuracy of hemodynamic measurements. Overgaining can exponentially amplify the measured pressures, while undergaining low can lead to inadequate detection of the Doppler signal".

### The alpha angle [^91fe6233]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

TABLE III
Grades of Recommendation

Overall, the utility of the alpha angle as a single measurement in today's hip preservation practice is unclear. A single angle is likely inadequate to capture a complex 3D and dynamic pathologic process, and the methods for measuring this angle are rife with imprecision and variable reliability. That being said, the alpha angle is still the most commonly used and reported method for quantifying cam deformity. Also, it is important to correlate preoperative localization of the maximal alpha angle with direct intraoperative visualization of the lesion, as this can help to prevent under-resection. Although the alpha angle may continue to play a role in the diagnosis and management of FAI, the path forward will likely include much more 3D standardization, automation, and dynamic assessment of these measurements.

### The dimorphos ejecta plume properties revealed by LICIACube [^8ed88cc4]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Cone geometry methods

Equation (1) gives the geometric relation between a perfectly axisymmetric cone and its projection onto a plane in Euclidean space, where α is the half aperture angle of the original cone, δ is the half angle of the projected cone and θ is the angle between the axis of the original cone and the plane onto which it is projected (Extended Data Fig. 2).

The projected aperture angles (2 δ) are measured using LUKE images, and the SPICE data enable the calculation of camera planes in the inertial space. These are the planes to which the images are projected at each image acquisition time. Extended Data Table 1 details the image parameters used, and Extended Data Fig. 1 shows cropped portions of the respective images, which were used for the measurement of the projected aperture angle 2 δ. The uncertainty of the measurements is the minimum measurement possible by the protractor used, which is 1°.

Deriving an upper limit for the aperture angle

Equation (1) is rewritten as equation (2) for distinction. Equation (2) implies that given a measured projected half angle δ of a cone, the highest possible half angle α of the original cone can be obtained when the angle between the cone axis and the projected plane is 0°. A static cone is assumed over all six observations. The lowest projected aperture angle measured is the highest possible value of the original cone aperture angle. As such, the upper limit for the aperture angle of the ejecta cone has to be 140° with an uncertainty of 1°.

Constraining the axis and the aperture angle of the ejecta cone

Using these measured data and SPICE data, a nonlinear equation for each observation of the cone is constructed. A projected plane is defined by introducing the following equation, ax + by + cz + d = 0, where a, b, c and d are the coefficients describing the plane and x, y and z are the coordinates. The unit vector of the cone axis is also defined as (p, q and r). As using these geometric constraints yields θ, θ in equation (1) can be replaced with the quantities defined above and rewritten in the following way:where k is (a 2 + b 2 + c 2) 1/2.

### Primer on logistic regression for emergency care researchers [^12c58eb1]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Logistic regression plays a fundamental role in the production of decision rules, risk assessment, and in establishing cause and effect relationships. This primer is aimed at novice researchers with minimal statistical expertise.

Objective

Introduce the logit equation and provide a hands-on example to facilitate understanding of its benefits and limitations.

Discussion

This primer reviews the mathematical basis of a logit equation by comparing and contrasting it with the simple straight-line (linear) equation. After gaining an understanding of the meaning of beta coefficients, readers are encouraged to download a free statistical program and database to produce a logistic regression analysis. Using this example, the narrative then discusses commonly used methods to describe model fitness, including the C-statistic, chi square, Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria, McFadden's pseudo R 2, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The authors provide a how-to discussion for variable selection and estimate of sample size. However, logistic regression alone can seldom establish causal inference without further steps to explore the often complex relationship amongst variables and outcomes, such as with the use of a directed acyclic graphs. We present key elements that generally should be considered when appraising an article that uses logistic regression. This primer provides a basic understanding of the theory, hands-on construction, model analysis, and limitations of logistic regression in emergency care research.

Conclusions

Logistic regression can provide information about the association of independent variables with important clinical outcomes, which can be the first step to show predictiveness or causation of variables on the outcomes of interest. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

### Tibial bowing in children-what is normal? A radiographic study [^f363d396]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To define osseous landmarks on tibia radiographs in order to establish age-related normal values characterizing physiological tibial bowing in children.

Materials and Methods

Five hundred and twenty-six patients aged 0–17 years with normal radiographs of the lower legs were identified and retrospectively reviewed by two blinded radiologists. In anteroposterior (ap)/lateral (lat)-views, 3 lines defined tibial length and angulation. Line-A connecting proximal to distal corner of tibial metaphysic, lines B and C corresponding to corners of tibial metaphysis. Angle A/B defines proximal, A/C distal tibial-angulation. Tibial curvature is defined by distance of line-D parallel to A and tangential to tibial cortex. Normal values were calculated with linear-regression. Intra-/Interreader agreement were tested with a Bland-Altman-plot.

Results

Intrareader-agreement: Reader 1 showed a bias of -0.1, standard-deviation of bias was 1.9 and 95%-limits-of-agreement -3.9–3.7. Reader 2: -0.01, 2.4 and -4.7–4.7. Interreader: 0.2, 1.6 and -2.9–3.3. Angle-A/B ap was 80–100°, increasing with age (86.5–88); angle-AC ap was 82–107°(96.8–90.5), angle-AB lat was 81–107°(93.0–98.0); angle-AC lat was 76–102 (89.5–86.5); depth of curve ap was 0–11% (8–3.5) and lat 2–13%, (8.5–3.5).

Conclusion

Age dependent tibial bowing can be assessed with this new measurement system and age-related normal-values characterizing physiological tibial bowing in children is established.

Key Points

- Tibial Bowing is diagnosed on conventional radiographs.
- Existing Methods provide limited level of confidence.
- New methods provide easy to assess landmarks in all patient ages.
- Existing methods require higher radiation dose compared to new method presented.

### What are the reference values and associated factors for center-edge angle and alpha angle? A population-based study [^eb7e6d31]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The available evidence regarding normal ranges for the center-edge angle and the alpha angle derives from a few small studies, and associated factors such as sex and anthropometric factors have not been well evaluated. Knowing more about normal values for these parameters is critical, because this can inform decisions about when to perform elective hip preservation surgery. Population-level studies would provide considerable clarity on these issues, but to our knowledge, no such studies are available.

Questions/Purposes

The purposes of this study were (1) to use MRI in patients of a population-based study to establish normal values for the alpha and center-edge angles in the normal adult hip; and (2) to determine whether age, sex, or anthropometric variables were associated with differences in these values.

Methods

We used MRI images (1.5 T) of 3226 participants of the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). SHIP is a population-based study that started with 4308 participants in 1997. Participants were recruited randomly from official inhabitant data files as a stratified cluster sample of the population from a defined region in northeastern Germany. To ensure a representative epidemiologic cohort, stratification variables were sex, age, and city of residence. Between 2008 and 2012, 1094 of these participants underwent whole-body MRI with pelvic sequences in the second followup. In parallel, the next cohort, SHIP-Trend, started with the same protocol in which 2132 participants underwent MRI examination. Reference values were calculated by quantile regressions for the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. Associations with the demographic features sex, age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference were analyzed by bivariate linear regression models.

Results

The mean center-edge angle was 31° (± 7°) with a corresponding calculated normal range of 17° to 45°. The mean alpha angle was 55° (± 8°) with a corresponding calculated normal range between 39° and 71°. Men (30° ± 7°) had a lower center-edge angle than women (32° ± 8°) (p < 0.001, β = 1.4°; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9°-1.9°) and a higher alpha angle (57° ± 8° versus 52° ± 7°, p < 0.001, β = 5.7°; 95% CI, 5.2°-6.3°). Moreover, a higher center-edge angle for the left side was found (33° ± 8° versus 30° ± 8°, p < 0.001, β = 3.2°; 95% CI, 3.0°-3.4°). In addition to sex, we found that age, height, waist circumference, and BMI affected both center-edge angle and alpha angle. Weight was associated with the alpha angle as well. Because of these associations, age- and sex-adjusted reference values with belonging formulas were calculated.

Conclusions

The range of normal center-edge and alpha angles is quite wide. Therefore, only markedly abnormal angles may be associated with pathology. Moreover, center-edge angle and alpha angle are associated with age, sex, and anthropometric factors, which have to be taken into account for better interpretation.

Clinical Relevance

The association of abnormal radiographic values with true clinical hip pathology is tenuous at best. Assuming that a patient with an abnormal radiograph requires treatment is unwise. The clinical picture has to be substantial for therapeutic decisions.

### Non-linear relationships in clinical research [^668fb19a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Polynomial functions

In Fig. 4, we provide an example of a simple power transformation using the square function, which raises a variable to the power of 2 (x 2), providing a U-shaped curve. Higher powers of x can be also used to determine the shape of the function, such as the cubic function (x 3) which has a distinctive S-shape. These power terms form the core elements of so-called polynomial functions, which along with the coefficients included in the function, offer a flexible way to model various curves. By adjusting the coefficients and power functions, polynomials offer a wide variety of shapes. "Fractional" polynomial functions allow the power terms to be fractions instead of just whole numbers (i.e. x 1/2) [21]. A (fractional) polynomial function often provides sufficient flexibility to follow relatively simple non-linear curves, providing a simpler solution than the more advanced techniques we describe below. However, higher degree polynomials can be sensitive to "noise" in the data, and are not suited for fitting some of the more complex curves (e.g. sudden shifts, discontinuities, or logarithmic curves). They may also suffer from Runge's phenomenon, becoming unstable and oscillating at the edges of the data, and extrapolate poorly beyond the original range of the independent variable.

Regression splines

A powerful approach to dealing with non-linearity is provided by the family of spline functions. Instead of a single function defining the whole curve, such as polynomials or other transformations, splines are constructed by using a series of functions, each defining a different segment of the curve. As splines are constructed segment by segment — or piece by piece — they are often referred to as "piecewise" functions. Segments are connected to each other using so-called "knots", and the spline is restricted to join at these knots so there are no gaps in the curve. The simplest spline function is the linear spline function. This function assumes linearity within each segment, but the overall curve formed by the connected segments can be non-linear. For a small number of segments, linear spline models can be as easy to interpret as linear regression, as each segment can be represented by a single slope. Figure 3 provides an example of a simple linear spline with two knots (in green). These two knots divide the range of the independent variable into three segments, each with its own slope.

### Nonlinear magnitude and linear phase behaviors of T2✱ imaging: theoretical approximation and monte carlo simulation [^78d7f7fa]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The underlying source of brain imaging by T2✱-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T2✱MRI) is the intracranial inhomogeneous tissue magnetic susceptibility (denoted by χ) that causes an inhomogeneous field map (via magnetization) in a main field. By decomposing T2✱MRI into two steps, we understand that the 1st step from a χ source to a field map is a linear but non-isomorphic spatial mapping, and the 2nd step from the field map to a T2✱ image is a nonlinear mapping due to the trigonometric behavior of spin precession signals. The magnitude and phase calculations from a complex T2✱ image introduce additional nonlinearities. In this report, we look into the magnitude and phase behaviors of a T2✱ image (signal) by theoretical approximation and Monte Carlo simulation. We perform the 1st-order Taylor expansion on intravoxel dephasing formula of a T2✱ signal and show that the T2✱ magnitude is a quadratic mapping of the field map and T2✱ phase is a linear isomorphic mapping. By Monte Carlo simulation of T2✱MRI for a span of echo times (with B0 = 3T and TE = [0,120] ms), we first confirm the quadratic magnitude and linear phase behaviors in small phase angle regime (via TE < 30ms), and then provide more general magnitude and phase nonlinear behaviors in large phase angle scenarios (via TE > 30ms). By solving the inverse problem of T2✱MRI, we demonstrate χ tomography and conclude that the χ source can be reliably reconstructed from a T2✱ phase image in a small phase angle regime.

### A novel precise optical navigation system for craniomaxillofacial surgery registered with an occlusal splint [^7be7ad98]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

In terms of data analysis, in the preoperative and postoperative measurements of the 10 groups of mandibular models, the left data was selected to mark many anatomical landmarks, and statistical analysis was performed by defining different line segments, planes, and angles (Fig. 7). Specifically, we marked condyle (A 1), coracoid (A 2), osteotomy point of the mandibular trailing edge (B 1), osteotomy point of the mandibular front edge (B 2), medial mandibular osteotomy point (B 3), and gonion (C). Then, we marked the mandibular ramus plane (A 1 A 2 C) as yellow and the osteotomy plane (B 1 B 2 B 3) as red. Finally, we selected and defined the line segment A 1 B 3 as the inner plate height, the line segment A 1 B 1 as the outer plate height, and the line segment the length of B 1 B 2 was osteotomy length, ∠A 1 B 1 B 2 was the retained mandibular angle, and the angle between plane A 1 A 2 C and plane B 1 B 2 B 3 was osteotomy angle. Undergoing the statistics of inner plate height, outer plate height, osteotomy length, retained mandibular angle, and osteotomy angle for designed osteotomy, respectively (preoperative) (Fig. 7) and the actual osteotomy (postoperative), respectively, the statistical results are shown in Supplementary Digital Content, Table 1. Statistical software (SPSS 26; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) was used to perform a paired t -test on the mandibular measurement data, and all measurement data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Finally, we made a scatter plot for the preoperative design and postoperative results of each index, and analyzed the correlation coefficient and consistency of each data (Fig. 8, Supplementary Digital Content, Table 2).

### A multi-step model of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis [^e2cef97a]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Box 1
Armitage and Doll Multistep Model – Heuristic Argument*

If disease development depends on one step, incidence in a given year will be proportional to the chance of undergoing that step:If two‐steps are required, then incidence is the product of the chance of undergoing the first step by age t and the rate of undergoing the second step:And for n‐steps:Taking log of both sides returns the equation for a straight line:The slope is one less than the number of steps required to develop the disease, and the intercept represents the combined probability of undergoing these steps.

*see Webster 2019 for full derivation.

A multistep model of pathogenesis could account for many of the epidemiological observations made in PD. These include the variability in the expression of disease and age of onset in carriers of disease‐causing mutations, and the multiple environmental and genetic associations that confer a risk of developing PD. A multistep model could also explain the phenotypic variability seen in PD, if it is assumed that at least some steps apply to specific neuronal populations rather than the nervous system as a whole. Furthermore, the predictions arising from such a model can be used to test specific hypotheses about basic observations in PD, such as whether the higher incidence and prevalence of PD in males observed in most parts of the world relates to differential environmental exposures by sex.

### Fast fat suppression RF pulse train with insensitivity to B1 inhomogeneity for body imaging [^88ee1112]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

In higher-field magnetic resonance imaging scanners, a spectrally selective fat saturation radiofrequency (RF) pulse does not work well because B(1) inhomogeneity increases. An adiabatic 180° pulse is used to improve nonuniform fat suppression, but requires inversion recovery time. Therefore, a new RF pulse that achieves flip angles near 90° and is B(1) insensitive has been developed. The pulse consists of three sinc-shaped RF pulses with different flip angles and with different time intervals between each RF pulse. Using the Bloch equations, we analyzed the optimal combination of flip angles. Experimental results demonstrated that M(z) was maintained at less than 0.05 M(0) for a B(1) inhomogeneity of ± 35%. The optimal net flip angles was adjusted to 95° by varying the time interval between RF pulses. The pulse duration was 77 ms, which is less than half of the 170-ms inversion recovery time required for the adiabatic pulse. We demonstrated excellent fat suppression for body imaging.

### Enantioselectivity of discretized helical supramolecule consisting of achiral cobalt phthalocyanines via chiral-induced spin selectivity effect [^a999592d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Microscopic structure of helical supramolecules

Next, we address the microscopic structures of the helical supramolecules, focusing on a mechanism to create chirality from the achiral components. We investigate three-dimensional (3D) structural information by tomographic reconstruction from tilt series of two-dimensional TEM images. For this analysis, we selected a single-stranded helical structure to avoid a possible complexity in the cross-sectional image owing to overlapping supramolecules in double- or triple-stranded helix. Figure 3a shows a typical cross-sectional image of a single-stranded helical supramolecule, in which stripe patterns along the 1D-stacking axis are well-resolved, confirming the highly 1D-crystalline nature of the supramolecules. A clue for discussing the origin of helical nature is found in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis of the cross-sectional image. In Fig. 3 b and c, two pairs of discrete spots (Q 1 and Q 2) are clearly obtained in the FFT pattern of a yellow-rectangular region in Fig. 3a. The spots of Q 1 and Q 2 are not broadened along the azimuthal angle direction, indicative of an existence of two well-defined periodicities with different directions (see also line-profile analysis across Q 1 and Q 2 in Supplementary Fig. 3). The deduced periodicity in real space from the Q 1 and Q 2 spots is approximately 1.8–1.9 nm, roughly comparable to a diameter of a CoPc molecule. We also performed additional structural analysis based on electron diffraction images of the helix; the obtained lattice constants differ from those of well-established superstructures such as α, β, and ε-phases, but seem to fit a structure of so-called J -phase(see Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 1 for details). Here the simultaneous appearance of Q 1 and Q 2 can be interpreted as either a superimposed double- Q structure or spatially separated multiple domains of a single- Q structure. One useful way to distinguish these two possibilities is to examine Q 1 + Q 2 spots, which are allowed to appear only for the former double- Q case. In Fig. 3b, although spots of higher order periodicity, Q 3 and Q 4, show up, Q 1 + Q 2 spots are not identified, excluding the former possibility. Furthermore, additional FFT analysis for the two restricted regions, positions 1 and 2, in Fig. 3a shows that either Q 1 or Q 2 spots appear in each position (Fig. 3 d and e). These results lead us to conclude that our helical supramolecule includes spatially separated multi-domain structures characterized by different directions of periodicity. What is noteworthy here is that similar FFT results are obtained for different locations in the cross-sectional image (see Supplementary Fig. 4). Hence, the multi-domain nature is not a property that emerges only at a certain location but rather can be viewed as an overall characteristic of the helical superstructure.

### Angle-based wavefront sensing enabled by the near fields of flat optics [^3283df1c]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Measuring the wavefront of light has broad application in optical characterization. Wavefront cannot be directly measured, because it is determined by phase. There are two types of indirect methods to measure the wavefront. The first is based on interference as shown in Fig. 1a. A secondary reference wave, often a replica of the primary incident wave, is brought in to interfere with the primary wave. The resulting interference patterns are used to measure the phaseor the gradient of the phase. It offers high spatial resolution for quantitative phase imaging –. However, the interference method has certain limitations related to delicate interference setups and complex signal acquisition schemes, making it sensitive to temporal perturbation or spatial alignment. Recent work has shown exciting progresses in overcoming these shortcomings. Despite rapid progress in the interference method, a second method based on angle measurement is much more dominant in commercial applications because of its robustness. Figure 1b illustrates the working principle of angle-based wavefront sensors. Arrays of micro-lenses sample the incident angleson a set of grid points. These angles together can determine the wavefront –. Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensors, one type of angle sensor, have been widely used in adaptive optics such as astronomy, and biomedical imaging –. It is also widely used in metrology –. While angle-based method is fast and robust, they have a long-standing difficulty. Its spatial resolution is low, orders of magnitude lower than that of interference methods. As such, they are mostly used for slowly varying wavefronts and are not suitable for demanding applications such as quantitative phase imaging. In addition to these two main methods, there are other innovative approaches such as spatial wavefront sampling.

### SSFP signal with finite RF pulses [^29a35a7d]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The theoretical description of steady state free precession (SSFP) sequences is generally well accepted and unquestioned, although it is based on instantaneously acting radiofrequency (RF) pulses. In practice, however, all excitation processes are finite, thereby questioning the overall validity of the common SSFP signal description for use with finite RF pulses. In this paper, finite RF pulse effects on balanced SSFP signal formation are analyzed as a function of the RF time, the pulse repetition time, the flip angle (alpha) and relaxation times (T(1,2)). The observed signal modulations from finite RF pulses (compared to infinitesimal ones) can range from only a few percent (for RF time/pulse repetition time < < 1, alpha < < 90 degrees, T(2)/T(1) approximately 1) to over 10% (for RF time/pulse repetition time < < 1, alpha approximately 90 degrees, T(2)/T(1) < < 1) and may even exceed 100% in the limit of RF time/pulse repetition time → 1 (for alpha approximately 90 degrees, T(2)/T(1) < < 1). As a result, a revision of SSFP signal theory is indicated not only for reasons of completeness but also seems advisable, e.g., for all quantitative SSFP methods. A simple modification for the common balanced SSFP equation is derived that provides an accurate framework for SSFP signal description over a wide variety of practical and physiologic parameters.

### Transceive phase mapping using the PLANET method and its application for conductivity mapping in the brain [^5949a251]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

2.2 Estimation of the transceive phase ϕ ± with bSSFP and PLANET

2.2.1 bSSFP

As shown in Figure 1 B, bSSFP signal phase appears almost constant within the pass‐band region and shifts vertically by a quantity corresponding to ϕ ± value. Thus, the transceive phase is generally approximated by the phase of bSSFP signal (whereas all other phase contributions in bSSFP phase image[Equation A1] are normally neglected).

2.2.2 PLANET

PLANET applies a linear least squares fit, specific to ellipses, in the complex plane to steady state phase‐cycled bSSFP data using the signal model defined in Equation 1. 48 This model assumes a Lorentzian single‐component relaxation model. To fit the ellipse coefficients in PLANET, at least N = 6 dynamics with different RF phase increments are required. 48 The PLANET method reconstructs T 1, T 2, a banding‐free image, B 0 ‐related off‐resonances (Δf 0) and ϕ ± from the shape and rotation of the ellipse (Figure 1 C).

When B 0 drift is assumed negligible and when eddy‐current effects are compensated for, the terms ϕ drift and ϕ eddy drop out from the rotation angle Ω in Equation A5, yielding:

Both Ω and Δf 0 in Equation 2 can be independently estimated from the fitting procedure (see steps 2 and 4 in reference 48). Hence, PLANET‐based transceive phase can be obtained by subtracting these two terms.

### Advanced statistics: linear regression, part I: simple linear regression [^18239641]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Simple linear regression is a mathematical technique used to model the relationship between a single independent predictor variable and a single dependent outcome variable. In this, the first of a two-part series exploring concepts in linear regression analysis, the four fundamental assumptions and the mechanics of simple linear regression are reviewed. The most common technique used to derive the regression line, the method of least squares, is described. The reader will be acquainted with other important concepts in simple linear regression, including: variable transformations, dummy variables, relationship to inference testing, and leverage. Simplified clinical examples with small datasets and graphic models are used to illustrate the points. This will provide a foundation for the second article in this series: a discussion of multiple linear regression, in which there are multiple predictor variables.

### Additive angle method for fast large-tip-angle RF pulse design in parallel excitation [^490f3a09]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Current methods for parallel excitation RF pulse design are based on the small-tip-angle approximation, which provides a computationally efficient means of pulse calculation. In general, pulses designed with those methods are inaccurate when scaled to produce large-tip angles, and methods for large-tip-angle pulse design are more computationally demanding. This paper introduces a fast iterative method for large-tip-angle parallel pulse design that is formulated as a small number of Bloch equation simulations and fast small-tip-angle pulse designs, the results of which add to produce large-tip-angle pulses. Simulations and a phantom experiment demonstrate that the method is effective in designing multidimensional large-tip-angle pulses of high excitation accuracy, compared to pulses designed with small-tip-angle methods.

### Crystal growth in confinement [^1bb3a3c9]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Table 1
Step front velocities of the two interlaced layers A and B, measured at σ = 0.002 on the crystal shown in Fig. 3

There is a difference in supersaturation from the outer rim (red), σ = 0.002, to the edge of the cavity (light red), σ ≈ 0. We have therefore measured the step front propagation velocity upwards in the image Fig. 3 C in the green region c. Figure 3 D shows the measured velocities of the step fronts, A and B, of the two half layers of the unit cell. The straight line fits demonstrate that the step front velocity is linear in vertical position, going to zero at the cavity and the maximum values (found in Table 1) at the outer edge.

In the very small range of supersaturations over the growth rim it is reasonable to assume that the supersaturation is linear in position, that is, the step velocity is linear in supersaturation:where α = 1170 ± 110 μm/s.

Using this relation, we have simulated the A and B step front propagation from a dislocation source situated at the inner rim edge like in Fig. 3 A–C. The local step propagation velocity normal to the step front follows from (1). The supersaturation σ is assumed to be a linear function of the distance from the outer rim edge and constant in time in this stationary state. Each point of the front is shifted with every time step according to the local concentration and the orientation-dependent growth kinetics as described by Eq. (1). This emulates a part of an extended growth rim, where the inner (lower) part is connected to the cavity. For the orientation dependency of the step front kinetics, the experimental values are used. The A and B fronts have kinetic anisotropy ratios k (θ) as shown in Fig. 3 E. The resulting A and B step fronts are shown in Fig. 3 H, I for every 10th simulation time step. One observes the close correspondence with the step fronts in Fig. 3 A–D. This shows that the simple assumptions of our simulations are valid for a crystal surface confined about 50 nm from an inert surface, with a small bulk supersaturation (σ = 0.002) and a growth spiral that ensures that step fronts pass with regular intervals (every ≈ 10 s).

### Mitigating the impact of flip angle and orientation dependence in single compartment R2* estimates via 2-pool modeling [^8ed47cfa]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In this work, a two compartment model was used to investigate the impact of tissue microstructure on single compartmentrelaxation rate estimates, with particular focus on the flip angle dependence that this produces. Simulations showed good agreement with in vivo data illustrating that MWF and residency time both dictate the observed. The heuristic linear model that we propose in this work can partition the α‐dependent and α‐independent components of the single compartment. Ideally, the true multi‐compartment nature of the tissue would be faithfully characterized, but if the data to support more advanced modeling are not available, the flip angle independent component may provide a more robust measure owing to its reduced sensitivity to confounding factors such as α and fiber orientation. It may, therefore, be a useful means of reducing spurious variance particularly in multisite studies.

### Modelling the species-area relationship using extreme value theory [^10b0aaff]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The nested species-area relationship, obtained by counting species in increasingly larger areas in a nested fashion, exhibits robust and recurring qualitative and quantitative patterns. When plotted in double logarithmic scales it shows three phases: rapid species increase at small areas, slower growth at intermediate scales, and faster rise at large scales. Despite its significance, the theoretical foundations of this pattern remain incompletely understood. Here, we develop a theory for the species-area relationship using extreme value theory, and show that the species-area relationship is a mixture of the distributions of minimum distances to a starting sampling focal point for each individual species. A key insight of our study is that each phase is determined by the geographical distributions of the species, i.e., their ranges, relative to the focal point, enabling us to develop a formula for estimating the number of species at phase transitions. We test our approach by comparing empirical species-area relationships for different continents and taxa with our predictions using Global Biodiversity Information Facility data. Although a SAR reflects the underlying biological attributes of the constituent species, our interpretations and use of the extreme value theory are general and can be widely applicable to systems with similar spatial features.

### Nonuniversal impact of cholesterol on membranes mobility, curvature sensing and elasticity [^a81490d9]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The distribution width σ of the mean curvature values (used as a measure for the bending modulus κ b for bicelle systems), is slightly smaller for DOPC compared to DPPC. Addition of cholesterol led to increased fluctuations for DOPC, from 0.018 nm − 1 to 0.021 nm − 1, indicative of a softened membrane. In contrast, curvature fluctuations substantially decreased for the saturated DPPC bilayer upon the addition of cholesterol, a signature of membrane stiffening.

Thus, despite a similar ordering and condensing effect of cholesterol on all investigated types of lipid bilayers, the addition of cholesterol led to enhanced fluctuations of the mean curvature for the di-unsaturated DOPC lipid bilayer, and decreased fluctuations for fully saturated DPPC membranes.

Cholesterol stiffening and softening of lipid membranes

To further quantify the effect of cholesterol on membrane fluctuations, we analyzed the membrane bending modulus κ b for all investigated systems, i.e. bicelle and infinite systems, at CG and all-atom resolution (see Supplementary Table 4). κ b is defined by the Helfrich Hamiltonian, which relates the membrane bending energy E b to the local principle curvatures C 1 and C 2 by an integral over the membrane surface,

The Gaussian curvature term (κ G C 1 C 2) is disregarded in the following as it contributes a constant, the spontaneous curvature C 0 is zero for symmetric membranes. For infinite membrane systems, Fourier transformation of the lipid height field (FT-H) or, alternatively, of the lipid orientation field (FT-O) –, and application of the equipartition theorem allows to determine bending moduli and lipid tilt moduli from fluctuation spectra(see Methods Section for details) with high accuracy (Fig. 3c). For the bicelle, in turn, the local fluctuation method (LFM) in direct space was used. It relates the fluctuation width σ in mean curvature (H = 1 / 2(C 1 + C 2)) averaged over the analyzed circular disc domain to the bending modulus (see Methods Section), with σ ∝ κ − 1 / 2.

### Modelling the species-area relationship using extreme value theory [^2a10b7d0]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

When a SAR is plotted across a wide range of areas on a double logarithmic plot, it displays three distinct regions, forming a triphasic curve. Initially, for small areas, which we call Phase I, the number of species increases rapidly, with a slope approaching 1. Subsequently, for intermediate area sizes, Phase II, the SAR exhibits slower growth, following a power law with an exponent smaller than one. Finally, for large area sizes, Phase III, the SAR experiences rapid growth again, with a slope tending to one.

Several explanations have been proposed for each phase of the SAR. Williamson, building on an argument by Plotkin and Levin, attributed the steep slope of Phase I to species occurring at very low densities in very small areas. In the limiting case where species are represented by only one individual, this leads to a SAR with a slope of one on a double logarithmic plot. For Phase II, Prestonexplained the power law relationship, with a presumed exponent approximately equal to 0.25, by assuming an underlying lognormal species abundance distribution under the canonical assumption that the maximum of the distribution of individuals coincides with the most abundant species. Subsequently, Maydemonstrated that the slope is still approximately equal to 0.25 when the canonical approach is relaxed. Finally, the steep slope characterising Phase III has been explained as the result of the combination of species from different biogeographical realms, or, similarly, due to the sampled areas being of similar magnitude to the geographic ranges of species.

### Multidimensional RF pulse design with consideration of concomitant field effects [^ae84ecf6]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

2 THEORY

2.1 Concomitant fields

According to Maxwell's equations, a vector magnetic field must satisfy two conditions: negligible curl, assuming that the true and displacement current densities are negligible, and zero divergence. As a result, additional transverse magnetic fields, denoted as concomitant fields, are created when gradient fields are applied. Based on Bernstein et al.a vector Taylor expansion of a vector magnetic fieldin the laboratory frame neglecting gradient nonlinearity is given by:whereis a vector of applied gradient fields along the physical‐,‐, and‐axes, respectively, is the symmetry parameter which depends on coil geometry.is a constant that represents two identical unspecified field derivatives (i.e.) that are not directly related to the desired gradients, therefore g is often assumed to be zero.denotes spatial coordinates in the physical coordinate system, andis the main magnetic field strength.

Consider a general scenario where an RF field with an angular frequency ofand gradient fields are applied to a spin system in the laboratory frame, as shown in Figure 1A. Assuming uniform transmit sensitivities, the vector magnetic fieldin the laboratory frame can be described as a superposition of an RF field, the staticfield, gradient fields, and concomitant fields:whereis the RF field andrepresents a right‐handed rotation matrix that rotates a vector about theaxis by an angle. It is important to note that concomitant fieldsare stationary (i.e. nonrotating) in the laboratory frame and are considered as an off‐resonance RF field in the context of RF pulse design.

FIGURE 1
Derivation of concomitant gradient terms from concomitant fields using the Bloch‐Siegert shift. (A) The vector magnetic fieldin the laboratory frame consists of a rotating on‐resonance RF field, nonrotating concomitant fields, a staticfield, and gradient fields. (B, C) Bloch‐Siegert shift approximation. The concomitant fields are considered as an off‐resonance RF field with a carrier frequency of. To calculate the BS shift caused by concomitant fields, the vector magnetic fieldexcluding other RF fields is transformed into a rotating frame with an angular frequency of. The difference between the magnitude of the effective magnetic fieldand the magnitude of its z component is known as the BS shift caused by the concomitant fields (indicated by the red curly bracket). (D) Once the BS shift approximation is used, concomitant fields are treated as an additional off‐resonance term in a rotating frame with a frequency of.

### Inference of field reversed configuration topology and dynamics during alfvenic transients [^8a0b1e8d]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Active control of field reversed configuration (FRC) devices requires a method to determine the flux surface geometry and dynamic properties of the plasma during both transient and steady-state conditions. The current tomography (CT) method uses Bayesian inference to determine the plasma current density distribution using both the information from magnetic measurements and a physics model in the prior. Here we show that, from the inferred current sources, the FRC topology and its axial stability properties are readily obtained. When Gaussian process priors are used and the forward model is linear, the CT solution involves non-iterative matrix operations and is then ideally suited for deterministic real-time applications. Because no equilibrium assumptions are used in this case, inference of plasma topology and dynamics up to Alfvenic frequencies then becomes possible. Inference results for the C-2U device exhibit self-consistency of motions and forces during Alfvenic transients, as well as good agreement with plasma imaging diagnostics.

### The burden of proof studies: assessing the evidence of risk [^ae0fefba]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Basis splines, measurement mechanism and shape constraints

We used a Bayesian regularized spline to obtain the general shape of the nonlinear relationship. Basis splines represent nonlinear curves as linear combination of recursively generated basis elements. The basis elements were recursively generated using piecewise smooth polynomials, and were roughly localized to certain regions of the exposure variable in the data. Most of the time, quadratic or cubic polynomials were used, often with linear tails in the presence of sparse data. This approach allowed the common restricted cubic spline and constraints on the shape of the relationship (including nondecreasing and nonincreasing).

Given basis functions f 1, …, f k and coefficient vector β = (β 1. β k), the final curve is obtained as a β -linear combination

Specifically, for any given exposure (x), the prediction using the spline model is given bywhere X is a vector containing (f 1 (x), …, f k (x)). Derivatives and integrals of splines can likewise be expressed as linear combinations of spline coefficient β. For additional details about B -splines see Zheng et al.

Many studies of dose–response relationships report relative risks between categories defined by intervals of consumption. In mathematical notation, these observations are given bywhere y ij is the reported relative risk corresponding to measurement j in study i, [a ij, b ij] delineates the reference group exposure interval, and [c ij, d ij] delineates the alternative group exposure interval.

When f (x) is represented using a spline, each integral is a linear function of β similar to equation (1). The model (equation (2)) is then a ratio of linear functions, with the log relative risk given by

Equation (4) is a nonlinear function of the spline coefficients β.

When studying dose–response relationships, we allow for shape constraints of the inferred mean response. For example, for some harmful risks, such as smoking and air pollution, we assume the relative risk is monotonically increasing with exposure. To regularize the splines, and capture biologically plausible limits, we also allow a maximal derivative constraint, which is similar to penalizing total variation or limiting the spline degree. To introduce each of these constraints, we used the fact that derivatives of splines are linear functions of spline coefficients, similar to equation (1).

Insert Needle Into Site

At a 45° angle to the injection site, with your other hand use a quick dart-like motion to insert the needle into the site (See Figure G).

Be careful to insert the needle so that it will not inject into your ﬁngers holding the injection site.

Step 4

Inject Medicine

After the needle is in, let go of squeezing the injection site.

Slowly push the plunger all the way down with your thumb until all the medicine is injected and the Syringe is empty (See Figure H). If the plunger is not pressed all the way down the Needle Safety Feature will not activate afterwards to cover the needle.

Do not move, twist, or rotate Syringe during injection.

Step 5

End of Injection, Remove Syringe

Pull the Syringe away from the injection site, then release your thumb from the plunger. The needle will retract and the Needle Safety Feature will cover the needle (See Figure I).

Caution: If the needle did not retract or you do not think you received the full dose, contact your healthcare provider for assistance.

If the needle does not retract, carefully place the Syringe into a sharps or puncture resistant container to avoid injury.

3 RESULTS

The CP echo signals only oscillates with an exact frequency of(see Equation 5) for ideal rectangular slice profiles. In practice, the slice profile is generally not rectangular, and the signal sums over a distribution of flip angles centered around the chosen flip angle. As a result, the observed frequencies deviate from the idealbehavior (see Figure 2).

FIGURE 2
Simulations of CP echo amplitudes for an ideal slice profile (black open circles) and for a realistic slice profile (blue filled circles) for relative B 1 values of 0.5, 1, and 1.5. The real slice profile was computed using the pulse shape generated from the sequence. The simulations were performed using the configuration model toolkit

Figure 3A shows a voxel‐wise comparison of the observed B 1 + magnitude for both AFI and CP, and over the whole phantom in the form of a binned scatter plot. Using a linear regression analysis, a slope of 0.993 and an offset of −0.013 are found, indicating excellent correlation. In Figure 3B, the relative difference of the two methods is assessed in a Bland‐Altmann plot, where the relative difference is defined as (B 1, AFI − B 1, CP)/(mean B 1) for every voxel. The "mean B 1 " corresponds to the voxel‐wise average of the B 1, AFI and the B 1, CP. The mean relative difference is calculated to be at −2.14% and is indicated in the figure together with the 95% confidence interval.

### The alpha angle [^fee5f34e]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

The current diagnosis and management of FAI syndrome in clinical practice rely on a combination of a positive clinical examination and characteristic imaging findings. The alpha angle, the most commonly reported radiographic measure of cam morphology, was first defined in 2002 by Nötzli et al.using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. 1). Cam morphology is clinically important, as it can be a risk factor for the development of osteoarthritis (more so than isolated pincer morphology). In the original definition by Nötzli et al. the alpha angle was defined as the angle between the femoral neck axis and a line connecting the femoral head center with the point of beginning asphericity of the head-neck contour. Specifically, a para-axial plane was used, parallel to the axis of the femoral neck and passing through the center of the femoral head; this radial view was defined in each individual from the initial coronal scout view.

Fig. 1
Top: MRI slice of the femoral head-neck junction. Bottom: Conceptual diagram demonstrating a sample alpha angle measurement using the circle of the best-fit method, with the alpha angle measured between the femoral neck axis and a line connecting the femoral head center with the point of beginning asphericity of the head-neck contour. The center of the femoral neck is determined as the center of a circle touching the cortices of the femoral neck on either side. Note that the measurement methodologies for both the femoral neck center and the alpha angle may vary slightly depending on imaging modality or planes; this diagram is simply meant to communicate the concept of the alpha angle. (Courtesy of Dr. Seyed Arad Mosalami Aghili.)

As hip preservation surgery becomes an increasingly common part of orthopaedic surgical practice and training, it is important to revisit the clinical and academic utility of the alpha angle. Furthermore, with advancements in imaging technology and the increasing availability of 3D imaging modalities, it is important to consider the diagnostic, prognostic, and academic value of measuring a single angle to quantify a complex, 3D, and dynamic disease process.

### Identification of a kitaev quantum spin liquid by magnetic field angle dependence [^9a8da133]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The universal properties of the KQSL can be observed by heat capacity experiments. Figure 5 a illustrates the calculated specific heat c v (ϕ) for the KQSL as a function of in-plane field angle ϕ (where magnetic field is rotated within the honeycomb plane). The specific heat is maximized by gapless continuum of excitations when the magnetic field is aligned to the bond directions. For comparison, the zigzag state, observed in α -RuCl 3 at zero field, is investigated by using a spin wave theory. The magnon spectrum is gapped due to completely broken spin rotation symmetry, so there is no critical line on the (θ, ϕ) plane (Fig. 5 b). Compared to the KQSL, the zigzag state exhibits reverted patterns of ϕ dependence in the excitation energy gap and specific heat. The energy gap is maximized and the specific heat is minimized at the bond directions. This behavior is closely related with the structure of spin configuration: all spin moments are aligned perpendicular to a certain bond direction selected by magnetic field direction (Supplementary Note 9). The distinct patterns of ϕ dependence in Fig. 5 characterize differences between the non-abelian KQSL and zigzag states. Remarkably, such behaviors were observed in the recent heat capacity experiments with in-plane magnetic fields. Covering the polar angle (θ) in the heat capacity measurements will provide more detailed information on the critical lines and spin interactions in α -RuCl 3 (see Fig. 1 d).

Magnon gaps for other values of Γ are shown together to highlight the generality of the field angle dependence.

Lastly, we have examined the chirality and critical behaviors of excitation energy gap for magnetically ordered phases of H (θ, ϕ). It is found that the associated magnon gap does not have any critical lines, and there is no resemblance/correlation between the magnon gap and the chirality (Supplementary Note 9).

### Phase informed model for motion and susceptibility [^b1900879]. Human Brain Mapping (2013). Low credibility.

Performing the Dynamic Distortion Correction

From Eq. (5), the resulting map of local phase changes associated with each time point i can be scaled from radians to a change in B 0 field, ΔΒ 0 i in Hz by dividing by the echo time, TE, of the EPI volume, and a value of 2π since the phases are given in radians (i.e. ΔΒ 0 i = Δ ϕ correction i /(2π TE)). ΔΒ 0 i must be divided by the bandwidth per pixel in the phase‐encode direction, BW PE, to give the relative distortion in voxels, resulting in a voxel displacement map (vdm):Each vdm i describes the voxel displacement in the phase encode direction caused by the change in field at each voxel in the distorted image i with respect to the space of the first image. To calculate the field required to correct for the relative distortion between each image and the first in the time series, the vdm i must be inverted. For this inversion procedure, the forward mapping gives us x′ = f (x) for each value x on a regular grid, where x is a 1‐dimensional column in the phase encode direction. The inverse mapping yields x = f −1 (x ′) for each value x ′ on a regular grid. It is calculated by, for each value x ′, finding the first x i so that f (x i) > x ′ and then finding x by linear interpolation between f (x i −1) and f (x i). This is a valid procedure as long as f (x) is monotonously increasing, which is the case in general. When it is not, i.e. when the off‐resonance field changes very rapidly over space (compared with the effective encoding gradient strength), there will be almost total signal loss in the gradient echo EPI images, so the displacement of the nonexistent signal will not matter. Finally, at each time point i, the original distorted image can be distortion corrected to the space of the first image by resampling distorted image voxels at new locations along the phase encode direction according to the values in the vdm i [Hutton et al. 2002; Jezzard and Balaban, 1995].

Patients may be asymptomatic when presenting for routine eye care, or they may present with sudden onset of symptoms and signs typical of AACC (such as pain, nausea, redness, congestion, decreased vision, corneal edema, very high IOP), and the initial history and ophthalmic examination includes the components of the comprehensive adult medical eye evaluation with special attention to those elements that specifically bear on primary and secondary causes of angle closure.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of peripheral arterial ultrasound examinations using color and spectral Doppler imaging [^dbdb6853]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Peripheral arterial ultrasound — examination specifications and techniques indicate the sonographic examination consists of gray scale imaging and spectral Doppler waveforms in the appropriate arterial segments, and Color Doppler should be used to improve detection of arterial lesions and to guide placement of the sample volume for spectral Doppler assessment. Specific sonographic techniques must be tailored to the clinical indication, the different arterial segments studied, and the specific pathology being evaluated, and diagnostic criteria for stenosis differ between native and postoperative and postprocedural arteries. Velocity measurements are obtained from angle-corrected spectral Doppler waveforms obtained from longitudinal images, every attempt should be made to acquire images where the angle… is kept at 60° or less, and velocity estimates made from images using larger angles are less reliable. For spectral Doppler, velocity ratio, absolute velocity, pulsatility indices, and acceleration time have been published criteria, and one or more criterion may be used; the criteria may be validated for some but not all arterial segments.

### Atom interferometry at arbitrary orientations and rotation rates [^471e71d7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Scale factor of the gyroscopes

The rotation rate of the device is directly measured by the fiber-optic gyroscopes. An error in the scale factor of the gyroscopes will lead to a systematic error in the calculation of the rotation-induced phase shift, which could explain our observations on the interferogram. Now performing the substitution Ω → (1 + ε) Ω, we find that a correction ε = 0.016 allows us to retrieve a 2 π -periodicity. Nevertheless, the scale factors of the gyroscopes have been characterized with a 10 −5 relative precision, which is much smaller than the discrepancy we find. We, therefore, exclude this from the list of possible sources of error.

Mismatch of tip-tilt and device axes

The tip-tilt mirror rotates around two axes which are determined by the position of its piezoelectric actuators. These axes are at an angle γ ≈ 45° with respect to the measurement axes of the fiber-optic gyroscopes on the device. An error on the angle γ leads to an imperfect compensation of the device's rotation. This, in turn, produces a non-zero Coriolis phase shift as the motion of the mirror in the inertial frame of reference is not a pure translation. In the general expression of the rotation-induced phase (Eq. (16)), this corresponds to the term 2(v x + a x T) δ Ω y − 2(v y + a y T) δ Ω x.

We thus assume an error on the angle γ and calculate the corresponding values of δ Ω x and δ Ω y to reconstruct the interference pattern. We also allow for a non-zero initial velocity along the x direction (v x). Using the same criterion of 2 π -periodicity as above, we find an optimum for an error of δ γ ≈ 9° which is too large a value to be credible. From design and independent measurements we estimate δ γ = ± 2° at most.
