Gout

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about gout management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease definition and epidemiology to anchor the clinical context. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including when to aspirate and how to handle cases where aspiration is not feasible. Next, I will review acute flare management and prophylaxis. After that, I need to examine indications for urate-lowering therapy, treat-to-target strategy, and first-line agents. I will then consider special populations, especially chronic kidney disease, and reconcile guideline differences. Finally, I should integrate lifestyle measures, monitoring, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking areas of controversy and evidence quality throughout.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and burden. Gout is a crystal deposition disease caused by monosodium urate crystals, with acute flares driven by NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated inflammation; prevalence in the US is approximately 9.2 million adults, and it is the most common inflammatory arthritis, with rising incidence linked to metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diuretic use, so I need to keep comorbidity screening in mind as I plan care [^538794e5] [^fa894f3f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis. I should verify when synovial fluid analysis is necessary. The ACP recommends synovial fluid analysis when clinical judgment indicates diagnostic uncertainty, whereas EULAR emphasizes that hyperuricemia alone is insufficient to diagnose gout and supports a clinical diagnosis when aspiration is not feasible using validated features such as rapid-onset monoarthritis of the first MTP, erythema, and prior similar episodes; in primary care, presumptive diagnosis is common, but I need to remember that only about 11% undergo aspiration in practice, which can lead to misclassification if I am not careful [^0e821a33] [^db188ac2] [^d7fabb1b] [^9a4b8c9c].

> Wait, let me verify the role of imaging and clinical decision rules. When aspiration is not performed, validated clinical criteria and imaging can support diagnosis; dual-energy CT can detect urate deposits, and ultrasound may show the double-contour sign, but I should confirm that these are adjuncts rather than replacements for crystal identification when feasible [^9dbc570a] [^94de9e78].

> Next, I should review acute flare management. First-line options are colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids, chosen based on comorbidities and patient preference; low-dose colchicine is preferred over high-dose given similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects, and if oral therapy is not feasible, parenteral glucocorticoids are recommended; IL-1 blockade is reserved for refractory cases or when standard therapies are contraindicated, and topical ice can be used as adjunctive therapy [^526db9c4] [^44adb76c] [^a2ca3215] [^3d0ffebe].

> I need to ensure I address prophylaxis during ULT initiation. Flares commonly occur when starting or uptitrating ULT, so concurrent anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months is strongly recommended; colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily is a common choice, with NSAIDs or prednisone as alternatives when colchicine is contraindicated, and I should extend prophylaxis if flares persist during titration [^647133e7] [^6239eda6] [^6c900825] [^fae70caf].

> Let me consider indications for urate-lowering therapy. Strong indications include tophaceous gout, radiographic damage attributable to gout, or frequent flares (≥ 2/year); conditional indications include infrequent flares after more than one attack, or even a first flare with marked hyperuricemia (serum urate > 9 mg/dL), and I should discuss benefits, harms, and costs with patients before initiating therapy [^a3f9b726] [^88ca52ab] [^2d765e8c] [^c9b7306e].

> I should confirm the treat-to-target strategy and serum urate goals. A treat-to-target approach with dose titration to achieve and maintain serum urate < 6 mg/dL is strongly recommended for all patients on ULT; for severe disease with tophi or frequent flares, a lower target of < 5 mg/dL is reasonable to accelerate crystal dissolution, though prolonged very low urate levels warrant safety monitoring and evidence is limited for thresholds below 3 mg/dL [^b2544b44] [^9fd1057f] [^839e9040] [^8af18ccb].

> Now, I will examine first-line ULT and dosing. Allopurinol is preferred first-line for most patients, including those with CKD, starting low (≤ 100 mg/day, lower in CKD) and titrating every 2–5 weeks to reach target urate; febuxostat is an alternative when allopurinol is not tolerated or contraindicated, but I should be cautious about cardiovascular risk signals and consider switching after a new CV event; uricosurics like probenecid or benzbromarone can be added or used selectively when xanthine oxidase inhibitors are insufficient or contraindicated, with attention to renal function and stone risk [^647133e7] [^af44b55a] [^7f331de8] [^6239eda6].

> But wait, what if the patient has CKD? I should double-check CKD-specific guidance. In CKD, allopurinol remains first-line with dose adjustments and slow titration; NSAIDs are often avoided for flares, so colchicine at reduced dose or glucocorticoids are preferred; evidence gaps persist because many trials exclude CKD, so I need to monitor closely for efficacy and toxicity and coordinate with nephrology when needed [^a410a5f8] [^647133e7].

> I will now examine lifestyle and adjunctive measures. Weight loss, limiting alcohol (especially beer), reducing high-purine foods, and avoiding sugary beverages can lower urate and reduce flares; hydration is important, particularly in patients with a history of urolithiasis; I should also screen for and manage comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, and review medications that raise urate, such as thiazide diuretics, when feasible [^25f55c58] [^819a554f] [^538794e5].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. During ULT titration, check serum urate every 2–5 weeks until at goal, then monitor periodically; assess for flares and adherence at each visit; educate patients on early recognition and self-treatment of flares with a medication-in-pocket approach; and consider nonphysician-led treat-to-target protocols to improve uptake and titration efficiency [^6239eda6] [^6575affc] [^840af1f8].

> Hold on, I should verify areas of controversy and reconcile guideline differences. The ACP advises against routine ULT after a first attack or with infrequent flares, emphasizing shared decision-making, whereas ACR and EULAR support a broader treat-to-target approach even after a first flare if hyperuricemia is marked or comorbidities are present; this discordance reflects differing interpretations of evidence and outcome priorities, so I need to individualize decisions and document patient preferences [^cbb6c3f8] [^af19a095] [^c9b7306e].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check each step. Suspect gout in acute monoarthritis with rapid onset and erythema; confirm with aspiration when feasible, otherwise use validated clinical features and imaging as adjuncts; treat flares promptly with colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids tailored to comorbidities; initiate ULT for strong indications and consider it for conditional scenarios after discussion; start low and titrate allopurinol to reach serum urate < 6 mg/dL, using < 5 mg/dL for severe disease; provide prophylaxis for 3–6 months during ULT initiation; reinforce lifestyle measures and monitor urate, flares, and adherence at regular intervals [^526db9c4] [^b2544b44] [^647133e7] [^6239eda6].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways and ensure internal consistency. Gout is common, underdiagnosed, and undertreated; a treat-to-target ULT strategy with allopurinol first-line and structured monitoring improves outcomes; acute flares require timely anti-inflammatory therapy and prophylaxis during ULT initiation; patient education and shared decision-making are essential to address adherence and comorbidities; and special populations, particularly those with CKD, require dose-adjusted, safety-conscious regimens with coordinated care [^fa894f3f] [^b2544b44] [^647133e7] [^a410a5f8].

Gout is a **crystal-driven arthritis** caused by monosodium urate deposition, with flares driven by NLRP3 inflammasome activation [^ebebeea4]. Diagnosis is **clinical plus synovial fluid crystals** when available; when aspiration is not feasible, use validated clinical criteria and imaging (ultrasound/DECT) to support the diagnosis [^9dbc570a] [^d7fabb1b]. Acute flares are treated with colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids, chosen based on comorbidities and patient factors [^526db9c4] [^44adb76c]. For long-term control, **initiate urate-lowering therapy** (allopurinol first-line) with a treat-to-target strategy to achieve serum urate < 6 mg/dL, and use flare prophylaxis during initiation/up-titration [^b2544b44] [^647133e7]. Address lifestyle and comorbidities, and tailor therapy in CKD and cardiovascular disease to optimize outcomes [^a410a5f8] [^af44b55a].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Hyperuricemia**: Elevated serum uric acid from overproduction or underexcretion leads to supersaturation and crystal formation [^f291ee0f].
- **Crystal deposition**: Monosodium urate crystals deposit in joints and tissues, triggering inflammation [^538794e5].
- **Inflammatory cascade**: Crystals activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, generating IL-1β and driving neutrophil recruitment and acute flares [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Acute flares**: Rapid-onset, severe monoarthritis with erythema, swelling, and exquisite tenderness; the first MTP (podagra) is classic but any joint may be involved [^d7fabb1b].
- **Intercritical periods**: Asymptomatic intervals between flares, with ongoing subclinical inflammation and crystal burden [^b070eca0].
- **Chronic disease**: Tophi, chronic arthropathy, and joint damage develop with sustained hyperuricemia [^538794e5].

---

## Diagnosis

### Definitive diagnosis

Definitive diagnosis requires **synovial fluid analysis** demonstrating negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals [^f291ee0f].

---

### Clinical diagnosis (when aspiration not feasible)

Use the **ACR/EULAR criteria**, integrating clinical features, serum urate, and imaging (ultrasound/DECT) to estimate probability [^9dbc570a] [^d7fabb1b]. Key features include male sex, monoarticular foot involvement, rapid onset, erythema, prior similar episodes, and hyperuricemia [^d7fabb1b].

---

### Laboratory and imaging

- **Serum urate**: Elevated in most cases, but normal levels do not exclude gout [^db188ac2].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound (double contour sign) and DECT can detect crystals and support diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Management

### Acute flares

First-line options include **colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids** (oral, intra-articular, or intramuscular), selected based on comorbidities and patient factors [^526db9c4] [^44adb76c]. Low-dose colchicine is preferred when colchicine is chosen, given similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects [^268ef8a1] [^a2ca3215]. IL-1 inhibitors are reserved for refractory cases or when standard therapies are contraindicated [^3d0ffebe].

---

### Chronic management (urate-lowering therapy, ULT)

- **Indications**: Frequent flares (≥ 2/year), tophi, radiographic damage, or marked hyperuricemia (> 8 mg/dL) [^a3f9b726] [^88ca52ab] [^ebce7886].
- **First-line ULT**: Allopurinol for all patients, including those with CKD; start low (≤ 100 mg/day) and titrate every 2–5 weeks to target serum urate [^6575affc] [^af396802] [^6239eda6].
- **Treat-to-target**: Maintain serum urate < 6 mg/dL; use < 5 mg/dL for severe disease (tophi, frequent flares) until crystal dissolution [^b2544b44] [^839e9040] [^1b5a3ff1].
- **Prophylaxis**: Use colchicine, NSAIDs, or prednisone/prednisolone for ≥ 3–6 months during ULT initiation/up-titration to prevent flares [^647133e7] [^6239eda6].

---

### Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications include **weight loss** for overweight/obese patients, limiting alcohol (especially beer), reducing high-purine foods, and maintaining adequate hydration [^25f55c58]. Address comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and CKD to improve outcomes [^ae8b910e].

---

## Special populations

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

In CKD, **allopurinol** is first-line with dose adjustment; start low and titrate cautiously [^6575affc] [^af396802]. NSAIDs are generally avoided; prefer colchicine or glucocorticoids for flares [^a410a5f8]. Evidence gaps exist; monitor closely and coordinate with nephrology [^a410a5f8].

---

### Cardiovascular disease

In cardiovascular disease, **allopurinol** is preferred over febuxostat due to cardiovascular safety concerns; consider switching if new CV events occur on febuxostat [^af44b55a].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is favorable with **effective ULT and lifestyle changes**, though adherence is often poor [^fa894f3f]. Complications include chronic arthropathy, tophi, joint deformity, and urate nephrolithiasis; gout is associated with increased mortality, largely due to comorbid cardiovascular and renal disease [^538794e5] [^ae8b910e].

---

Gout is a **manageable crystal arthritis**; confirm diagnosis with crystals when possible, treat flares promptly, and use a treat-to-target ULT strategy with allopurinol first-line to achieve serum urate < 6 mg/dL. Address lifestyle and comorbidities, and tailor therapy in CKD and CVD to optimize outcomes [^b2544b44] [^6575affc] [^a410a5f8].

### Treatment guidelines in gout [^07985e5e]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The range of drug treatment options to treat acute and chronic gout has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. Yet, there is general consensus that drug therapy selection, dosing and dose titration, of both traditional and novel agents is far from optimally delivered in clinical practice. Updated guidelines disseminated in the last 5 years, from the American College of Physicians, the European League Against Rheumatism, and the American College of Rheumatology, provide clear guidance to the medical community on how and when to optimally integrate these therapeutic options into practice to improve the medical management of gout.

### Optimizing current treatment of gout [^6577200c]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and to 'cure' the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practice and barriers to effective care, and how these barriers might be overcome. To optimize the management of gout, health professionals need to know not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy against a specific target level of serum uric acid that is below the saturation point for crystal formation. Current perspectives are changing towards much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of first diagnosis of gout. Holistic assessment and patient education are essential to address patient-specific risk factors and ensuring adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

### Gout in primary care [^5b28a9e0]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

Gout affects around 1% of people in the UK, most aged over 45 years. The condition, which is five times more common in men than women, usually presents as a painful inflammatory monoarthritis, which can be diagnosed clinically and successfully treated with a high dose of an NSAID. Problems arise when the features are atypical or when high doses of an NSAID are inappropriate. Also; there is no robust evidence to guide when to start prophylactic therapy or what advice to give on lifestyle changes. Here we review current practice and offer advice on managing patients with this increasingly common condition, concentrating on approaches to be taken by the non-specialist.

### We can make gout management more successful now [^356223da]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this editorial review is to identify and comment on factors contributing to the current less-than-optimal state of gout management and to emphasize immediate opportunities to improve management practices affecting many patients with gout.

Recent Findings

Numerous publications document deficits in the current management and clinical outcomes of gout despite detailed understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder, the ability to establish the diagnosis with certainty, and the likely effectiveness, for most patients, of available lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Among impediments to successful gout management are diagnostic inaccuracy; a paucity of validated management recommendations to guide care providers; incomplete patient education about gout and the aims and modalities of management; suboptimal patient adherence, even to demonstrably effective therapeutic recommendations; comorbidities and drug interferences that complicate treatment of gout; patient groups at special risk for progression to chronic tophaceous gout; and limited urate-lowering alternatives.

Summary

Recent publication of evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of gout and the impending availability of new urate-lowering agents suggest that this is an opportune time to initiate professional and patient education efforts toward improved management of this increasingly common disorder.

### Why better treatment of gout is needed [^b56854e7]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

The treatment of gout is thought to be simple, but in reality we are confronted regularly with patients who do not adhere to treatment and patients who have other medical conditions that render the choice of therapy difficult. A treat-to-target approach is essential in order to manage hyperuricaemia effectively and this, combined with a better use of existing treatments, offers the best way forward.

### Managing gout in the primary care setting: what you and your patients need to know [^9a4b8c9c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The US prevalence of gout, a rapidly progressive inflammatory arthritic condition linked to serum uric acid levels, has grown in recent years, in part due to the increasing prevalence and incidence of predisposing factors in the population, such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, and the use of diuretics. Left untreated, gout can be debilitating and cause deformity. Although a definitive diagnosis requires joint aspiration, only approximately 11% of patients with suspected gout undergo this procedure, and a presumptive diagnosis based on patient medical history and presentation with characteristic symptoms and comorbidities is a reasonable guidelines-based approach that has utility in the primary care setting, where approximately 70% of all cases and nearly 3,000,000 visits occur. The therapeutic standard for patients with recurrent gout flares is urate-lowering therapy (ULT), including allopurinol and the recently introduced febuxostat, the first new treatment for gout in 40 years. Although ULT must be taken consistently to sustain benefits, inadequate dosing and patient nonadherence or intolerance to therapy often lead to treatment failure. It is important that primary care clinicians understand gout diagnosis and therapeutic approaches and can communicate effectively with patients to improve treatment adherence.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^4e9e571a]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Methods — ACR guideline development used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to rate the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. The Core Team, Expert Panel, and Voting Panel generated 57 population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions covering indications for ULT (5 questions), approaches to initiating ULT (7 questions), ongoing management (18 questions), gout flares (10 questions), and lifestyle and other medication strategies in patients with gout (9 questions) and in individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (8 questions), which were posted for public comment (October 30–November 30, 2018). An in-person Patient Panel of 8 male patients with gout reviewed the evidence report and discussed the desirable and undesirable outcomes for decision making; then prespecified outcomes were obtained for each PICO question from a systematic literature review, and both patient-identified outcomes and serum urate (SU) concentration (and tophus for PICO question 1) were specified as critical outcomes for all PICO questions specific to ULT.

### Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout [^b070eca0]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gout has been academically considered to be a step-up disease consisting of different stages: acute gout, intercritical gout, and chronic gout. This simple approach may lead to misinterpretation and misdiagnosis. In clinical practice, we should consider gout as a single disease with either or both acute (most commonly, episodes of acute inflammation) and persistent clinical manifestations, but not restricted to chronic synovitis. In this article, an innovative, practical, and rational approach to the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout is presented, which may be supportive for clinicians involved in everyday care and management of patients with gout.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^fa894f3f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction — gout epidemiology and care gaps are highlighted, noting that gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, affecting ∼9.2 million adults (3.9%) in the US. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines and other international specialty society guidelines recommend treat-to-target strategies with use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), yet over the past 2 decades there has been no increase in ULT utilization and adherence to ULT remains poor and is the lowest adherence among treatments for 7 common chronic medical conditions. Prior 2012 ACR Guidelines have been criticized due to low quality of evidence supporting treat-to-target recommendations, and several clinical trials since then provided additional evidence leading the ACR Guidelines Subcommittee to determine that new guidelines with updated recommendations were warranted.

### What is gout? | Rheumatology-JAMA network… [^538794e5]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Yip K, Berman J. What Is Gout. JAMA. 2021; 326:

2541. doi: 10.1001/jama.2021.19770 Gout is a form of arthritis caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in the body. Gout can cause acute inflammation of 1 or more joints and in severe cases can lead to permanent joint damage. Uric acid crystals can also form hard lumpy deposits in the skin called tophi. Gout affects approximately 9. 2 million people in the US. It is more common in men and older people. People with gout have high blood levels of uric acid, a substance produced during digestion of certain foods and drinks. However, most people with high uric acid levels do not develop gout. Other risk factors for gout include metabolic and genetic factors, obesity, high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, and certain medications.

A gout flare typically occurs over the span of a few hours with pain, redness, warmth, and swelling in a joint developing because of the presence of uric acid crystals. Often a gout flare involves a single joint but sometimes can affect multiple joints, including those in the feet, ankles, knees, and wrists. A gout flare tends to last several days; for most patients, it subsides over 2 weeks without treatment. Over time, repeated attacks can damage the joint, resulting in chronic gouty arthritis. There is no cure for gout. However, gout flares can be treated with anti-inflammatory medications. These drugs can reduce acute pain and swelling and are typically given for several days to weeks until a flare has subsided.

To decrease the risk of future gout flares, medications may be used to lower uric acid levels in the body. These drugs are taken on a long-term basis.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^cbb6c3f8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Impact of comorbidities on gout and hyperuricaemia: an update on prevalence and treatment options [^ae8b910e]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is a prevalent disorder whose frequency is increasing worldwide. In addition to causing excruciating arthritic pain, gout is associated with premature death, classically explained by a high frequency of comorbidities, especially renal and cardiovascular diseases. Comorbidities must be considered in gout because they could contribute to the vital prognosis of gouty patients and they complicate gout management. These comorbidities are also frequently associated with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, an even more prevalent condition than gout, with their causal relationship with hyperuricaemia raising important therapeutic issues.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^634d9d11]. Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to treatment targets, BSR 2017 guidelines recommend to adjust the dose of urate-lowering therapy to maintain the serum urate level ≤ 360 mcmol/L after some years of successful treatment when tophi have resolved and the patient remains free of symptoms, to avoid further crystal deposition and the possibility of adverse effects associated with a very low serum urate level.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^0f008583]. Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding patient education for gout, more specifically with respect to general counseling, BSR 2017 guidelines recommend to explain the option of urate-lowering therapy to patients with gout when the diagnosis is confirmed and they are being given information about gout. Involve patients in the decision as to when to initiate urate-lowering therapy.

### The challenges of approaching and managing gout [^f8aef601]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite many effective treatments for gout, its management remains a challenge internationally. Options for optimizing gout management may differ in different practice sizes and settings. Gout incidence is rising and it continues to be associated with increased mortality. Education of patients and medical providers is essential, and newer gout medications need to be used in the most appropriate ways for cost-effective therapy. Special consideration needs to be given to such populations as the elderly and those with renal and cardiovascular disease in gout management. New agents are in development, which may add to the armamentarium for gout management.

### Discordant American College of Physicians and international rheumatology guidelines for gout management: consensus statement of the gout, hyperuricemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) [^af19a095]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

In November 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute and recurrent gout. This guideline differs substantially from the latest guidelines generated by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative, despite reviewing largely the same body of evidence. The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) convened an expert panel to review the methodology and conclusions of these four sets of guidelines and examine possible reasons for discordance between them. The G-CAN position, presented here, is that the fundamental pathophysiological knowledge underlying gout care, and evidence from clinical experience and clinical trials, supports a treat-to-target approach for gout aimed at lowering serum urate levels to below the saturation threshold at which monosodium urate crystals form. This practice, which is truly evidence-based and promotes the steady reduction in tissue urate crystal deposits, is promoted by the ACR, EULAR and 3e Initiative recommendations. By contrast, the ACP does not provide a clear recommendation for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for patients with frequent, recurrent flares or those with tophi, nor does it recommend monitoring serum urate levels of patients prescribed ULT. Results from emerging clinical trials that have gout symptoms as the primary end point are expected to resolve this debate for all clinicians in the near term future.

### The impact of gout guidelines [^c1ebc32e]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the impact of recent treatment guidelines for the management of gout and the barriers to treating gout patients.

Recent Findings

Multiple guidelines for both the treatment and prevention of gout have been put forth in the last decade including those from the British Rheumatism Society; the European League Against Rheumatism; the Multinational Evidence, Expertise, Exchange Initiative; the Japanese Society of Gout and Nucleic Acid Metabolism; the American College of Rheumatology. These guidelines are designed to facilitate the management of gout by providers with key recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia, which is the greatest risk factor for developing gout. However, despite the extant guidelines, overall adherence to recommendations and uptake have been slow and initiation of urate-lowering therapy, titration of dosing, and monitoring of serum urate is infrequent. Greater education in proper management as well as increased awareness of new treatment strategies appear to be the primary reasons for this gap and offer avenues for improvement in management as well as areas for further research.

Summary

Gout remains a treatment challenge for both acute and chronic disease. Despite the availability of management guidelines, primary care providers are struggling with appropriate management of the disease. More research tools and strategies are needed to improve overall outcomes and quality of care.

### New ACR guidelines for gout management hold some surprises [^8d64ce31]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Despite exciting progress in the understanding and treatment of gout, management of this condition remains suboptimal. In the face of this inadequacy, new guidelines provide recommendations both for therapeutic approaches to hyperuricaemia and for the management and anti-inflammatory prophylaxis of acute gouty arthritis.

This guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on gout diagnosis, identified using several databases, from database inception to February 2016. Evaluated outcomes included the accuracy of the test results; intermediate outcomes (results of laboratory and radiographic tests, such as serum urate and synovial fluid crystal analysis and radiographic or ultrasonography changes); clinical decision making (additional testing and pharmacologic or dietary management); short-term clinical (patient-centered) outcomes, such as pain and joint swelling and tenderness; and adverse effects of the tests. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations by using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with joint inflammation suspected to be gout.

Recommendation

ACP recommends that clinicians use synovial fluid analysis when clinical judgment indicates that diagnostic testing is necessary in patients with possible acute gout. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Update on gout: new therapeutic strategies and options [^94de9e78]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Gout, a disease recognized since antiquity, has increased in prevalence in recent years and the clinical profile of this disease has become increasingly complex, owing to large numbers of cases with iatrogenic factors, multiple comorbidities, advanced age, and hyperuricemia and arthritis refractory to treatment. In this Review, key advances in gout research made during the past decade are summarized. Revised strategies for safe and effective employment of dietary measures and pharmacologic treatments for active gouty arthritis, prevention of gout flares and urate lowering are also reviewed, with an emphasis on dosing of colchicine and allopurinol, and the evidence-based approach to systemic glucocorticosteroid treatment of acute gout. Also discussed are new and emerging treatments for gout and hyperuricemia, and the potential influence of dual energy CT imaging on treatment. In this context, the therapeutic role of febuxostat, and clinical development of pegylated uricase urate-lowering therapy and interleukin 1 antagonism for gouty inflammation are reviewed. Collectively, novel approaches will hopefully lead to improved management of hyperuricemia and gout, and also to improvements in patient-centered outcomes, even for those who have previously failed to respond to treatment.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^647133e7]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

### Refractory gout: what is it and what to do about it? [^ebebeea4]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to discuss the defining characteristics of refractory gout and the pharmacological management of this problem.

Recent Findings

Refractory gout refers to those patients who have ongoing symptoms of active disease and cannot maintain a target serum urate less than 6 mg/dl. Patients with refractory gout have reduced quality of life, functional impairment, and joint destruction. Multiple factors contribute to refractory gout, and they often relate to delayed or insufficient dosing with allopurinol. Chronic kidney disease imparts a dose limitation on allopurinol that further impairs the effectiveness of urate-lowering therapy. Febuxostat, a novel xanthine oxidase inhibitor, represents a potential alternative to allopurinol in refractory gout patients. Uricase, the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of uric acid into allantoin, is showing promise with its ability to rapidly diminish serum urate levels. The recently defined role of the NALP3 inflammasome in the inflammatory phase of gout suggests a potential role for interleukin-1 inhibition in urate crystal-induced inflammation.

Summary

Refractory gout occurs when urate levels are not adequately controlled. Emerging therapies may improve the clinical course of patients with recalcitrant disease.

### An update on the management of gout [^98645b9a]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and its incidence in the UK has steadily increased from 1.5% in 1997 to 2.5% in 2012. 1,2 It is characterised by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues and usually presents with intermittent painful attacks followed by long periods of remission. 3 It has been suggested that the management of gout in the UK remains suboptimal. 1 In 2004, we concluded that there was a woeful lack of evidence to guide treatment or prophylaxis for gout, particularly with regard to choice of drug or doses. 4 The introduction of new drugs and new evidence on the efficacy and safety of treatment options has led the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) to update their guidelines on the management of gout. 2,5 Nevertheless, there are differing views on target serum uric acid (SUA) levels and the role of urate lowering treatment (ULT). 2,5–7 Here, we review the latest guidance on the management of gout and consider the role of long-term ULT.

### Up-to-date management of gout [^5a718f99]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gout is a true crystal deposition disease, extremely painful and bone and tissue damaging if untreated. It is the only curable form of arthritis. Although we have many treatments to cure gout, it is a disease that is consistently undertreated/mismanaged and perceived by clinicians and the lay public as a 'laughable condition' with the patients' lifestyle often held erroneously to account. This article would give you a good understanding of modern and established pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments used in the management of acute and chronic gout and how to 'treat to target' to cure the disease.

Recent Findings

Many of the drugs we use to manage patients with gouty arthritis have been in existence since the 1970s and 1980s. In the past few years, because of the improved physiological understanding of gout, new innovative treatments such as anti-IL inhibitors, a nonxanthine oxidase inhibitor and the uricase enzymes have been developed adding to our armamentarium of drugs.

Summary

With the introduction of new research, we have been able to explore how to also use established treatments more effectively, raising the profile of gout and its best management and introducing the principle of treating the patient to urate target.

### EULAR evidence based recommendations for gout. part II: management. report of a task force of the EULAR standing committee for international clinical studies including therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^25f55c58]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of gout.

Methods

The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results

12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; low animal purine diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for management of gout were developed, using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and the SOR provided for each proposition.

### Gout [^52c0da91]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The treat to target strategy looks attractive for management of gout because it removes the causal mechanism inducing formation, growth, and aggregation of urate crystals. Further reduction of serum urate (sUA) levels below the threshold may dissolve crystals more rapidly. It is generally agreed that sUA less than 6 mg/dL is acceptable as a therapeutic and long-term preventive target, with < 5 mg/dL for the most severe cases. The challenges that this approach in gout is facing include whether proposed targets are the best for desired outcomes, whether they fit patient-related outcomes, and whether they adequately balance effectiveness and safety.

American College of Rheumatology gout flare management — For patients experiencing a gout flare, the guideline states "we strongly recommend using oral colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intramuscular, or intraarticular) as appropriate first-line therapy for gout flares over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH", and "when colchicine is the chosen agent, we strongly recommend low-dose colchicine over high-dose colchicine given its similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects". For patients who are unable to take oral medications, "we strongly recommend glucocorticoids (intramuscular, intravenous, or intraarticular) over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH". If other antiinflammatory therapies are poorly tolerated or contraindicated, "we conditionally recommend using IL-1 inhibition over no therapy (beyond supportive/analgesic treatment)". As adjunctive care for a flare, "we conditionally recommend using topical ice as an adjuvant treatment over no adjuvant treatment". For colchicine dosing during flares, the guideline notes "the FDA-approved dosing should be followed (1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing antiinflammatory therapy until the flare resolves)".

Fig. 1
Stages of gout.

Gout progresses through several classic disease stages and corresponding clinical manifestations. In some cases, advanced disease stages and complications can appear prematurely, without earlier disease stages or clinical manifestations being apparent (for example, tophaceous gout without prior gout flares), although this pattern is uncommon. MSU, monosodium urate. Adapted from ref. Springer Nature Limited.

Care for people with gout and CKD presents important challenges. For instance, the clinical presentation of gout in this high-risk, comorbid population is variable, with a higher frequency of atypical presentations than in those without CKD. However, quality evidence to guide the management of gout in people with CKD is lacking, owing at least in part to the exclusion of people with CKD from trials of gout therapies, failure to report results stratified by renal function and inconsistencies in the outcome measures used and reported. The resultant knowledge gaps have contributed to concerns regarding gout treatment efficacy and safety, some of which are legitimate and others questionable. The use of ULT in the context of advanced CKD varies greatly among rheumatologists, nephrologists and generalists, and professional bodies have issued conflicting recommendations regarding the treatment of gout in people with concomitant CKD. These inconsistencies frequently result in confusion and, consequently, suboptimal gout management with failure to achieve recommended target urate levels. Moreover, pharmacological options for treating gout flares and lowering urate concentrations are often restricted by physicians, other health-care professionals (such as pharmacists) and patients who have appropriate concerns and/or misconceptions about drug toxicity or the need to adjust medication doses. As a result, outcomes in people with gout and CKD are commonly poor(Fig. 2).

### Critical appraisal of serum urate targets in the management of gout [^1b5a3ff1]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Gout management involves two broad aspects: treatment of gout flares to provide rapid symptomatic relief and long-term urate-lowering therapy to lower serum urate sufficiently to prevent gout flares from occurring. All of the major rheumatology societies recommend a target serum urate of < 5mg/dl (< 0.30mmol/l) or < 6mg/dl (< 0.36mmol/l), both of which are below the point of saturation for urate and therefore lead to monosodium urate crystal dissolution. In this Review, we describe the rationale for treat-to-target urate approach in the long-term management of gout and the current evidence and controversy around the appropriate serum urate targets.

### Unusual clinical presentations of gout [^f78c4101]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The dogmatic description of gout is described as an inflammatory crystal-induced arthropathy that afflicts peripheral joints. This manuscript describes many recent cases and unusual clinical presentations of gout. Emphasis is placed on the ability of gout to cause diagnostic dilemmas that can impact patient treatment and care.

Recent Findings

Various genetic mutations can predispose patients in developing early onset gout. Environmental exposures, medications, and certain patient populations can affect pathophysiology of uric acid, predisposing patients both typical and atypical manifestations of gout. Numerous reports have described gout deposition in unusual parts of the body, which can mimic unrelated disease processes.

Summary

Although classic gout is still most commonly seen, the disease can manifest as with a wide array of presentations. It is likely that such atypical presentations are a result of a complexity of reasons. When presented with a diagnostic challenge in a patient with gout, the clinician should be aware of unusual manifestations of gout and consider it in the differential.

Recent Findings

The ACRs first clinical practice guidelines for the management of gout focus on recommendations for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to hyperuricaemia and the treatment and prophylaxis of acute gouty arthritis. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology employed assessed risks and benefits of alternative treatments for efficacy, safety and quality but not for cost-effectiveness. Novel recommendations include the use of either allopurinol or febuxostat for first-line urate-lowering drug therapy (ULT), screening for HLA-B✱5801 prior to initiation of allopurinol in Asians at relatively high risk for allopurinol hypersensitivity, and the use of pegloticase for patients with severe, symptomatic, tophaceous gout refractory to, or intolerant of, appropriately dosed ULTs. Appraisal and comparison with other guidelines using Guidelines International Network and Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) criteria showed good scores for scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, clarity of presentation, editorial independence and, overall quality, but not for applicability.

Summary

The ACR guidelines provide comprehensive, up-to-date, good-quality, evidence-based, expert consensus recommendations for the management of gout in clinical practice but score poorly for applicability. To improve the management of gout in the community a summary of key recommendations, criteria for audit and standards of care are now required.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^ca944278]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

Shared decision-making improves patients' experiences with care, satisfaction with management decisions and possibly health outcomes. This study describes the development of a decision aid (DA) that supports patients with gout and their physicians in a face-to-face clinical setting to (a) decide whether or not to (re)start urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and (b) agree on the preferred ULT.

Methods

Recommendations of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards group guided the development. A steering group of experts in gout and health services research specified the scope. Nominal group technique meetings were organised in which patients ranked the importance of preidentified potential characteristics/attributes of ULT and discussed further needs regarding the DA. A literature search was conducted to collect evidence on gout outcomes with and without ULT. Subsequently, the DA prototype was designed and adjusted using feedback from the steering group and results of cognitive debriefing interviews among five gout patients.

Results

The final DA consists of six pages. First, the DA clarifies the decision at stake and describes gout including its risk factors, the role of lifestyle and treatment of flares. Next, risk of future flares with and without ULT in relation to serum uric acid levels is described and visualised. Relevant attributes of ULT are presented in an option grid distinguishing first-line and second-line ULT. Finally, patients' believes and preferences are explicitly addressed before making the shared decision.

Conclusion

This study provides initial support for usability of a DA for gout patients eligible for starting ULT.

### Gout: a clinical and radiologic review [^f291ee0f]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Gout is a group of diseases characterized by arthritis and results from a disturbance of urate metabolism with the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints and soft tissues. Often, but not invariably, the serum urate levels are elevated as a result of overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid. Clinical manifestations include acute and chronic arthritis, tophaceous deposits, interstitial renal disease, and uric acid nephrolithiasis. The diagnosis is based on the identification of uric acid crystals in joints, tissues, or body fluids. Acute episodes are treated with colchicine, NSAIDs, or steroids. Long-term management includes treatment with uricosuric agents or xanthine oxidase inhibitors.

### Gout: an update [^ffd5097a]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Arthritis caused by gout (i.e., gouty arthritis) accounts for millions of outpatient visits annually, and the prevalence is increasing. Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues leading to arthritis, soft tissue masses (i.e., tophi), nephrolithiasis, and urate nephropathy. The biologic precursor to gout is elevated serum uric acid levels (i.e., hyperuricemia). Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is common and usually does not progress to clinical gout. Acute gout most often presents as attacks of pain, erythema, and swelling of one or a few joints in the lower extremities. The diagnosis is confirmed if monosodium urate crystals are present in synovial fluid. First-line therapy for acute gout is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids, depending on comorbidities; colchicine is second-line therapy. After the first gout attack, modifiable risk factors (e.g., high-purine diet, alcohol use, obesity, diuretic therapy) should be addressed. Urate-lowering therapy for gout is initiated after multiple attacks or after the development of tophi or urate nephrolithiasis. Allopurinol is the most common therapy for chronic gout. Uricosuric agents are alternative therapies in patients with preserved renal function and no history of nephrolithiasis. During urate-lowering therapy, the dose should be titrated upward until the serum uric acid level is less than 6 mg per dL (355 micromol per L). When initiating urate-lowering therapy, concurrent prophylactic therapy with low-dose colchicine for three to six months may reduce flare-ups.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^d109f4d6]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

To enhance usability of a DA in daily practice, it is essential to adhere to national and/or international recommendations (EULAR/ACR). The distinction in the current DA between the first-line (allopurinol) and second-line (febuxostat and benzbromaron) ULT options, advice on lifestyle changes, need for prophylaxis on ULT initiation and the role of a sUA target are all supported in national as well as international recommendations.

The development of the DA posed some challenges, especially regarding evidence-based information on the risk of flares with and without ULT. Flares, the most important indicator of effectiveness for patients, are not or inconsistently reported in RCTs and follow-up is often too short to provide meaningful data on risks and benefits for clinical care. Fortunately, observational studies on the relation between sUA and flares with and without ULT were helpful, the discussion on sUA as biomarker for gout is ongoing. An advantage of this approach was that we could 'personalise' the DA, by presenting different risk for future flares depending on the initial sUA level while keeping the relative effectiveness of ULT. Some studies suggest that febuxostat has exacerbation of acute gout flares at the start of treatment, which is less the case for allopurinol, but evidence is weak. In other words, while febuxostat is more effective in sUA target achievement compared with allopurinol at the recommended dose, this does not translate into better effectiveness on flare reduction. Yet, the relationship between sUA and gout flares is complex.

### New classification criteria for gout: a framework for progress [^99758b92]. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

The definitive classification or diagnosis of gout normally relies upon the identification of MSU crystals in SF or from tophi. Where microscopic examination of SF is not available or is impractical, the best approach may differ depending upon the context. For many types of research, clinical classification criteria are necessary. The increasing prevalence of gout, advances in therapeutics and the development of international research collaborations to understand the impact, mechanisms and optimal treatment of this condition emphasize the need for accurate and uniform classification criteria for gout. Five clinical classification criteria for gout currently exist. However, none of the currently available criteria has been adequately validated. An international project is currently under way to develop new validated gout classification criteria. These criteria will be an essential step forward to advance the research agenda in the modern era of gout management.
