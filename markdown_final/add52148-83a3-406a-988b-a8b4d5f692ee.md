## Question

Treatment for elevated cpk with daptomycin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) during daptomycin therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the CPK elevation and correlating it with symptoms. Then, I should verify risk factors and the current daptomycin exposure, especially trough concentrations and dosing frequency. Next, I will stratify severity and decide whether to continue, adjust, or stop therapy. After that, I need to outline supportive care and monitoring. Finally, I should consider alternatives, special populations, and prevention strategies, and close with a concise decision algorithm summary [^notfound].

> Let me first confirm the laboratory abnormality and its clinical context, because I need to ensure we are not reacting to a spurious result. I should repeat the CPK to verify persistence, check for symptoms such as myalgia, weakness, or dark urine, and review baseline CPK and trends since daptomycin initiation, since daptomycin-associated myopathy can present with or without marked CPK elevations and symptoms may be subtle or distal, particularly in the forearms and lower legs [^1128G1Ao] [^113VSJDh] [^112LFuiC] [^115ki9i6].

> Next, I should review risk factors that increase the likelihood of daptomycin-associated muscle injury, and I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions. Concurrent statin therapy is a key risk factor with multiple studies associating it with myopathy and rhabdomyolysis during daptomycin, so I should confirm statin use and consider temporary suspension while balancing cardiovascular risk, especially in acute settings like stroke or MI where stopping statins may be harmful [^117J9zQA] [^113wWyRK] [^111fvVmD] [^112aqRow]. I should also check for renal impairment, obesity, high-dose or prolonged daptomycin, and any recent or concomitant agents that can cause rhabdomyolysis, and I must remember that higher trough concentrations, particularly Cmin ≥ 24.3 mg/L, correlate with increased CPK elevation risk, so I should verify exposure if available [^112W7oML] [^117J9zQA] [^1128G1Ao].

> Hold on, I should verify the dosing strategy because frequency matters. Daptomycin should not be dosed more frequently than once daily due to higher rates of CPK elevation with divided dosing, so if I see BID or Q12H orders, I need to correct that immediately to once-daily dosing to mitigate risk [^1128G1Ao] [^113VSJDh] [^112LFuiC].

> Now I will stratify severity to guide action, but let me double-check the thresholds. Mild elevation is typically CPK 1–5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) without symptoms, moderate is 5–10× ULN or symptomatic 1–5× ULN, and severe is ≥ 10× ULN or any CPK > 2,000 U/L regardless of symptoms, which warrants prompt intervention per labeling and safety guidance [^1128G1Ao] [^113VSJDh] [^112LFuiC].

> For mild, asymptomatic elevations, I should continue daptomycin and increase CPK monitoring frequency to every 3–5 days, and I need to ensure we are not missing evolving symptoms. I should also consider holding statins if used, review and remove other myotoxic drugs, and reinforce hydration while checking electrolytes and renal function, since early, modest CPK rises can progress in the presence of interacting agents or high exposure [^1128G1Ao] [^113VSJDh] [^112LFuiC] [^117Top48].

> For moderate elevations or symptomatic mild elevations, I should pause and reassess the indication for daptomycin and whether alternatives exist. If daptomycin is essential, I will reduce the dose toward 6 mg/kg if currently higher, avoid divided dosing, hold statins, and monitor CPK every 2–3 days along with renal function and electrolytes; if symptoms worsen or CPK rises toward 10× ULN, I should discontinue daptomycin without delay [^1128G1Ao] [^113VSJDh] [^112LFuiC].

> For severe elevations, I should confirm that daptomycin must be discontinued immediately, regardless of symptoms, and I need to ensure statins and other myotoxic agents are held. I will initiate aggressive IV hydration with isotonic fluids, correct electrolytes, and monitor closely for acute kidney injury and compartment syndrome; if rhabdomyolysis is suspected, I should follow established rhabdomyolysis protocols with serial CK until peak and downtrend, and consider nephrology consultation for renal replacement therapy if indicated [^1128G1Ao] [^113VSJDh] [^112LFuiC] [^111bexD2] [^111dhbCP].

> Wait, let me verify the role of therapeutic drug monitoring because exposure may be the driver. If available, I should obtain a daptomycin trough and consider a 7–11 hour post-dose sample to estimate exposure; troughs around or above 24.3 mg/L are associated with higher CPK risk, so dose reduction or extended interval may be reasonable if the clinical course allows and PK targets can still be met, balancing efficacy against toxicity [^112W7oML] [^112tQzo3].

> I should also consider alternative antimicrobial therapy if daptomycin is discontinued or if the infection is not responding. Options include vancomycin adjusted to PK/PD targets, linezolid with hematologic and serotonergic monitoring, or ceftaroline, with the choice tailored to pathogen, site of infection, and patient-specific factors; for enterococcal endocarditis or persistent bacteremia, higher-dose daptomycin regimens or combination strategies may be considered when daptomycin is retained, ideally with infectious diseases consultation [^112w921g] [^1177CRNL] [^115HGCF5].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population where kinetics or risks differ. In renal impairment, I need to extend the dosing interval and monitor CPK more frequently than weekly, and in obesity or critical illness with augmented clearance, fixed or higher doses may be needed to achieve PK/PD targets, though I should balance this against CPK risk and consider TDM to individualize therapy; in pediatrics, age-based dosing is standard and CPK elevations are generally manageable with monitoring, but I should still apply the same symptom-guided discontinuation thresholds [^112uy7DU] [^112MuVqz] [^113RWjBG] [^11366aTJ] [^117Ef3ew] [^116fm9xW] [^114dUtCm].

> Next, I should review prevention and longitudinal monitoring to avoid recurrence. Baseline CPK should be obtained before or at initiation, then monitored weekly during therapy and more often with renal impairment, high doses, prolonged courses, or concomitant statins; I should counsel patients to report muscle pain, weakness, or dark urine promptly, and I will avoid divided dosing and reassess the need for statins during the daptomycin course whenever feasible [^1128G1Ao] [^113VSJDh] [^112LFuiC] [^113vFikX].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision framework to ensure internal consistency. If CPK is < 5× ULN without symptoms, continue and monitor more frequently; if 5–10× ULN or symptomatic, reduce dose, hold statins, and intensify monitoring with a low threshold to stop; if ≥ 10× ULN or > 2,000 U/L, discontinue daptomycin immediately, treat rhabdomyolysis if present, and select an alternative agent, with all steps individualized to infection severity, alternatives, and patient risk profile [^1128G1Ao] [^113VSJDh] [^112LFuiC].

---

Elevated CPK during daptomycin therapy is managed by **immediate CPK monitoring** and **symptom assessment** [^1128G1Ao]. If CPK is > 1,000 U/L (≥ 5× ULN) with symptoms, or > 2,000 U/L (≥ 10× ULN) without symptoms, **discontinue daptomycin** and stop statins; if CPK is < 1,000 U/L without symptoms, continue daptomycin with close monitoring [^113VSJDh] [^112LFuiC]. Risk increases with **high doses**, **longer duration**, **renal impairment**, and **statin coadministration** [^112W7oML] [^117J9zQA]. Management includes hydration, electrolyte correction, and renal monitoring; most cases resolve after stopping daptomycin, but severe rhabdomyolysis may need dialysis [^111dhbCP] [^111MVNR3].

---

## Incidence and risk factors

- **Incidence**: CPK elevation occurs in 2–13% of patients on daptomycin, with rhabdomyolysis in 0.2–2% [^111MVNR3] [^117J9zQA].

- **Risk factors**: Higher doses (≥ 8 mg/kg), prolonged therapy (> 2 weeks), renal impairment, and concomitant statins increase risk [^112W7oML] [^117J9zQA].

- **Mechanism**: Daptomycin disrupts muscle cell membranes, causing leakage of CPK and potential rhabdomyolysis [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines for monitoring CPK levels

- **Baseline monitoring**: Obtain CPK before starting daptomycin [^notfound].

- **Routine monitoring**: Check CPK weekly during therapy [^113VSJDh].

- **Increased frequency**: Monitor more often in renal impairment, with statins, or if CPK rises [^112uy7DU] [^113VSJDh].

- **Patient education**: Instruct patients to report muscle pain, weakness, or dark urine promptly [^113vFikX].

---

## Management of elevated CPK levels

### Mild elevation (CPK < 1,000 U/L without symptoms)

In cases of mild elevation (CPK < 1,000 U/L without symptoms), **continue daptomycin** with close monitoring, and **increase CPK monitoring** to every 3–5 days until stable.

---

### Moderate elevation (CPK 1,000–2,000 U/L or mild symptoms)

For moderate elevation (CPK 1,000–2,000 U/L or mild symptoms), **consider discontinuation** — stop daptomycin if symptoms persist or CPK rises — and **monitor closely**, with CPK checks every 2–3 days and assessment for rhabdomyolysis.

---

### Severe elevation (CPK > 2,000 U/L or significant symptoms)

For severe elevation (CPK > 2,000 U/L or significant symptoms), **discontinue daptomycin immediately** and stop statins and other myotoxic drugs [^1128G1Ao] [^113VSJDh]. Provide **supportive care** with aggressive IV hydration, correct electrolytes, and monitor renal function; consider dialysis if acute kidney injury occurs [^111dhbCP].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Most cases resolve with **drug cessation and supportive care** [^notfound]. Severe rhabdomyolysis can cause acute kidney injury requiring dialysis [^notfound]. Prognosis is **generally favorable** with timely management [^notfound].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies

When daptomycin is discontinued for elevated CPK, consider:

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Vancomycin | MRSA, enterococcal infections | Nephrotoxicity, monitoring required |
| Linezolid | MRSA, VRE | Hematologic toxicity, serotonin syndrome |
| Tigecycline | Multidrug-resistant infections | Gastrointestinal side effects |
| Ceftaroline | MRSA | Expensive, limited experience |

---

## Preventive strategies

- **Dose adjustment**: Use lowest effective dose; avoid > 8 mg/kg unless necessary [^notfound].

- **Avoid high-frequency dosing**: Do not dose more than once daily [^113VSJDh].

- **Monitor concomitant medications**: Temporarily stop statins during therapy [^117Top48].

- **Regular monitoring**: Weekly CPK and symptom assessment [^112LFuiC].

---

Elevated CPK during daptomycin therapy is managed by **immediate CPK monitoring** and **symptom assessment**. Discontinue daptomycin if CPK is > 1,000 U/L with symptoms or > 2,000 U/L without symptoms; otherwise, continue with close monitoring. Risk increases with higher doses, longer duration, renal impairment, and statin coadministration. Management includes hydration, electrolyte correction, and renal monitoring; most cases resolve after stopping daptomycin, but severe rhabdomyolysis may require dialysis.

### Daptomycin exposure and the probability of elevations in the creatine phosphokinase level: data from a randomized trial of patients with bacteremia and endocarditis [^112W7oML]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the relationship between daptomycin exposure and the probability of an elevation in the creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level (hereafter, "CPK elevation") in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with or without infective endocarditis.

Methods

Phase 3 data for patients with S. aureus bacteremia, with or without infective endocarditis, who received intravenous daptomycin (6 mg/kg daily) and in whom pharmacokinetic data were collected were evaluated. On the basis of univariate logistic regression, the relationship between Bayesian post hoc exposure estimates and the probability of a CPK elevation was evaluated. Time to CPK elevation was examined with Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression.

Results

Significant relationships between the minimum concentration of drug (C(min)) and area under the plasma concentration time curve and probability of CPK elevation were observed in 108 evaluable patients. Of the 108 patients evaluated, 6 (5.56%) demonstrated a defined CPK elevation, regardless of treatment relationship. C(min) (breakpoint of 24.3 mg/L) was most significantly associated with CPK elevation (P = 0.002). The probabilities of a CPK elevation with a C(min) 24.3 mg/L and < 24.3 mg/L were 0.5 and 0.029, respectively. Increases in C(min), evaluated as a continuous variable, were also significantly associated with CPK elevation (P = 0.01). Stratified Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression demonstrated C(min) to be a significant predictor of time to a CPK elevation (P .003). The probability of a CPK elevation was 0 and 0.01 after 7 days of treatment in patients with a C(min) 24.3 mg/L or < 24.3 mg/L, respectively. After 14 days, the probabilities were 0.5 and 0.025, respectively.

Conclusions

This analysis demonstrated that a daptomycin C(min) 24.3 mg/L was associated with an increased probability of a CPK elevation. Clinical trials registration. Clinical trials.gov NCT00093067.

### Evaluation of impact of statin use on development of CPK elevation during daptomycin therapy [^1154Y61W]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Because both daptomycin and statins may increase creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels, the manufacturer of daptomycin suggests considering holding statins during daptomycin therapy. Published evidence suggests potential detrimental effects of withdrawing statin therapy.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of concurrent statin therapy on peak CPK values, incidence of CPK elevation in patients receiving daptomycin therapy, and clinical factors associated with increased risk of developing CPK elevation.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients ≥ 18 years of age who received daptomycin for ≥ 72 hours and had ≥ 1 follow-up CPK during a 5-year period. A Kaplan-Meier curve was used to evaluate time to CPK elevation. Cox regression analyses were used to compare the risk of developing elevated CPK between 3 study groups: those receiving daptomycin alone, daptomycin with concurrent statin therapy, and statin therapy held while on daptomycin.

Results

498 patients were included in the study-384 received daptomycin alone, 63 received daptomycin concurrent with statin, and 51 with statin held during daptomycin therapy. Cumulative incidence of CPK elevation was 5.1% and 12% at 7 and 14 days. Those on daptomycin and statin concurrent therapy demonstrated an approximately 2-fold risk of CPK elevation compared with those having their statin therapy held, but the overall group effect was not statistically significant (P = 0.17).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that holding statin during daptomycin therapy may not be necessary, but may indicate need for increased frequency of CPK monitoring when these medications are used concurrently.

### Rhabdomyolysis during therapy with daptomycin [^112S4fRQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The use of daptomycin has been associated with an elevation in creatine phosphokinase level, with a reported incidence of 2.8% in phase III clinical trials. Published case reports have documented the presence of myopathy in patients who received daptomycin; however, there have been no previously reported cases of rhabdomyolysis in animals or humans to date. We describe a case of rhabdomyolysis during therapy with daptomycin.

### Daptomycin [^1128G1Ao]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of antibacterial agents, including daptomycin, and may be life-threatening. If an allergic reaction to daptomycin occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.2 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), has been reported with the use of daptomycin. Rhabdomyolysis, with or without acute renal failure, has been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Patients receiving daptomycin should be monitored for the development of muscle pain or weakness, particularly of the distal extremities. In patients who receive daptomycin, CPK levels should be monitored weekly, and more frequently in patients who received recent prior or concomitant therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or in whom elevations in CPK occur during treatment with daptomycin.

In adult patients with renal impairment, both renal function and CPK should be monitored more frequently than once weekly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In Phase 1 studies and Phase 2 clinical trials in adults, CPK elevations appeared to be more frequent when daptomycin was dosed more than once daily. Therefore, daptomycin should not be dosed more frequently than once a day.

Daptomycin should be discontinued in patients with unexplained signs and symptoms of myopathy in conjunction with CPK elevations to levels > 1,000 U/L (~5× ULN), and in patients without reported symptoms who have marked elevations in CPK, with levels > 2,000 U/L (≥ 10×ULN).

In addition, consideration should be given to suspending agents associated with rhabdomyolysis, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, temporarily in patients receiving daptomycin [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of standard-, medium-, and high-dose daptomycin strategies for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia among veterans affairs patients [^111ZzT2Y]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus bloodstream infections (VRE-BSIs) are associated with significant mortality. Daptomycin exhibits concentration-dependent activity vs VRE in vitro, yet the clinical impact of higher-dose strategies remains unclear.

Methods

We performed a national retrospective cohort study of hospitalized Veterans Affairs patients treated with standard-dose (6 mg/kg total body weight), medium-dose (8 mg/kg total body weight), or high-dose (≥ 10 mg/kg total body weight) daptomycin for VRE-BSI. Patient-related, microbiological, and outcomes data were abstracted from clinical databases. The primary outcome was overall survival, evaluated by Cox regression. Secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality, time to microbiological clearance, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation.

Results

A total of 911 patients were included (standard dose, n = 709; medium dose, n = 142; high dose, n = 60). Compared to high-dose daptomycin, both standard-dose (hazard ratio [HR], 2.68; 95% confidence interval; [CI], 1.33–3.06; p = 0.002) and medium-dose (HR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.33–3.92; p = 0.003) daptomycin were associated with poorer survival. After adjusting for confounders, the relationship between poorer survival and standard-dose (adjusted HR [aHR], 2.58; 95% CI, 1.27–4.88; p = 0.004) and medium-dose (aHR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.27–5.00; p = 0.008) daptomycin persisted. Thirty-day mortality was significantly lower among high-dose daptomycin-treated patients compared with other dosing strategies (risk ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, .74-.94; p = 0.015). Compared with standard-dose daptomycin, both medium-dose (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, .55-.90; p = 0.012) and high-dose daptomycin (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, .41-.84; p = 0.006) were associated with significantly improved microbiological clearance. No difference in the risk of CPK elevation was observed between the treatment groups (P = 0.504).

Conclusions

High-dose daptomycin was associated with improved survival and microbiological clearance in VRE-BSI.

### Daptomycin (Dapzura rt) [^113VSJDh]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.1 Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of antibacterial agents, including daptomycin for injection, and may be life-threatening. If an allergic reaction to DAPZURA RT occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.2 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), has been reported with the use of daptomycin for injection. Rhabdomyolysis, with or without acute renal failure, has been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Patients receiving DAPZURA RT should be monitored for the development of muscle pain or weakness, particularly of the distal extremities. In patients who receive DAPZURA RT, CPK levels should be monitored weekly, and more frequently in patients who received recent prior or concomitant therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or in whom elevations in CPK occur during treatment with DAPZURA RT.

In adult patients with renal impairment, both renal function and CPK should be monitored more frequently than once weekly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In Phase 1 studies and Phase 2 clinical trials in adults, CPK elevations appeared to be more frequent when daptomycin for injection was dosed more than once daily. Therefore, DAPZURA RT should not be dosed more frequently than once a day.

DAPZURA RT should be discontinued in patients with unexplained signs and symptoms of myopathy in conjunction with CPK elevations to levels > 1,000 U/L (~5× ULN), and in patients without reported symptoms who have marked elevations in CPK, with levels > 2,000 U/L (≥ 10× ULN). In addition, consideration should be given to suspending agents associated with rhabdomyolysis, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, temporarily in patients receiving DAPZURA RT [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Safety of high-dose intravenous daptomycin treatment: three-year cumulative experience in a clinical program [^112vBMEU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

There are limited safety data for high-dose and long-term daptomycin treatment (16mg/kg administered for ≥ 14 days). We present our experience in 61 patients.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review for all patients treated with daptomycin at New York Hospital Queens (Flushing) from 1 January 2004 through 30 April 2007; patients were identified through a computerized hospital pharmacy database.

Results

Sixty-one patients (29 male and 32 female patients; mean age, 66.6 years) received a mean dose of 8 mg/kg of daptomycin for a median of 25 days (range, 14–82 days). Twelve patients (with bone and skin and softtissue infections) did not have an identified microbiologic isolate. Gram-positive infections included bloodstream infection with or without infective endocarditis (n = 32), skin and soft-tissue infection (n = 14), bone and joint infection (n = 9), and intra-abdominal infection (n = 5), and unidentified infection (n = 1). Prosthetic devices were removed from 11 of 20 patients. Grade 1 adverse events occurred in 22 patients and did not lead to daptomycin discontinuation. Fifty-eight patients underwent creatine phosphokinase (CPK) analysis (34 patients had paired CPK analyses at the beginning of and during therapy, and 13 patients had random CPK analysis performed during treatment). Three patients had constitutional and/or musculoskeletal symptoms accompanying CPK levels 110 times upper limit of normal (grade 3). All occurred after 24 days of treatment and improved after daptomycin treatment was discontinued. Two of 3 patients were morbidly obese (body mass index grade III).

Conclusions

Daptomycin treatment was well tolerated at a mean dose of 8 mg/kg for a median duration of 25 days. The incidence of symptomatic CPK level elevation was within the range reported with lower doses of daptomycin and/or for shorter treatment durations.

### Efficacy and safety of high Vs standard daptomycin doses examined in Chinese patients with severe burn injuries by pharmacokinetic evaluation [^112jPzzr]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

High-Dose Daptomycin Is a Useful Drug to Treat Patients With Severe Burn Injuries

Increased CPK is the most common adverse reaction to daptomycin, and there was only one patient (no. 3) that showed a transient increase of CPK on day 3 after receiving high-dose daptomycin. The level returned to a normal value without discontinuation of daptomycin treatment. There were no significant CPK differences in the indicated time points between the groups (Table 8). No serious adverse events (SAEs) and nonserious AEs, which could have led to discontinuation of daptomycin occurred during the study.

Laboratory Changes in Adults

Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection Trials in Adults

In Phase 3 cSSSI trials of adult patients receiving daptomycin at a dose of 4 mg/kg, elevations in CPK were reported as clinical adverse events in 15/534 (2.8%) daptomycin-treated patients, compared with 10/558 (1.8%) comparator-treated patients. Of the 534 patients treated with daptomycin, 1 (0.2%) had symptoms of muscle pain or weakness associated with CPK elevations to greater than 4 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The symptoms resolved within 3 days and CPK returned to normal within 7 to 10 days after treatment was discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Table 8 summarizes the CPK shifts from Baseline through End of Therapy in the cSSSI adult trials.

S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis Trial in Adults

In the S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial in adult patients, at a dose of 6 mg/kg, 11/120 (9.2%) daptomycin-treated patients, including two patients with baseline CPK levels > 500 U/L, had CPK elevations to levels > 500 U/L, compared with 1/116 (0.9%) comparator-treated patients. Of the 11 daptomycin-treated patients, 4 had prior or concomitant treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Three of these 11 daptomycin-treated patients discontinued therapy due to CPK elevation, while the one comparator-treated patient did not discontinue therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Safety and treatment outcomes of infants and children treated with daptomycin: six-year experience from a pediatric academic medical center [^111UgWmW]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Daptomycin is a common treatment for serious infections caused by gram-positive bacteria in adult patients; however, data regarding its safety and efficacy in the pediatric population are limited. This was a retrospective chart review of adverse reactions and treatment outcomes associated with daptomycin use in children < 13 years old who received at least 1 dose of daptomycin. At least 1 dose of daptomycin was received by 147 patients. Seventy-two patients received daptomycin for 5 or more days. New-onset loose stools on daptomycin initiation were reported for 14 (9.5%) patients, elevations in creatine kinase in 3 (2%) patients, and elevated aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase in 13 (8.8%) and 9 (6.1%) patients, respectively. Two patients (1.4%) had daptomycin discontinued due to specific concerns for adverse drug reactions. Daptomycin was found to be safe and effective in this pediatric cohort that included young children and infants with a variety of types and severities of infections.

### Daptomycin for the treatment of major gram-positive infections after cardiac surgery [^116vNk3M]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were monitored closely at both centers. Increases occurred in nearly all patients, but as fluctuations were found to be associated with cardiac surgery, no valid conclusion could be drawn from the evaluation of CPK values at baseline, during and after daptomycin. Monitoring of white blood cell (WBC) levels for leukopenia yielded minimum values between 1.9 G/l and 19.4 G/l. A drop in WBC to values below the normal range was noted only in two patients of whom one showed only temporary mild leukopenia with a minimum WBC count of 3.46 G/L. In the second, a decrease from 12.6 G/L to 1.72 G/L during daptomycin treatment with a recovery to 3.35 G/L upon termination of treatment was noted. Beyond this, no adverse events or undesired side effects attributable to daptomycin treatment were registered.

In Phase 3 cSSSI trials of adult patients receiving daptomycin for injection at a dose of 4 mg/kg, elevations in CPK were reported as clinical adverse events in 15/534 (2.8%) daptomycin for injection-treated patients, compared with 10/558 (1.8%) comparator-treated patients. Of the 534 patients treated with daptomycin for injection, 1 (0.2%) had symptoms of muscle pain or weakness associated with CPK elevations to greater than 4 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The symptoms resolved within 3 days and CPK returned to normal within 7 to 10 days after treatment was discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Table 8 summarizes the CPK shifts from Baseline through End of Therapy in the cSSSI adult trials.

S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis Trial in Adults

In the S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial in adult patients, at a dose of 6 mg/kg, 11/120 (9.2%) daptomycin for injection-treated patients, including two patients with baseline CPK levels > 500 U/L, had CPK elevations to levels > 500 U/L, compared with 1/116 (0.9%) comparator-treated patients. Of the 11 daptomycin for injection-treated patients, 4 had prior or concomitant treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Three of these 11 daptomycin for injection-treated patients discontinued therapy due to CPK elevation, while the one comparator-treated patient did not discontinue therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 534 adult patients treated with daptomycin in Phase 3 controlled clinical trials of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI), 27% were 65 years of age or older and 12% were 75 years of age or older. Of the 120 adult patients treated with daptomycin in the Phase 3 controlled clinical trial of S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis, 25% were 65 years of age or older and 16% were 75 years of age or older. In Phase 3 adult clinical trials of cSSSI and S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis, clinical success rates were lower in patients ≥ 65 years of age than in patients < 65 years of age. In addition, treatment-emergent adverse events were more common in patients ≥ 65 years of age than in patients < 65 years of age.

The exposure of daptomycin was higher in healthy elderly subjects than in healthy young adult subjects. However, no adjustment of daptomycin dosage is warranted for elderly patients with creatinine clearance (CLCR) ≥ 30 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment

Daptomycin is eliminated primarily by the kidneys; therefore, a modification of daptomycin dosage interval is recommended for adult patients with CLCR < 30 mL/min, including patients receiving hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In adult patients with renal impairment, both renal function and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) should be monitored more frequently than once weekly [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.10), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The dosage regimen for daptomycin in pediatric patients with renal impairment has not been established.

### Muscle pain associated with daptomycin [^115ki9i6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of muscle pain without pronounced creatine kinase (CK) elevation in a patient receiving daptomycin.

Case Summary

A 26-year-old African American woman had antibiotic intolerance to vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. She presented with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis that was treated with intravenous daptomycin 6 mg/kg daily for 14 days. The patient developed muscle aches and pains with only a minor elevation (492 U/L) of CK; both resolved after daptomycin was discontinued.

Discussion

Daptomycin is a newly approved lipopeptide antibiotic derived from Streptomyces roseosporus with rapid bactericidal activity. Daptomycin has excellent coverage against gram-positive bacteria. The adverse effect profile has included rare reports of myopathy and elevated CK levels. Daptomycin is a promising agent with many potential applications. Once-daily dosing has diminished the preclinical incidence of myopathy. The current package labeling recommends discontinuation of daptomycin with significant myopathy symptoms in association with a CK elevation > 1000 U/L or in patients without muscle pain and a CK > 10 times normal.

Conclusions

An objective causality assessment revealed that the myopathy was possibly related to daptomycin. Clinicians should recognize that significant myopathy with daptomycin can occur without pronounced CK elevation.

### Daptomycin for the treatment of major gram-positive infections after cardiac surgery [^111NYGwf]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Of the remaining patients, those in whom the respiratory tract was designated as the primary focus of infection deserve mention because daptomycin is expressly not recommended for treatment of pulmonary infections. In these cases, the respiratory tract was indicated as the initial focus of infection and the microbiological results obtained from the patients' respiratory secretion served to guide antibiotic management, but daptomycin was not chosen to treat gram-positive respiratory tract infection as such, but to prevent seeding of pathogens from the respiratory tract in severely compromised patients in an ICU setting.

In the largest subgroup of our patient cohort, i.e. patients with catheter-associated infections, we made more liberal use of daptomycin than recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America in its 2009 Update of its Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Intravascular Catheter-Related Infection. These recommend alternative agents such as daptomycin for empirical therapy of catheter-related bloodstream infections in health care settings with an elevated prevalence of MRSA in which the preponderance of MRSA isolates have vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration values > 2 μg/ml. Additionally, daptomycin is listed as an option in patients with catheter-related bloodstream infection due to ampicillin- and vancomycin-resistant enterococci and patients receiving hemodialysis with catheter-related bloodstream infection due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci. In contrast to the dosages of 6 mg/kg and 6–8 mg/kg per day recommended by these guidelines, our patients with catheter-related infection mostly received daptomycin at lower doses ranging from 3 mg/kg at intervals of 48 h to 7 mg/kg at intervals of 24 h. Treatment success in patients with catheter-related infection was nevertheless achieved in 72.2% of cases, compared to a total success rate of 83.7%.

Assessment of the overall outcome in our patient cohort yielded a favourable profile for daptomycin in terms not only of efficacy and clinical success rates, but also with regard to tolerability and safety even in high doses. This applies, in particular, to muscle toxicity and drug-related CPK elevations, which were reported to have occurred more frequently in patients receiving daily doses > 6 mg/kg, but also to renal impairment and leukopenia. Regular monitoring of our patients for CPK, creatinine clearance and WBC implemented showed no relevant changes in creatine clearance and CPK levels from baseline to completion that were attributed to daptomycin, and only one case of moderate leucopenia that resolved upon termination of treatment.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors

In healthy adult subjects, concomitant administration of daptomycin and simvastatin had no effect on plasma trough concentrations of simvastatin, and there were no reports of skeletal myopathy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

However, inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase may cause myopathy, which is manifested as muscle pain or weakness associated with elevated levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK). In the adult Phase 3 S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial, some patients who received prior or concomitant treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor developed elevated CPK [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Experience with the coadministration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and daptomycin in patients is limited; therefore, consideration should be given to suspending use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors temporarily in patients receiving daptomycin.

7.2 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions

Clinically relevant plasma concentrations of daptomycin have been observed to cause a significant concentration-dependent false prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and elevation of International Normalized Ratio (INR) when certain recombinant thromboplastin reagents are utilized for the assay. The possibility of an erroneously elevated PT/INR result due to interaction with a recombinant thromboplastin reagent may be minimized by drawing specimens for PT or INR testing near the time of trough plasma concentrations of daptomycin. However, sufficient daptomycin concentrations may be present at trough to cause interaction.

If confronted with an abnormally high PT/INR result in a patient being treated with daptomycin, it is recommended that clinicians:

Repeat the assessment of PT/INR, requesting that the specimen be drawn just prior to the next daptomycin dose (i.e., at trough concentration). If the PT/INR value obtained at trough remains substantially elevated above what would otherwise be expected, consider evaluating PT/INR utilizing an alternative method.
Evaluate for other causes of abnormally elevated PT/INR results.

### Daptomycin (Cubicin RF) [^112LFuiC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of antibacterial agents, including CUBICIN, and may be life-threatening. If an allergic reaction to CUBICIN RF occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.2	Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), has been reported with the use of CUBICIN. Rhabdomyolysis, with or without acute renal failure, has been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Patients receiving CUBICIN RF should be monitored for the development of muscle pain or weakness, particularly of the distal extremities. In patients who receive CUBICIN RF, CPK levels should be monitored weekly, and more frequently in patients who received recent prior or concomitant therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or in whom elevations in CPK occur during treatment with CUBICIN RF.

In adult patients with renal impairment, both renal function and CPK should be monitored more frequently than once weekly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In Phase 1 studies and Phase 2 clinical trials in adults, CPK elevations appeared to be more frequent when CUBICIN was dosed more than once daily. Therefore, CUBICIN RF should not be dosed more frequently than once a day.

CUBICIN RF should be discontinued in patients with unexplained signs and symptoms of myopathy in conjunction with CPK elevations to levels > 1,000 U/L (~5× ULN), and in patients without reported symptoms who have marked elevations in CPK, with levels > 2,000 U/L (≥ 10× ULN).

In addition, consideration should be given to suspending agents associated with rhabdomyolysis, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, temporarily in patients receiving CUBICIN RF [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Utility assessment of a pharmacy to dose daptomycin protocol: a retrospective cohort study [^111iXXWh]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pharmacy-to-dose (PTD) services describe an established practice where providers consult pharmacists for various medication dosing. In 2019, several institutions approved a daptomycin protocol, which allowed pharmacists to select doses based on provider-selected indications, renal function, and body mass index (BMI).

Objective

This study aims to determine the utility of a daptomycin PTD consult service.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from 4 community hospitals between July 19, 2019 and October 31, 2021. The 2 comparative cohorts included patients who started on daptomycin with and without PTD services. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients receiving appropriate initial dosing of daptomycin.

Results

A total of 297 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 128 (43.1%) in the PTD group and 169 (56.9%) in the non-PTD group. The primary endpoint of appropriate initial dosing occurred significantly more in the PTD group (92.2% vs 82.8%, P = 0.02). Baseline creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was ordered significantly more in the PTD group (88.3% vs 77.5%, P = 0.02). A nonsignificant trend was seen in favor of the PTD arm (80% vs 58.3%, P = 0.22) for dose adjustments required within the first 24 hours.

Conclusion and Relevance

The use of a PTD daptomycin protocol was associated with a significant increase in appropriate initial dosing and baseline CPK monitoring compared with traditional provider order entry.

### Effect of statin coadministration on the risk of daptomycin-associated myopathy [^117J9zQA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Daptomycin-associated myopathy has been identified in 2%-14% of patients, and rhabdomyolysis is a known adverse effect. Although risk factors for daptomycin-associated myopathy are poorly defined, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) monitoring and temporary discontinuation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or "statins", has been recommended.

Methods

We conducted a single-center, retrospective, matched case-control risk factor analysis in adult and pediatric patients from 2004 to 2015. Patients in whom myopathy (defined as CPK values above the upper limit of normal) developed during daptomycin treatment were matched 1:1 to no-myopathy controls with at least the same duration of therapy. Risk factors independently associated with myopathy were determined using multivariable conditional logistic regression. Secondary analysis was performed in patients with rhabdomyolysis, defined as CPK values ≥ 10 times the upper limit of normal.

Results

Of 3042 patients reviewed, 128 (4.2%) were identified as having daptomycin-associated myopathy, 25 (0.8%) of whom had rhabdomyolysis; 121 (95%) of the 128 were adults, and the mean duration of therapy before CPK elevation was 16.7 days (range, 1–58 days). In multivariate analysis, deep abscess treatment (odds ratio, 2.80; p = 0.03), antihistamine coadministration (3.50; p = 0.03), and statin coadministration (2.60; p = 0.03) were independent risk factors for myopathy. Obesity (odds ratio, 3.28; p = 0.03) and statin coadministration (4.67; p = 0.03) were found to be independent risk factors for rhabdomyolysis, and older age was associated with reduced risk (0.97; p = 0.05).

Conclusions

Statin coadministration with daptomycin was independently associated with myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. This is the first study to provide strong evidence supporting this association. During coadministration, we recommend twice-weekly CPK monitoring and consideration of withholding statins.

5.1 Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of antibacterial agents, including daptomycin for injection, and may be life-threatening. If an allergic reaction to Daptomycin in Sodium Chloride Injection occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.2 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), has been reported with the use of daptomycin for injection. Rhabdomyolysis, with or without acute renal failure, has been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Patients receiving Daptomycin in Sodium Chloride Injection should be monitored for the development of muscle pain or weakness, particularly of the distal extremities. In patients who receive Daptomycin in Sodium Chloride Injection, CPK levels should be monitored weekly, and more frequently in patients who received recent prior or concomitant therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or in whom elevations in CPK occur during treatment with Daptomycin in Sodium Chloride Injection.

In adult patients with renal impairment, both renal function and CPK should be monitored more frequently than once weekly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In Phase 1 studies and Phase 2 clinical trials in adults, CPK elevations appeared to be more frequent when daptomycin for injection was dosed more than once daily. Therefore, Daptomycin in Sodium Chloride Injection should not be dosed more frequently than once a day.

Daptomycin in Sodium Chloride Injection should be discontinued in patients with unexplained signs and symptoms of myopathy in conjunction with CPK elevations to levels > 1,000 U/L (~5× ULN), and in patients without reported symptoms who have marked elevations in CPK, with levels > 2,000 U/L (≥ 10× ULN).

In addition, consideration should be given to suspending agents associated with rhabdomyolysis, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, temporarily in patients receiving Daptomycin in Sodium Chloride Injection [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

As determined using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, CKD 2 = glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m 2, CKD 3 = GFR of 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and CKD 4–5 = GFR of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

Follow-up durations: microbiologic assessment (urine culture) ~3 days, clinical assessments up to ~7 days posttreatment.

*Use of unusually high per-weight dose was recommended by the ID specialist for the concomitant management of Staphylococcus spp. bacteremia.

† ID consult resulted in clinical decision to treat q24h rather than q48h for more rapid results in this patient.

Daptomycin-based courses of antibiotic treatment achieved clinical cure and successful eradication of VRE in all patients in this representative sample of a diverse patient population in our medical facility (Table 2). Indwelling catheters are common sites of infection, and similar results of daptomycin treatment were observed in patients with and without Foley catheters. Daptomycin was effective at eradicating VRE in patients regardless of whether they had had previous UTIs. Additionally, daptomycin eradicated VRE regardless of the level of renal function. Overall, daptomycin was well tolerated, and no reports of adverse events such as alteration of kidney function, muscle weakness or pain, and elevated levels of CPK enzymes were included. For most patients, CPK levels were measured at the time of daptomycin therapy initiation and once or twice more in the next 7 to 10 days. Even for the patient receiving the highest dose (13 mg/kg, patient 3), no elevation was above the normal CPK range.

### Association between statin use and daptomycin-related musculoskeletal adverse events: a mixed approach combining a meta-analysis and a disproportionality analysis [^113wWyRK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Daptomycin (DAP) is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic widely used for patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. DAP increases the risk of elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) caused by muscle injury, leading to myopathy and rhabdomyolysis in 2%–13% and 5% of the patients, respectively. Therefore, weekly monitoring of CPK levels is recommended to prevent the occurrence of musculoskeletal adverse events (MAEs) such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.

Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are used to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides by blocking the formation of cholesterol in the liver. Similar to DAP, statins also cause the development of MAEs. In patients using statins, myopathy is observed in 5%–10% and rhabdomyolysis only in 0.01%–0.1%. Rhabdomyolysis leads to a high mortality rate of approximately 10%; therefore, even the occurrence of mild and moderate MAEs in some cases requires statin therapy to be discontinued. Several studies have investigated the concerning increased incidence of MAEs following the combined use of DAP and statins. An observational study that analyzed 128 cases of DAP-related MAEs revealed that statin use was associated with an increased incidence of DAP-related MAEs. Conversely, other studies did not show an association between statin use and the occurrence of DAP-related MAEs. The inconsistent results remain controversial and thus need to be clarified to optimize pharmacotherapy using DAP and statins. Despite limited supporting data, the manufacturer of DAP recommends discontinuation of statin therapy to prevent potential drug–drug interactions. In contrast, based on the clinical practice guidelines for methicillin-resistant S aureus treatment, there is no need to withdraw statins. Discontinuing statin therapy may worsen neurological, cardiac, and survival outcomes in patients with acute stroke or myocardial infarction. Therefore, to develop safer and more effective pharmacotherapy, it is important to elucidate if the combined use of DAP and statins potentiate the occurrence of MAEs.

This study aimed to clarify, using a mixed approach, whether statins increase the incidence of DAP-related MAEs. To improve the quality of evidence on the association between statin use and DAP-related MAEs, we first performed a meta-analysis and then analyzed a database of spontaneous reports of adverse events. This mixed approach was successful in identifying other adverse events in recent articles because both methods complemented each other and improved the quality of evidence.

### Effect of daptomycin dose on the outcome of vancomycin-resistant, daptomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium bacteremia [^115HcScQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment options for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bloodstream infection (BSI) are limited. Daptomycin, although not currently approved for this indication, is frequently used for the treatment of VRE-BSI. Its optimal dose still needs to be determined.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational, cohort study during 2010–2015. We included patients who received a daptomycin dose of ≥ 6 mg/kg for the treatment of VRE-BSI caused by daptomycin-susceptible VRE. The primary endpoint was 14-day mortality, and multivariable logistic regression was performed for outcome analysis.

Results

We included 112 patients treated with daptomycin for VRE-BSI and with evaluable clinical outcomes. The daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 4 mg/L in 78 (69.6%) and ≤ 2 mg/L in 34 (30.4%) isolates. The overall mortality was 40/112 (35.7%). The unadjusted mortality was 18/36 (50.0%) for a daptomycin dose of < 7 mg/kg, 17/51 (33.3%) for a dose of 7–9 mg/kg, and 5/25 (20%) for a dose of ≥ 9 mg/kg (P = 0.05). The best outcomes were associated with a daptomycin dose of ≥ 9 mg/kg compared to doses of < 7 mg/kg (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 10.57; 95% confidence interval, 2.25–49.62; p = 0.003) and 7–9 mg/kg (aOR, 5.01; 95% CI, 1.14–21.98; p = 0.03). There was no significant difference in mortality with respect to the daptomycin MIC. There was no association between daptomycin dose and elevated creatinine kinase.

Conclusion

Higher daptomycin doses (≥ 9 mg/kg) were associated with lower mortality in patients with VRE-BSI. Our results suggest that higher daptomycin doses need to be considered for VRE-BSI treatment.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^1156yGqT]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Once a patient was determined to have a VRE UTI, screening creatinine values were measured in all cases, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were determined in most cases. Daptomycin was generally administered at a planned dosage regimen of ≥ 5 mg/kg every 24 hours (if creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥ 30 mL/min) or every 48 hours (if CrCl < 30 mL/min). Dosage was determined based on actual body weight for all patients in this analysis. A dose of ≥ 5 mg/kg was chosen to provide ample urinary concentrations of the drug.

Clinical cure was defined by the resolution of symptoms in the best judgment of the ID clinician involved in the care of the patient (SJS). These included urinary symptoms such as dysuria, urinary frequency, and changes in urine character. Other symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, malaise, and anorexia were also monitored for improvement. Follow-up urinalysis and urine culture were typically performed at the end of the daptomycin treatment course. The presence or absence of pyuria in urinalysis at the end of treatment was not in itself a strict criterion for clinical cure because it might have resulted from bladder irritation, drugs, or other causes. Regardless of whether pyuria was initially present and remained present at the end of the treatment course, microbiologic data were examined to help determine whether microbiologic cure was achieved. Microbiologic cure was defined by the eradication of VRE in urine cultures taken after completion of the daptomycin treatment course.

### Randomized multicenter study comparing safety and efficacy of daptomycin versus standard-of-care in pediatric patients with staphylococcal bacteremia [^116fm9xW]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus, including community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus, is an important cause of pediatric bacteremia. Daptomycin is a well-established treatment option for Gram-positive bacteremia in adults, but its safety and efficacy in children require confirmation.

Methods

This was a randomized (2:1), evaluator-blinded, multicenter, phase 4 clinical trial comparing intravenous daptomycin with standard-of-care (SOC) for treatment of S. aureus bacteremia in 1- to 17-year-old patients (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01728376). Total treatment duration (intravenous followed by oral step-down therapy) was 5–42 days. Daptomycin was dosed once daily by patient age: 12–17 years, 7mg/kg; 7–11 years, 9mg/kg and 1–6 years, 12mg/kg. The primary objective was to evaluate daptomycin safety in children who received ≥ 1 dose; secondary objectives included comparing daptomycin efficacy with SOC (the trial was not designed to confirm noninferiority) and pharmacokinetic analysis.

Results

Fifty-five children were randomized to daptomycin and 27 to SOC (primarily vancomycin or cefazolin); 90% had S. aureus. In both groups, 15% of patients had drug-related adverse events, primarily diarrhea (4% daptomycin, 8% SOC) and increased creatine phosphokinase (4% daptomycin, 0% SOC). Clinical success (blinded evaluator-assessed complete/partial resolution of bacteremia signs and symptoms 7–14 days after end-of-treatment) rates were similar for daptomycin (88%) and SOC (77%; 95% confidence interval for difference: -9% to 31%). Daptomycin plasma levels across age groups were comparable with those in adults receiving daptomycin at 6mg/kg.

Conclusions

Once-daily, age-appropriate daptomycin was well tolerated in children with staphylococcal bacteremia; efficacy was comparable with SOC. Daptomycin in age-adjusted doses is a safe treatment alternative in this setting.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1	HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors

In healthy adult subjects, concomitant administration of CUBICIN and simvastatin had no effect on plasma trough concentrations of simvastatin, and there were no reports of skeletal myopathy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

However, inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase may cause myopathy, which is manifested as muscle pain or weakness associated with elevated levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK). In the adult Phase 3 S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial, some patients who received prior or concomitant treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor developed elevated CPK [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Experience with the coadministration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and CUBICIN in patients is limited; therefore, consideration should be given to suspending use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors temporarily in patients receiving CUBICIN RF.

7.2	Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions

Clinically relevant plasma concentrations of daptomycin have been observed to cause a significant concentration-dependent false prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and elevation of International Normalized Ratio (INR) when certain recombinant thromboplastin reagents are utilized for the assay. The possibility of an erroneously elevated PT/INR result due to interaction with a recombinant thromboplastin reagent may be minimized by drawing specimens for PT or INR testing near the time of trough plasma concentrations of daptomycin. However, sufficient daptomycin concentrations may be present at trough to cause interaction.

If confronted with an abnormally high PT/INR result in a patient being treated with CUBICIN RF, it is recommended that clinicians:

Repeat the assessment of PT/INR, requesting that the specimen be drawn just prior to the next CUBICIN RF dose (i.e., at trough concentration). If the PT/INR value obtained at trough remains substantially elevated above what would otherwise be expected, consider evaluating PT/INR utilizing an alternative method.
Evaluate for other causes of abnormally elevated PT/INR results.

### Clinical outcomes of daptomycin for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus bacteremia [^115UCxZn]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

In light of recent evidence suggesting enhancement of daptomycin activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) by ampicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics, we evaluated the safety profile and clinical efficacy of daptomycin with and without concomitant β-lactam antimicrobials in the treatment of VRE (faecium or faecalis) bacteremia from multiple centers across the United States.

Methods

Data were collected retrospectively as part of a larger multicenter registry (The Cubicin Outcomes Registry and Experience). Efficacy and clinical outcomes in patients with VRE bacteremia who received at least 3 days of daptomycin with or without concomitant β-lactams were analyzed. Although all the cases involved daptomycin-susceptible VRE, additional analysis was performed to examine whether the adjunctive β-lactam would play a more pivotal role in cases where the daptomycin MIC was in the upper limit of the susceptibility range, indicating that daptomycin monotherapy efficacy may be relatively compromised compared with cases with lower daptomycin MICs.

Findings

Two hundred sixty-two patients from 33 hospitals were evaluated. Most patients had at least one significant comorbidity, such as solid-organ or bone marrow transplantation (16%), neutropenia (36%), dialysis dependency (20%), or critical illness (36%) requiring care in an intensive care unit. Overall treatment success was 86% (n = 225/262), and treatment success for patients taking concomitant β-lactams was 86% (n = 105/122). Logistic regression identified treatment failure to be associated with sepsis (odds ratio = 3.42; P = 0.009) and an elevated daptomycin MIC (3–4 µg/mL) (odds ratio = 3.23, P = 0.013). No significant increase in clinical failure was seen among patients with elevated daptomycin MIC who received concomitant β-lactam therapy (clinical success, 88% vs 79% for MIC ≤ 2 vs 3–4 µg/mL, respectively; P = 0.417). Of 262 patients, 33 (13%) experienced ≥ 1 adverse event possibly related to daptomycin (increased creatine kinase in 8 patients).

Implications

Overall, daptomycin was effective and well tolerated for VRE bacteremia, with lower effectiveness noted with daptomycin MIC of 3 to 4 µg/mL. Concomitant β-lactam therapy with daptomycin may improve clinical outcomes in this setting. Further studies are needed to characterize the potential benefit of concomitant β-lactams with daptomycin.

### Daptomycin compared to vancomycin for the treatment of osteomyelitis: a single-center, retrospective cohort study [^113pSygJ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Osteomyelitis (OM) is a serious infection with high rates of recurrence. Vancomycin has been used for decades in the treatment of OM, but, despite adequate dosing, 30% to 50% of patients experience infection recurrence within 12 months. Daptomycin, a novel lipopetide antibiotic, is also active against resistant gram-positive organisms, but there is little published about its efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of OM.

Objective

Our aim was to compare the recurrence rates of OM in patients treated with daptomycin or vancomycin.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of all patients at a VA Medical Center between January 1, 2003, and July 31, 2009, who received daptomycin for the treatment of OM was undertaken. Patients with a diagnosis of OM who received at least 2 weeks of daptomycin and had at least 1 follow-up visit within 6 months after completion of therapy were included. Each patient was matched with 2 controls treated with at least 2 weeks of vancomycin for OM. Matching criteria included previous OM, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hardware involvement, and surgical therapy. Patients were excluded from the evaluation if they received < 14 days of therapy, had no follow-up in the 6 months after therapy was discontinued, had an absolute neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm(3), or were receiving vancomycin and daptomycin concurrently. The primary outcome was recurrence of infection within 6 months after the discontinuation of therapy. Secondary outcomes included mean change in creatine phosphokinase (CPK), incident thrombocytopenia, and mean doses of antibiotics. The χ(2) test was used to compare rates of recurrence between groups.

Results

Seventeen patients received at least 2 weeks of daptomycin for the treatment of OM and were matched to 34 vancomycin controls. Twenty-nine percent of patients receiving daptomycin had a recurrence of infection compared with 61.7% in the vancomycin group (P = 0.029). The mean change in CPK for the daptomycin group was +28.8 U/L. No thrombocytopenia developed in any patients receiving daptomycin compared with 2 (5.9%) patients in the vancomycin group.

Conclusions

In a limited number of cases, significantly fewer patients treated with daptomycin for OM had a recurrence of their infection. Daptomycin may be a tolerable and effective alternative to vancomycin for the treatment of OM.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 534 adult patients treated with CUBICIN in Phase 3 controlled clinical trials of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI), 27% were 65 years of age or older and 12% were 75 years of age or older. Of the 120 adult patients treated with CUBICIN in the Phase 3 controlled clinical trial of S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis, 25% were 65 years of age or older and 16% were 75 years of age or older. In Phase 3 adult clinical trials of cSSSI and S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis, clinical success rates were lower in patients ≥ 65 years of age than in patients < 65 years of age. In addition, treatment-emergent adverse events were more common in patients ≥ 65 years of age than in patients < 65 years of age.

The exposure of daptomycin was higher in healthy elderly subjects than in healthy young adult subjects. However, no adjustment of CUBICIN RF dosage is warranted for elderly patients with creatinine clearance (CLCR) ≥ 30 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6	Patients with Renal Impairment

Daptomycin is eliminated primarily by the kidneys; therefore, a modification of CUBICIN RF dosage interval is recommended for adult patients with CLCR < 30 mL/min, including patients receiving hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In adult patients with renal impairment, both renal function and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) should be monitored more frequently than once weekly [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.10), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The dosage regimen for CUBICIN RF in pediatric patients with renal impairment has not been established.

FIGURE 2.
Clinical outcomes by duration of daptomycin treatment.

Safety

AEs, regardless of relationship to daptomycin, were reported in 6 (7.4%) patients. Three (3.7%) patients experienced SAEs. A total of 4 (4.9%) patients discontinued daptomycin because of AEs, of whom 3 (3.7%) patients discontinued because of SAEs. One death was reported in an 11-year-old girl with cSSTI because of pulmonary hemorrhage 3 days after starting daptomycin therapy, and this was deemed to be unrelated to the treatment. Immune system disorders; respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders; and skin and subcutaneous disorders were the most commonly involved system organ classes [2 (2.5%) patients each]. Details of individual AEs and SAEs are presented in Table 4. Three patients had AEs after 1–4 days of exposure to daptomycin, and 1 patient each had an AE after 5–7, 15–28 and > 28 days of exposure to daptomycin.

TABLE 4.
Safety of Daptomycin in Children and Adolescents

Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was measured in 32 (39.5%) patients at baseline and 31 (38.3%) patients during daptomycin treatment. At baseline, 28 (87.5%) patients had CPK at ≤ 1 × upper limit of normal (ULN), with 1 patient in each of the following categories: > 1 to 2 × ULN, > 2 to 5 × ULN, > 5 to 10 × ULN and > 10 × ULN. The majority of patients showed no increase in maximum CPK level during daptomycin therapy. Three patients had an increase to > 1 to 2 × ULN, and 1 patient had an increase to > 5 to 10 × ULN from normal values at baseline (≤ 1 × ULN). One patient showed a decrease from > 5 to 10 × ULN at baseline to > 2 to 5 × ULN during treatment.

### Association between statin use and daptomycin-related musculoskeletal adverse events: a mixed approach combining a meta-analysis and a disproportionality analysis [^111fvVmD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first study to clearly demonstrate the association between statin use and DAP-related rhabdomyolysis through a mixed approach using 2 methodologies. The meta-analysis showed that the incidence of DAP-related rhabdomyolysis was significantly higher in patients using statins than in patients not on statins. Disproportionality analysis using the FAERS showed an association between statin use and increased incidence of DAP-related rhabdomyolysis. This relationship was observed for all commonly used statins in clinical settings, such as atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin. The novel findings of the present study provide useful information on the safety of the combined use of statins and DAP. It is important to carefully decide on the use of DAP and statin combination; sufficient monitoring to prevent the occurrence of DAP-related rhabdomyolysis may be necessary. Frequent CPK monitoring at least once a week is required if the combined use is unavoidable. Many of the populations in the meta-analysis and FAERS in the present study were of Western descent. Our results were consistent with that of a very recent report that concomitant use of statins is associated with a risk of increased CPK during DAP therapy using a large Japanese electronic medical record database. The present study may be applicable to populations other than those of Western descent; further detailed study for verification is needed.

### Clinical experience with daptomycin for the treatment of Gram-positive infections in children and adolescents [^111US56U]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background:

This subgroup analysis of the European Cubicin Outcomes Registry Experience evaluated the safety and effectiveness of daptomycin in children and adolescent patients (< 18 years).

Methods:

Clinical outcomes at the end of therapy were assessed as success (cured or improved), failure or nonevaluable. Safety was assessed for up to 30 days post treatment.

Results:

Eighty-one children and adolescent patients were included in this study. The most common primary infections were bacteremia (19.8%), complicated skin and soft-tissue infection (18.5%), osteomyelitis (13.6%), endocarditis (12.3%), foreign body/prosthetic infection (12.3%), uncomplicated skin and soft-tissue infection (9.9%) and other (13.6%). Daptomycin doses ranged from 4 to > 10 mg/kg/day. Median duration of therapy was 12.5 (interquartile range, 7–25; mean, 16.7; standard deviation, 12.8) days. Staphylococcus aureus (46.7%) was the most commonly isolated pathogen (23.8% methicillin-resistant S. aureus). Forty-nine (60.5%) patients completed daptomycin therapy without further antibiotics, 27 (33.3%) switched to another antibiotic, 4 (4.9%) discontinued because of adverse events (AEs) and 1 (1.2%) discontinued because of other reason. Overall, 75 (92.6%; 95% confidence interval: 95.2–100.0%) patients achieved clinical success; 39 of 41 (95.1%) patients receiving daptomycin monotherapy and 36 of 40 (90.0%) patients receiving concomitant antibiotics. Six (7.4%) patients reported AEs, including 1 patient with increased blood creatine phosphokinase. Three (3.7%) patients had serious AEs; 1 (1.2%) had a serious AE possibly related to daptomycin.

Conclusion:

Daptomycin, alone or combined with other antibiotics and/or surgery, demonstrated high clinical success rates against a wide variety of infections and was well tolerated in children and adolescents.

RESULTS

Meta-analysis

Description of Selected Studies

Of the 48 articles from the database search, we included 7 in this review. The article selection process is illustrated in Figure 1. Of the 32 extracted articles, 21 were letters/correspondence, case reports, or relevant reviews and therefore were excluded. The study design and outcomes of the other 11 articles were reviewed, and only 7 studies were found eligible for a detailed analysis and quality assessment. The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 2. Overall, 4548 patients were included in the meta-analysis, 3489 patients in the DAP group and 1059 patients in the DAP + statin group. The number of participants in each study ranged from 16 to 3658. The definition of MAEs based on CPK values differed among the studies.

Table 2.
Summary of Included Studies

Quality Assessment

Seven studies were assessed and scored according to the RoBANS guideline (Table 3). There was a high risk of bias associated with participant selection for 5 of 7 studies because patients who have been treated with statins before DAP administration were not excluded. Four of the 7 studies were found to have a high risk of bias linked to confounding variables because these factors were not considered in the analysis. The 2 studies were evaluated to have a high risk of bias related to incomplete outcome data because patients with incomplete CPK data were excluded.

### Daptomycin for complicated skin infections: a randomized trial [^114dUtCm]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) are common in children. Due to safety and resistance issues with recommended agents, new treatment options would be advantageous.

Methods

Multicenter, evaluator-blinded clinical trial. Patients 1 to 17 years old with cSSSI caused by Gram-positive pathogens were randomized 2:1 to intravenous daptomycin or standard-of-care (SOC) treatment for ≤ 14 days. Daptomycin was administered once daily with dosing by patient age: 12 to 17 years, 5 mg/kg; 7 to 11 years, 7 mg/kg; 2 to 6 years, 9 mg/kg; 12 to 23 months, 10 mg/kg. The primary objective was to evaluate daptomycin safety. The secondary objective was to assess the efficacy of daptomycin compared with SOC. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of all randomized patients with any dose of study drug.

Results

The ITT population comprised 257 daptomycin and 132 SOC patients (primarily clindamycin or vancomycin); 35% had confirmed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (7% daptomycin, 5% SOC) and increased creatine phosphokinase (6% daptomycin, 5% SOC). The proportions of safety population patients with treatment-related adverse events were similar between the daptomycin (14%) and SOC (17%) groups. Clinical success rates (blinded evaluator-assessed complete/partial resolution of cSSSI signs and symptoms 7–14 days after end-of-treatment) in the ITT population were also similar for the daptomycin (91%) and SOC groups.

Conclusions

Once-daily daptomycin was well tolerated, with safety and efficacy comparable to SOC in children/adolescents with cSSSI caused by Gram-positive pathogens, including community-acquired methicillin-resistant S aureus.

### Daptomycin-induced acute renal and hepatic toxicity without rhabdomyolysis [^112C7WTd]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of a patient who experienced acute renal and hepatic toxicity following administration of daptomycin and review previously published case reports of renal and hepatic dysfunction with daptomycin.

Case Summary

A 35-year-old man receiving daptomycin 4 mg/kg (275 mg) intravenously once daily (started 5 wk prior to presentation for presumed osteomyelitis) presented to the emergency department with elevations in serum creatinine and hepatic transaminase levels. He did not experience creatine kinase (CK) elevation or rhabdomyolysis. Following discontinuation of daptomycin, his renal and hepatic function improved.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first case of daptomycin-induced hepatotoxicity with acute renal failure in the absence of rhabdomyolysis and CK abnormalities. Previously published case reports described patients with a variety of elevations in liver function tests, serum creatinine, and CK with daptomycin. In our patient, the acute renal and hepatic toxicity was probable according to the Naranjo probability scale.

Conclusions

Although daptomycin is a well-tolerated antibacterial agent, clinicians should consider periodic monitoring of liver function and renal function tests to identify potential adverse effects.

This subgroup analysis of the European Cubicin Outcomes Registry Experience evaluated the safety and effectiveness of daptomycin in children and adolescent patients (< 18 years).

Methods

Clinical outcomes at the end of therapy were assessed as success (cured or improved), failure or nonevaluable. Safety was assessed for up to 30 days post treatment.

Results

Eighty-one children and adolescent patients were included in this study. The most common primary infections were bacteremia (19.8%), complicated skin and soft-tissue infection (18.5%), osteomyelitis (13.6%), endocarditis (12.3%), foreign body/prosthetic infection (12.3%), uncomplicated skin and soft-tissue infection (9.9%) and other (13.6%). Daptomycin doses ranged from 4 to > 10mg/kg/day. Median duration of therapy was 12.5 (interquartile range, 7–25; mean, 16.7; standard deviation, 12.8) days. Staphylococcus aureus (46.7%) was the most commonly isolated pathogen (23.8% methicillin-resistant S. aureus). Forty-nine (60.5%) patients completed daptomycin therapy without further antibiotics, 27 (33.3%) switched to another antibiotic, 4 (4.9%) discontinued because of adverse events (AEs) and 1 (1.2%) discontinued because of other reason. Overall, 75 (92.6%; 95% confidence interval: 95.2–100.0%) patients achieved clinical success; 39 of 41 (95.1%) patients receiving daptomycin monotherapy and 36 of 40 (90.0%) patients receiving concomitant antibiotics. Six (7.4%) patients reported AEs, including 1 patient with increased blood creatine phosphokinase. Three (3.7%) patients had serious AEs; 1 (1.2%) had a serious AE possibly related to daptomycin.

Conclusion

Daptomycin, alone or combined with other antibiotics and/or surgery, demonstrated high clinical success rates against a wide variety of infections and was well tolerated in children and adolescents.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: a randomized clinical trial [^1124gzMh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients receiving daptomycin plus fosfomycin had a higher rate of AEs leading to discontinuation of therapy than patients receiving daptomycin alone (17.6% vs 4.9%; p = 0.012) (Table 4). No differences were observed between the groups at TOC in terms of overall mortality, lack of blood cultures, or loss to follow-up. A total of 103 AEs was recorded in 160 randomized patients who received any dose of study drug (Supplementary Table 5). The number of patients with AEs and serious AEs did not vary between the groups, but there were differences in the frequency of AEs related to the study drugs. The most frequent serious AEs in patients receiving daptomycin plus fosfomycin were cardiac failure in 5 cases and hypokalemia in 2. A 10-fold increase in creatinine phosphokinase values was observed in 1 patient receiving daptomycin plus fosfomycin and in 2 patients receiving daptomycin alone. AEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 13 of 77 patients (16.9%) receiving daptomycin plus fosfomycin and in 4 of 83 patients (4.8%) receiving daptomycin alone (P = 0.013; Table 4). The median time from randomization to discontinuation of the antibiotic treatment due to serious AEs was 10 days (IQR, 4–14 days) in patients receiving daptomycin plus fosfomycin and 10.5 days (IQR, 10–11.5 days) in those given daptomycin alone.

Table 4.
Adverse Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation

When benefits and risks of the intervention were analyzed by the DOOR approach, the probability that a patient randomly assigned to daptomycin plus fosfomycin combination would have a better DOOR ranking than if assigned to daptomycin alone was 61.6% (95% CI, 60.4%–62.8%).

### Efficacy and safety of high Vs standard daptomycin doses examined in Chinese patients with severe burn injuries by pharmacokinetic evaluation [^116PPqPN]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Data Source

This study was a single-center retrospective study of Chinese patients with one serious accident-caused burn injury. The therapies were conducted at the Burn Intensive Care Unit of Wuxi Third People's Hospital from August 2014 to October 2014. The medical record database was established simultaneously to record, save, and process all treatment data, which included the demographic information of the burn injury patients, the use and dosage of antimicrobial agents, as well as the efficacy of high daptomycin doses with PK/PD analyses, which was applied according to a previously published article. The database was maintained by the hospital medical records management department of Wuxi Third People's Hospital, from which the permission to use de-identified data for assessment and publication was obtained. The study is approved by the ethics committee of the Zhongda Hospital (no.: 2019ZDSYLL165-P01).

Basic Characteristics of Enrolled Patients With Severe Burn Injuries

The severe burn injury patients (age range 20–50 years), were at least 7 days postburn injury and received either standard-dose (6 mg/kg/d) or high-dose (12 mg/kg/d) daptomycin. In this study, severe burn injury was defined as > 50% body surface area burns. Inclusion criteria were completion of initial fluid resuscitation, and confirmed or suspected Gram-positive bacterial infection in the blood stream, skin, and/or soft tissues. Exclusion criteria were allergy to daptomycin; confirmed or suspected infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria; undergoing renal replacement therapy; pregnancy or breast-feeding; a history of rhabdomyolysis; or elevated creatine phosphokinase. Baux scores for predicting burn-caused mortalities were evaluated as: Burn area + age + 17 × (inhalation injury, yes = 1, no = 0).

However, there have been isolated reports of reduced daptomycin susceptibility, but this was not seen in our study. We had no mortality and successful wound healing was achieved in all patients. Further, in our study there were no adverse advents. An antibiotic regimen containing daptomycin was generally very well tolerated, and no patient required antibiotic treatment to be discontinued because of daptomycin-related adverse events. This is better than in other studies, which observed adverse event in patients with surgical site infection only or any cSSSI rates of 13% and 18%, respectively. Muscle toxicity thought to be related to daptomycin is reported to occur in approximately 3% of patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI), however these observation was not seen in our study. The CPK levels were within in the normal range after commencing treatment with daptomycin.

### High-dose daptomycin for cardiac implantable electronic device-related infective endocarditis [^113FCswE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED)-related endocarditis is a growing challenge because of increasing incidence and significant mortality. Current treatment is based on complete hardware removal coupled with long-term administration of effective and safe antimicrobials. Daptomycin at the dose of 6 mg/kg/day has been found to be effective in staphylococcal endocarditis, but limited data exist on CIED endocarditis. Moreover, whether higher doses could be more effective but equally safe in this setting is currently unknown.

Methods

We report here our experience with high-dose daptomycin in the treatment of 25 cases of CIED endocarditis due to staphylococci.

Results

Patients were mostly elderly and male, with large lead vegetations and severe comorbidities. Pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis (56%), Staphylococcus aureus (28%), and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (16%). Only 4 patients (16%) had a normal pretreatment renal function. The median daptomycin daily dose was 8.3 mg/kg (range, 6.4–10.7). Daptomycin was administered for a median of 20 days (range, 8–52). Percutaneous lead extraction was performed in 88% of patients. Two patients (8%) failed to clear bacteremia. The overall clinical success of treatment was 80%, whereas a complete microbiological success was observed in 92% of patients. Creatine phosphokinase values were monitored and increased above normal in 5 cases (20%). No serious adverse event related to high-dose daptomycin was observed and no patient required discontinuation because of muscle toxicity.

Conclusions

Our experience suggests that high-dose daptomycin may be a safe therapeutic option in staphylococcal CIED endocarditis and may be associated with high microbiological responses and clinical success.

### Multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium endocarditis treated with combination tigecycline and high-dose daptomycin [^115KpFB2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium requiring combination antibacterial therapy.

Case Summary

A 39-year-old female presented with chest pain and a history of endocarditis 3 years prior to admission. Blood cultures were positive for E. faecium. She was treated initially with daptomycin 6 mg/kg daily, which was later increased to 8 mg/kg daily despite poor gentamicin clearance. A variety of antibiotics were used in combination with daptomycin, but the patient remained febrile, with positive blood cultures revealing vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 256 microg/mL and daptomycin MIC 3 microg/mL (and later, 4 microg/mL). Following the addition of tigecycline, the patient experienced rapid clinical and microbiologic improvement, and blood cultures remained negative 9 weeks after discharge.

Discussion

Limited clinical data support the use of daptomycin for the treatment of E. faecium endocarditis, and information regarding the effects of escalating doses and combination therapy is scant. After failing multiple combination regimens, this patient responded to a combination of tigecycline and daptomycin. Daptomycin 8 mg/kg daily did not result in creatine kinase elevation in the face of evidence of possible renal dysfunction.

Conclusions

Increasing doses of daptomycin may enhance efficacy without compromising safety, even in patients with some renal dysfunction. The combination of daptomycin and tigecycline may be useful for the treatment of multidrug-resistant E. faecium.

### Clinical experience with daptomycin for the treatment of Gram-positive infections in children and adolescents [^116GxbM9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Daptomycin was well tolerated, and no unexpected or infusion-related reactions were reported. A limited number of AEs were reported, with no new safety signals. CPK levels remained at < 1 × ULN in the majority of patients. No indication of CPK-related AEs was observed in these real-world data.

Results from pharmacokinetic studies suggest that higher doses may be required in pediatric patients due to increased plasma clearance and hence lower area under the curve when compared with adults. However, in the present registry, the most commonly used dose was 6 mg/kg/day. In a recently completed study of daptomycin in patients aged 1–17 years with cSSTI, age-adjusted daptomycin doses were administered once daily to achieve exposures demonstrated to be successful in adult studies of cSSTI: 12–17 years, 5 mg/kg; 7–11 years, 7 mg/kg; 2–6 years, 9 mg/kg; and 1 to < 2 years, 10 mg/kg (NCT00711802). Treatment guidelines published in 2011 (after the start of this study in January 2006) suggest that an intravenous dosage of daptomycin 6–10 mg/kg/day may be used as an alternative agent in the management of MRSA bacteremia, infective endocarditis, acute hematogenous osteomyelitis and septic arthritis in pediatric patients. There are currently 2 trials registered in Clinical Trials.gov that focus on the treatment of Gram-positive infections with daptomycin in pediatric patients. One of these studies will examine the safety and efficacy of daptomycin versus standard of care in pediatric patients with bacteremia caused by S. aureus (NCT01728376). The second trial will examine the safety and efficacy of daptomycin, compared with vancomycin or nafcillin, in the treatment of pediatric patients with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (NCT01922011). These randomized studies aim to recruit a relatively large number of patients and should help to increase the overall knowledge surrounding the efficacy and safety of daptomycin in children and adolescent patients.

Laboratory data

Compared with the laboratory data before daptomycin application, median fibrinogen, hemoglobin, hematocrit, wbc, and plasma CRP levels declined significantly until discharge (fibrinogen: 674 ± 109 mg/dl and 603 ± 125 mg/dl, respectively, p = 0.03; hemoglobin: 10.4 ± 1.6 g/dl and 9.4 ± 1.3 g/dl, respectively, p = 0.008; hematocrit: 32 ± 4.8% and 29 ± 3.1%, respectively, p = 0.005; wbc: 12 ± 4.2 × 10 3 /μl and 9 ± 3.2 × 10 3 /μl, respectively, p = 0.001; CRP: 118 ± 72 mg/l and 35 ± 32 mg/l, respectively, p = 0.0001).

The liver enzymes (SGOT, SGPT, and GGT) levels, thrombocytes, serum creatinine, serum total bilirubin, CPK, CK-MB, and LDH levels remained constant before the first daptomycin application and discharge and did not achieved statistically significance. All laboratory values are shown in table 4.

### Association between statin use and daptomycin-related musculoskeletal adverse events: a mixed approach combining a meta-analysis and a disproportionality analysis [^111jKosY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

A mixed approach combining a meta-analysis and a disproportionality analysis using the FAERS demonstrated a significant association between statin combination therapy and DAP-related rhabdomyolysis. Disproportionality analysis using the FAERS suggested a relationship regardless of the statin agent. The appropriate use of statins and DAP should be performed with careful consideration of its safety.

### Association between statin use and daptomycin-related musculoskeletal adverse events: a mixed approach combining a meta-analysis and a disproportionality analysis [^1177yGuP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

There was a difference in the results between the meta-analysis and the FAERS disproportionality analysis in our mixed approach. The increased incidence of DAP-related myopathy with statin use was only observed in the FAERS disproportionality analysis and not in the meta-analysis. In most studies in the meta-analysis, the median DAP dose for enrolled patients was above 6 mg/kg. High dosing (≥ 6 mg/kg) of DAP, which has been widely used recently, leads to the development of MAEs. Therefore, the combined use of DAP and statins should be with careful consideration and sufficient monitoring of parameters such as frequent CPK to avoid developing DAP-induced rhabdomyolysis. The difference between the FAERS analysis and the meta-analysis of DAP-related myopathy and statin use may also be explained by the distinct definitions of myopathy in each study included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis carries a higher level of evidence than studies of other design. Reportedly, the results obtained from the analysis of real-world data are consistent with those of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Nonetheless, a mixed approach using a meta-analysis and using a spontaneous adverse event reporting database is particularly useful because it is difficult to conduct RCTs to investigate adverse events with drug–drug interactions.

The FAERS disproportionality analysis suggests that careful pharmacovigilance is required if DAP is combined with clinically recommended statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin). In contrast, Imai et al recently reported that the use of rosuvastatin, a hydrophobic statin, was not associated with an increased incidence of DAP-related MAEs in a large Japanese population. We propose that the inconsistency in results is from differences between study populations; however, additional investigation is required to determine the details. Furthermore, the mechanism behind the effect of statins on DAP-related MAEs remains unclear and additional studies are needed to investigate its etiology and occurrence in various populations. The positive association between the dose of DAP and DAP-related MAE was not observed in the present study. In our analysis, only 9.6% reported on DAP therapy with sufficient information on the daily dose of DAP; therefore, the relationship between dosage and incidence of adverse event in spontaneous adverse event database may need to be evaluated carefully. Our result is consistent with a previous report on patients with DAP in the Japanese spontaneous adverse event database. Further studies are needed to clarify the dose effect of DAP on DAP-related MAEs.

Finally, we examined PD parameters for S. aureus in severely burned patients with MIC values of 0.5 or 1, guided by CLSI. As given in Table 6, the AUC 0–24 /MIC and C max /MIC values in patients treated with high-dose daptomycin (12 mg/kg/d) significantly increased compared with 6 mg/kg/d of daptomycin (1283.0 ± 355.8 vs 510.6 ± 103.22, P = 0.007, MIC = 0.5 and 641.5 ± 177.9 vs 255.3 ± 51.61, P = 0.007, MIC = 1; 158.3 ± 33.6 vs 53.32 ± 5.16, P = 0.001, MIC = 0.5; 79.17 ± 16.84 vs 26.66 ± 2.58, P = 0.001, MIC = 1, respectively), but no significant difference in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were found between patients who received a standard dose (6 mg/kg/d) or high dose (12 mg/kg/d).

Infection

Infection was defined by means of clinical assessment, laboratory values, and microbiologic analysis. All patients showed DSWI with gram-positive organisms and were classified according to the criteria proposed by El Oakley and Wright.

Furthermore, mediastinal cultures, previous antibiotic therapy, and modalities regarding daptomycin application were studied. A suspicious wound was treated in our department with a standard microbiological protocol including amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. If we observed a treatment failure and/or the microbiological results showed sensitivity or resistance to other antibiotics, we changed the antibiotic therapy according the microbiological results. The details are summarised in Table 3.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Allergic Reactions

Advise patients that allergic reactions, including serious skin, kidney, lung, or other organ reactions, could occur and that these serious reactions require immediate treatment. Patients should report any previous allergic reactions to daptomycin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4, 5.5)].

Muscle Pain or Weakness (Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis, Peripheral Neuropathy)

Advise patients to report muscle pain or weakness, especially in the forearms and lower legs, as well as tingling or numbness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6)].

Cough, Breathlessness, or Fever (Eosinophilic Pneumonia)

Advise patients to report any symptoms of cough, breathlessness, or fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

C. difficile -Associated Diarrhea (CDAD)

Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials including daptomycin, that usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, including daptomycin, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever), even as late as 2 or more months after having received the last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Antibacterial Resistance

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including daptomycin, should be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When daptomycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be administered exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by daptomycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### Cerebrospinal fluid penetration of high-dose daptomycin in suspected Staphylococcus aureus meningitis [^111Bj1D3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia with suspected MSSA meningitis treated with high-dose daptomycin assessed with concurrent serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations.

Case Summary

A 54-year-old male presented to the emergency department with generalized weakness and presumed health-care-associated pneumonia shown on chest radiograph. Treatment was empirically initiated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Blood cultures revealed S. aureus susceptible to oxacillin. Empiric antibiotic treatment was narrowed to nafcillin on day 4. On day 8, the patient developed acute renal failure (serum creatinine 1.9 mg/dL, increased from 1.2 mg/dL the previous day and 0.8 mg/dL on admission). The patient's Glasgow Coma Score was 3, with normal findings shown on computed tomography scan of the head 72 hours following an episode of cardiac arrest on day 10. The patient experienced relapsing MSSA bacteremia on day 9, increasing the suspicion for a central nervous system (CNS) infection. Nafcillin was discontinued and daptomycin 9 mg/kg daily was initiated for suspected meningitis and was continued until the patient's death on day 16. Daptomycin serum and CSF trough concentrations were 11.21 μg/mL and 0.52 μg/mL, respectively, prior to the third dose. Lumbar puncture results were inconclusive and no further blood cultures were positive for MSSA. Creatine kinase levels were normal prior to daptomycin therapy and were not reassessed.

Discussion

Daptomycin was initiated in our patient secondary to possible nafcillin-induced acute interstitial nephritis and relapsing bacteremia. At a dose of 9 mg/kg, resultant penetration of 5% was higher than in previous reports, more consistent with inflamed meninges.

Conclusions

High-dose daptomycin may be an alternative option for MSSA bacteremia with or without a CNS source in patients who have failed or cannot tolerate standard therapy. Further clinical evaluation in patients with confirmed meningitis is warranted.

### Daptomycin as supportive treatment option in patients developing mediastinitis after open cardiac surgery [^111ajgvC]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Table 3
Organisms causing the mediastinitis

All patients underwent surgical debridement combined with drainage in 5 patients and removal of the implanted device in 4 patients. The removed devices were implantable cardioverter defibrillators; ventricular assist devices had not to be removed. Microbiological analysis of the removed materiel did not show any bacteriological population.

Surgical debridement was combined with calculated antibiotic therapy. Therapy was initiated with ureidopenicillins (in 9 cases as monotherapy and in 6 cases as combined therapy), carbapenems (in 7 cases as monotherapy and in 12 cases as combined therapy), cephalosporins (in 3 cases as combined therapy), or others (in 11 cases as combined therapy). Antibiotic therapy was changed to Daptomycin in all patients after 2 [1/3] days according to the antibiogram or in cases of disease progression.

Clinical improvement after therapy with daptomycin was detected in 90.5%; in 17 patients (81%) eradication without residues was achieved, in two patients (9.5%) eradication with residues was detected, and in two patients the therapy was unsuccessful (Table 4). The median until clinical improvement occurred was 5 [4/6] days. During therapy, daptomycin lead to mild increase in creatinine kinase, and values of leukocytes. These increased values declined distinctly after therapy (Figure 1 and Figure 2). No major adverse events during antibiotic therapy with daptomycin were detected; only a mild allergic reaction occurred in a single case. Median duration of daptomycin therapy was 8.5 [7/15] days.

### TDM-guided therapy with daptomycin and meropenem in a morbidly obese, critically ill patient [^116JaDrS]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of severe cellulitis, successfully treated with high-dose daptomycin plus continuous infusion meropenem, in a patient with morbid obesity and renal failure, in whom drug exposure over time was optimized by means of real-time therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).

Case Summary

A 63-year-old man with morbid obesity (body mass index 81.6 kg/m²) and renal failure was admitted to the emergency department because of severe cellulitis. The patient had an admission Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis score of 9, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy with daptomycin and meropenem was started. Because of rapidly changing renal function, dosage adjustments were guided by an intensive program of TDM (daptomycin ranging from 1200 mg every 48 hours over 30 minutes to 1200 mg every 36 hours over 30 minutes; meropenem ranging from 0.25 g every 8 hours over 6 hours to 500 mg every 4 hours by continuous infusion). Clinical response was observed within 72 hours. However, a sudden increase of serum creatine kinase (SCK) raised questions about the need for discontinuation of daptomycin. The drug concentrations were not toxic; therefore, we decided to continue therapy. Significant clinical improvement, with SCK normalization, was observed within a few days. Antimicrobial therapy was switched on day 29 to amoxicillin/clavulanate plus levofloxacin, and then discontinued at discharge on day 53.

Discussion

High-dose daptomycin plus continuous infusion meropenem may ensure adequate empiric antimicrobial coverage in patients with possible early necrotizing fasciitis. However, in patients with morbid obesity and changing renal function, significant challenges may arise because of the hydrophilic nature of these drugs and the inaccuracy of standard methods of estimating renal function.

Conclusions

Real-time TDM may represent an invaluable approach in optimizing drug exposure with high-dose daptomycin plus continuous infusion meropenem in patients with severe cellulitis, morbid obesity, and changing renal function.

### Efficacy and safety of high Vs standard daptomycin doses examined in Chinese patients with severe burn injuries by pharmacokinetic evaluation [^1159EGVC]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The AUC and days after the burn injury have been reported in previous PK studies with single-dose intravenous daptomycin administration. We demonstrated that the average AUC 0–24 value in burn patients treated with single and multiple high-dose daptomycin was negatively correlated with the Baux score, but had no correlation with the number of days from the burn injury. The severe condition of our patients, lack of improvement in their physical condition in the short-term, and different metabolic processes may have contributed to the differences noted in the previous report. Since the PK of daptomycin was linear and dose-proportional, the equation between the steady-state AUC 0–24 and Baux score was used to predict the plasma concentration and permitted the dose of daptomycin to be calculated according to the target AUC 0–24.

C max /MIC and AUC/MIC ratios are considered the best predictors for the efficacy of daptomycin against infections caused by S. aureus. We found an increased C max /MIC and AUC 0–24 /MIC with MIC at 0.5 or 1 in patients treated with high-dose daptomycin compared with a standard dose, but no significant difference of CPK in either standard-dose or high-dose treated patients. It is noteworthy that all patients in our study received supplemental plasma albumin and that the serum albumin level was controlled within the normal range. Thus, the increased serum albumin in patients treated with high-dose daptomycin would likely have no relationship with the steady state AUC 0–24 of high-dose daptomycin.

Daptomycin at 12 mg/kg/d elicited no serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations during the entire study period suggesting a good tolerability of daptomycin dosage up to 12 mg/kg/d administered intravenously once daily for 14 days. Although daptomycin has well known adverse effects, the FDA has identified seven confirmed daptomycin-associated eosinophilic pneumonia cases and confirmed that the victims were all older than 60 years, with symptoms occurring within 2 weeks of initiation of daptomycin treatment. There have also been a few case reports that pointed out serious respiratory complications associated with daptomycin therapy. Healthcare professionals should be aware of these life-threatening adverse events when treating burn patients with daptomycin.

Limitations of the present study were its retrospective design and the low sample number which was due to the fact that the patients were all affected by single serious fire disasters which is difficult to expand to a larger sample size.

### Association between statin use and daptomycin-related musculoskeletal adverse events: a mixed approach combining a meta-analysis and a disproportionality analysis [^112aqRow]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Disproportionality Analysis Using the FAERS

Among 13 508 522 reports submitted during the study period, the number of cases related to administration of DAP and statins was 5903 and 329 778, respectively (Supplemental Table 1). An increase in reports of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis was observed in cases treated with DAP and statins, regardless of age and sex (Supplemental Tables 1–6). Increased incidence of DAP-related MAE was not observed in patients with higher DAP dosing (≥ 8 mg/kg/d) compared with those with standard DAP dosing (< 8 mg/kg/d) (data not shown). Data for daily dose of DAP were available in 568 (9.6%) of 5903 reports with DAP therapy. Among the reports of DAP therapy, the incidence of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis were 5.15% (304/5903) and 4.68% (276/5903), respectively (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). In patients using statins, incidence rates of DAP-related myopathy (19.42%) and rhabdomyolysis (17.99%) were significantly higher than those in patients not on statins (myopathy: 4.06%; rhabdomyolysis: 3.66%) (Table 4). The combination of statin and DAP significantly increased the ROR for DAP-related myopathy (P < .001) and rhabdomyolysis (P < .001). The incidence of DAP-related MAEs in cases using simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin was significantly higher than that in cases not on these statins (Table 5). The effect of the other four statins on DAP-related MAEs could not be evaluated because of limited reports available, with no reports on the combination of DAP and cerivastatin.

6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of daptomycin for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Blood and lymphatic system disorders: anemia, thrombocytopenia

General and administration site conditions: pyrexia

Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis; hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, pruritus, hives, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, truncal erythema, and pulmonary eosinophilia [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]

Infections and Infestations: Clostridioides difficile –associated diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]

Laboratory Investigations: platelet count decreased

### Association between statin use and daptomycin-related musculoskeletal adverse events: a mixed approach combining a meta-analysis and a disproportionality analysis [^111gLjqz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Although the features of the 2 methodologies complemented each other through an integrated study design, there were several limitations inherent to each methodology. First, none of the included studies in the meta-analysis were RCTs and most of them had a high risk of bias. Second, there were only 2 studies about rhabdomyolysis in the meta-analysis, with 25 of the 26 cases with rhabdomyolysis reported by Dare et al, leading to high weight (90.6%) of that report. These factors may have affected the results of the meta-analysis. To address some of these limitations, the FAERS, which has a large claims database, was used in the disproportionality analysis. The association indicated by the meta-analysis between statin combination and DAP-related MAEs was confirmed by a disproportionality analysis using the FAERS. However, in the FAERS data, there is no definitive proof of causality between combined DAP and statin use and the occurrence of MAEs. The reported MAEs may have also been owing to other reasons aside from the administration of DAP or statins. Last, the FAERS data are known to have duplicate reports and significant amounts of missing data. To address this, duplicate reports were removed and only cases with complete information were selected. The generalizability of our results may be limited and needs to be verified by further studies in a larger population.

### Influenza-induced rhabdomyolysis [^116JJ1dJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

There are traumatic and non-traumatic causes of rhabdomyolysis. Traumatic causes include crush injury, prolonged immobility, compression syndrome, excessive exercise and lightning injury. Non-traumatic causes include metabolic myopathies, sepsis, electrolyte abnormalities, medications such as statins and daptomycin, illicit drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine, alcohol, hyperthermia or hypothermia and bacterial and viral infections.

In our case, there were no physical examination findings or laboratory abnormalities that indicated another cause for rhabdomyolysis. The patient's maximum temperature during the hospitalisation was 39.4°C, and prior to this measurement, the maximal temperature measured was 38.8°C, at which point serum CK level had already reached 20 000 U/L. Therefore, it was unlikely that hyperthermia was the aetiology for the rhabdomyolysis. Our patient did not drink alcohol or do illicit drugs. He did not take any medications regularly. He had no clinical signs of seizures. Hence, an electroencephalogram was not performed to exclude seizure as the aetiology. He required vasopressors briefly on day 1 of his hospitalisation making sepsis an unlikely cause of the rhabdomyolysis. Oseltamivir has also been implicated as a rare aetiology of rhabdomyolysis. In our case, the patient presented with an elevated CK level of 3043 U/L at admission making it less likely the inciting event. Furthermore, use of the Naranjo Adverse Drug Event Probability Scale indicated a doubtful relationship between rhabdomyolysis and oseltamivir therapy in this patient.

A muscle biopsy ruling out an underlying metabolic myopathy or polymyositis to identify a risk factor for rhabdomyolysis was not obtained. The clinical picture suggested a diagnosis of virus-induced rhabdomyolysis.

### Revolutionizing daptomycin dosing: a single 7–11-hour sample for pragmatic application [^112tQzo3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Precision daptomycin dosing faces clinical implementation barriers despite known exposure-safety concerns with the use of twice the regulatory-approved doses. We propose achieving a single 7–11-hour post-dose plasma target concentration of 30mg/L to 43mg/L to be a practical starting point to facilitate precision daptomycin dosing.

### Diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) [^11186TNP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Pentamidine isethionate — adverse effects, monitoring, and precautions — include hypo-/hyperglycemia, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, hypotension, QTc prolongation, nephrotoxicity, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hepatotoxicity, and cytopenias; with intramuscular use, pain and sterile abscesses at injection sites and rhabdomyolysis are noted. Laboratory monitoring should assess serum chemistry values, complete blood count (CBC), and electrocardiogram (ECG) before, during, and after therapy; monitor fasting glucose (and urinalysis) before each dose and at 3–4 wk and at 2–3 mo posttreatment, and if rhabdomyolysis is a concern, check or monitor creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level. To minimize risk for hypotension, infuse the drug over 1–2 h, keep the patient supine, and check vital signs before, during, and after infusion (or injection) until stable; avoid/minimize use of other agents, including nephrotoxic drugs. Use in pregnancy is typically not warranted or recommended for antileishmanial treatment during pregnancy, and selection of a different drug or interruption of breastfeeding may be prudent.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: literature review of contemporary strategies for diagnosing and management with three case reports: torso, abdominal wall, upper and lower limbs [^115SfjDj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Today, the generally agreed upon algorithm for care is: 1-Resuscitate the patient in shock; 2-Begin with broad spectrum antibiotics which cover polymicrobial infection; 3-Take patient to the operating room for early comprehensive debridement of all dead tissue. Doubt as to the diagnosis can be settled using frozen section histologic analysis. Obtain gram stain and culture from the wound; 4-Further debridement's should be repeated every 24 to 48 hours until the infection is controlled; 5-Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted to adequately cover organisms obtained on initial culture; 6-HBO can be considered in the hemodynamically stable patient, if available (Table 5).

A combination of antibiotics is the key to successful adjuvant therapy, most of our patients having been treated with empirical antimicrobial therapy before we established the early diagnosis of necrotizing infection. In the majority of our cases the wound cultures were collected at the time of initial surgery. Unfortunately, antibiotic therapy alone has little value because tissue hypoxia and ischemia do not permit adequate delivery of antibiotics to the target tissue. The polymicrobial infection identified by wound cultures was the dominant causes of NF in our study (Table 1, 4). For that purpose we used a combination of antibiotics that cover a broad spectrum of anaerobes (Clindamycin) and aerobes, gram-positive (Penicillin G or extended spectrum Penicillin, Imipenem and Teicoplanin) and gram-negative organisms (Aminogliycosides, Cephalosporins, or Carbapenems). Our therapeutic regimen usually consisted of Penicillin G, Clindamycin and Gentamicin. In cases when we used Aminoglycosides, renal function with creatinin excretion was additionally monitored. Because of the increasing number of MRSA infections, Daptomycin or Linezolid should be considered as part of the therapeutic regime, until MRSA infection has been excluded. Vancomycin is also in use, but it does not have any effect on exotoxin production. For the anaerobes coverage we have provided some other combination of antibiotics like Metronidazole and third generation Cephalosporins. After gram staining and culture for rapid bacteriologic diagnosis or rapidly frozen biopsy examination have been established, we started with targeted antibiotics. The culture-negative rate in our study was probably not due to the use of empirical antibiotic treatment before the wound culture was available, but it is lower than in other studies. Unfortunately, contemporary dilemmas about how long to use antibiotics also exist. We recommend continuing with the antibiotic therapy for 3 to 5 days after the systemic signs and symptoms and most local signs of soft tissue infection have resolved. Other authors suggested the same approach.

### High-dose daptomycin and clinical applications [^115HGCF5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate evidence for high-dose daptomycin (doses ≥ 8 mg/kg/d).

Data Sources

A PubMed/MEDLINE literature search was performed (January 2000 to December 2020) using the search terms daptomycin, high dose, and dosing. Review article references and society guidelines were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials, observational studies, retrospective studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews reporting on high-dose daptomycin were included.

Data Synthesis

Experimentally, daptomycin outperforms other antimicrobials for high inoculum and biofilm-associated infections. Clinically, high-dose daptomycin is supported as salvage and first-line therapy for endocarditis and bacteremia, primarily when caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (when vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration is > 1 mg/L) and Enterococcus. High-dose daptomycin appears effective for osteomyelitis and central nervous system infections, although comparative studies are lacking. High dosing in renal replacement therapy requires considering clearance modality to achieve exposures like normal renal function. Weight-based dosing in obesity draws concern for elevated exposures, although high doses have not been evaluated kinetically in obesity. Some data show benefits of high doses in overweight populations. Burn patients clear daptomycin more rapidly, and high doses may only achieve drug exposures similar to standard doses (6 mg/kg).

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This review analyzes the efficacy and safety of high-dose daptomycin in serious gram-positive infections. Discussion of specific infectious etiologies and patient populations should encourage clinicians to evaluate their daptomycin dosing standards.

Conclusions

The efficacy of high-dose daptomycin and limited safety concerns encourage clinicians to consider high-dose daptomycin more liberally in severe gram-positive infections.

### Roctavian gene therapy for hemophilia a… [^115jyVaL]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Lastly, nearly half of pivotal trial participants experienced creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations of unknown source. Roctavian mouse preclinical pharmacology-toxicology studies demonstrated histopathological findings of cardiac fibrosis and inflammation at doses of 6 × 10 13 vg/kg that were not reported in nonhuman primate toxicology studies, making the translational relevance of mouse observations unclear. Creatine kinase elevations were also observed with Hemgenix, an AAV5 vector produced in Sf9 cells administered at a comparable dose. CPK elevations were not reported in other AAV hemophilia trials, although routine measurements were not done. It is unclear whether CPK observations represent transduced tissue (eg, cardiac or skeletal muscle cells) toxicity or whether observations are AAV5 specific vs generalizable to the AAV vector-dose and/or manufacturing platform.

### Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase is associated with mortality and inotropic requirement in critically injured adults [^114GHwhU]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hemeproteins such as free myoglobin can undergo autoxidation and catalyse lipid peroxidation, increasing oxidative stress. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation is a marker for free myoglobin after myocyte damage. Since oxidative injury is a key mechanism of injury-related organ dysfunction, we hypothesised that serum CPK levels correlate with mortality and need for inotropic medication and duration of inotropic support, i.e. shock, among critically injured patients.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of 17,847 patients admitted to a single Trauma Intensive Care Unit over 9 years. 2583 patients with serum CPK levels were included in the analysis. Patient data were collected continuously into an electronic ICU repository. Univariate analysis was accomplished using Spearman correlation and the Mann–Whitney U test. Propensity score adjustment models accounting for potential confounders were used to assess the independent effect of CPK level on mortality, need for inotropic support, and duration of inotropic support.

Results

Median CPK was significantly higher in patients who died (916 [IQR 332, 2472] vs. 711 [253, 1971], p = 0.004) and in those who required inotropic medications (950 [353, 2525] vs. 469 [188, 1220], p < 0.001). After adjusting for propensity score and potential confounders the odds of mortality increased by 1.10 (95% CI 1.02–1.19, p = 0.020) and the odds of inotropic medication use increased by 1.30 (95% CI 1.22–1.38, p < 0.001) per natural log unit increase in CPK. There was a significant association between CPK level and duration of inotropic support (Spearman's rho .237, p < 0.001) that remained significant in a propensity score-adjusted model.

Conclusion

In critically injured patients, elevated serum CPK level is independently associated with mortality, need for inotropic medication, and duration of inotropic support. This study is the first to evaluate the relationship of CPK level and mortality in addition to surrogate measures of shock in a population of critically injured patients. If these associations are verified prospectively, there may be a role for treatment with hemeprotein reductants, such as paracetamol, to mitigate the effects of shock and end-organ dysfunction.

### Safety and tolerability of dalcetrapib (RO4607381 / JTT-705): results from a 48-week trial [^112YCkKZ]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests

Four percent of participants in each treatment group experienced elevations in creatine phosphokinase (CPK), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST). In the dalcetrapib group, CPK elevations > 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed in 2% (2/89) of participants and CPK elevations > 5 × ULN in 1% (1/89) of participants; also with elevated levels at baseline (> 1 but < 3 × ULN). In the placebo group, 2% (1/45) of participants experienced CPK elevations > 3 × ULN. Additionally, 1% (1/89) of participants administered dalcetrapib experienced ALT elevations > 3 × ULN, and 2% (1/45) of participants administered placebo experienced elevations in both ALT (> 5 × ULN) and AST (> 5 × ULN). Aspartate aminotransferase elevations > 3 × ULN were not observed with dalcetrapib. No participants with CPK elevations experienced myalgia, and no participant permanently discontinued treatment due to liver enzyme elevations. Treatment was interrupted for one dalcetrapib participant due to increased (> 3 × ULN) levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), ALT, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) on Day 19. This participant also had elevated ALP and GGT levels on Days 22, 28, 37, 55, 70, and 118, which progressively returned to normal. Elevation in ALP > 3 × ULN on Days 19 and 22 was not considered clinically significant (the definition being ALP and AST > 3 × ULN on two occasions ≥ 4 days apart). The AE was considered mild and possibly related to treatment by the investigator and resolved without sequelae.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: a randomized clinical trial [^112ukX7e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcomes and Measurements

The primary endpoint was treatment success at TOC (6 weeks after EOT). Treatment success was considered when patient was alive and had resolution of clinical manifestations of infection and negative blood cultures at TOC after completion of therapy. Treatment failure was considered in any of the following situations: lack of clinical improvement at day 3 or later after the start of therapy, persistent MRSA bacteremia at day 7 or later, premature discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events (AEs) or based on clinical judgment, recurrent MRSA bacteremia before or at TOC, additional antimicrobial therapy active against MRSA administered before TOC, lack of blood cultures obtained at TOC, and/or death due to any cause before TOC. Only patients without treatment failure could have treatment success. For analysis purposes, patients lost to follow-up (with missing TOC data) were classified as treatment failure.

The secondary endpoints were MRSA bacteremia at day 3, day 7, and/or at TOC; microbiological failure; complicated bacteremia; AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and mortality due to any cause at day 7 and at TOC. Microbiological failure was considered in the case of persistent bacteremia, recurrent bacteremia, and the emergence of resistance to study drugs during treatment.

Primary and secondary endpoints were assessed by study investigators in the modified intention-to-treat population. A systematic, prioritized, risk-based approach to monitor AEs was developed to ensure that the trial was conducted, recorded, and reported according to good clinical practices. AEs were recorded in all patients who received at least 1 dose of the study medication. Clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and other safety assessments were performed at scheduled visits. An independent data and safety monitoring committee was established to review data when half of the sample had been recruited. Mortality and serious AEs leading to discontinuation of therapy were considered key safety parameters. After a safety monitoring meeting performed on 25 May 2016, no significant differences in serious events between groups were detected, and a formal recommendation of continuing the study was established by the independent data and safety monitoring committee.

Microbiological methods are detailed in the Supplementary Appendix.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^1177CRNL]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Enterococcus infective endocarditis (IE) caused by strains resistant to penicillin, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin — treatment and care team guidance include the following: Linezolid 600 mg IV or orally every 12 h for > 6 weeks is a Class IIb; Level of Evidence C option, and linezolid use may be associated with potentially severe bone marrow suppression, neuropathy, and numerous drug interactions; daptomycin 10–12 mg/kg per dose for > 6 weeks is also Class IIb; Level of Evidence C, and if daptomycin therapy is selected, then doses of 10 to 12 mg·kg−1·24 h−1 may be considered. Patients with IE attributable to Enterococcus species resistant to penicillin, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin should be managed by specialists in infectious diseases, cardiology, cardiovascular surgery, clinical pharmacy, and, if necessary, pediatrics (Class I; Level of Evidence C); patients with IE caused by these strains should be treated by a care team including specialists in infectious diseases, cardiology, cardiac surgery, clinical pharmacy, and, in children, pediatrics, and cardiac valve replacement may be necessary for cure. Combination therapy with daptomycin and ampicillin or ceftriaxone may be considered, especially in patients with persistent bacteremia or enterococcal strains with high MICs (ie, 3 μg/mL) to daptomycin within the susceptible range (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C). Doses recommended are for patients with normal renal and hepatic function.

### A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis to dose optimize daptomycin in vancomycin-resistant: is the answer fixed dosing or lowering breakpoints? [^113qg5CJ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal daptomycin dose for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium remains unclear. Dosing of 8 to 12 mg/kg/d has been recommended to improve outcomes, but literature suggests fixed dosing may improve methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia pharmacodynamic (PD) targets.

Objective

This study sought to evaluate weight-based versus fixed dosing of daptomycin based on pharmacokinetic and PD (PK-PD) targets in vancomycin-resistant E faecium bacteremia.

Methods

PK-PD analyses were conducted using previously published PK models for daptomycin. Probability of target attainment (PTA) was assessed for 8 to 12 mg/kg/d and various fixed doses. The percentage of simulated participants who achieved a free area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio (f AUC 0–24 /MIC) > 27.43 for susceptible dose-dependent (SDD) MICs and the probability of a minimum concentration (C min) > 24.3 mg/L were calculated.

Results

At MICs ≤ 2 mg/L, fixed doses had the best overall PTA. At the SDD breakpoint of 4 mg/L, all weight-based doses had < 60% PTA. A fixed dose of 1500 mg/d was necessary for ≥ 90% PTA at higher MICs considered SDD; however, this dose had elevated risks of C min ≥ 24.3 mg/L.

Conclusion and Relevance

Fixed doses were more likely to achieve a f AUC/MIC of 27.43 than weight-based doses up to 12 mg/kg/d. However, fixed doses necessary for 90% PTA against SDD isolates with higher MICs were associated with elevated risks of toxicity. A reevaluation of Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints may need to be considered, with an emphasis on lowering the SDD breakpoint to 1 mg/L.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis – when should we start worrying? Case reports and literature review [^113Kzp8k]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER) is a serious medical issue usually seen in individuals or patients after engaging in heavy exertion and physical activity. The incidence, natural course, and recurrence of ER are, by and large, unknown. Given the lack of rigorous scientific data that are specific for ER, most of the patients with ER receive treatment in an inpatient setting even with only a mild elevation of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level. Often, patients receive inpatient treatment solely on the basis of elevated CPK (< 3000 IU) even in the absence of other serious signs and symptoms of ER. We intent to describe 2 case reports that involve patients who developed ER after an intense physical exertion and were managed in an outpatient setting with close follow-up. In the discussion part, we point suggest that in patients with a relatively mild CPK elevation (< 15,000 IU) and normal creatinine value and in the absence of factors such as profound dehydration, sickle cell trait, concomitant infectious cause, underlying metabolic syndrome, and current and ongoing use of analgesics, the complications after ER are low. Patients who develop ER, who can be reliably followed up, and who fulfills these criteria can be managed as outpatients.

### Effect of vancomycin or daptomycin with vs without an antistaphylococcal β-lactam on mortality, bacteremia, relapse, or treatment failure in patients with MRSA bacteremia: a randomized clinical trial [^113uYSHx]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia is associated with mortality of more than 20%. Combining standard therapy with a β-lactam antibiotic has been associated with reduced mortality, although adequately powered randomized clinical trials of this intervention have not been conducted.

Objective

To determine whether combining an antistaphylococcal β-lactam with standard therapy is more effective than standard therapy alone in patients with MRSA bacteremia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted at 27 hospital sites in 4 countries from August 2015 to July 2018 among 352 hospitalized adults with MRSA bacteremia. Follow-up was complete on October 23, 2018.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to standard therapy (intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin) plus an antistaphylococcal β-lactam (intravenous flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cefazolin) (n = 174) or standard therapy alone (n = 178). Total duration of therapy was determined by treating clinicians and the β-lactam was administered for 7 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was a 90-day composite of mortality, persistent bacteremia at day 5, microbiological relapse, and microbiological treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included mortality at days 14, 42, and 90; persistent bacteremia at days 2 and 5; acute kidney injury (AKI); microbiological relapse; microbiological treatment failure; and duration of intravenous antibiotics.

Results

The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study prior to enrollment of 440 patients because of safety. Among 352 patients randomized (mean age, 62.2 [SD, 17.7] years; 121 women [34.4%]), 345 (98%) completed the trial. The primary end point was met by 59 (35%) with combination therapy and 68 (39%) with standard therapy (absolute difference, -4.2%; 95% CI, -14.3% to 6.0%). Seven of 9 prespecified secondary end points showed no significant difference. For the combination therapy vs standard therapy groups, all-cause 90-day mortality occurred in 35 (21%) vs 28 (16%) (difference, 4.5%; 95% CI, -3.7% to 12.7%); persistent bacteremia at day 5 was observed in 19 of 166 (11%) vs 35 of 172 (20%) (difference, -8.9%; 95% CI, -16.6% to -1.2%); and, excluding patients receiving dialysis at baseline, AKI occurred in 34 of 145 (23%) vs 9 of 145 (6%) (difference, 17.2%; 95% CI, 9.3%-25.2%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with MRSA bacteremia, addition of an antistaphylococcal β-lactam to standard antibiotic therapy with vancomycin or daptomycin did not result in significant improvement in the primary composite end point of mortality, persistent bacteremia, relapse, or treatment failure. Early trial termination for safety concerns and the possibility that the study was underpowered to detect clinically important differences in favor of the intervention should be considered when interpreting the findings.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: a randomized clinical trial [^1165px1s]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this randomized clinical trial, daptomycin plus fosfomycin provided a 12% higher rate of treatment success than daptomycin alone at 6 weeks after end of therapy for MRSA bacteremia, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Of note, the antibiotic combination therapy precluded microbiological failure and complicated bacteremia at TOC but was more often associated with AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. Our results suggest that daptomycin plus fosfomycin could be more effective than daptomycin alone in younger patients and in those with more severe disease, but this needs to be confirmed after further study. Our findings were reinforced by the DOOR post hoc analysis showing that patients randomly assigned to daptomycin plus fosfomycin combination would have a better DOOR ranking, and thus a better outcome, than if assigned to daptomycin alone.

We found that no patient receiving daptomycin plus fosfomycin had persistent bacteremia at day 7 and/or relapsing bacteremia at TOC. Rapid clearance of MRSA bacteremia is an important target, since the persistence of positive blood cultures beyond day 3 has been closely related to worse clinical outcomes. Importantly, we found that patients receiving combination therapy developed complicated bacteremia less often and that no antibiotic resistance occurred in any patients in this group. Our results concur with those reported in small series of patients treated with β-lactams or daptomycin plus fosfomycin. Additionally, the combination of daptomycin plus fosfomycin might prevent the emergence of drug resistance. The single patient who developed resistance to daptomycin was receiving daptomycin alone.

We found that AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were more frequent in patients receiving daptomycin plus fosfomycin. The antibiotic combination was more often associated with cardiac failure and electrolyte disorders, particularly hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. It has been suggested that hypokalemia could be avoided in some cases by the extended infusion of fosfomycin over a 4-hour period. The fact that fosfomycin-related serious AEs appeared after a median of 10 days of therapy and the high microbiological efficacy achieved at 3 and 7 days of the combination therapy suggest that fosfomycin should essentially be administered during the first week of treatment.

Table 3 — PK/PD-based dosing targets for specific antimicrobials outlines concentration goals and dosing considerations. For aminoglycosides, targets include AUC 70–100, Cmax/MIC 8–10, and Cmin < MIC, with the note to use extended interval dosing with patient weight and kidney function. Daptomycin lists AUC0–24/MIC > 200 with use patient weight and kidney function. Fluoroquinolones specify AUC0–24/MIC 80–125 with use kidney function. Vancomycin specifies AUC0–24/MIC 400 with use patient weight and kidney function. For antifungals, fluconazole lists AUC0–24/MIC 100; posaconazole lists Cmin 1–4 mg/L with use formulation-specific dose; and voriconazole lists Cmin 2–6 mg/L with use patient weight.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for rhabdomyolysis, more specifically with respect to laboratory follow-up, AAST 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain serial CK measurement for monitoring until a peak concentration is identified (typically at 24–72 hours), and discontinue once the CK is reliably downtrending.

### Bench-to-bedside review: rhabdomyolysis – an overview for clinicians [^111dhbCP]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis ranges from an asymptomatic illness with elevation in the creatine kinase level to a life-threatening condition associated with extreme elevations in creatine kinase, electrolyte imbalances, acute renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Muscular trauma is the most common cause of rhabdomyolysis. Less common causes include muscle enzyme deficiencies, electrolyte abnormalities, infectious causes, drugs, toxins and endocrinopathies. Weakness, myalgia and tea-colored urine are the main clinical manifestations. The most sensitive laboratory finding of muscle injury is an elevated plasma creatine kinase level. The management of patients with rhabdomyolysis includes early vigorous hydration.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by group G Streptococcus, United Kingdom [^117HsoXk]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

In 2014, a 66-year-old man (patient 3) with a history of diabetes mellitus was admitted to the hospital in septic shock. A total knee replacement 6 months earlier had resulted in chronic leg lymphedema. Noteworthy blood test results included a high serum lactate level of 4 mmol/L, an elevated creatinine level of 318 µmol/L, and a high alanine aminotransferase level of 210 IU/L. The patient had a blood pressure of 40/20 mm Hg, rapidly spreading erythema from the knee to the abdomen, and suffused conjunctivae. His illness was managed clinically as toxic shock syndrome. He received inotropic support, mechanical ventilation, hemofiltration, and intravenous linezolid (600 mg every 12 h), intravenous clindamycin (1.2 g every 6 h), and 2 g/kg polyclonal IVIg (Privigen). Arthroscopic washout of the prosthetic knee revealed copious pus that yielded GGS on culture. Although cardiovascular function stabilized, blood parameters continued to deteriorate. On day 3, following open debridement of the knee, the patient began to improve, and his CRP level remained elevated at 280 mg/L. Antimicrobial drugs were changed to intravenous daptomycin (7 mg/kg once daily) to maximize antibiofilm activity (reference 16 in Technical Appendix). After a negative echocardiography, the patient was discharged home on day 30, completing a 6-week course of daptomycin as an outpatient, and successfully retained the knee prosthesis. He remains well on life-long penicillin prophylaxis.

### Daptomycin use in a neonate: serum level monitoring and outcome [^117J7kVg]. American Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

We present a case of successfully treated persistent bacteremia due to Gram-positive bacteria with daptomycin in a preterm neonate. Daptomycin was given at higher doses (6 mg/kg/dose) and shorter intervals (every 12 hours) than those recommended for adults with no adverse events. Peak and trough serum concentrations of daptomycin were 27.3 and 11.6 μg/mL [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] at day 4 as well as 22.9 and 7.9 μg/mL [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED]at day 11 after initiation of treatment, respectively.

### Considerations for higher doses of daptomycin in critically ill patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^117Ef3ew]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Higher daptomycin doses are advocated for select methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-related infections, but the probabilities of target attainment (PTA) and toxicity of these doses have not been characterized in critically ill patients.

Methods

We evaluated the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical outcomes of a cohort of critically ill patients treated with daptomycin 6–8 mg/kg/day for primarily Staphylococcus species-related infections. Daptomycin concentrations were measured intensively over the initial 96-hour dosing period. Data were modeled by population PK analyses, and Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the probabilities of effect and toxicity with standard and alternate dosing regimens.

Results

Fifty patients with a mean (SD) age of 69.7 (12.2) years, weight 74.5 (20.3) kg, and creatinine clearance 56.8 (38.2) mL/minute were enrolled with measurements of 12 (2.2) daptomycin samples per patient. Significantly lower daptomycin exposures were observed despite comparable doses in a subset of patients (n = 13) with augmented clearance (CL). No covariates of CL were identified, but this subset was significantly more likely to be in severe sepsis or septic shock, have higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, and MRSA bacteremia. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher (30.7% vs 10.8%) in patients with augmented daptomycin CL. Use of an empiric fixed dose of 750 mg of daptomycin is predicted to achieve a comparable PTA with a lower probability of toxicity as compared to the use of 10 mg/kg in critically ill patients.

Conclusions

A reappraisal of current daptomycin dosing recommendations is needed to improve the PTA and reduce toxicity among critically ill patients.
