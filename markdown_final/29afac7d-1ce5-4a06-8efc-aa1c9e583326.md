## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the provided article describes a new risk score or risk calculator in healthcare. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition of a risk score and what constitutes a "new" score versus a review or validation. Then, I should verify the article's content and methodology to see if it presents a newly derived model with variables, weights, and a scoring algorithm. Next, I will check whether the article includes external validation or is primarily a comparative review of existing tools. Finally, I will synthesize and conclude whether the article meets the criteria for describing a new risk score or calculator.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: a healthcare risk score is a quantitative estimate of the probability of a clinical event or outcome over a specified period, typically derived from an algorithm using patient demographics, clinical history, laboratory results, and other predictors, and designed to support clinical decision-making and resource allocation; I should ensure the article aligns with this construct before labeling it as a new score.

> Wait, let me verify the article's intent and scope; if it is a narrative review, systematic review, or comparative study of existing scores, that would not qualify as introducing a new score, whereas a derivation study with model development, predictor selection, and internal/external validation would meet the definition of a new risk score or calculator.

> I will now examine whether the article presents a newly derived model with explicit variables, weights, and a scoring algorithm; if it does, that would support classifying it as a new risk score, whereas absence of derivation details would argue against that classification.

> Next, I should review whether the article includes external validation on an independent cohort; external validation is a hallmark of a robust, new risk score and helps distinguish a true development/validation study from a purely internal or descriptive proposal.

> Hold on, I should verify whether the article is primarily a review, commentary, or comparison of existing tools; if the main contribution is evaluating or comparing previously published scores rather than proposing a new model, then it does not constitute a new risk score despite potentially discussing performance metrics like discrimination and calibration.

> Let me consider concrete examples to anchor my judgment; articles describing the derivation and validation of tools like the 4C Mortality Score for COVID-19, the MASCC risk index for febrile neutropenia, or the Fong Clinical Risk Score for colorectal liver metastases clearly present new risk scores, whereas articles that only review, critique, or compare existing scores without proposing a new model do not meet the "new score" criterion [^notfound] [^113smG9L] [^111ufAfW].

> I should double-check for ambiguity: if the article proposes a modification or recalibration of an existing score, that could be considered a new variant, but I need to confirm whether the authors present it as a novel derivation with validation rather than a mere update; only the former would typically qualify as a new risk score in this context.

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my conclusion matches the evidence: if the article lacks model derivation, predictor specification, and external validation, and instead reviews or compares existing tools, then it does not describe a new risk score; conversely, if it includes derivation, validation, and a usable scoring algorithm, then it does describe a new risk score or calculator.

> Final answer: I can't say definitively without the article text, but based on the reasoning above, if the article is a review or comparative study without presenting a newly derived and externally validated model, then the answer is NO; if it presents a newly developed model with derivation and validation, then the answer is YES, and I would classify it accordingly once I can verify those elements in the full text.

Medical scoring systems synthesize clinical data into standardized metrics to support diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions across specialties. They must be **validated and recalibrated** for the target population to ensure accuracy and fairness [^111MREMC] [^112ATjHi]. Clinicians should apply scores alongside clinical judgment, recognizing limitations such as population mismatch, miscalibration, and potential bias [^1174Pji7] [^111SWU61] [^112Di81v]. Emerging tools like polygenic risk scores and machine learning models offer promise but require careful validation and integration into practice [^115kMgUj] [^1113dY1w].

## Types of medical scoring systems

Medical scoring systems fall into **four broad categories**:

- **Diagnostic scores**: Aid disease identification (e.g. DIC score, Wilson disease scoring) [^114NFaAf] [^116GTmBp].
- **Prognostic scores**: Predict outcomes such as mortality or disease progression (e.g. SOFA, APACHE II, CURB-65) [^111oR41Y] [^1178FoFB] [^113TrRra].
- **Severity scores**: Quantify illness severity to guide care intensity (e.g. GCS, ISS, CAP severity scores) [^116ZJ4ZT] [^113zpvFR].
- **Risk stratification scores**: Categorize patients by risk to inform management (e.g. cardiovascular risk scores, diabetes risk models) [^111MREMC] [^117STXmt].

---

## Clinical applications

Scoring systems are integral to **clinical decision-making**:

- **Triage and resource allocation**: Rapidly identify high-risk patients needing intensive care (e.g. trauma scores, sepsis scores) [^116ZJ4ZT] [^115oRW6L].
- **Treatment selection**: Guide interventions (e.g. MASCC for febrile neutropenia, cardiovascular risk scores for statin therapy) [^113smG9L] [^111MREMC].
- **Monitoring and follow-up**: Track disease progression and response to therapy (e.g. SOFA, RA disease activity scores) [^111oR41Y] [^116jDVD7].
- **Research and quality improvement**: Standardize outcomes and enable benchmarking (e.g. ICU performance metrics, cancer prognostic models) [^1178FoFB] [^1144k7tm].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite their utility, scoring systems have **important limitations**:

- **Population mismatch**: Models derived in one population may perform poorly in others (e.g. PRS, cardiovascular risk scores) [^112Di81v] [^113p9QFv].
- **Calibration drift**: Risk estimates may diverge over time or across settings, requiring recalibration [^111MREMC] [^112ATjHi].
- **Bias and generalizability**: Underrepresentation of certain groups can limit fairness and accuracy [^112Di81v] [^117XS4Ag].
- **Clinical judgment**: Scores should augment, not replace, clinician judgment [^1174Pji7] [^1144k7tm].

---

## Emerging trends and innovations

Recent advances include **polygenic risk scores (PRS)** — genetic tools that refine risk prediction for conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes — and **machine learning models** that leverage large datasets to improve accuracy and personalization [^115kMgUj] [^1113dY1w]. Efforts also focus on integrating multiple scores and biomarkers into **composite models** and on developing **digital health tools** for real-time scoring and decision support [^114hokoW] [^112yUCVR].

---

## Best practices for implementation

Effective use of scoring systems requires **careful selection** — choosing tools validated for the specific clinical context and population — and **regular recalibration** to maintain accuracy and relevance [^111MREMC] [^112ATjHi]. Clinicians should be trained in proper application and interpretation, and systems should be integrated into clinical workflows to support decision-making without replacing judgment [^1174Pji7] [^111SWU61].

---

Medical scoring systems are **valuable tools** that standardize assessment and guide care, but they must be validated, recalibrated, and applied thoughtfully to ensure accuracy, fairness, and clinical utility.

## References

### Severity scoring systems for pneumonia: current understanding and next steps [^113TrRra]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To describe the current understanding and clinical applicability of severity scoring systems in pneumonia management.

Recent Findings

Severity scores in community-acquired pneumonia are strong markers of mortality, but are not necessarily clinical decision-aid tools. The use of severity scores to support outpatient care in low-risk patients has moderate-to-strong evidence available in the literature, mainly for the pneumonia severity index, and must be applied together with clinical judgment. It is not clear that severity scores are helpful to guide empiric antibiotic treatment. The inclusion of biomarkers and performance status might improve the predictive performance of the well known severity scores in community-acquired pneumonia. We should improve our methods for score evaluation and move toward the development of decision-aid tools.

Summary

The application of the available evidence favors the use of severity scoring systems to improve the delivery of care for pneumonia patients. The incorporation of new methodologies and the formulation of different questions other than mortality prediction might help the further development of severity scoring systems, and enhance their support to the clinical decision-making process for the pneumonia-management cascade.

### Using clinical risk models to predict outcomes: what are we predicting and why? [^1174Pji7]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical risk prediction models can support decision making in emergency medicine, but directing intervention towards high-risk patients may involve a flawed assumption. This concepts paper examines prognostic clinical risk prediction and specifically describes the potential impact of treatment effects in model development studies. Treatment effects may lead to models failing to achieve the aim of identifying the patients most likely to benefit from intervention, and may instead identify patients who are unlikely to benefit from intervention. The paper provides practical advice to help clinicians who wish to use clinical prediction scores to assist clinical judgement rather than dictate clinical decision making.

### Evaluating multivariate risk scores for clinical decision making [^111SWU61]. Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The medical literature abounds with risk scores that can help clinicians predict the probability of disease. Risk scores are popular and attractive because they synthesize the effects of several different risk factors for disease in a way that is otherwise too complex for the human mind alone to analyze. However, to optimize clinical decision making, users of risk scores need to consider the factors and methods used to create the score and to recognize the potential limitations of risk scores. Clinicians should consider the patient populations in which the risk score has been developed and validated, the risk factors included in the score, how computing the score might fit into the flow of daily practice, and how risk scores can help estimate pretest probability. An awareness of the uses and potential limitations of using risk assessment tools will aid the clinician in daily clinical decision making. These tools may grow in importance and use with increasing utilization of electronic health records.

### The clinical application of polygenic risk scores: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^115kMgUj]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ACMG points to consider for clinical application of polygenic risk score (PRS) state that PRS test results do not provide a diagnosis, instead they provide a statistical prediction of increased clinical risk, and that a low PRS does not rule out significant risk for the disease or condition in question. If the risk prediction of a PRS is derived from a population that is different from the patient being tested, then the results may have a poor predictive value for the patient, and isolated PRS testing is not the appropriate test for clinical scenarios in which monogenic etiology is known or suspected. Before testing, a patient and provider should discuss the indications for the PRS test, and the patient should be informed how the PRS results will be used to guide medical management. PRS-based medical management should be evidence-based; however, there is currently limited evidence to support the use of PRS to guide medical management, and clinical follow-up for PRS should be consistent with best practices outlined by professional societies with appropriate expertise in instances when and where evidence-based practice guidelines exist. The ACMG's position is that preimplantation PRS testing is not yet appropriate for clinical use and should not be offered at this time.

### The clinical application of polygenic risk scores: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^116uTZNy]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) interpretation — low scores and absolute risk is summarized as follows: A low PRS does not rule out significant risk for the disease or condition in question. PRS outputs usually reflect relative ranking rather than absolute lifetime risk, because PRS results are typically given in the unit of the effect size and can be converted to a score between the first to 99th percentiles; a low percentile score reflects lower predicted risk versus a reference population and does not typically report the absolute lifetime risk. Potential sources of unidentified risk and methodological limitations also constrain PRS, absolute risk from the original genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or reference population is not always available, and area under the curve may not be as high as lifestyle-based prediction models, although some studies have shown PRS may be at least comparable or stronger risk predictors than traditional tools.

### Clinical review: scoring systems in the critically ill [^114hokoW]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

General illness severity scores are widely used in the ICU to predict outcome, characterize disease severity and degree of organ dysfunction, and assess resource use. In this article we review the most commonly used scoring systems in each of these three groups. We examine the history of the development of the initial major systems in each group, discuss the construction of subsequent versions, and, when available, provide recent comparative data regarding their performance. Importantly, the different types of scores should be seen as complementary, rather than competitive and mutually exclusive. It is possible that their combined use could provide a more accurate indication of disease severity and prognosis. All these scoring systems will need to be updated with time as ICU populations change and new diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic techniques become available.

### Predicting outcome after multiple trauma: which scoring system? [^116ZJ4ZT]. Injury (2004). Low credibility.

We have undertaken a review of the commonly used scoring systems to identify advantages and possible pitfalls involved in their use. Currently, there is a variety of systems available for scoring trauma severity. Some of them are based on the anatomical description of the injuries, whilst others are based on physiological parameters. The most widely used systems for the purpose of predicting outcome after trauma are based on combined anatomical and physiological parameters. Systems such as the Injury Severity Score (ISS) and the Trauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS) have served some useful purposes and have proved popular over time, but it now seems that there is no ideal scoring system available. The task of incorporating various factors such as pre-existing morbidity, age, immunological differences and different genetic predispositions has made the prospect of creating a universally acceptable and applicable trauma-scoring system extremely arduous, if not impossible. Therefore caution should be exercised when using any of the existing scoring systems until an ideal one becomes available.

### The SOFA score-development, utility and challenges of accurate assessment in clinical trials [^112Zp8up]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this review, we propose solutions and pragmatic approaches to calculating the SOFA score which have the potential to improve the reliability of assessments and mitigate some of the sources of heterogeneity that could prove important in new applications of the score. Training of study teams in the measurement of the SOFA score and application of study guidance is an important part of this process and should be considered in all studies including the SOFA score as an inclusion criteria or end point. The evidence base available to determine the guidance presented here is limited, and study authors should consider this before defining the approaches they will take to assessment of the SOFA score. Balancing the requirement for robust and consistent calculation with the introduction of unvalidated approaches and the inadvertent development of a new scoring system is an important challenge for clinical triallists to address.

### Risk estimation for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: considerations for appropriate risk prediction model selection [^111MREMC]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

In conclusion, there are various national, regional, and global risk scores available for cardiovascular disease risk estimation, but they differ in derivation methodology, included risk predictors, endpoints predicted, and derivation and target populations. To identify an appropriate cardiovascular disease risk score with good predictive ability, including discrimination and calibration, health professionals and policy makers need to compare and select risk scores based on the needs of cardiovascular disease prevention as well as the practicality of use in their local population. In the vast majority of cases, regular recalibration of the risk score is needed to ensure that the estimated risks reflect those in the target population, and this can be completed using aggregate-level data. The use of a cardiovascular disease risk score that includes recalibration as an integral process is advantageous.

Search strategy and selection criteria

To inform this Review, we searched PubMed, Embase, Google, and Google Scholar to identify existing risk prediction models for cardiovascular disease in the context of primary prevention recommended by global, regional, and subregional guidelines published in English, from database inceptions to January, 2024, using relevant terms, such as "cardiovascular disease", "risk score", "risk equation", "risk algorithm", and "risk prediction". The intention was not to provide an exhaustive review of all published cardiovascular disease risk scores, but to give a contemporary description of several selected scores, which are recommended by prominent clinical guidelines for primary cardiovascular disease prevention, while also exemplifying key issues relating to risk score development, application and valuation, and selection for use in the given target population.

### Clinical genetic counseling and translation considerations for polygenic scores in personalized risk assessments: a practice resource from the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^1115maHn]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2023). High credibility.

Polygenic scores heritability considerations note that the usefulness of PGS in predicting outcomes is bounded by heritability, which quantifies the extent to which phenotypic variation in the condition or trait is explained by genetic factors and is defined at the population level. Polygenic risk estimates may be less informative for conditions or traits with relatively low heritability, for rare conditions, and/or when there are strong nongenetic modifiers for the phenotype of interest, and as such, PGS has typically been studied in conditions with a high degree of heritability such as diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, kidney disease, and various psychiatric conditions. The decision of using standalone PGS vs. integrated risk estimates is driven by the current understanding and models of a particular condition, and successful implementation of PGS will require clear consensus about when and how to integrate all forms of risk information.

### Risk models and scores for type 2 diabetes: systematic review [^117STXmt]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective To evaluate current risk models and scores for type 2 diabetes and inform selection and implementation of these in practice.

Design Systematic review using standard (quantitative) and realist (mainly qualitative) methodology.

Inclusion criteria Papers in any language describing the development or external validation, or both, of models and scores to predict the risk of an adult developing type 2 diabetes.

Data sources Medline, PreMedline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched. Included studies were citation tracked in Google Scholar to identify follow-on studies of usability or impact.

Data extraction Data were extracted on statistical properties of models, details of internal or external validation, and use of risk scores beyond the studies that developed them. Quantitative data were tabulated to compare model components and statistical properties. Qualitative data were analysed thematically to identify mechanisms by which use of the risk model or score might improve patient outcomes.

Results 8864 titles were scanned, 115 full text papers considered, and 43 papers included in the final sample. These described the prospective development or validation, or both, of 145 risk prediction models and scores, 94 of which were studied in detail here. They had been tested on 6.88 million participants followed for up to 28 years. Heterogeneity of primary studies precluded meta-analysis. Some but not all risk models or scores had robust statistical properties (for example, good discrimination and calibration) and had been externally validated on a different population. Genetic markers added nothing to models over clinical and sociodemographic factors. Most authors described their score as "simple" or "easily implemented", although few were specific about the intended users and under what circumstances. Ten mechanisms were identified by which measuring diabetes risk might improve outcomes. Follow-on studies that applied a risk score as part of an intervention aimed at reducing actual risk in people were sparse.

Conclusion Much work has been done to develop diabetes risk models and scores, but most are rarely used because they require tests not routinely available or they were developed without a specific user or clear use in mind. Encouragingly, recent research has begun to tackle usability and the impact of diabetes risk scores. Two promising areas for further research are interventions that prompt lay people to check their own diabetes risk and use of risk scores on population datasets to identify high risk "hotspots" for targeted public health interventions.

### Risk estimation for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: considerations for appropriate risk prediction model selection [^112ATjHi]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Previous reviews of cardiovascular disease risk scores have outlined criteria for clinically useful risk estimation models and many have summarised the numerous scores that have been developed, with some providing quantitative evaluations and others discussing limitations and advantages. Nevertheless, an update is warranted as cardiovascular epidemiology is rapidly evolving and novel risk model development continues. Furthermore, few reviews have explicitly considered whether potential risk scores have specifically and systematically ensured adequate calibration of the score for the contemporary target population, as well as making provision for recalibration approaches to allow continual updates in the future. Therefore, this Review presents a guiding framework on factors to be taken into consideration by health professionals and policy makers when selecting a cardiovascular disease risk model for implementation in clinical practice, including crucially the ability to recalibrate, and provides an up-to-date overview of the main guideline-recommended cardiovascular disease risk scores from global, regional, and national contexts, and summarises their qualities.

### Clinical genetic counseling and translation considerations for polygenic scores in personalized risk assessments: a practice resource from the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^114QmAG8]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2023). High credibility.

Polygenic scores (PGS) clinical applications and scope include that PGS are best-considered screening tools rather than diagnostic tools, and as a screening tool, PGS can be used either as a standalone risk estimate or as one component in an integrated risk model. Reported uses include stratifying populations for screening programs based on the predicted risk of a condition, refining risk for individuals undergoing genetic testing for a monogenic disorder, guiding therapeutic interventions, facilitating diagnosis, and screening newborns to identify individuals at high risk. Screening tools are used to predict the possibility of a condition in the future to inform preventive care for asymptomatic individuals or those with subclinical disease. This practice resource uses PGS as broadly inclusive of both PRS that predict disease as well as PGS that predict traits/biomarkers, and unless otherwise stated, this practice resource focuses on the first scenario of risk stratification of populations, for which there is the most evidence supporting translation.

### Prognostic scoring systems: which one is best? [^113zpvFR]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the initial evaluation of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, a number of important assessments are made, including that of the severity of the illness. This assessment will determine the appropriate site of care, diagnostic work-up, and choice of empiric antibiotics. A number of severity assessment tools have been developed and some of the recent findings are reviewed.

Recent Findings

A number of studies of the efficacy of the individual scoring systems, as well as comparator studies, have been undertaken. A significant number of patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Pneumonia Severity Index classes I and II are admitted to hospital and several of these patients suffer complications. Clinical and social factors other than those contained in the scoring systems need to be taken into consideration when deciding about hospitalization of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. A number of studies of the efficacy of the various scoring systems in predicting 'severe pneumonia' have been undertaken, as well as studies of their accuracy in the sub-set of patients with pneumococcal infections and in the elderly.

Summary

The various scoring systems have reasonable sensitivity and specificity and their own strengths and weaknesses, but should always be used in association with good clinical judgment.

### Clinical genetic counseling and translation considerations for polygenic scores in personalized risk assessments: a practice resource from the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^117XS4Ag]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2023). High credibility.

Section summary — ordering and evaluating polygenic scores (PGS): The decision of whether to order a PGS and which PGS is most appropriate depends on the clinical context and lab offerings. The application and generalizability of a PGS to clinical populations may be limited by the methodological approach used in its creation. Larger and more ancestrally diverse GWAS data sets may improve PGS validity and utility over time. A thorough assessment of PGS performance should compare the PGS model to established risk models for the condition and in clinical contexts be assessed by how well a PGS model performs above currently accepted clinical risk factors or a gold standard screening test. Risk prediction models should be continually updated with new knowledge of polygenic and other risk factors.

### Prognostic models [^117HaB18]. Practical Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

An appreciation of prognosis is essential for effective clinical practice, in neurology as in other fields. Predicting risk of a poor outcome in individuals, or at least in well-defined groups of individuals, is necessary to properly inform patients about what the future holds for them, and the likely benefits of treatment. Despite the various pitfalls in the derivation and validation of prognostic models (or scores), there are an increasing number of useful models available to help patients and clinicians in routine neurology practice. This article considers how such models are best derived, and how their reliability should be assessed, drawing on examples from various different neurological disorders.

### How to define severity: a review of allergic reaction severity scoring systems [^113AiKiL]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Numerous scoring systems have been developed to improve and standardize the diagnosis and management of acute allergic reactions and anaphylaxis; however, considerable variability exists among these systems. This review article discusses existing severity scoring systems and identifies specific knowledge gaps that remain. Future research is needed to resolve the limitations of existing grading systems, including attempting to link reaction severity with treatment advice and conducting validation studies in different clinical settings, patient populations, and geographies to promote grading system application and dissemination in both clinical care and research.

### Risk models and scores for type 2 diabetes: systematic review [^1136Jx9j]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of the review

The strengths of this review are our use of mixed methodology, orientation to patient relevant outcomes, extraction and double checking of data by five researchers, and inclusion of a citation track to identify recently published studies and studies of impact. We applied both standard systematic review methods (to undertake a systematic and comprehensive search, translate all non-English texts, and extract and analyse quantitative data) and realist methods (to consider the relation between the components of the risk score, the context in which it was intended to be used, and the mechanism by which it might improve outcomes for patients).

The main limitation of this review is that data techniques and presentation in the primary studies varied so much that it was problematic to determine reasonable numerators and denominators for many of the calculations. This required us to make pragmatic decisions to collate and present data as fairly and robustly as possible while also seeking to make sense of the vast array of available risk scores to the general medical reader. We recognise that the final judgment on which risk scores are, in reality, easy to use will lie with the end user in any particular setting. Secondly, authors of some of the primary studies included in this review were developing a local tool for local use and made few or no claims that their score should be generalised elsewhere. Yet, the pioneers of early well known risk scoreshave occasionally found their score being applied to other populations (perhaps ethnically and demographically different from the original validation cohort), their selection of risk factors being altered to fit the available categories in other datasets, and their models being recalibrated to provide better goodness of fit. All this revision and recalibration to produce "new" scores makes the systematic review of such scores at best an inexact science.

Why did we not recommend a "best" risk score?

We have deliberately not selected a single, preferred diabetes risk score. There is no universal ideal risk score, as the utility of any score depends not merely on its statistical properties but also on its context of use, which will also determine which types of data are available to be included. Even when a risk model has excellent discrimination (and especially when it does not) the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity plays out differently depending on context. Box 3 provides some questions to ask when selecting a diabetes risk score.

### Should we Be using the poisoning severity score? [^113uv2yL]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite the existence of a number of severity-of-illness classifications for other areas of medicine, toxicology research lacks a well-accepted method for assessing the severity of poisoning. The Poisoning Severity Score (PSS) was developed in the 1990s in Europe as a scoring system for poisonings reported to a poison center in order to describe a patient's most severe symptomatology. We reviewed the literature to describe how the PSS is utilized and describe its limitations.

Discussion

We searched the medical literature in all languages using PUBMED, EMBASE, and SCOPUS from inception through August 2013 using predefined search terms. Out of 204 eligible publications, 40 met our criteria for inclusion in this review. There has been a paucity of published studies from North America that used the PSS. In some cases, the PSS was misapplied or modified from standard scoring, making a bottom line appraisal of the validity or reliability of the original version of the instrument challenging. The PSS has several subjective criteria, is time consuming to score, and is likely to be of little use with some types of poisonings, limiting its clinical utility.

Conclusion

The PSS was developed as a tool to document encounters with poisoned patients. However, it is used infrequently and, when applied, has been misused or modified from its original form. In its current form, it has limited clinical utility and likely cannot be broadly applied to many exposures due to their unique clinical circumstances. With better global collaboration among medical toxicologists, it is possible that a modified score could be developed for use clinically or as a research instrument.

### The SOFA score-development, utility and challenges of accurate assessment in clinical trials [^114t8rLh]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The SOFA score has become integrated into a range of aspects of critical care since its development in the early 1990s, and it is now widely employed in the daily monitoring of acute morbidity in critical care units. The SOFA score was designed to provide population level insights into the acute morbidity of ICU patients; however, its application has broadened substantially in recent years. Following the development of new definitions, it is now used as a key criterion in the diagnosis of the sepsis syndrome on an individual patient level. It is also increasingly used to determine the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in phase II trials, a development that follows acceptance by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and others of organ dysfunction scores as an endpoint in exploratory trials for sepsis.

This review describes the development of the score and the challenges associated with robust and reproducible calculation and proposes guidance for its assessment in clinical trials, where inconsistency in SOFA score measurement could introduce substantial variability in key outcomes.

### Clinical genetic counseling and translation considerations for polygenic scores in personalized risk assessments: a practice resource from the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^117AmHDc]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2023). High credibility.

Applications requiring special consideration — polygenic scores (PGS) with monogenic testing: In the familial setting, a PGS can be used both to inform a portion of inherited risk that is not explained by monogenic testing and as a modifier of monogenic risk; the inclusion of PGS information in complex risk prediction models that also consider genetic and nongenetic factors is currently limited to a few conditions, and genetic counseling in this setting requires discussion of monogenic inheritance and the overall level of risk calculated from inclusion of PGS and additional risk factors; presently, it is not possible to provide a concise PGS estimate based on close relatives' PGS results.

### A systematic review of predictor composition, outcomes, risk of bias, and validation of COVID-19 prognostic scores [^116Mpdus]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a state of emergency in health systems across the globe. Hospitals were overcrowded with patients and decisions for their management had to be made quickly. At the same time resource constraints limit the treatment of all patients with adequate therapies. Even in 2023, when the pandemic transitioned into an endemic state, the dynamically evolving variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) still cause severe disease in individuals, regardless of immunity, vaccines, and therapeutic interventions, especially when they are of elevated age or have comorbidities.

Especially during the first wave of the pandemic, scientists and clinicians rushed their efforts to support decision making, often trying to define thresholds of defined symptoms or scores. Such clinical prognostic scores are derived from models that estimate an individual's probability for a particular condition by combining and weighting predictive factors, mainly in an easy-to-apply manner (eg, additive point systems). Compared to a more complex, information-intense, and accurate (statistical) outcome prediction model, a score is a clinical decision support tool that facilitates fast applicability and unambiguous communication. Clinicians use such scores as "prediction rules" daily to reduce severe outcomes by modifying therapeutic considerations according to given risks. Although clinical judgments remain irreplaceable, a score's validity, reliability, and trustworthiness depend on the quality criteria applied during development and adequate validation. Scores can be developed for different scenarios (eg, predicting in-hospital mortality after admission or hospitalization at diagnosis), making their application relevant in different settings.

PRS-based medical management — polygenic risk score (PRS)-based medical management should be evidence-based, and there is currently limited evidence to support the use of PRSs to guide medical management; extrapolating from established non-PRS risk management may be prudent in some scenarios and may not be in others, and until robust outcome research is available clinicians using PRS should make efforts to standardize their management approach and, when possible, contribute to efforts that analyze clinical outcomes of prospective PRS-based management, noting that currently there are no clinical guidelines available for the use of PRS.

### The SOFA score-development, utility and challenges of accurate assessment in clinical trials [^111jPam9]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment or SOFA score was developed to assess the acute morbidity of critical illness at a population level and has been widely validated as a tool for this purpose across a range of healthcare settings and environments.

In recent years, the SOFA score has become extensively used in a range of other applications. A change in the SOFA score of 2 or more is now a defining characteristic of the sepsis syndrome, and the European Medicines Agency has accepted that a change in the SOFA score is an acceptable surrogate marker of efficacy in exploratory trials of novel therapeutic agents in sepsis. The requirement to detect modest serial changes in a patients' SOFA score therefore means that increased clarity on how the score should be assessed in different circumstances is required.

This review explores the development of the SOFA score, its applications and the challenges associated with measurement. In addition, it proposes guidance designed to facilitate the consistent and valid assessment of the score in multicentre sepsis trials involving novel therapeutic agents or interventions.

Conclusion

The SOFA score is an increasingly important tool in defining both the clinical condition of the individual patient and the response to therapies in the context of clinical trials. Standardisation between different assessors in widespread centres is key to detecting response to treatment if the SOFA score is to be used as an outcome in sepsis clinical trials.

### Clinical genetic counseling and translation considerations for polygenic scores in personalized risk assessments: a practice resource from the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^1171znbd]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2023). High credibility.

Polygenic score (PGS) model performance — area under the curve (AUC), discrimination, calibration, uncertainty, thresholds, and reclassification are described, noting that the AUC ranges from 0 to 1, 0.5 is equivalent to chance, and many PGS models to date have had AUC values in the range of 0.6–0.7. Discrimination measures how well a model separates individuals at higher versus lower risk but does not capture the accuracy of risk predictions, so calibration is also important; unless discrimination and calibration are investigated before a model is implemented in clinical practice, risk predictions may be inaccurate. Any prediction model has uncertainty in individual risk estimates, and there has been limited investigation of individual-level uncertainty in polygenic risk score (PRS) models to date. For absolute risk models, a primary goal is to classify an individual's risk as above or below a threshold for clinical action; although this is an active area of research, risk management guidelines do not presently account for PGS-based risk stratification and existing cutoffs are being used to inform a threshold for clinical action. Reclassification summarizes how many individuals move above versus below a prespecified clinical threshold if a new model including a PGS is used instead of an existing model, and the threshold is based on the condition and the benefits and risks of the clinical action under consideration.

Polygenic score (PGS) development and validation for clinical use — Ordering providers should have a basic understanding of PGS test development and downstream testing restrictions in order to support appropriate test utilization, and there are no best practices or standards for developing a PGS, such that PGS for the same condition are often not the same. Regulatory requirements for genetic tests to make it to market often require demonstrated analytic and clinical validity, and for PGS and integrated PGS risk models analytic and clinical validity may be restricted to the model parameters used during development. From genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to PGS, the basic steps are to (1) conduct a GWAS to identify variants in a training/source data set, (2) select disease-associated variants that meet prespecified thresholds and combine these to create a PGS, and (3) validate the PGS using an independent dataset; GWAS evaluates associations using "common" variants with "common" population prevalence (≥ 1% frequency in a population).

### The clinical application of polygenic risk scores: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^112Di81v]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) applicability across populations and sex — population mismatch can degrade predictive value, and current evidence for sex-specific PRS is limited. If the risk prediction of a PRS is derived from a population that is different from the patient being tested, then the results may have a poor predictive value for the patient. PRS models are based on the specific population studied in the relevant genome-wide association studies (GWAS) cohort, and most GWAS have been performed primarily using populations of European descent, which leads to decreased predictive accuracy of PRS in other populations owing, in part, to differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and allele frequencies; prediction capacity should ideally be optimized for all ancestries, with methods such as admixture and LD adjustments being developed to improve applicability and promote health equity. The document also notes that most GWAS do not include sex-specific data and that there is currently not enough evidence for sex-specific PRS, although some studies have found sex-dependent differences in certain conditions.

### Laboratory perspectives in the development of polygenic risk scores for disease: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^115yNa2G]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ACMG — Testing in the context of Mendelian conditions: If the PRS is being used within a joint prediction model for Mendelian disease risk, there are additional challenges in validating the use of these combined tests. The target populations for testing differ, as Mendelian testing is usually done in high-risk populations with significant family history and challenges exist with testing of healthy populations and should be given careful consideration keeping in mind the potential benefits and risks. The risk information conveyed by each test type differs; Mendelian variant curation frameworks rely on an understanding of disease mechanisms, PRS describes a statistical association, and high-risk does not indicate an underlying disease pathology, and PRS is solely considered screening information. There is no clear guidance on how these different types of risk information can be accurately combined or related to one another. The predicted phenotype of a PRS may not be appropriate for Mendelian diseases. When designing reports including both monogenic high-penetrance variants and PRS in a joint model, the potential effect on medical management must be considered, and many thresholds for prophylactic action or screening recommendations are dependent on lifetime or absolute risk of disease, which are traditionally dependent on well-established risks conferred by Mendelian conditions.

### Scoring systems for risk stratification in patients undergoing cardiac surgery [^114aHRQt]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiac surgery is associated with significant mortality rates. Careful selection of surgical candidates is, therefore, vital to optimize morbidity and mortality outcomes. Risk scores can be used to inform this decision-making process. The European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation Score and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score are among the most commonly used risk scores. There are many other scoring systems in existence; however, no perfect scoring system exists, therefore, additional research is needed as clinicians strive toward a more idealized risk stratification model. The purpose of this review is to discuss the advantages and limitations of some of the most commonly used risk stratification systems and use this to determine what an ideal scoring system might look like. This includes not only the generalizability of available scores but also their ease of use and predictive power.

### Laboratory perspectives in the development of polygenic risk scores for disease: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^112MN8Mb]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) polygenic risk scores — clinical validity (CV) versus clinical utility (CU) are distinguished as follows: A PRS with demonstrated CV cannot be assumed to have CU, and CV parameters are established through PRS development and validation procedures with reporting steps described in the ClinGen Polygenic Risk Score Reporting Standard and validation possible for stand-alone use or in an integrated risk model. CV is a precursor to CU but should not be conflated as utility; CV describes the context in which a PRS reliably predicts a disease or trait phenotype (for example, population characteristics or timeframe such as 10-year risk vs lifetime risk), and improved prediction does not guarantee increased health benefits, so other evidence is needed to demonstrate CU. Studies establishing CU must show health benefits via an intervention using PRS-based risk information, typically through randomized control trials or pragmatic clinical trials in which the clinical relevance of risk thresholds should be validated. CU depends on the health benefits of the associated intervention, and it is important to consider the availability of treatments when proposing new polygenic score–based applications of risk assessment.

### Composite rating scales [^112DmAtr]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Rating scales are instruments that are very frequently used by clinicians to perform patient assessments. Typically, rating scales grade the attribute on an ordinal level of measurement, i.e., a rank ordering, meaning that the numbers assigned to the different ranks (item scores) do not represent 'real numbers' or 'physical magnitudes'. Single-item scales have some advantages, such as simplicity and low respondent burden, but they may also suffer from disadvantages, such as ambiguous score meanings and low responsiveness. Multi-item scales, in contrast, seem more adequate for assessment of complex constructs, allowing for detailed evaluation. Total scores representing the value of the construct may be quite precise and thus the responsiveness of the scale may be high. The most common strategy for obtaining the total score is the sum of the item scores, a strategy that constitutes one of the most important problems with these types of scales. A summative score of ordinal figures is not a 'real magnitude' and may have little sense. This paper is a review of the theoretical frameworks of the main theories used to develop rating scales (Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory). Bearing in mind that no alternative is perfect, additional research in this field and judicious decisions are called for.

### A systematic review of predictor composition, outcomes, risk of bias, and validation of COVID-19 prognostic scores [^113tVGV1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous prognostic scores have been published to support risk stratification for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods

We performed a systematic review to identify the scores for confirmed or clinically assumed COVID-19 cases. An in-depth assessment and risk of bias (ROB) analysis (Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool [PROBAST]) was conducted for scores fulfilling predefined criteria ([I] area under the curve [AUC)] ≥ 0.75; [II] a separate validation cohort present; [III] training data from a multicenter setting [≥ 2 centers] [IV] point-scale scoring system).

Results

Out of 1522 studies extracted from MEDLINE/Web of Science (20/02/2023), we identified 242 scores for COVID-19 outcome prognosis (mortality 109, severity 116, hospitalization 14, long-term sequelae 3). Most scores were developed using retrospective (75.2%) or single-center (57.1%) cohorts. Predictor analysis revealed the primary use of laboratory data and sociodemographic information in mortality and severity scores. Forty-nine scores were included in the in-depth analysis. The results indicated heterogeneous quality and predictor selection, with only five scores featuring low ROB. Among those, based on the number and heterogeneity of validation studies, only the 4C Mortality Score can be recommended for clinical application so far.

Conclusions

The application and translation of most existing COVID scores appear unreliable. Guided development and predictor selection would have improved the generalizability of the scores and may enhance pandemic preparedness in the future.

### Value and limitations of existing scores for the assessment of cardiovascular risk: a review for clinicians [^113p9QFv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the biggest causes of death worldwide. In most people, CVD is the product of a number of causal risk factors. Several seemingly modest risk factors may, in combination, result in a much higher risk than an impressively raised single factor. For this reason, risk estimation systems have been developed to assist clinicians to assess the effects of risk factor combinations in planning management strategies. In this article, the performances of the major risk estimation systems are reviewed. Most perform usably well in populations that are similar to the one used to derive the system, and in other populations if calibrated to allow for different CVD mortality rates and different risk factor distributions. The effect of adding "new" risk factors to age, sex, smoking, lipid status, and blood pressure is usually small, but may help to appropriately reclassify some of those patients who are close to a treatment threshold to a more correct "treat/do not treat" category. Risk estimation in the young and old needs more research. Quantification of the hoped-for benefits of the multiple risk estimation approach in terms of improved outcomes is still needed. But, it is likely that the widespread use of such an approach will help to address the issues of both undertreatment and overtreatment.

### Triage scoring systems, severity of illness measures, and mortality prediction models in pediatric trauma [^116fRGaE]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Trauma triage scores, severity of illness measures, and mortality prediction models quantitate severity of injury and stratify patients according to a specified outcome. Triage scoring systems are typically used to assist prehospital personnel determine which patients require trauma center care, but they are not recommended as the sole determinant of triage. Severity of illness measures and mortality prediction models are used in clinical and health services research for risk-adjusted outcomes analyses and institutional benchmarking. As clinicians and researchers, it is imperative that we be knowledgeable of the methodologies and applications of these scoring and risk prediction systems to ensure their quality and appropriate utilization.

### Monitoring severity of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome: new and progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, scoring systems [^115pSB35]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the diagnostic criteria of new and progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and scoring systems that might be used to assess and monitor the severity and progression of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in children presented as part of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development MODS Workshop (March 26–27, 2015).

Data Sources

Literature review, research data, and expert opinion.

Study Selection

Not applicable.

Data Extraction

Moderated by an experienced expert from the field, issues relevant to the monitoring of the severity of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome including new and progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and scoring systems were presented, discussed, and debated with a focus on identifying knowledge gaps and research priorities.

Data Synthesis

Summary of presentations and discussion supported and supplemented by relevant literature.

Conclusions

Many sets of diagnostic criteria of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome are presently available. All are useful, but their diagnostic and predictive value can be improved. Several types of diagnostic criteria are candidates to describe the severity and to monitor the progression of cases of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, which include existing scores of organ dysfunction: Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction, version 2, daily Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction, version 2, organ failure-free days, etc. If a new set of diagnostic criteria of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is created, its value must be validated. Furthermore, the epidemiology of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome based on these new diagnostic criteria must be compared with the epidemiology found with the preexisting sets of diagnostic criteria. The reliability as well as the added values of additional or new candidate markers of organ dysfunction and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome severity must be studied and compared.

### The clinical application of polygenic risk scores: a points to consider statement of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^112KDSZA]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

General considerations for a health care provider when interpreting PRS emphasize that even the individual with a high disease-risk prediction by PRS may never develop the disease in question, because the PRS percentile result represents the individual's ranking of odds ratio of the lifetime disease risk in a chosen population, and similarly, individuals with low PRS predicted risk can develop the disease. PRS-related clinical risk should be understood both within an individual-specific clinical context (eg, the individual's age, medical and family history, and other clinical data) as well as within an understanding of the limitations of the test, and healthy lifestyle could play a protective role in developing a certain condition, even for individuals with high PRS results. The performance of the PRS model should be validated on a comparable test population independent from the population in which the model was generated, PRS results only deliver a risk prediction for the trait, disorder, or disease for which the specific model was generated, and monogenic etiologies for the trait, disorder, or disease addressed by the PRS are not evaluated through PRS calculations (eg, breast cancer PRS does not assess for monogenic BRCA1-associated breast cancer risk). However, PRS has been shown to be associated with a modified clinical risk level for features of monogenic conditions (eg, age of disease onset).

### Application of a population-based severity scoring system to individual patients results in frequent misclassification [^115ubL3B]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Key messages

- 	There are typically errors in execution of a complex scoring scheme such as APACHE II.

- 	These errors do not have a significant effect when applied to patient populations of a sufficient size.

- 	If a cut-off APACHE II score in the middle range of critically ill patients is used for making decisions about individual patients, an error rate that may be considered acceptable for use with sufficiently large patient populations will produce a very high rate of misclassification in those individuals so classified.

### Risk prediction tools for cancer in primary care [^116kAHF3]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

A risk prediction model aims to predict the probability or risk of a condition or event among individuals, or occasionally groups, based on a combination of known or measured characteristics. Risk prediction tools are the means by which risk prediction models, scores or algorithms are implemented in clinical practice. Numerous risk tools are now available, which predict either current or future risk of a cancer diagnosis. In theory, these tools have the potential to improve patient outcomes through enhancing the consistency and quality of clinical decision-making, facilitating equitable and cost-effective distribution of finite resources and encouraging behaviour change. These potential uses have been recognised by the National Cancer Institute as an 'area of extraordinary opportunity' and an increasing number of risk prediction models continue to be developed. In the near future, risk prediction models are also likely to incorporate genomic data and could contribute to the translation of precision or personalised medicine and precision screening into clinical practice. However, there remains uncertainty about the clinical utility of risk tools and how to implement them to maximise benefits and minimise harms such as over-medicalisation, anxiety and false reassurance. In this study we provide an overview of the types of risk prediction models that exist, their potential uses, the existing evidence around their use, the challenges to implementation and the key issues for future research (see Box 1).

ACC Appropriate Use Criteria — rating process outlines that ratings are analyzed for median and dispersion, followed by a mandatory face-to-face meeting; during this meeting each panelist votes anonymously, indications are discussed using a "round robin" format, and after the meeting panelists independently rescore all indications. Once ratings are completed, each indication is placed in a discrete category — Appropriate Care, May Be Appropriate Care, or Rarely Appropriate Care — and each round is reviewed for wide dispersion of scores, whether rewording would better clarify the scenario, and misalignment with evidence and/or CPGs. Under most circumstances, 2 rating sessions are all that will be required and no more than 4 rating cycles will be permitted, with the median score for the final session defining the final indication rating. Online tools support the process, including live online rating sessions that collect indication ratings, notes to the writing group, and personal notes to capture preliminary ratings immediately after discussion; when second ratings are collected via online survey the preliminary votes and notes are shared, and any additional rounds are performed through a live online survey during an interactive educational conference.

### The urgent need for a harmonized severity scoring system for acute allergic reactions [^117FxTBc]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

The accurate assessment and communication of the severity of acute allergic reactions are important to patients, clinicians, researchers, the food industry, and public health and regulatory authorities. Severity has different meanings to different stakeholders with patients and clinicians rating the significance of particular symptoms very differently. Many severity scoring systems have been generated, most focusing on the severity of reactions following exposure to a limited group of allergens. They are heterogeneous in format, none has used an accepted developmental approach, and none has been validated. Their wide range of outcome formats has led to difficulties with interpretation and application. Therefore, there is a persisting need for an appropriately developed and validated severity scoring system for allergic reactions that work across the range of allergenic triggers and address the needs of different stakeholder groups. We propose a novel approach to develop and then validate a harmonized scoring system for acute allergic reactions, based on a data-driven method that is informed by clinical and patient experience and other stakeholders' perspectives. We envisage two formats: (i) a numerical score giving a continuum from mild to severe reactions that are clinically meaningful and are useful for allergy healthcare professionals and researchers, and (ii) a three-grade-based ordinal format that is simple enough to be used and understood by other professionals and patients. Testing of reliability and validity of the new approach in a range of settings and populations will allow eventual implementation of a standardized scoring system in clinical studies and routine practice.

### Trustworthy or flawed clinical prediction rule? [^117Peufv]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

We read with interest the recently published paper by Hilder et al. where the authors present the PRESET-Score, a new clinical prediction rule for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). While the topic is clinically relevant and interesting, we are worried that spurious findings, biased results, and overstated findings are presented.

First, both the new and the four existing scores assessed are at high risk of being underpowered. Multivariable risk prediction models should be based on an effective sample size (lowest number of events/non-events) of at least 10, often more, per predictor variable assessed. Using 11 variables and 41 non-events (3.7 per predictor) results in overfitting of the development sample and inflated performance estimates. This will be evident upon use of the score in other populations.

Second, comparing the performance of the new score with four existing scores using the development dataset is against recommendations, as this is biased to favor the new score due to overfitting. For comparison with other scores, an independent cohort not used to develop any of the scores must be used.

Third, internal validation is performed to quantify overfitting, and should be done by bootstrap resampling of the development dataset. The authors state that they used logistic regression analysis to "reassess" the score, which essentially is a recalibration resulting in a new model generating new predictions. This is neither internal nor external validation, which requires assessment of predictions made by the score without modifications in a new sample.

Fourth, it is recommended to assess calibration by graphical methods or regressions of the predicted versus observed outcomes, not by the Hosmer-Lemeshow Ĉ -test, as P > 0.05 is more likely to indicate lack of power than proper model fit when used on small samples.

While we agree that clinical prediction rules may be valuable for clinicians considering ECMO, it is a prerequisite that such scores are developed and validated using appropriate methodology and sufficient sample sizes, and that all relevant features are transparently reported with adequate discussion of the limitations. Developing and sufficiently validating a clinical prediction rule for this highly selected patient group likely requires a large, multicentre collaboration to ensure trustworthy predictions that will benefit patients and relatives, the healthcare system, researchers, and society.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for palliative care in patients with cancer, more specifically with respect to prognostic assessment, ESMO 2023 guidelines recommend to use the following in patients with advanced cancer no longer receiving disease-modifying treatment and a prognosis of months to weeks:

- use the Palliative Performance Scale or other measures of performance status to differentiate between patients with varying survival prospects

- consider using validated prognostic models, such as Palliative Prognostic Score, Prognosis in Palliative Care Study-B, or Feliu Prognostic Nomogram, to calculate individualized levels of risk

- consider using other prognostic tools in certain circumstances, such as when expert clinician predictions of survival is not available, when scores can be calculated using routinely available data, or for research purposes

- consider deciding on the choice of prognostic model based on the type of prognostic estimate desired, such as how long or how likely, the availability of required data, such as blood test results, and the timeframe being predicted

- avoid using individualized risk prediction models in isolation unaccompanied by clinician judgment of prognosis, and ensure that models are not used by patients without guidance from an oncology or palliative care clinician.

ACC appropriate use criteria (AUC) methodology — appropriate use categories define three rating bands by median score for clinical scenarios: Appropriate Care (Median Score 7 to 9) described as an appropriate option with benefits generally outweighing risks and generally acceptable/reasonable; May Be Appropriate Care (Median Score 4 to 6) described as at times an appropriate option with variable evidence or agreement and with effectiveness for individual care determined by a patient's physician in consultation with the patient; and Rarely Appropriate Care (Median Score 1 to 3) described as rarely an appropriate option due to lack of a clear benefit/risk advantage and not generally acceptable or reasonable except with documented clinical reasons.

### Establishing mild, moderate, and severe scores for cancer-related symptoms: how consistent and clinically meaningful are interference-based severity cut-points? [^113WXkzK]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2008). Low credibility.

Methods are presented to separate 16 frequently occurring cancer symptoms measured on 10-point symptom severity rating scales into mild, moderate, and severe categories that are clinically interpretable and significant for use in oncology practice settings. At their initial intervention contact, 588 solid tumor cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy reported severity on a standard 11-point rating scale for 16 symptoms. All reporting a one or higher were asked to rate on an 11-point scale how much the symptom interfered with enjoyment of life, relationship with others, general daily activities, and emotions. Factor analysis revealed that these items tapped into the same dimension, and the items were summed to form an interference scale. Cut-points for mild, moderate, and severe categories of symptom severity were defined by comparing the differences in interference scores corresponding to each successive increases in severity for each symptom. The cut-points differed among symptoms. Pain, fatigue, weakness, cough, difficulty remembering, and depression had lower cut-points for each category compared to other symptoms. Cut-points for each symptom were not related to site or stage of cancer, age, or gender but were associated with a global depression measure. Cut-points were related to limitations in physical function, suggesting differences in the quality of patients' lives. The resulting cut-points summarize severity ratings into clinically significant and useful categories that clinicians can use to assess symptoms in their practices.

### The SOFA score-development, utility and challenges of accurate assessment in clinical trials [^115oRW6L]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Defining sepsis

Defining the syndrome of sepsis has proven challenging since the initial consensus definitions were developed in the early 1990s. The definitions of sepsis and septic shock were based on expert consensus. In 2016, a novel approach saw a data-driven redefinition as:

'Life threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection'.

The team demonstrated that SOFA score was a better discriminant than the traditional SIRS and similarly effective to the more complex Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS). Organ dysfunction was therefore characterised by a change in SOFA score of two or more points as a consequence of infection, which conferred an associated mortality of approximately 10%. By using a change in SOFA score, the authors recognised that whilst SOFA score can often be considered zero in previously healthy patients, the presence of chronic organ dysfunction precludes the use of an absolute value to define the presence of infection. This transition from observing to defining a syndrome has significant relevance for clinicians and researchers in critical care.

### Personalized medicine and access to health care: potential for inequitable access? [^112xC3t9]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Case study: breast cancer risk prediction models

Breast cancer genetic risk assessment models are clinical tools that calculate a patients' individual risk for developing cancer or harboring a cancer predisposing genetic mutation. These tools seek to identify patients likely to benefit from increased cancer surveillance, prophylactic treatments, and other cancer risk reducing interventions. In existence for nearly 20 years, the models are based on cancer prevalence in particular populations. By mapping individual factors from the patient such as family history of cancer, age, etc. into the models, a patients' individual cancer risk can be expressed numerically. Countries worldwide have established particular risk thresholds required before a patient is eligible for additional screening, or cancer risk reduction measures. As a result, patient stratification regarding access to health care occurs through the use of their genetic information.

On the surface, use of breast cancer genetic risk prediction models to select patients for additional health care should not raise concerns for equitable access. Indeed, they are tools that have the purpose of improving the delivery health care. Strong medical, legal, ethical, and economic arguments exist favoring their use to maintain or improve equitable access to health care. From a medical perspective, decisions based on the best available scientific evidence is part of evidence-based medicine, a widely adopted practice in health-care systems worldwide. Hence, the use of risk assessment scores to select patients for additional care is consistent with evidence-based medicine.

Use of risk assessment scores to prioritize patients can be justified from a legal perspective in the context of a publically funded health-care system. For example, in Canada, the Canada Health Act, specifies the conditions for public funding of health care stipulating that universal public funding is provided for services that are deemed 'medically necessary for the purpose of maintaining health, preventing disease or diagnosing or treating an injury, illness or disability'. Thus use of cancer risk assessment scores as a medical tool to identify those patients in need of further medical intervention is consistent with the legislated purpose of the public health insurance program to provide funding for medically necessary care.

Use of risk assessment scores can also be justified from ethical perspectives. Indeed, selecting only patients likely to benefit from additional interventions spares those unlikely to benefit from the burden of additional medical treatment, consistent with the principle of non-malfeasance. In publically funded health-care systems, limiting access to additional screening and testing by establishing thresholds through the use of risk assessment represents a fair distribution of limited resources, by prescribing additional treatment only to those in need.

### Current endoscopic scoring systems in inflammatory bowel disease: strengths and limitations [^117THdvH]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several available endoscopic scoring systems that are designed to assess disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease. The most widely known is the Mayo endoscopic subscore for ulcerative colitis. These schemas are not routinely used in clinical practice, largely due to their complexity or lack of granularity, although they are standard for outcomes measurement in large clinical trials. While some schemas have been validated using independent cohorts, there is high inherent interobserver variation. Furthermore, derivation of these scoring systems has been subject to selection bias and limited challenge bias.

### Severity scoring in the critically ill: part 1 – interpretation and accuracy of outcome prediction scoring systems [^1178FoFB]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

This review examines the use of scoring systems to assess ICU performance. APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation), MPM (mortality probability model), and SAPS (simplified acute physiology score) are the three major ICU scoring systems in use today. Central to all three is the use of physiologic data for severity adjustment. Differences in the size, nature, and time horizon of the data set translate into minor differences in accuracy and difficulty of data abstraction. APACHE IV provides ICU and hospital predictions for mortality and length of stay, whereas MPM and SAPS only provide hospital mortality predictions (although new algorithms generated from MPM data elements may predict ICU length of stay adequately). The primary use of scoring systems is for assessing ICU performance, with the ratio of actual-to-predicted outcomes in the study cohort providing performance comparisons to the reference ICUs. The reliability of scoring system predictions depends on the completeness and accuracy of the abstracted data; accordingly, ICUs must implement robust data quality control processes. CIs of the ratios are inversely related to sample size, and care must be taken to avoid overinterpreting changes in outcomes. ICU structural and process issues also can affect scoring system performance measures. Despite good discrimination and calibration, scoring systems are used in only 10% to 15% of US ICUs. Without ICU performance data, there is little hope of improving quality and reducing costs. Current demands for transparency and computerization of documentation are likely to drive future use of ICU scoring systems.

### The SOFA score-development, utility and challenges of accurate assessment in clinical trials [^111oR41Y]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The development of the SOFA score

The SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score was developed following a consensus meeting in 1994, the stated aim of which was to create a score 'to describe quantitively and as objectively as possible the degree of organ dysfunction/failure over time in groups of patients or even individual patients'. The score was designed to describe a sequence of complications of critical illness and not to predict outcome, although the authors acknowledged that any functional morbidity score must also be associated with mortality. Initially described as the sepsis-related organ failure assessment, the utility of the score for the assessment of acute morbidity in a range of critical illnesses was recognised early and the title changed.

SOFA was based on six different scores, one for each of the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal and neurological systems each scored from 0 to 4 with an increasing score reflecting worsening organ dysfunction. The development team showed retrospectively that the score detected differences in severity of illness and proposed its use as an alternative to other assessments of multiple organ dysfunction that had been developed in the early 1990s.

Following its initial validation, prospective analysis of the score's utility was undertaken in 16 countries. The study showed that some sub-scores and also the total score were associated with survival. Moreno et al. studied the impact of maximum SOFA score in the same population and showed that there was a good correlation between increasing score and mortality. The score performed well as a discriminator of survival status at ICU discharge. In addition to studying the maximum SOFA score, the change in score, or delta SOFA (total maximum SOFA score minus admission total SOFA score) also demonstrated a strong correlation with ICU mortality.

Further prospective evaluations in differing settings have validated the SOFA score, its maximum value during ICU stay and also change in SOFA over time as valid tools for the assessment of morbidity in critical illness, and the score has become a common feature of observational study reporting.

Guidance statements — evidence basis and process indicate that, unlike recommendations in CGC clinical guidelines, guidance in guidance statements is not derived from a de novo systematic evidence review specifically done for or by ACP and hence the CGC does not use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence or strength of recommendations; guidance is based on evaluating recommendations and evidence in selected and most highly rated clinical guidelines, but the CGC does not simply adopt recommendations from those with the highest AGREE II scores, instead assessing the evidence base and independently assessing benefits, harms, costs, and patient values and preferences; CGC public members and the Public Panel provide input through discussion, review, and comments, and the final result is adoption or adaptation of existing high-quality clinical guidelines; guidance statements are typically not suitable for the development of performance measures.

### The art of cardiovascular risk assessment [^116uCCqJ]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Healthcare expenditures have been principally allocated toward treatment of CVD at the end of the health/disease continuum, rather than toward health promotion and disease prevention. A focused effort on both primordial and primary prevention can promote cardiovascular health and reduce the burden of CVD. Risk-factor assessment for predicting atherosclerotic CVD events serves as the foundation of preventive cardiology and has been driven by population-based scoring algorithms based on traditional risk factors. Incorporating individual nontraditional risk factors, biomarkers, and selective use of noninvasive measures may help identify more at-risk patients as well as truly low-risk individuals, allowing for better targeting of treatment intensity. Using a combination of validated population-based atherosclerotic CVD risk-assessment tools, nontraditional risk factors, social health determinants, and novel markers of atherosclerotic disease, we should be able to improve our ability to assess CVD risk. Through scientific evidence, clinical judgment, and discussion between the patient and clinician, we can implement an effective evidence-based strategy to assess and reduce CVD risk.

### Clinical scoring systems in cystic fibrosis [^114mNgjH]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2006). Low credibility.

The first cystic fibrosis (CF) scoring system was published in 1958. Since then, many other scoring systems were developed. Clinical parameters, details about statistical evaluations, and recent strategic uses of scores were identified. Several similar scores aiming to assess chronic illness severity (Shwachman-Kulczycki score and a modification, Cooperman, Berneze-score and the NIH score) have not been evaluated and are out of date, given the changing natural history of CF. Of the current scoring systems, the modified Shwachman score by Doershuk is perhaps most reliable for describing follow-up studies. Scores designed for acute changes and short-term evaluation were also developed. The modified Huang score may be useful in the prognostic evaluation of patients with end-stage disease. It could also be used for discrimination of adult patients with differing disease severity and for longitudinal evaluation. Scores assessing pulmonary exacerbations could help provide consensus among clinicians regarding the need for intervention. Most of these scores require further evaluation. Although scores could provide an objective measure of disease severity, progression, need for and response to interventions, including value in selecting patients for lung transplantation and as an outcome measure for research studies, no scoring system can fulfill all these objectives. Nevertheless, there is a need for the development of a modern day longitudinal score that is sensitive, valid and reproducible, to reflect the milder disease status of patients.

Figure 1
Relational schema of existing trauma scoring systems. Boxes indicate a subset of standard trauma scoring systems reviewed here. Text outlines individual factors used to compute trauma score. Example: To compute AIS, injury severity is ranked by anatomic region. The computation of ISS is based on AIS assignment of each anatomic region. TRISS methodology incorporates ISS and RTS to predict probability of survival.

Despite evidence that certain trauma scoring systems may not be appropriate for resource-limited settings, those commonly found in HICs may also be used in LMICs because they remain the most well established and accepted for trauma management. Yet, the extent to which each scoring system is used in LMICs around the world remains unknown. Understanding which and how trauma scoring systems are used is the first step in determining which score(s) may be optimal in these settings. The optimal trauma score for any setting will strike the appropriate balance between accuracy in quantifying injury severity and feasibility in implementation. The objective of this review was to identify scores that have been used in LMICs to classify injury severity and assess their appropriateness, feasibility, and application in QI efforts in these settings.

Study risk of bias assessment

Item 11. Specify the methods used to assess risk of bias in the included studies, including details of the tool(s) used, how many reviewers assessed each study and whether they worked independently, and, if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process

Explanation: Users of reviews need to know the risk of bias in the included studies to appropriately interpret the evidence. Numerous tools have been developed to assess study limitations for various designs. However, many tools have been criticised because of their content (which may extend beyond assessing study limitations that have the potential to bias findings) and the way in which the items are combined (such as scales where items are combined to yield a numerical score) (see box 4). Reporting details of the selected tool enables readers to assess whether the tool focuses solely on items that have the potential to bias findings. Reporting details of how studies were assessed (such as by one or two authors) allows readers to assess the potential for errors in the assessments. Reporting how risk of bias assessments were incorporated into the analysis is addressed in Items #13e and #13f.

### Risk prediction tools for cancer in primary care [^1132xDy6]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Following in the footsteps of cardiovascular risk scores, numerous tools are now being made available in primary care to estimate, communicate and monitor risk of current undiagnosed and future incident cancer. The data on predictive utility (discrimination and calibration) of these models suggest that some have potential for clinical application. However, the focus on implementation and impact is much more recent, with considerable uncertainty about their clinical utility and how best to implement them in primary care, in order to maximise benefits and minimise harms. To ensure we make the most of this 'area of extraordinary opportunity', future research therefore needs to focus on the following: wider validation of the underlying risk models; assessment of the utility, including patient and professional acceptability, of incorporating them into risk tools in practice; impact studies addressing whether their use affects behaviour of either patients or practitioners; and studies modelling the population level impact and economic implications of widespread use.

Selecting the daily value

The value for each sub-score that represents the most severe (worst) value for the respective 24-h period for each parameter was used in initial validation and subsequent clinical studies using the SOFA score.

Proposal 1

SOFA score should be undertaken prior to the start of any intervention or admission and for each subsequent 24-h period. At each assessment, the worst (most severe) value for the 24-h period of each SOFA sub-score is selected.

Proposal 2

If data points arise in more than one score for a subcategory, the higher SOFA sub-score criteria is selected.

### Comparison of alternate scoring of variables on the performance of the frailty index [^116bLtvm]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The frailty index provides a useful way to quantify the accumulation of relatively small health deficits across multiple physiological systems, and to identify and grade a state of overall vulnerability to outcomes. Based on our analysis of three diverse datasets we found that, if enough variables are included, dichotomizing variables or using them in ordinal form appears to have little impact on three important properties of the frailty index: the mean score, gender differences, and the ability to predict mortality.

Clinical prediction models help inform health care professionals, patients, and their families about the risks of disease or a future outcome and guide decision-making aimed at mitigating these risks. In this article, we review the principles of clinical prediction model development and validation, including predictor selection, model performance measures, internal validation, translation of a model to a scoring rule for clinical application, and external validation. We illustrate each principle using a published example of a prediction model developed to predict the presence of invasive bacterial infection in well-appearing febrile infants aged no more than 60 days presenting to emergency departments.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease that can present at various stages of disease activity and severity. Traditionally, severity scoring has focused on disease activity during a single moment with various tools, including patient-reported symptoms, as well as clinical, laboratory-based, endoscopic, histologic, and imaging variables. Optimal delivery of care depends on the accurate assessment of disease severity, which must take longitudinal variables into account. This article reviews the history of severity scoring in UC and provides a concise, clinically oriented approach to assessing disease severity.

### Health-related quality of life scores and values as predictors of mortality: a scoping review [^116sX6zm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

HRQoL was found to be an indicator of mortality risk in the general population and most clinical sub-populations, independent of the generic instrument employed. However, no studies investigated the relationship between HRQoL and people living with diagnosed mental disorders. This is an important gap, as rates of poor physical health and mortality are much higher in people with mental disorders, especially those with severe mental illness, compared to the general population. In the clinical context, HRQoL assessment may be useful for screening and/or monitoring purposes to understand how people perceive their health and well-being and as an indicator of mortality risk, encouraging better-quality and timely patient care to support and maximize what may be a patient's only modifiable outcome.

### New cardiovascular risk assessment techniques for primary prevention: JACC review topic of the week [^115AvqnK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Risk factor-based models fail to accurately estimate risk in select populations, in particular younger individuals. A sizable number of people are also classified as being at intermediate risk, for whom the optimal preventive strategy could be more precise. Several personalized risk prediction tools, including coronary artery calcium scoring, polygenic risk scores, and metabolic risk scores may be able to improve risk assessment, pending supportive outcome data from clinical trials. Other tools may well emerge in the near future. A multidimensional approach to risk prediction holds the promise of precise risk prediction. This could allow for targeted prevention minimizing unnecessary costs and risks while maximizing benefits. High-risk individuals could also be identified early in life, creating opportunities to arrest the development of nascent coronary atherosclerosis and prevent future clinical events.

### Predictive models for clinical decision making: deep dives in practical machine learning [^1113dY1w]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Example workflow for training, testing and validating prediction models.

With all these questions surrounding the validation of machine learning algorithms, it is tempting to let domain experts decide what provides clinically actionable insight. Algorithms are agnostic until they are given domain knowledge to represent and reason. We argue that such knowledge could be presented to the learning algorithms in both correct and incorrect ways, and that this, in turn, dictates what the algorithms could provide in terms of optimal performance. As clinicians often invoke risk scores by which patients are binned into groups that need immediate attention, monitoring etc. such at‐risk labelling entails binning. For a clinician, a risk score value is not a simplification as much as it is an aid to attend to the patient correctly, not least because it may be part of a standardised clinical workup routine or treatment guidelines. However, dichotomisation means discarding potentially important information and, as we will see, it can make an algorithm learn in a suboptimal manner. The prediction capacity of the clinician is incredibly high because of the rapid and efficient adaptation to context and pragmatics of care. In contrast, computers deal with procedural (algorithmic) and declarative (logical) representations, caring little for pragmatics. A concrete example of a complex disease and its treatment will illustrate how and why this is important.

Deep dive I: Precision psychiatry

Psychology and AI have a long history, with the trends indicated in Fig. 3. Human decision‐makers often dichotomise continuous values into discrete risk scores. An example is the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) for major depressive disorder (MDD). In earlier work, based on patient self‐reporting, we showed how machine learning may help assess which MDD patients in Internet‐based treatment should receive extra attention from therapists. This is relevant to precision medicine because it allows for a move from stepped care to adaptive care by providing dynamic decision support to psychologists. We have previously shown by statistical reasoning without machine learning that empirically derived clinician preferences for actionable predictions were obtained from relatively simple and limited data (in the form of weekly reports), albeit fairly late, almost halfway through the 12‐week treatment for MDD. If predictions of who might fail to benefit from the programme could successfully be made earlier, say at the end of week 3, interventions could also follow before the patient loses interest in, or the ability needed for, remaining active on the treatment platform.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment – from individual risk prediction to estimation of global risk and change in risk in the population [^115aXwoF]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death and risk prediction formulae such as the Framingham Risk Score have been developed to easily identify patients at high risk that may require therapeutic interventions.

Discussion

Using cardiovascular risk formulae at a population level to estimate and compare average cardiovascular risk among groups has been recently proposed as a way to facilitate surveillance of net cardiovascular risk and target public health interventions. Risk prediction formulas may help to compare interventions that cause effects of different magnitudes and directions in several cardiovascular risk factors, because these formulas assess the net change in risk using easily obtainable clinical variables. Because of conflicting data estimates of the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease, risk prediction formulae may be a useful tool to estimate such risk at a population level.

Summary

Although risk prediction formulae were intended on guiding clinicians to individualized therapy, they also can be used to ascertain trends at a population-level, particularly in situations where changes in different cardiovascular risk factors over time have different magnitudes and directions. The efficacy of interventions that are proposed to reduce cardiovascular risk impacting more than one risk factor can be well assessed by these means.

### Symptom assessment in cancer patients [^115hiDre]. Current Oncology Reports (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with cancer suffer from a multitude of symptoms. Effective treatment strategies are available for a number of the common symptoms. A major reason for inadequate symptom relief is lack of effective symptom assessment. Accurate assessment of symptoms is necessary before any treatment can be undertaken. Although there are many complexities involved in the assessment of symptoms, simple, effective tools are available for identification and scoring of symptoms in clinical practice. This review describes recent advances in the study of symptom assessment in cancer patients. Several common symptoms are presented individually, followed by an overview of efforts addressing the assessment of multiple symptoms. Also, new tools in the evaluation of symptoms, including computer-based questionnaires, are discussed.

### A systematic review of scoring systems for diabetic foot ulcers [^116kiqD6]. Diabetic Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

Foot ulcers are a common and important complication of diabetes. Variation in the clinical presentation of this disease has resulted in a paucity of evidence from comparable studies to guide optimal clinical management. A validated scoring system might help clinicians and researchers in everyday assessment and management of patients or the development and assessment of new therapies. The aim of the present review was to critically appraise the published literature of wound scoring systems for diabetic foot ulcers.

Methods

An electronic search was performed using the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases from 1966 until 2009 for scoring systems for diabetic foot ulcers. The literature review conformed to PRISMA statement standards.

Results

The literature search identified 197 articles, of which 180 were excluded. Eleven scoring systems and six validation or comparative studies are described.

Conclusions

Many scoring systems exist for classification of the diabetic foot, few of which have been validated. Detailed scoring systems offer a valuable method for the comparison of data from different diabetic foot centres. Simplistic scoring systems may be used in clinical practice and the choice of scoring system should be determined by the population under study.

### Assessment of health-related quality of life [^111t1TKQ]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

In addition to mortality, morbidity, and patient satisfaction, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an outcome of health care as well as a consequence of illness or injury. Consequently, instruments to assess HRQOL have become important outcome measures for the evaluation of health care. The last 2 decades have seen the development of hundreds of HRQOL instruments, which are increasingly being incorporated in clinical trials. However, for HRQOL instruments to be valid outcome measures, a variety of factors must be addressed, including conceptual and methodological issues. In addition, there must be careful selection and thoughtful administration. The present report discusses these issues in addition to the scoring and interpretation considerations for the valid assessment of HRQOL. We provide an overview of generic, disease-specific, and utility measures. Using disease-specific instruments pertinent to respiratory care, we discuss their validity, reliability, responsiveness, and minimum clinically important difference. We conclude with recommendations regarding which HRQOL tools have documented evidence that they are psychometrically sound for application to research and clinical practice in respiratory care.

### Injury scoring systems for blast injuries: a narrative review [^1131Hqn5]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Injury scoring systems can be used for triaging, predicting morbidity and mortality, and prognosis in mass casualty incidents. Recent conflicts and civilian incidents have highlighted the unique nature of blast injuries, exposing deficiencies in current scoring systems. Here, we classify and describe deficiencies with current systems used for blast injury. Although current scoring systems highlight survival trends for populations, there are several major limitations. The reliable prediction of mortality on an individual basis is inaccurate. Other limitations include the saturation effect (where scoring systems are unable to discriminate between high injury score individuals), the effect of the overall injury burden, lack of precision in discriminating between mechanisms of injury, and a lack of data underpinning scoring system coefficients. Other factors influence outcomes, including the level of healthcare and the delay between injury and presentation. We recommend that a new score incorporates the severity of injuries with the mechanism of blast injury. This may include refined or additional codes, severity scores, or both, being added to the Abbreviated Injury Scale for high-frequency, blast-specific injuries; weighting for body regions associated with a higher risk for death; and blast-specific trauma coefficients. Finally, the saturation effect (maximum value) should be removed, which would enable the classification of more severe constellations of injury. An early accurate assessment of blast injury may improve management of mass casualty incidents.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pain, more specifically with respect to assessment scales, EUSEM 2020 guidelines recommend to use the NRS scale rating the severity of pain from 0–10 (no pain to worst pain possible) where the scores suggest accordingly:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|0–3|- Mild pain|
|4–6|- Moderate pain|

### Endorsement of definitions of disease activity States and improvement scores for the ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score: results from OMERACT 10 [^115HpJrr]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

The Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) is a new composite index to assess disease activity in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Criteria for disease activity states and improvement scores are important for use in clinical practice, observational studies, and clinical trials, and have been proposed by the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS). At OMERACT 10, our aim was to obtain endorsement from OMERACT for the ASDAS disease activity states and response criteria proposed by the ASAS membership. This article summarizes the associated discussions, the scientific basis of the validation process, and the results from the voting sessions, and identifies areas for research using the ASDAS. OMERACT participants agreed with the selection of cutoff values, which now have the combined endorsement of ASAS and OMERACT and are ready to be used in clinical practice and in research settings.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^114rPaj5]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

2021 grading system characteristics for allergic reactions — An advantage of the 2021 grading system is that it allows grading of allergic reactions from mild to severe with or without requiring a definition of anaphylaxis. This system is clinically intuitive, but also quite nuanced, so it will likely require the use of decision support tools or memory aids to be most effective, and although derived from expert consensus of a 21-member multidisciplinary panel, the 2021 grading system still requires validation. Using a "Best-Worst Scaling" exercise, Stafford et al evaluated 10 severity grading systems, concluding that geographic location of the health care provider may affect severity assessment and that all scoring systems have limitations in discriminating anaphylaxis severity.

### Regulatory science challenge… [^1112p4hd]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Performer: Kaiser Foundation Research Institute Principal Investigator: Andrew J. Karter Project Duration: 9/22/14
- 3/31/17. Project Description In this project, a risk assessment mechanism to assist clinicians in predicting a patient's risk for SH was designed and tested. The Kaiser Foundation Research Institute developed a pragmatic risk-scoring tool that helps clinicians identify patients at highest risk of SH and guides shared decision-making. The scoring tool draws on an existing wealth of clinical data from electronic medical records from a large, integrated, health care delivery system. The tool was designed for use in the outpatient setting. It simply and efficiently provides quantitative estimates of hypoglycemic risk, which together with the patient's preferences and clinician knowledge, helps providers and patients weigh the risks of SH against reduction in long-term diabetes complications, reduces the incidence of SH events, and improves patient safety.

The risk-scoring tool is publicly available. Project Goals Improve diabetes patient safety for the more than 25 million Americans with diabetes:

- Construct a research database, populate the database, and validate risk scores.
- Develop the risk-scoring tool for use by clinicians to identify patients at high risk for SH.
- Prepare a manuscript to describe the project and the tool for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Project Results The final report from the researchers to the FDA included the following results:

- A model was developed using six inputs to define a patient risk for SH: 1) total number of prior episodes of hypoglycemia-related ED or hospital utilization; 2) number of ED encounters for any reason in the prior 12 months; 3) insulin use; 4) sulfonylurea use; 5) presence of severe or end-stage kidney disease; and 6) age younger than 77 years.
- This model was translated into a checklist, to allow clinicians to quickly assess risk.
- The model successfully differentiated between patients at high-risk for SH and low risk patients.
- The model was constructed based on ICD-9 codes.

### Association between licensing examination scores and resource use and quality of care in primary care practice… [^113MZjXH]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

skills by direct, structured observation of a candidate's performance in 24 to 26 clinical problems. 64 Clinical problems are presented by standardized patients and performance is assessed by physician examiners. Scores for each case are averaged to produce an overall OSCE score. Candidates fail the OSCE if their score is more than 2 SDs below the mean. Candidates who pass some but not all components of the 2 examinations are reviewed by the licensing examination board and decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. The subscores from the CFPCEx and the OSCE and an overall average score were retrieved for eligible physicians. There were 6 administrations of the licensing examination between 1991 and 1993. To adjust for potential differences in the difficulty of the examination, scores were standardized using the reference-group method.

67 A large homogeneous group of examinees is assumed to have similar ability over time and this group. was used as the reference standard. Reliability of scores was estimated in each year and summarized across years using a weighted intraclass correlation coefficient. 68 Standardized examination scores for each physician and their license number were sent to the RAMQ. Personal identifiers on the score file and health care databases were encrypted to. We calculated the difference in the number of outcomes that would be expected among patients seen by physicians with lowest scores if they experienced the same outcome rate as patients of physicians with the highest scores. A total of 810 family medicine residents took the licensing examination in 1991, 1992, or 1993, and 614 were eligible for inclusion. Among the ineligible. reference group varied from 74% to 80% in different administrations.

Thus, physicians who obtained the passing score of 50% for prevention would have a standardized score of –2. 8 to –3. 9 depending on the year in which they took the examination. Score reliability varied from 0. 27 to. would be prescribed symptom-relief medication and 2. 7 fewer elderly patients per 1000 would be prescribed potentially inappropriate medication. Higher management scores were not significantly associated with symptom-relief prescribing but were associated with higher relative rates of disease-specific to symptom-relief prescribing and lower rates of potentially inappropriate prescribing.

### The clinical risk score… [^111ufAfW]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

No patient with a CRS greater than 3 survived more than2 years. Conclusion This study validates the CRS, finding it to be highly predictive of patient outcome and survival. The database, hospital records, and pathology reports were used to extract the following data: demographics; pathologic features of the primary colorectal lesion, including nodal status; characteristics of liver metastases, including size, number of lesions, and disease-free interval; preoperative CEA level prior to hepatic resection; and outcome. Per the protocol outlined in the Fong et al30 article, a preoperative CRS was calculated for each patient.

One point was assigned for each of the following criteria, creating a minimum CRS of 0 and a maximum of 5: positive lymph node status of the primary colorectal lesion; disease-free interval from the diagnosis of the primary lesion to discovery of liver metastases less than 12 months; number of hepatic metastases greater than 1 on preoperative imaging; size of the largest hepatic metastases > 5 cm on preoperative imaging; and preoperative CEA level > 200 ng/mL. Statistics were performed using SPSS version 9.
0. All data are expressed as median values and ranges. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed and compared by the log-rank test. P values <. 05 were considered significant. Indeed, it appears possible to further stratify CRS into 0 and 1, 2 and 3, and 4 and 5. Five-year survival rates were CRS 0 and 1,
72. 5%; CRS 2 and 3, 31. 2%; and CRS 4 and 5,
0. 0%; 1-year survival rates were 93. 8%,
76. 6%, and 75.

0%, respectively. No patient with a CRS higher than 3 survived more than 2 years. For the purpose of validating the CRS as published, it was decided to include number of tumors greater than 1 and disease-free interval less than 12 months in the CRS, despite our finding them not to be prognostic. Similarly, we used the CEA level cutoff as described by Fong et al. 30 The current study found the CRS to be highly predictive of outcome.

### Validation of pSOFA scores and evaluation of sepsis-3 definitions in the pediatric emergency department… [^114ZxuWX]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

How does the pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score perform in predicting mortality in the emergency department setting. Findings In this large cohort study of nearly 4 million pediatric emergency department visits, pSOFA scores of 2 or more were uncommon but associated with increased hospital mortality. Conversely, children with pSOFA scores of less than 2 were at very low risk of death, with high specificity and negative predictive value. Exposures ED pSOFA score was assigned by summing maximum pSOFA organ dysfunction components during ED stay. In the subset with suspected infection, visit meeting criteria for sepsis and septic shock were identified.

We calculated pSOFA, as previously described, being the sum of 6 component organ system scores, each of which range from 0 to 4. 4–6 We adopted a previously. We considered any missing values to be normal, and assigned zero points for that category. 10, 12 We determined the maximal pSOFA score for each ED visit, using previously described methods, 10, 12 assigning each subscore the worst value present during the entirety of the ED visit. The sum of the subscores resulted in a pSOFA score. The primary outcome was all-cause, in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality rates in patients with suspected infection, sepsis, and septic shock.

In a pediatric ICU population, pSOFA had excellent discrimination for in-hospital mortality and it performed as well or better than other illness severity scores, such as pediatric logistic organ dysfunction, pediatric logistic organ dysfunction 2, and pediatric multiple organ dysfunction score. 12 Although these severity of illness scores are commonly used in the pediatric ICU, there have been few attempts to develop risk stratification scores in the pediatric ED. 17 The Pediatric Risk of Hospital Admission score was derived and validated to identify children at high risk of requiring hospital admission. 18 However, this score did not evaluate risk of severe long-term clinical outcomes, such as mortality.

### Resident evaluations, milestones, board certification scores… [^1143hQKf]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Adapted with permission from American College of Graduate Medical Education and American Board of Internal Medicine and, copyright 2012. aThe 2 scales represent different ordinal scales, and the new milestones scale uses more criterion-based ratings. A full unit change in the resident annual evaluation summary score is equivalent to a 0. 5 unit change on the milestone score. The RAES ratings were derived from a form that contained 9 items rated on a 1 to 9 scale without behavioral anchors. Residents could be rated on the full scale regardless of years of training.

A single item on moral and ethical behavior was rated as satisfactory or unsatisfactory. Subcompetency milestone ratings were on a 5-level rating scale with narrative descriptions for each item. Ratings of 1 or 1. 5 were interpreted as critical deficiencies. Ratings of 4 to 5 were interpreted as readiness for unsupervised practice. The milestone cutoff of 2. 5 captures concerning professional behavior within the narrative milestones language, such as behaviors that are demonstrated inconsistently or need reminders, assistance, and oversight. The milestone cutoff of 2. 0 captures behaviors defined as critical deficiencies. All differences in slopes were significant, adjusting for residents nested within programs.

The percentage of residency programs that demonstrated this pattern of a significantly steeper slope for milestone ratings than RAES ratings was 53. 4% of programs for all 6 competencies combined and
68. 3% to 81. 7% for individual competencies.
