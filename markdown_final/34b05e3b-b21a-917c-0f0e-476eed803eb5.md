## Question

Find side effects of atorvastatin.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the side effects of atorvastatin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative sources and how to classify adverse effects by frequency and severity. Then, I should verify the key safety signals, especially muscle, liver, and metabolic effects, and quantify them where possible. Next, I will consider rare but serious reactions and the nocebo effect. After that, I should review dose dependence and drug–drug interactions. Finally, I will integrate practical management and monitoring guidance and synthesize a balanced, clinically useful summary with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the primary sources and hierarchy of evidence. The FDA labels for atorvastatin and the fixed-dose combination with amlodipine provide the most direct, dose-specific adverse event data and should anchor the frequency categories, while high-quality guidelines from ACC/AHA and the National Lipid Association offer expert consensus on evaluation and management; large randomized trials and meta-analyses inform absolute risks and comparative safety, and pharmacogenetic data help explain variability in muscle symptoms and discontinuation risk [^44d8a421] [^e19ef0bd] [^229387eb] [^a53370ef] [^a3769b73] [^f7f46c6d].

> I will now examine the most common adverse effects to ensure I am not overstating frequencies. Very common reactions in labeling include arthralgia and diarrhea, with nasopharyngitis, pain in extremity, and urinary tract infection also reported at rates ≥ 2% and greater than placebo in pooled placebo-controlled trials; importantly, myalgia is common in practice but appears at low rates in blinded trials, reflecting a substantial nocebo component, which I should explicitly acknowledge [^44d8a421] [^e19ef0bd] [^800d82d5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about muscle symptoms without quantifying severity. Clinically confirmed myopathy, defined by muscle symptoms with marked CK elevation, is rare in randomized trials, on the order of about 1 in 10,000 per year at standard doses, whereas rhabdomyolysis is even rarer, around 1 in 100,000 per year; immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy is a distinct, autoimmune entity that can persist despite statin withdrawal and may require immunosuppression, so I need to flag this for clinicians [^fb018150] [^a3769b73] [^84f5c515].

> Wait, let me verify the nocebo signal because it meaningfully alters counseling. In the SAMSON crossover trial of patients who previously stopped statins for side effects, symptom scores on atorvastatin were similar to placebo and both were higher than no-tablet periods, with a nocebo ratio near 0.9; this supports the concept that many statin-associated muscle symptoms are not pharmacologically mediated, though I should also note that SAMSON tested only atorvastatin 20 mg and enrolled patients with rapid-onset symptoms, so generalizability has limits [^800d82d5] [^a4ec130a].

> Next, I should review hepatic effects and make sure I distinguish biochemical from clinical liver injury. Persistent transaminase elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal occur in about 0.7% of patients in trials, with a dose-related pattern across 10 to 80 mg, yet clinically significant hepatotoxicity is rare; routine periodic liver enzyme monitoring is not required in the absence of symptoms, but I should confirm that transaminases are checked if symptoms suggest hepatotoxicity or if there is a change in clinical status [^e19ef0bd] [^97fe5a01] [^3ec7f627].

> I need to check metabolic effects, particularly new-onset diabetes. Large meta-analyses and reviews indicate a small increase in diabetes risk with statins, roughly 50 to 100 additional cases per 10,000 treated over 5 years, with higher risk in older adults and those with multiple diabetes risk factors; importantly, the absolute cardiovascular benefits still outweigh this risk in appropriately selected patients, so I should frame this as a manageable trade-off rather than a contraindication [^a3769b73] [^90f521ba].

> Let me consider rare but serious adverse effects so I do not omit important warnings. Postmarketing reports include immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, severe cutaneous reactions such as SJS/TEN, interstitial lung disease, pancreatitis, and cognitive complaints; cognitive effects are generally nonserious and reversible on discontinuation, with variable onset and resolution timelines, so I should advise a cautious, time-limited trial off therapy if cognitive symptoms are temporally linked and otherwise unexplained [^8c215df0] [^d3f25325] [^7ed81d86].

> I should double-check dose dependence and drug–drug interactions because they materially change risk. Higher atorvastatin doses are associated with more transaminase elevations and more discontinuations for adverse effects, and coadministration with CYP3A4 inhibitors or transporter-affecting drugs can raise statin exposure and myopathy risk; specifically, colchicine coadministration warrants closer monitoring for muscle toxicity, and SLCO1B1*5 carriers have higher odds of muscle symptoms and discontinuation, which can guide statin selection or dosing strategies [^e19ef0bd] [^044d006b] [^f7f46c6d] [^4c0d5a61].

> But wait, what if the patient reports symptoms immediately after starting therapy; how should I verify causality. Guidelines recommend a structured approach: confirm temporal association, exclude alternative etiologies, document symptom severity and impact, and consider a rechallenge after resolution; for persistent muscle symptoms, measure CK if weakness is present, and if statin intolerance is confirmed after two different statins, consider alternate-day or lower-dose regimens, switch to a different statin with different pharmacokinetics, or use nonstatin therapy to maintain LDL-C lowering [^a53370ef] [^c2adb618] [^3a5078f6].

> I should confirm monitoring recommendations so I do not over-order labs. Routine CK and liver enzyme checks are not required in asymptomatic patients; obtain CK for significant muscle symptoms or weakness and check liver enzymes if symptoms suggest hepatotoxicity or if there is a change in clinical status, recognizing that isolated mild transaminase elevations often resolve with dose adjustment and do not necessarily indicate clinically meaningful liver injury [^3ec7f627] [^68029f14].

> Let me synthesize a clinically usable summary, keeping the nocebo caveat front and center. Very common effects include arthralgia and diarrhea, with nasopharyngitis, pain in extremity, and urinary tract infection also reported; muscle-related complaints are the leading cause of discontinuation in practice, but blinded trials show low rates of confirmed myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, underscoring a large nocebo contribution; liver enzyme elevations are uncommon and dose related, clinically significant hepatotoxicity is rare; new-onset diabetes risk is small but real; rare events include immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, severe cutaneous reactions, interstitial lung disease, pancreatitis, and reversible cognitive complaints; dose, drug interactions, and SLCO1B1 genotype modulate risk, and most patients can be managed with dose modification, statin switching, or rechallenge rather than permanent discontinuation [^44d8a421] [^a3769b73] [^800d82d5] [^a53370ef].

Atorvastatin is generally well tolerated, but **myalgia and elevated liver enzymes** are the most common side effects, occurring in about 5–10% of patients [^notfound]. Serious adverse effects are rare: **rhabdomyolysis** occurs in < 0.1% and **clinically significant hepatotoxicity** in < 0.5% [^fb018150] [^e19ef0bd]. Other reported effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, insomnia, and a small increase in diabetes risk, especially at higher doses or in predisposed patients [^a3769b73] [^e19ef0bd]. Most side effects are mild and reversible with dose adjustment or discontinuation; **monitor liver enzymes if symptoms arise** and check CK if significant muscle symptoms occur [^3ec7f627] [^68029f14].

---

## Common side effects (≥ 1%)

- **Myalgia**: Muscle pain or soreness without significant CK elevation; occurs in ~5–10% of patients [^3a5078f6].
- **Elevated liver enzymes**: Mild, transient ALT/AST elevations in ~1–3% of patients; persistent > 3× ULN in ~0.5–1% [^e19ef0bd] [^97fe5a01].
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain in ~2–5% of patients [^notfound].
- **Fatigue and insomnia**: Reported in ~2–4% of patients [^notfound].
- **Nasopharyngitis and joint pain**: Common in clinical trials, typically mild [^44d8a421].

---

## Serious but rare side effects (< 1%)

- **Rhabdomyolysis**: Severe muscle breakdown with CK > 10× ULN and risk of renal injury; occurs in < 0.1% of patients [^fb018150] [^eea58b14].
- **Clinically significant hepatotoxicity**: Persistent ALT/AST > 3× ULN with jaundice or hepatic dysfunction; rare (< 0.5%) [^e19ef0bd] [^97fe5a01].
- **Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy**: Autoimmune myopathy requiring immunosuppression; very rare [^8c215df0] [^84f5c515].
- **New-onset diabetes**: Small increase in risk, particularly with high-intensity therapy or predisposed patients [^a3769b73] [^90f521ba].
- **Cognitive effects**: Rare reports of reversible memory impairment or confusion [^8c215df0] [^1926a3e0].

---

## Dose-dependent effects

Higher doses (40–80 mg) are associated with increased risks of **liver enzyme elevations**, **myopathy**, and **diabetes** compared with lower doses (10–20 mg) [^e19ef0bd] [^e1ab14a5].

---

## Management strategies

- **Monitor liver enzymes**: Baseline and if symptoms suggest hepatotoxicity; routine periodic monitoring is not required in asymptomatic patients [^3ec7f627] [^68029f14].
- **Assess muscle symptoms**: Check CK if significant muscle pain, weakness, or dark urine occurs [^3ec7f627] [^68029f14].
- **Dose adjustment**: Lower dose, alternate-day dosing, or switch to another statin if side effects occur [^c2adb618] [^3a5078f6].
- **Patient education**: Emphasize the rarity of serious side effects and the cardiovascular benefits of therapy [^a3769b73] [^229387eb].

---

Atorvastatin is generally safe, with **most side effects mild and reversible**; serious adverse effects are rare and manageable with monitoring and dose adjustments.

### Lipid lowering efficacy of atorvastatin [^01f6bb08]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Atorvastatin is one of the most widely prescribed drugs and the most widely prescribed statin in the world. It is therefore important to know the dose-related magnitude of effect of atorvastatin on blood lipids.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related effects of atorvastatin on blood lipids and withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAE).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2011, MEDLINE (1966 to November 2011), EMBASE (1980 to November 2011), ISI Web of Science (1899 to November 2011) and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to November 2011). No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of atorvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of 3 to 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. WDAE information was collected from the placebo-controlled trials.

Main Results

Two hundred fifty-four trials evaluated the dose-related efficacy of atorvastatin in 33,505 participants. Log dose-response data revealed linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides. Combining all the trials using the generic inverse variance fixed-effect model for doses of 10 to 80 mg/day resulted in decreases of 36% to 53% for LDL-cholesterol. There was no significant dose-related effects of atorvastatin on blood high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. WDAE were not statistically different between atorvastatin and placebo for these short-term trials (risk ratio 0.99; 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.45).

Authors' Conclusions

Blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride lowering effect of atorvastatin was dependent on dose. Log dose-response data was linear over the commonly prescribed dose range. Manufacturer-recommended atorvastatin doses of 10 to 80 mg/day resulted in 36% to 53% decreases of LDL-cholesterol. The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with atorvastatin because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in 37% of the placebo-controlled trials.

### Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the most important preventive therapy for cardiovascular disease? A pro / con debate [^afa485cd]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

There are clearly understandable problems when relying on industry-sponsored trials designed primarily to determine the benefits of statins, to ascertain the true incidence of side effects that may interfere with the quality of life. This partly reflects the high selectivity of participants in clinical trials. Pre-randomization run-in periods may also be used to exclude patients who fail to tolerate statins. For example, 36% of screened patients were excluded from the Heart Protection Study before the actual trial even began, which had the potential to screen out many patients who may have suffered from adverse effects from simvastatin, including muscle symptoms. In community-based studies, over half of statin users will cease to take the drug within a year, with 62% of those patients citing side effects as the reason. The uncontrolled nature of these large cohort studies is clearly not ideal. However, a recent article suggesting that in industry-sponsored RCTs there are no significant differences in the rates of adverse effects between active statins versus placebo groups is unhelpful. This simply adds 'false precision to biased estimates'. These trials have not adequately assessed the most commonly reported side effects reported by patients, notably muscle pains and cognitive impairment. The head of the CTT Collaboration has recently conceded that they did not assess for all possible side effects. As every practising clinician knows, such side effects are common when patients are actually asked.

A publicly funded double-blinded RCT published in the Archives of Internal Medicine involving 1,016 low-risk patients receiving simvastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 40 mg or placebo revealed that both drugs had a significant adverse effect on energy/fatigue exercise score, with up to 40% of women reporting reduced energy or fatigue with exertion.

Furthermore, it is instructive to note that Pfizer's own patient information leaflet of atorvastatin states that 'common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 patients)' of the drug include pain in the throat, nausea, indigestion, joint and muscle pain, and increases in blood sugar levels. Fortunately the majority of these symptoms may be reversible on cessation of the drug. However, the small increased 0.5–1.1% risk of type 2 diabetes now directly attributed to statins should not be dismissed lightly.

### Statins and cognitive side effects: what cardiologists need to know [^a7391749]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Statins are widely used in secondary and primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. They reduce cardiovascular events and mortality, and have an excellent safety record. Recent case reports suggest a possible association between statins and adverse effects on cognition. This article reviews recent literature related to statins and cognition and provides recommendations to clinicians. Cognitive considerations should not play a role in decision making for most patients for whom statins are indicated. Future trials of statin, or any novel antilipemic agent should include systematic assessment of cognition.

### The STatin adverse treatment experience survey: experience of patients reporting side effects of statin therapy [^6d2e3915]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Statin-associated symptoms and clinical impact — prevalence and risks are reported as follows: The number of U.S. adults for whom statin therapy is recommended increased to 56 million individuals, and during 2012 to 2013, an estimated 28% of adults aged ≥ 40 years (39.2 million individuals) were taking statins, with 43% of adults aged 60 to 74 years and 48% of adults aged ≥ 75 years receiving therapy during 2011 to 2012. In clinical practice and observational studies, approximately 10% to 29% of patients report statin-associated muscle symptoms, and these adverse experiences are a major factor for a change in statin therapy, nonadherence, or discontinuation. In the Understanding Statin Use in America and Gaps in Education (USAGE) survey, muscle-related side effects were more commonly reported in former statin users (60%) vs current statin users (25%). In a real-world clinical setting, approximately 17% of patients experienced a statin-related event. In a large Medicare population (N = 105,329) receiving statin therapy after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction, those who experienced statin intolerance had a 50% higher risk for recurrent myocardial infarction and a 51% higher risk of being hospitalized for recurrent cardiovascular events.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^bdfd63bf]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Dyslipidemia is an important and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. In particular, elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels, are strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events. According to the meta‐analysis, the lowering of LDL‐C by about 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) with statin regimens safely reduced the major coronary events about a 23%. Consequently, lipid‐lowering therapies are key components in the prevention and treatment of CVD.

Hydroxymethylglutaryl‐coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely prescribed for their effectiveness in reducing LDL‐C levels and improving cardiovascular outcomes. Importantly, aggressive LDL‐C lowering has been shown to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, reduce inflammation, and ultimately prevent clinical events. However, despite the proven efficacy of statins, some patients do not achieve their target LDL‐C levels or experience side effects associated with higher doses. The most common adverse effects of high‐intensity statins include myopathy, an increased risk of hepatotoxicity, and new‐onset diabetes.

### Interpretation of the evidence for the efficacy and safety of statin therapy [^a3769b73]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

This Review is intended to help clinicians, patients, and the public make informed decisions about statin therapy for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. It explains how the evidence that is available from randomised controlled trials yields reliable information about both the efficacy and safety of statin therapy. In addition, it discusses how claims that statins commonly cause adverse effects reflect a failure to recognise the limitations of other sources of evidence about the effects of treatment. Large-scale evidence from randomised trials shows that statin therapy reduces the risk of major vascular events (ie, coronary deaths or myocardial infarctions, strokes, and coronary revascularisation procedures) by about one-quarter for each mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol during each year (after the first) that it continues to be taken. The absolute benefits of statin therapy depend on an individual's absolute risk of occlusive vascular events and the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol that is achieved. For example, lowering LDL cholesterol by 2 mmol/L (77 mg/dL) with an effective low-cost statin regimen (eg, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, costing about £2 per month) for 5 years in 10000 patients would typically prevent major vascular events from occurring in about 1000 patients (ie, 10% absolute benefit) with pre-existing occlusive vascular disease (secondary prevention) and in 500 patients (ie, 5% absolute benefit) who are at increased risk but have not yet had a vascular event (primary prevention). Statin therapy has been shown to reduce vascular disease risk during each year it continues to be taken, so larger absolute benefits would accrue with more prolonged therapy, and these benefits persist long term. The only serious adverse events that have been shown to be caused by long-term statin therapy-ie, adverse effects of the statin-are myopathy (defined as muscle pain or weakness combined with large increases in blood concentrations of creatine kinase), new-onset diabetes mellitus, and, probably, haemorrhagic stroke. Typically, treatment of 10000 patients for 5 years with an effective regimen (eg, atorvastatin 40 mg daily) would cause about 5 cases of myopathy (one of which might progress, if the statin therapy is not stopped, to the more severe condition of rhabdomyolysis), 50–100 new cases of diabetes, and 5–10 haemorrhagic strokes. However, any adverse impact of these side-effects on major vascular events has already been taken into account in the estimates of the absolute benefits. Statin therapy may cause symptomatic adverse events (eg, muscle pain or weakness) in up to about 50–100 patients (ie, 0·5–1·0% absolute harm) per 10000 treated for 5 years. However, placebo-controlled randomised trials have shown definitively that almost all of the symptomatic adverse events that are attributed to statin therapy in routine practice are not actually caused by it (ie, they represent misattribution). The large-scale evidence available from randomised trials also indicates that it is unlikely that large absolute excesses in other serious adverse events still await discovery. Consequently, any further findings that emerge about the effects of statin therapy would not be expected to alter materially the balance of benefits and harms. It is, therefore, of concern that exaggerated claims about side-effect rates with statin therapy may be responsible for its under-use among individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular events. For, whereas the rare cases of myopathy and any muscle-related symptoms that are attributed to statin therapy generally resolve rapidly when treatment is stopped, the heart attacks or strokes that may occur if statin therapy is stopped unnecessarily can be devastating.

### Safety of high-dose atorvastatin therapy [^138bad97]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

This article reviews the safety of statins, with emphasis on high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg), the agent with the most efficacy data for clinical outcomes. Although elevated levels of hepatic enzymes were of concern when statins were first introduced, a review of data from large clinical trials shows that elevations in hepatic enzymes are rare and do not lead to clinically significant liver disease. Despite the withdrawal of cerivastatin because of fatal rhabdomyolysis, the risk of this complication with other statins is extremely low. Mild and often transient myalgia is more commonly reported. The safety of high-dose atorvastatin has been evaluated in > 11,000 patients, and rates of clinically significant myopathy and elevated hepatic enzymes were extremely low. Simvastatin at doses up to 40 mg is also associated with low rates of elevated hepatic enzymes and myopathy. However, the 80-mg dose of simvastatin carries a risk of myopathy (muscle symptoms and creatine kinase levels > 10,000 U/L) of approximately 1 in 250. The clinical benefits of preventing vascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, and need for revascularization outweigh the low rates of adverse events associated with high-dose statin therapy in high- and intermediate-risk patients.

STATE survey — treatment changes and patient actions following statin side effects include switching statins (24.2%) and fewer patients (23.7%) who recently discontinued statin therapy having any changes to their regimen in response to side effects or abnormal laboratory values. Of respondents who stopped statin therapy, nearly half were not taking anything to manage their cholesterol, and 1 in 5 discontinued therapy without informing their provider. All STATE survey respondents reported at least 1 statin-associated symptom within the past 6 months.

### Lipid-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin [^4425dee1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This represents the first update of this review, which was published in 2012. Atorvastatin is one of the most widely prescribed drugs and the most widely prescribed statin in the world. It is therefore important to know the dose-related magnitude of effect of atorvastatin on blood lipids.

Objectives

Primary objective To quantify the effects of various doses of atorvastatin on serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides in individuals with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease. The primary focus of this review was determination of the mean per cent change from baseline of LDL-cholesterol. Secondary objectives
- To quantify the variability of effects of various doses of atorvastatin.• To quantify withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) in placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11, 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to December Week 2 2013), EMBASE (1980 to December Week 2 2013), Web of Science (1899 to December Week 2 2013) and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to December Week 2 2013). We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of atorvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of three to 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility criteria for studies to be included and extracted data. We collected information on withdrawals due to adverse effects from placebo-controlled trials.

Main Results

In this update, we found an additional 42 trials and added them to the original 254 studies. The update consists of 296 trials that evaluated dose-related efficacy of atorvastatin in 38,817 participants. Included are 242 before-and-after trials and 54 placebo-controlled RCTs. Log dose-response data from both trial designs revealed linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. The Summary of findings table 1 documents the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-cholesterol over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg/d, which is the range for which this systematic review acquired the greatest quantity of data. Over this range, blood LDL-cholesterol is decreased by 37.1% to 51.7% (Summary of findings table 1). The slope of dose-related effects on cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was similar for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, but rosuvastatin is about three-fold more potent. Subgroup analyses suggested that the atorvastatin effect was greater in females than in males and was greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. Risk of bias for the outcome of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) was high, but the mostly unclear risk of bias was judged unlikely to affect lipid measurements. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were not statistically significantly different between atorvastatin and placebo groups in these short-term trials (risk ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.40).

Authors' Conclusions

This update resulted in no change to the main conclusions of the review but significantly increases the strength of the evidence. Studies show that atorvastatin decreases blood total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in a linear dose-related manner over the commonly prescribed dose range. New findings include that atorvastatin is more than three-fold less potent than rosuvastatin, and that the cholesterol-lowering effects of atorvastatin are greater in females than in males and greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. This review update does not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with atorvastatin because included trials were of short duration and adverse effects were not reported in 37% of placebo-controlled trials.

### Statin-induced debilitating weakness and myopathy [^c5e92fbd]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A large percentage of the US population is either receiving or should be considered for statin therapy. Whether through primary or secondary prevention for atherosclerotic disease, statins remain one of the mainstay options available to physicians. Myalgias are the most commonly reported side effects, though largely self-limited and subjective in nature. Here, we report a case of drug-related myonecrosis following long-term use of atorvastatin. Prompt recognition of the condition and initiation of treatment is paramount to control the disease's progression. While high-dose steroids are first line, quick escalation to methotrexate, IVIG or rituximab should be considered in refractory cases. This decision is guided by monitoring of serum markers such as CK and transaminases. The goal is quick normalisation of these enzymes, signalling cessation of underlying muscle necrosis. Patients may never regain full function and treatment can last months to years.

### Side effect patterns in a crossover trial of statin, placebo, and No treatment [^800d82d5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most people who begin statins abandon them, most commonly because of side effects.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess daily symptom scores on statin, placebo, and no treatment in participants who had abandoned statins.

Methods

Participants received 12 1-month medication bottles, 4 containing atorvastatin 20 mg, 4 placebo, and 4 empty. We measured daily symptom intensity for each using an app (scale 1–100). We also measured the "nocebo" ratio: the ratio of symptoms induced by taking statin that was also induced by taking placebo.

Results

A total of 60 participants were randomized and 49 completed the 12-month protocol. Mean symptom score was 8.0 (95% CI: 4.7–11.3) in no-tablet months. It was higher in statin months (16.3; 95% CI: 13.0–19.6; P < 0.001), but also in placebo months (15.4; 95% CI: 12.1–18.7; P < 0.001), with no difference between the 2 (P = 0.388). The corresponding nocebo ratio was 0.90. In the individual-patient daily data, neither symptom intensity on starting (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.98–1.06; P = 0.28) nor extent of symptom relief on stopping (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.98–1.05; P = 0.48) distinguished between statin and placebo. Stopping was no more frequent for statin than placebo (P = 0.173), and subsequent symptom relief was similar between statin and placebo. At 6 months after the trial, 30 of 60 (50%) participants were back taking statins.

Conclusions

The majority of symptoms caused by statin tablets were nocebo. Clinicians should not interpret symptom intensity or timing of symptom onset or offset (on starting or stopping statin tablets) as indicating pharmacological causation, because the pattern is identical for placebo. (Self-Assessment Method for Statin Side-effects Or Nocebo [SAMSON]; NCT02668016).

Study limitations

The principal limitation of SAMSON is that it only recruited participants with symptoms that arose within 2 weeks of commencing statins. This allowed a trial duration that would be acceptable to most potential participants. To allow many periods of statin, placebo, and no tablets, we made each period 1 month long. To give enough time for symptoms to manifest, we therefore only enrolled participants whose symptoms characteristically arose within 2 weeks. SAMSON only tested a single statin at a single dose. We chose atorvastatin 20 mg daily because this is an inexpensive off-patent agent with satisfactory efficacy data, and is guideline-recommended for primary prevention. Finally, SAMSON did not require blood samples to avoid discouraging participation, to prevent delays to stopping tablets, and to maximize clinical applicability.

Future research should address why statins show such a high nocebo effect. One possibility is the dual misfortune of statins commonly being started for primary prevention where there are no symptoms to improve in an age group wherein ill-defined discomfort becomes increasingly common. Florid reports by mass media, unfiltered by scientific discipline, may lead to a vicious cycle where increased vigilance causes increased prevalence and vice versa. Induction of physical symptoms through information is recognized in medicine. The fact that atorvastatin is now the most prescribed medication has led to the following: 1) there are more patients to make an initial report of symptoms; 2) the media have a greater interest in publicizing them; and 3) individuals have a higher probability of being on the drug and having their attention drawn to symptoms. This triple combination might explain the dramatically higher public perception of side effects with statin tablets than with other medications.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated side effects (SASEs) — evaluation and statin rechallenge: The most-encountered SASE in clinical practice is statin-associated muscle symptoms, which may occur in 5% to 20% of patients, and in the SAMSON trial, 90% of the adverse symptom effects experienced with drug therapy can be attributed to what is seen with a blinded placebo; for patients with SASEs who meet evidence-based guideline criteria for statin therapy, avoiding complete discontinuation of statin treatment is strongly recommended. The approach to SASEs should include discontinuation of statin therapy until resolution of symptoms and subsequent rechallenge to verify recurrence of muscle-related symptoms, and most experts recommend documentation of unacceptable muscle-related symptoms that resolve and recur on at least 2 (and preferably 3) statins, with differing metabolic pathways/lipophilicity and one prescribed at the lowest approved dose. Although not studied in RCTs nor FDA approved, alternative statin regimens may include alternate-day dosing with a long half-life statin (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin), de-escalation dosing (reducing 40-mg daily dosing to alternating between a 40- and a 20-mg statin every other day), or a lower daily dose (from 40 mg daily to 20 mg daily), and the majority of patients who experience SASEs are able to tolerate statin rechallenge with an alternative statin or dose reduction with the same statin.

### Statin toxicity [^3932ef44]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

There is now overwhelming evidence to support lowering LDL-c (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Statins are a class of drugs frequently prescribed to lower cholesterol. However, in spite of their wide-spread use, discontinuation and nonadherence remains a major gap in both the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The major reason for statin discontinuation is because of the development of statin-associated muscle symptoms, but a range of other statin-induced side effects also exist. Although the mechanisms behind these side effects have not been fully elucidated, there is an urgent need to identify those at increased risk of developing side effects as well as provide alternative treatment strategies. In this article, we review the mechanisms and clinical importance of statin toxicity and focus on the evaluation and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:

Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]

Liver enzyme abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

In the atorvastatin placebo-controlled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8,755 atorvastatin vs. 7,311 placebo; age range 10 to 93 years, 39% women, 91% Caucasians, 3% Blacks, 2% Asians, 4% other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 9.7% of patients on atorvastatin and 9.5% of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with atorvastatin that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were: myalgia (0.7%), diarrhea (0.5%), nausea (0.4%), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4%), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4%).

The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 2% and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, in patients treated with atorvastatin in placebo controlled trials (n = 8,755) were: nasopharyngitis (8.3%), arthralgia (6.9%), diarrhea (6.8%), pain in extremity (6.0%), and urinary tract infection (5.7%).

### Safety of statins: focus on clinical pharmacokinetics and drug interactions [^d4efe470]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Statin monotherapy is generally well tolerated, with a low frequency of adverse events. The most important adverse effects associated with statins are myopathy and an asymptomatic increase in hepatic transaminases, both of which occur infrequently. Because statins are prescribed on a long-term basis, however, possible interactions with other drugs deserve particular attention, as many patients will typically receive pharmacological therapy for concomitant conditions during the course of statin treatment. This review summarizes the pharmacokinetic properties of statins and emphasizes their clinically relevant drug interactions.

### SLCO1B1*5 allele is associated with atorvastatin discontinuation and adverse muscle symptoms in the context of routine care [^5664ac4e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

In general, statin discontinuation is common. In patients with known cardiovascular disease, around 50% discontinue their initial statin within a year. Although reasons for nonadherence to statins are multifactorial, side effects are cited as the main reason patients prematurely discontinue statin therapy. Therefore, it is plausible that SLCO1B1 ‐informed statin therapy with the aim of reducing muscle side effects may lead to improved adherence for this important class of drugs. CPIC already provides guidance related to the choice of specific alternative therapies in carriers of SLCO1B1*5. If a low‐potency statin is acceptable, the area under the curve (AUC) is affected the least by SLCO1B1*5 for fluvastatin. If a moderate‐ or high‐potency statin is required, the AUC for pravastatin and rosuvastatin are impacted less by the SLCO1B1*5 variant than the AUC for simvastatin or atorvastatin. If a high‐potency statin is absolutely necessary, the JUPITER Trial has shown that rosuvastatin is safe in carriers of SLCO1B1*5.

We have previously demonstrated, in a longitudinal cohort of patients known to have been nonadherent with statins, that SLCO1B1 genotyping — with communication of test results and the alternative therapies described above to reduce side effect risks — can lead to lower LDL‐cholesterol levels through improved patient acceptance of guideline‐appropriate, new statin prescriptions. This nonrandomized prospective study delivered simple, written, patient‐facing and provider‐facing educational materials regarding SLCO1B1 genetic test results and recommendations delivered without the assistance of a pharmacist. More recently, we have confirmed the effectiveness of this approach using the same intervention in a randomized trial of 159 patients who had previously discontinued their statins due to myalgias, again demonstrating that SLCO1B1 gene–based statin prescribing leads to an increased use of new statin prescriptions (55.4% vs. 38%, P = 0.040) and lower LDL‐cholesterol levels (132 ± 42 vs. 144 ± 43 mg/dL at 3 months of follow‐up; P = 0.048). Because participants were followed for < 1 year in these studies, the long‐term effects of delivering SLCO1B1‐ guided statin therapy on adherence and LDL‐cholesterol level remain unknown. Future comparative effectiveness studies are therefore needed to assess the impact of SLCO1B1 ‐informed decision support for statins on their side effect frequency, adherence, and clinical efficacy in very large cohorts followed across multiple institutions.

### Statin-associated adverse effects beyond muscle and liver toxicity [^6e2b03bb]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have consistently demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Statins are currently the most widely used drugs in many countries. The most important adverse effects are associated with muscle and liver toxicity. However, with increased use and dose of statins and their over-the-counter availability in some countries more cases of other rare side effects may be seen in clinical practice. In the present article we review the literature concerning the statin-related adverse effects other than muscle and liver injury and we provide insight into their clinical relevance and possible underlying mechanisms.

### Lipid-lowering trials are not representative of patients managed in clinical practice: a systematic review and meta-analysis of exclusion criteria [^68c804bd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

For several common medical conditions, evidence on statin benefits and side effects is low, because patients with specific common conditions such as severe CKD, severe HF, dementia, and mental illness, or even groups of women were commonly excluded. It is not clear why these medical groups were excluded from these trials, and as previously published usually no reason is given for most of the exclusion criteria. In addition, in most of the excluded medical conditions lipid‐lowering drugs are not contraindicated. The reason for excluding common conditions may be to avoid situations that could limit the effectiveness of the medications tested or increase the risk of side effects. As to CKD, most of the lipid‐lowering drugs are not contraindicated. The official guidelines differ for the different drugs. For example, ezetimibe does not need an adjustment in severe renal failure, whereas with most statins it is recommended to start at a low dose and to up‐titrate. Not only are most of the lipid‐lowering drugs not contraindicated in CKD, but it is also essential to include this patient group in RCTs about LLT, because there is an association between decreasing eGFR and CVD risk (independent risk factor), but inconclusive evidence on the benefits of statins for advanced CKD. Because many studies excluded patients with higher‐grade renal insufficiency, it is not possible to assess whether the side effects of statin therapy (eg, interactions with other drugs) or the benefits outweigh the risks. However, in the 4D (Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse Studie) trial comparing atorvastatin versus placebo in patients treated with hemodialysis, there was no statistically significant effect on the composite end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. It may be reasonable not to start statin therapy in multimorbid older patients requiring dialysis or in patients with severe renal insufficiency in the primary prevention, and perhaps it would be reasonable as well to stop statins among those patients, as it is currently explored among multimorbid older adults in primary prevention in a randomized trial.

### Side effect patterns in a crossover trial of statin, placebo, and No treatment [^266a81da]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Side effects from taking statin tablets are verifiable but are driven by the act of taking tablets rather than whether the tablets contain a statin. The cues and informal experiments patients and clinicians use to test causation can paradoxically confirm a nonexistent association. This error is prevented by a scheduled, 3-armed, crossover trial containing no-tablet periods. Participating in such a protocol allows one-half of patients with reported side effects to successfully restart statins.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES: In a crossover trial that included no-treatment periods, patients who had stopped statin medication because of side effects exhibited similar frequencies and intensities of side-effect symptoms when starting and similar relief of symptoms when stopping statin and placebo.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: In future trials, a multiple-crossover trial design that includes a no-treatment arm as well as an active drug and placebo could prove useful in isolating side-effect profiles related to nonpharmacological factors.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1f2b3b86]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin intolerance and side effects — evaluation and management — notes that symptoms reported with statin use include mainly muscle-related complaints (myalgias), and observational studies have failed to find significant evidence for memory loss in those on longer-term statin therapy, despite anecdotal reports of short-term memory impairment. Because musculoskeletal complaints are common without statin therapy, an evaluation of such complaints to assess other possible causes should be undertaken before attributing symptoms to statins, and concomitant therapies may interact with statins, increasing the risk of muscle symptoms. For patients with statin intolerance, symptoms may improve when switched to a different statin; other strategies that may be used include limiting the daily dosage and modified regimens such as every other day or once weekly dosing with statins that have a long half-life. In some patients, it may be possible to switch to an alternative concomitant therapy to enhance statin tolerance, and for patients who cannot tolerate a statin within the previously discussed strategies, a nonstatin drug alone or in combination with another cholesterol-lowering agent may be considered. A modest increase in risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus has been observed with statin therapy in RCTs, and higher intensity statin therapy appears to increase risk to a greater extent than less-intensive regimens.

What Should I Avoid While Taking Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets?

Talk to your doctor before you start any new medicines. This includes prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Atorvastatin calcium tablets and certain other medicines can interact causing serious side effects.
Do not get pregnant. If you get pregnant, stop taking atorvastatin calcium tablets right away and call your doctor.

What are the Possible Side Effects of Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets?

Atorvastatin calcium tablets can cause serious side effects. These side effects have happened only to a small number of people. Your doctor can monitor you for them. These side effects usually go away if your dose is lowered or atorvastatin calcium tablets are stopped. These serious side effects include:

Muscle problems. Atorvastatin calcium tablets can cause serious muscle problems that can lead to kidney problems, including kidney failure. You have a higher chance for muscle problems if you are taking certain other medicines with atorvastatin calcium tablets.
Liver problems. Your doctor should do blood tests to check your liver before you start taking atorvastatin calcium tablets and if you have symptoms of liver problems while you take atorvastatin calcium tablets. Call your doctor right away if you have the following symptoms of liver problems:
feel tired or weak
loss of appetite
upper belly pain
dark amber colored urine
yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes

### Trends in prevalence of guideline-based use of lipid-lowering therapy in a large health system [^675aa287]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

4.3 Reasons for lack of appropriate statin use

There are likely multiple reasons for the modest adherence to guideline‐based statin use. Patients are understandably concerned about statin side effects and observational studies have reported that up to 25% of individuals experience statin‐related side effects. 9 In our analysis, < 3% of individuals had a statin allergy listed and the majority of those individuals had an active order for a different dose or different statin. Prior data from the Patient and Provider Assessment of Lipid Management (PALM) registry reported that fear of side effects was the most common reason for declining statin therapy. 8 However, the rate of side effects in the blinded statin trials has consistently been similar between the statin and placebo groups. The Anglo‐Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial — Lipid‐Lowering Arm tested atorvastatin for primary prevention of ASCVD and included a non‐blinded phase after the blinded portion of the trial was completed. 10 The trial reported no difference in muscle‐related adverse events during the blinded portion of the trial but during the non‐blinded portion of the trial, muscle‐related adverse events in those on statin therapy were reported at a frequency 41% higher (P = 0.006) than those not on statin therapy. While these data demonstrate the significant contribution of the nocebo effect to statin intolerance and subsequent lack of appropriate statin use, other factors may be even more important. The aforementioned PALM registry data also demonstrated that approximately 60% of statin eligible adults that were not on statin therapy reported never even being offered a statin by their provider. 8 Cost may be a potential limiting factor in statin use but nearly all statins are currently generic. From 2013 to 2017, the high intensity statins atorvastatin and rosuvastatin became generic, which is likely a significant driving factor for the increase use of high intensity from 2013 to 2017 seen in our study.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^90f521ba]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Common adverse effects of statin therapy — statin-associated muscle symptoms are the most frequent adverse events, with reported occurrence in 5% to 25% of people who receive statins. All statins have been implicated in small increases in both relative and absolute risk of diabetes, with increased risk associated with older age and the presence of ≥ 2 risk factors, such as elevated baseline fasting glucose level, elevated fasting triglycerides, elevated body mass index, or history of hypertension. Pitavastatin has previously been shown to have a neutral effect on glucose levels and in REPRIEVE there was no difference in glucose levels between pitavastatin and placebo groups over follow-up (median levels at Month 84 were 92 mg/dL and 90 mg/dL, respectively), although in REPRIEVE there was a small increase in new-onset diabetes (6.0% in the pitavastatin group; 4.7% in the placebo group). A randomized controlled trial in people with HIV demonstrated increases in insulin resistance and impaired fasting glucose levels with rosuvastatin use. Mild increases in liver enzymes are usually transient without clinical complications, and the overall clinical benefits of statin use outweigh the overall risks of adverse effects, especially for people with greater estimated 10-year ASCVD risk. Data related to any concerns of cognitive decline have been weak or contradictory, and, as such, do not warrant statin avoidance or cessation. Any time statins are initiated, clinicians should perform a comprehensive evaluation of musculoskeletal symptoms, an assessment of risk factors for diabetes, and a clinician–patient shared decision-making discussion focused on indications, benefits, risks, and patient concerns and preferences, and when mild adverse events occur, close clinical follow-up is important.

### Effect of atorvastatin on testosterone levels [^2112bb5c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Statins are one of the most prescribed classes of drugs worldwide. Atorvastatin, the most prescribed statin, is currently used to treat conditions such as hypercholesterolaemia and dyslipidaemia. By reducing the level of cholesterol, which is the precursor of the steroidogenesis pathway, atorvastatin may cause a reduction in levels of testosterone and other androgens. Testosterone and other androgens play important roles in biological functions. A potential reduction in androgen levels, caused by atorvastatin might cause negative effects in most settings. In contrast, in the setting of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), reducing excessive levels of androgens with atorvastatin could be beneficial.

Objectives

Primary objective To quantify the magnitude of the effect of atorvastatin on total testosterone in both males and females, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives To quantify the magnitude of the effects of atorvastatin on free testosterone, sex hormone binding globin (SHBG), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) concentrations, free androgen index (FAI), and withdrawal due to adverse effects (WDAEs) in both males and females, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to 9 November 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; two international trials registries, and the websites of the US Food and Drug Administration, the European Patent Office and the Pfizer pharmaceutical corporation. These searches had no language restrictions. We also contacted authors of relevant articles regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

RCTs of daily atorvastatin for at least three weeks, compared with placebo or no treatment, and assessing change in testosterone levels in males or females.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the citations, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We used the mean difference (MD) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) to report the effect size of continuous outcomes, and the risk ratio (RR) to report effect sizes of the sole dichotomous outcome (WDAEs). We used a fixed-effect meta-analytic model to combine effect estimates across studies, and risk ratio to report effect size of the dichotomous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included six RCTs involving 265 participants who completed the study and their data was reported. Participants in two of the studies were male with normal lipid profile or mild dyslipidaemia (N = 140); the mean age of participants was 68 years. Participants in four of the studies were female with PCOS (N = 125); the mean age of participants was 32 years. We found no significant difference in testosterone levels in males between atorvastatin and placebo, MD -0.20 nmol/L (95% CI -0.77 to 0.37). In females, atorvastatin may reduce total testosterone by -0.27 nmol/L (95% CI -0.50 to -0.04), FAI by -2.59 nmol/L (95% CI -3.62 to -1.57), androstenedione by -1.37 nmol/L (95% CI -2.26 to -0.49), and DHEAS by -0.63 μmol/l (95% CI -1.12 to -0.15). Furthermore, compared to placebo, atorvastatin increased SHBG concentrations in females by 3.11 nmol/L (95% CI 0.23 to 5.99). We identified no studies in healthy females (i.e. females with normal testosterone levels) or children (under age 18). Importantly, no study reported on free testosterone levels.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no significant difference between atorvastatin and placebo on the levels of total testosterone in males. In females with PCOS, atorvastatin lowered the total testosterone, FAI, androstenedione, and DHEAS. The certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low for both comparisons. More RCTs studying the effect of atorvastatin on testosterone are needed.

### Individualized dose-response to statins associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes [^f06e6157]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings also indicate that the role of ED 50 warrants further consideration. Lower ED 50 (greater potency) means that a lower dose is needed to reach target LDL-C, and the use of a lower dose may place patients at a lower risk of muscle side effects. Hence, the more potent drugs may be better tolerated and lead to improved adherence for this important class of drugs. Clearly, potency influences prescribing patterns. At present, the 3 most commonly prescribed drugs in this class are simvastatin (approved in 1991), atorvastatin (approved in 1996), and rosuvastatin (approved in 2003). Currently, atorvastatin is prescribed more commonly than any other statin. Historically, when simvastatin came off patent (affordable generic formulation) in 2006, it became the most commonly prescribed statin for a decade but was displaced by the more potent atorvastatin in 2011 when it came off patent. Since rosuvastatin is even more potent than atorvastatin, the prescribing frequency for rosuvastatin is increasing following it becoming available as a generic formulation in 2016, and it may soon overtake atorvastatin as the most commonly prescribed drug within this class.

For rosuvastatin, we specifically observed that it had both the greatest potency (lowest ED 50) and the greatest efficacy (highest E max) when compared to atorvastatin or simvastatin. These findings are consistent with previously published results from randomized clinical trials comparing statin potency and efficacy. Furthermore, the overall variance in efficacy and potency was much tighter with rosuvastatin, suggesting that it uniquely has a more consistent lipid-lowering effect at more consistent doses. These features may represent driving factors that contribute to the ongoing increase in prescribing frequency for rosuvastatin in the prevention of ASCVD. Given the relatively recent uptake in rosuvastatin prescribing, the sample size for the rosuvastatin cohort in our study is less than that of atorvastatin or simvastatin. The potential implications of these findings highlight a need for multi-institutional studies to further characterize dose-response characteristics of rosuvastatin.

### Remembering statins: Do statins have adverse cognitive effects? [^398b97f8]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

The issue of statin-associated cognitive impairment has been a hot topic among both patients and health care providers, especially since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a statement regarding rare postmarketing reports of ill-defined cognitive impairment associated with statin use. This statement was based on case reports, and no objective measures of cognitive function were used. Nevertheless, many patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease have expressed concerns about possible cognitive decline and may have opted to forgo statin therapy. In this overview, the evidence leading to the statement by the FDA is reviewed. Potential mechanisms of the effect of LDL cholesterol reduction and statin therapy on cognition are discussed. Evidence from observational and prospective randomized trials is summarized, leading to the conclusion that as for now, there is no good evidence that statins cause cognitive impairment to a significant degree. Reported cases seem to be rare, and a causal relationship has not been established.

Call your doctor right away if you have:

muscle problems like weakness, tenderness, or pain that happen without a good reason, especially if you also have a fever or feel more tired than usual. This may be an early sign of a rare muscle problem.
muscle problems that do not go away even after your doctor has advised you to stop taking atorvastatin calcium tablets. Your doctor may do further tests to diagnose the cause of your muscle problems.
allergic reactions including swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and/or throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing which may require treatment right away.
nausea and vomiting.
passing brown or dark-colored urine.
you feel more tired than usual
your skin and whites of your eyes get yellow.
stomach pain.
allergic skin reactions.

In clinical studies, patients reported the following common side effects while taking atorvastatin calcium tablets: diarrhea, upset stomach, muscle and joint pain, and alterations in some laboratory blood tests.

The following additional side effects have been reported with atorvastatin calcium tablets: tiredness, tendon problems, memory loss, and confusion.

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have side effects that bother you or that will not go away.

These are not all the side effects of atorvastatin calcium tablets. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list.

### SLCO1B1*5 allele is associated with atorvastatin discontinuation and adverse muscle symptoms in the context of routine care [^4c0d5a61]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Genotyping may improve adherence

Patients frequently discontinue statin use due to muscle side effects. We have previously demonstrated that genetic variation in SLCO1B1 is associated with SAMSs due to simvastatin and patient discontinuation of simvastatin. We now demonstrate that SLCO1B1 genotype is associated with SAMSs due to atorvastatin and patient discontinuation of atorvastatin. Thus, our findings help to establish the clinical validity of the SLCO1B1 genotype as a risk marker for atorvastatin‐related muscle side effects, and they expand the scope of this DGI beyond simvastatin to include the most commonly prescribed drug in this class.

This marker, the SLCO1B1 genotype, may also have utility in guiding choice of therapeutic alternatives to mitigate the risk of SAMSs. Rosuvastatin, for example, represents another high‐potency statin capable of achieving the robust reduction in LDL cholesterol that is expected with atorvastatin. In the JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial, where patients were randomized and double‐blinded to placebo or rosuvastatin 20 mg/day, a substudy of more than 8,700 participants demonstrated that carriers of SLCO1B1*5 were at no higher risk of SAMSs with rosuvastatin than with placebo. Although studies directly comparing the safety of rosuvastatin to the safety of simvastatin or atorvastatin have not been performed specifically in carriers of SLCO1B1*5, many clinical centers are now implementing clinical decision support tools for SLCO1B1*5 genotype based on its interactions with simvastatin. We anticipate that our data will form the foundation for expansion of these tools to atorvastatin.

### Lipid-lowering effect and safety of ezetimibe and atorvastatin 5 mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia: a randomized, double-blind, parallel, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial [^a55da2f6]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

4.1 The Benefits of Low‐Intensity Statin Combination Therapy Over Moderate‐Intensity Statin Therapy

Lowering LDL‐C improves clinical outcomes and statins are recommended as the mainstay of lipid‐lowering therapy. Therefore, recent lipid guidelines recommend LDL‐C reduction based on cardiovascular risk. Clinical guidelines recommend moderate‐intensity statins for primary prevention in adults aged 40–75 years without diabetes and at a moderate cardiovascular risk, or in patients with diabetes and aged 40–75 years. Although the initial lowering of LDL‐C levels with statins is effective, further reductions require disproportionately larger dose increases. This is because statin‐induced reductions in serum cholesterol can lead to increased cholesterol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, which diminishes the efficacy of higher statin doses. Typically, doubling the statin dose from the minimum effective dose yields only an additional 6% reduction in serum LDL‐C concentration. In addition, side effects associated with statins include myopathy, new‐onset diabetes, and an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. The SEARCH trial compared the effects of 80 mg versus 20 mg of simvastatin in patients with a history of myocardial infarction. The trial demonstrated a higher risk of myopathy in high‐dose simvastatin (0.9%) compared to the low‐dose group (0.03%). Similarly, the JUPITER trial, which compared rosuvastatin 20 mg to placebo, reported a higher incidence of new‐onset diabetes in the rosuvastatin (3.0% vs. 2.4%). In another meta‐analysis comparing high‐intensity and moderate‐intensity statins, new‐onset DM occurred 12% more often in the high‐intensity statin group compared with the moderate‐intensity statin group. These findings highlight the dose‐dependent manner in which statin‐associated side effects, which are important because they reduce patient adherence, are associated with clinical outcomes. Our study found that combining a low‐intensity statin atorvastatin 5 mg with ezetimibe resulted in a 47.6% reduction in LDL‐C from baseline, a significantly greater reduction than that achieved with atorvastatin 10 mg monotherapy, which is classified as a moderate‐intensity statin. Moreover, in the A5E10 group, 100% of participants with low‐to‐moderate risk achieved their LDL‐C targets. Consistent with the results of previous studies, these findings suggest that adding ezetimibe to a low‐intensity statin can achieve greater LDL‐C reduction than a moderate‐intensity statin alone, potentially offering a more effective and better‐tolerated treatment option by reducing the side effects commonly associated with high‐intensity statin therapy.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:

Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Amlodipine and Atorvastatin

Amlodipine and atorvastatin has been evaluated for safety in 1,092 patients in double-blind placebo-controlled studies treated for co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia. In general, treatment with amlodipine and atorvastatin was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse reactions have been mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials with amlodipine and atorvastatin, no adverse reactions peculiar to this combination have been observed. Adverse reactions are similar in terms of nature, severity, and frequency to those reported previously with amlodipine and atorvastatin.

The following information is based on the clinical experience with amlodipine and atorvastatin.

Amlodipine

Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with amlodipine was well tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine (N = 1,730) at doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N = 1,250), discontinuation of amlodipine because of adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1%). The most commonly reported side effects more frequent than placebo are dizziness and edema. The incidence (%) of side effects that occurred in a doserelated manner are as follows:

Regarding preventative measures for statin-induced myopathy, more specifically with respect to pretreatment assessment, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend to conduct a clinician-patient risk discussion before initiating statin therapy to review net clinical benefit, weighing the potential for ASCVD risk reduction against the potential for statin-associated side effects, drug-drug interactions, and safety while emphasizing that side effects can be addressed successfully.

### Statin-associated myopathy and its exacerbation with exercise [^9ceab495]. Muscle & Nerve (2010). Low credibility.

3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are a common and effective treatment for hypercholesterolemia, with a low overall rate of side-effects. The most common complication is some degree of skeletal muscle myopathy, ranging from painless serum creatine kinase elevations to rhabdomyolysis. Unfortunately, the likelihood and/or severity of complications increases with the combination of statin treatment and physical activity. The specific pathways that mediate statin-associated myopathy are unclear, and research directly addressing the exacerbation with exercise is limited. Potential mechanisms include the induction of skeletal muscle fiber apoptosis, alterations in ubiquitin-proteasome pathway activity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and terpenoid depletion. In this review we provide an overview of research that specifically addresses the combination of statin-associated myopathy and physical activity and highlight some deficiencies in the available literature, as well as future directions for this important subset of statin-associated myopathy.

### A mechanism for statin-induced susceptibility to myopathy [^c0070561]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Statins are the most widely prescribed drug in the Western world. Their use is predicted to rise further due to recent reductions in the cardiovascular risk threshold for statin prescription across the globe. However, cardiovascular benefits of statins are restricted by adverse effects that limit adherence, and, in turn, increase cardiovascular eventsand mortality. The most common side effects and main reason for discontinuation of therapy emerge from skeletal muscle (statin myopathy or statin-associated adverse muscle symptoms). Although no strict definition of statin myopathy has been universally adopted, we use this term to encompass the full spectrum of the effects of statins on skeletal muscle. This includes mild to moderate muscle symptoms and/or signs (myalgia: muscle pain with stiffness and weakness), as well as more severe potentially life-threatening outcomes (myositis and/or rhabdomyolysis) that are associated with raised creatine kinase. Although physical activity counteracts metabolic and cardiovascular diseases that are prevalent in subjects prescribed statins, exercise has been reported to exacerbate statin myopathy, which may further limit the benefits of statins in those at risk of cardiovascular disease.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^3a5078f6]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin intolerance — NLA definition and management: Statin intolerance was defined by the panel as adverse symptoms, signs or laboratory abnormalities attributed by the patient (or provider) to the statin and in most cases perceived by the patient to interfere unacceptably with activities of daily living, leading to a decision to stop or reduce statin therapy; myalgia, defined as muscle aches, soreness, stiffness or tenderness, is the most frequently reported side effect of statin use with reports generally ranging from 1–5% in controlled clinical trials to 11–29% in observational studies. The NLA Statin Safety Panel stated that patients should be told that whether to continue taking the statin is their decision, but it is best guided by advice from their health care provider, and patients should be advised that before stopping a statin due to possible side effects, they should first speak to their health care provider. Even if statin intolerance is confirmed, in most cases the clinician and patient should attempt to maintain statin treatment in some form to reduce the patient's CVD event risk; options for continuing statin therapy include a lower daily dosage of the same statin, less than daily dosages of the same statin (optimally with a long-acting statin, such as rosuvastatin or atorvastatin), or use of an alternative statin, and patients who are initially intolerant to 1 statin can often tolerate a different statin. The highest tolerated dose of statin should be targeted, and other non-statin lipid-lowering drugs are options for patients with statin intolerance with consideration of their potential for side effects.

### Statin therapy in the treatment of Alzheimer disease: what is the rationale? [^d5dcb32d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that is manifested by cognitive decline, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and diffuse structural abnormalities in the brain. Its prevalence is predicted to rise 4-fold in the next 50 years. AD is characterized pathologically by deposition of extracellular beta-amyloid and accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles. Neuronal death and specific neurotransmitter deficits also are part of the pathologic picture. Strategies to delay symptom progression have focused on addressing the neurotransmitter deficits. Strategies to delay the onset or biologic progression of AD largely have targeted the plaques formed by the deposition of beta-amyloid. AD and cardiovascular disease share common risk factors, notably hypercholesterolemia, and occur together more often than expected by chance. Therapy with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) is the first-line treatment option for hypercholesterolemia, and observational studies have suggested that the risk of AD is reduced in patients who receive statin therapy in midlife. This reduction in risk of AD observed with statin therapy may be due to statins reducing beta-amyloid formation and deposition or to their known anti-inflammatory effects. Two randomized double-blind statin trials in patients with AD to assess the potential for statins to slow disease progression are currently under way. If successful, statin AD primary prevention trials may be developed.

Factors That Increase Adverse Effects by Increasing Exposure to Statins

There are a number of mechanisms that affect drug exposure in individual patients; these are integral to and associated with risk of adverse events that exhibit dose dependence (notably myopathy). They include pharmacokinetic interactions, and pharmacogenomic factors that result in higher levels of statins in the blood and in hepatic and muscle tissue.

### Atorvastatin film coated (atorvastatin calcium) [^8c215df0]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atorvastatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Adverse reactions associated with atorvastatin therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following: anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, myositis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis and interstitial lung disease.

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (one day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks).

### Comparison of benefits and risks of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin from a meta-analysis of head-to-head randomized controlled trials [^ce949a39]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The benefit from statin therapy is proportional to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction. However, adverse events appear to be related to dose rather than LDL cholesterol reduction. Although serious side effects are rare, any comparison of statins requires scrutiny of the relation between therapeutic effect and risk of side effects. This report sought to determine whether the additional LDL cholesterol lowering with rosuvastatin over atorvastatin could be obtained without increased risk of short-term adverse events. Twenty-five studies (approximately 20,000 patients) were identified that provided 28 comparisons of 1:1 dose ratios, 20 comparisons of 1:2 dose ratios, and 6 comparisons of 1:4 dose ratios. Treatment difference in benefit (percentage of LDL cholesterol reduction) and risk (odds ratios for myalgia, increased alanine aminotransferase > 3 times the upper limit of normal, creatine kinase > 10 times the upper limit of normal, and percentage of change in glomerular filtration rate, as well as deaths, serious adverse events, and withdrawals caused by adverse events) were estimated using meta-analysis and presented in benefit-risk planes. Rosuvastatin was more efficacious than the same dose of atorvastatin (1:1 dose ratio) or a 2 times higher dose (1:2 dose ratio) of atorvastatin. There was no significant difference between rosuvastatin and a 4 times higher dose of atorvastatin (1:4 dose ratio). There were no significant differences between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin at any dose ratio for adverse events. Percentages of change in GFR improved significantly with both treatments. In conclusion, at 1:1 and 1:2 dose ratios, significant additional decreases in LDL cholesterol were obtained using rosuvastatin compared with atorvastatin at a similar risk of the adverse events presented.

Why Physicians Mistakenly Discontinue Statins

Reasons why physicians inappropriately discontinue or limit the dose of statins include commonly held myths about statin adverse effects including hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, cognitive decline, cataracts, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In some cases, this may be driven by concern about litigation, when guidelines specify, for example, monitoring of liver function.

Although rare cases of true hepatotoxicity may exist, 1 statins probably do not cause hepatotoxicity, as stated in the 2013 International Atherosclerosis Society guideline. 18 Fluctuations in blood levels of transaminase enzymes that are often blamed on statins ("transaminitis") are more likely to be caused by fatty liver or by release of enzymes from muscle in patients with statin myopathy. 19, 20 In the Heart Protection Study, in which > 20 000 high‐risk patients were randomized to simvastatin 40 mg versus placebo and were followed for 5 years, hepatotoxicity was undetectable. 21 Athyros et al 22 compared patients with and without abnormal liver function tests in the Greek Atorvastatin and Coronary Heart Disease Evaluation (GREACE) study. They found that liver function tests actually improved among patients given statins, whereas they worsened in patients not given statins. Further, the cardiovascular benefit of statins was greater among patients with abnormal liver function tests than among patients with normal liver function tests at baseline. Their conclusion 22 was that "Statin treatment is safe and can improve liver tests and reduce cardiovascular morbidity in patients with mild‐to‐moderately abnormal liver tests that are potentially attributable to non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease". Guidelines regarding monitoring of liver function in patients taking statins should be revised accordingly.

### Atorvastatin associated liver disease [^4908d606]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Atorvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is widely used in the treatment of dyslipidaemia. A transient rise in serum transaminases occurs in up to 3% of patients using atorvastatin but this is usually self-limiting and inconsequential. Recent literature has indicated some potential for more serious but rare idiosyncratic reactions related to this drug. Seven patients with significant liver dysfunction from one centre during 2002–2005 are reported, with one death, that raises some concern over the safety of atorvastatin. A total of seven other patients are reported in the literature. The 14 patients were usually over 60 years, had a female:male ratio of 2:1 and showed a mixed cholestatic/hepatocellular reaction. The mean interval to onset of reaction was approximately 9 weeks and the liver often took several months to recover. Three deaths occurred. Adverse drug reaction reports from the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines reveal that four deaths due to hepatobiliary disease (0.5 deaths per annum) have been reported in association with atorvastatin treatment over 8 years. Simvastatin has had no hepatobiliary-related fatalities reported over 15 years. While acute hepatotoxicity with atorvastatin remains uncommon, any persistent abnormality in liver function should be treated with caution.

An "asymptomatic increase in transaminases (> 3 times upper limit of normal) is an infrequent statin-associated side effect" that often resolves with dose adjustment, while "Severe statin-associated hepatotoxicity is rare, and the incidence is not impacted by routine monitoring of transaminases", and evaluation for nonstatin causes "is warranted" if elevations persist. "Statins are not contraindicated in patients with increased ASCVD risk with chronic, stable liver disease", and, overall, "CK and transaminase levels should not be routinely measured".

### Statin-related myopathies [^84f5c515]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Statins are the Marmite ('You either love it or hate it!') of the drug world, both in terms of therapeutic benefit and risk of side effects. Proponents think that they are potential life-savers, opponents that their main benefit is lining the pockets of pharma. Some consider side effects to be a major issue, outweighing any therapeutic benefit, others that they are rare and essentially innocuous. Statin-induced myalgia is relatively common but often mild and for most people does not limit treatment. In others, reducing the dose or changing the preparation may help. In all, withdrawal of the statin leads to resolution. Statin-induced rhabdomyolysis, most often precipitated by drug-drug interaction, affects only a tiny proportion of statin users, but because of the widespread prescribing of statins is an important clinical problem. Statin-induced immune-mediated necrotising myopathy represents a novel disease mechanism and clinically mimics forms of myositis. Resolution often requires immunosuppressant drug treatment, as well as statin withdrawal.

### Safety of atorvastatin derived from analysis of 44 completed trials in 9, 416 patients [^f97b56bc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

This analysis assessed the safety of atorvastatin in the 10- to 80-mg dose range using pooled data from 44 completed trials comprising 16,495 dyslipidemic patients treated with atorvastatin (n = 9,416), placebo (n = 1,789), and other statins (n = 5,290). A retrospective analysis was conducted and included treatment-associated adverse events, serious adverse events, and musculoskeletal and hepatic adverse events. Only 3% (n = 241) of atorvastatin-treated patients withdrew from studies due to treatment-associated adverse events, compared with 1% of those (n = 16) on placebo and 4% of those (n = 188) receiving other statins; the most frequently reported treatment-associated adverse events were related to the digestive system. Serious adverse events were rare and seldom led to withdrawal. Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases to > 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were experienced by 0.5% (n = 47) of atorvastatin-treated patients. A persistent elevation in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (> 10 x ULN) was observed in only 1 atorvastatin-treated patient and was not associated with myopathy. The incidence of treatment-associated myalgia was low in the atorvastatin (1.9% [n = 181]), placebo (0.8% [n = 14]), and other statin (2.0% [n = 105]) groups, and was not related to the atorvastatin dose. No cases of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy were reported. Thus, the overall incidence of treatment-associated adverse events observed with atorvastatin did not increase in the 10- to 80-mg dose range, and was similar to that observed with placebo and in patients treated with other statins.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atorvastatin calcium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Adverse reactions associated with atorvastatin calcium therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed above, regardless of causality assessment, include the following: anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis), rhabdomyolysis, myositis, fatigue, tendon rupture, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure, dizziness, depression, peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis and interstitial lung disease.

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (one day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks).

Elevations in Liver Enzyme Tests

Persistent elevations in serum transaminases, defined as more than 3 times the ULN and occurring on 2 or more occasions, occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively.

One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver enzyme tests in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent liver enzyme elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin.

### Statin myopathy: an update [^0fe32978]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Statin therapy has become the mainstay of treatment for lipid lowering, demonstrating cardiovascular risk reduction. Associated with statin popularity are misconceptions and fears of untoward side effects on muscle. This review clarifies the terminology relating to statin-related muscle disease; explores potential pathogenic mechanisms; reviews current estimates of statin myopathy prevalence; and examines diagnosis and management.

Recent Findings

The fundamental mechanism of statin myopathy remains elusive but is believed to be a class effect. The most common explanation for the cause of toxic muscle injury invokes the deficiency of one of three main synthetic products in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase pathway. Recent studies have revealed several patients with statin-induced rhabdomyolysis who also have metabolic muscle defects, indicating that statin use may unmask presymptomatic metabolic myopathies. Although statin-related myotoxicity is believed to be a noninflammatory, toxic myopathy, experimental evidence suggests that it may be triggered by an autoimmune reaction or, conversely, initiate an autoimmune process. The precise mechanism is uncertain.

Summary

As a class, statins appear to be usually safe, well tolerated agents with an excellent risk: benefit profile. The etiology and pathogenesis of statin myopathy are poorly understood owing to the relative rarity of its existence.

### Assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of 2 formulations of atorvastatin in Korean adults with hypercholesterolemia: a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized trial [^ecc0b410]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A manufacturer of atorvastatin is seeking marketing approval in Korea of a generic product for adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a new generic formulation of atorvastatin (test) with those of an original formulation of atorvastatin (reference) to satisfy regulatory requirements for marketing of the generic product in Korea.

Methods

Patients enrolled were aged 20 to 79 years with documented primary hypercholesterolemia who did not respond adequately to therapeutic lifestyle changes and with a LDL-C level > 100 mg/dL from a high-risk group of coronary artery disease patients. Eligible patients were randomized to receive 1 of the 2 formulations of atorvastatin 20 mg per day for 8 weeks. The primary end point was the percent change in LDL-C level from baseline to week 8. Secondary end points included the percent change in total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C level, apolipoprotein B:apolipoprotein A-I ratio, LDL:HDL ratio, LDL-C particle size, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein from baseline to week 8, and achievement rate of the LDL-C goal.

Results

A total of 298 patients (141 men and 157 women; 149 patients in each group; mean [SD] age, 62.4 [9.2] in the test group vs 60.3 [8.9] years in the reference group) were included. LDL-C levels were significantly decreased from baseline to week 8 in both groups, and there was no significant difference in the percent change in LDL-C level between groups (-44.0% [17.2%] in the test group, -45.4% [16.9%] in the reference group; P = 0.49). The between-group differences in the percent changes in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not statistically significant. In addition, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in percent changes in HDL-C, apolipoprotein B:apolipoprotein A-I ratio, LDL-C:HDL-C ratio, LDL-C particle size, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and the achievement rate of the LDL-C goal. Two (1.3%) patients in the reference group (N = 150) experienced treatment-related serious adverse events (AEs): toxic hepatitis and aggravation of chest pain. Common AEs were cough (4.1%), myalgia (2.1%), and indigestion (1.4%) in the test formulation group and cough (5.3%), creatine kinase elevation (2.7%), and edema (0.7%) in the reference formulation group; however, the differences in overall prevalence of AEs between the 2 treatment groups was not significant (P = 0.88).

Conclusions

There were no significant differences observed in the efficacy and tolerability between the test and reference formulations of atorvastatin in these Korean adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.

### The safety of statins in clinical practice [^eea58b14]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Statins are effective cholesterol-lowering drugs that reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease events (heart attacks, strokes, and the need for arterial revascularisation). Adverse effects from some statins on muscle, such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, are rare at standard doses, and on the liver, in increasing levels of transaminases, are unusual. Myopathy — muscle pain or weakness with blood creatine kinase levels more than ten times the upper limit of the normal range — typically occurs in fewer than one in 10,000 patients on standard statin doses. However, this risk varies between statins, and increases with use of higher doses and interacting drugs. Rhabdomyolysis is a rarer and more severe form of myopathy, with myoglobin release into the circulation and risk of renal failure. Stopping statin use reverses these side-effects, usually leading to a full recovery. Asymptomatic increases in concentrations of liver transaminases are recorded with all statins, but are not clearly associated with an increased risk of liver disease. For most people, statins are safe and well-tolerated, and their widespread use has the potential to have a major effect on the global burden of cardiovascular disease.

Respondents who had stopped their statin therapy reported significantly higher symptom and impact scores from their medication. Among those currently taking statins who experienced side effects or abnormal laboratory values, 40.2% were able to avoid discontinuation with regimen changes such as reducing the dose (22.6%).

### Beneficial cardiovascular pleiotropic effects of statins [^379b0fc6]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Pleiotropic effects of a drug are actions other than those for which the agent was specifically developed. These effects may be related or unrelated to the primary mechanism of action of the drug, and they are usually unanticipated. Pleiotropic effects may be undesirable (such as side effects or toxicity), neutral, or, as is especially the case with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), beneficial. Pleiotropic effects of statins include improvement of endothelial dysfunction, increased nitric oxide bioavailability, antioxidant properties, inhibition of inflammatory responses, and stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. These and several other emergent properties could act in concert with the potent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering effects of statins to exert early as well as lasting cardiovascular protective effects. Understanding the pleiotropic effects of statins is important to optimize their use in treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### An overview of the clinical safety profile of atorvastatin (lipitor), a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor… [^818d79f4]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcome Measures Transaminase and creatine phosphokinase levels and adverse events were recorded. Results. Atorvastatin was well tolerated; fewer than 2% of the atorvastatin-treated patients withdrew due to drug-attributable adverse events. The overall adverse event profile for atorvastatin was similar to that observed with other statins. The most common adverse events with atorvastatin as well as with other statins tested were constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Approximately 5% of atorvastatin-treated patients had serious adverse events; only 2 of these events were possibly associated with treatment. Thirty patients had confirmed transaminase elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range. Most elevations occurred within 16 weeks of beginning treatment. No patients had a conclusive characterization of drug-induced myopathy.

Atorvastatin was well tolerated; fewer than 2% of the 2502 patients treated withdrew due to adverse effects related to treatment. Similarly, about 3% of patients treated with other statins withdrew due to adverse effects related to treatment. The adverse effects that most often led to withdrawal in atorvastatin-treated patients were nausea, pain, depression, myalgia, abdominal pain, and abnormal liver function test results. Serious adverse events were reported by approximately 5% of the patients treated with atorvastatin and by approximately 7% of the patients treated with other statins in these studies. Only 2 patients treated with atorvastatin had serious events possibly associated with treatment. The rate of occurrence of all myalgia, arthralgia, and muscle disorders was similar among patients treated with placebo, atorvastatin, and other statins.

Monitoring of elevations did not identify possible liver damage. Cholestatic jaundice, an adverse event reported with other statins, occurred in only 1 patient who received atorvastatin; it was identified by the jaundice in a patient whose antibody test results indicated previous hepatitis infection. 57, 58 As with other statins, liver function test results should be monitored. In patients with persistent elevations in transaminase levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the dosage should be reduced or atorvastatin treatment should be discontinued.

### Overcoming challenges with statin therapy [^d26d39b9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Switching Statins, Low‐Dose and/or Alternate‐Day Statins

The truly causal adverse effects of statins are probably related to efficacy in inhibition of HMG‐CoA reductase and therefore entirely attributable to intensity of statin therapy. Switching statins probably will not help reduce adverse effects except when weaker statins or lower doses of statins are used. A useful maneuver may be alternate‐day low‐dose statin in combination with ezetimibe. A case report illustrates this.

### Statin myopathy: a review of recent progress [^4d70373c]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Statins are commonly prescribed lipid-lowering medications that significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. However, they can have myotoxic effects ranging in severity from myalgias to rhabdomyolysis. This review focuses on recent progress in defining the clinical features and mechanism(s) of statin-induced myopathy.

Recent Findings

Although severe myotoxicity is a very rare event, most recent studies suggest that myalgias and relatively low-level muscle damage may occur in a substantial number of patients treated with statins. Those taking medications that increase serum statin concentrations are at greater risk for severe muscle side-effects, as are those with a polymorphism in the gene encoding a hepatic statin transporter. Although the mechanism of muscle damage remains to be fully elucidated, a number of in-vitro studies suggest that inhibition of protein prenylation may underlie the myotoxic effects of statins, possibly through the induction of pro-apoptotic pathways. In addition, recent reports have indicated that statins may trigger an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy with many features of polymyositis.

Summary

Severe myopathy is a rare and generally self-limited side-effect of statin medications. However, myalgias are much more common and limit their use in many patients. Recent evidence also suggests that statins are associated with the development of a unique form of immune-mediated myopathy. Awareness of this newly described entity is important, as these patients may require immunosuppressive therapy.

### The SLCO1B1*5 genetic variant is associated with statin-induced side effects [^69a49456]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with mild statin-induced side effects.

Background

Statin-induced side effects can interfere with therapy. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 enzymes impair statin metabolism; the reduced function SLCO1B1*5 allele impairs statin clearance and is associated with simvastatin-induced myopathy with creatine kinase (CK) elevation.

Methods

The STRENGTH (Statin Response Examined by Genetic Haplotype Markers) study was a pharmacogenetics study of statin efficacy and safety. Subjects (n = 509) were randomized to atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, or pravastatin 10 mg followed by 80 mg, 80 mg, and 40 mg, respectively. We defined a composite adverse event (CAE) as discontinuation for any side effect, myalgia, or CK > 3x upper limit of normal during follow-up. We sequenced CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and SLCO1B1 and tested 7 reduced function alleles for association with the CAE.

Results

The CAE occurred in 99 subjects (54 discontinuations, 49 myalgias, and 9 CK elevations). Sex was associated with CAE (percent female in CAE vs. no CAE groups, 66% vs. 50%, p < 0.01). SLCO1B1*5 was associated with CAE (percent with ≥ 1 allele in CAE vs. no CAE groups, 37% vs. 25%, p = 0.03) and those with CAE with no significant CK elevation (p ≤ 0.03). Furthermore, there was evidence for a gene-dose effect (percent with CAE in those with 0, 1, or 2 alleles: 19%, 27%, and 50%, trend p = 0.01). Finally, the CAE risk appeared to be greatest in those carriers assigned to simvastatin.

Conclusions

SLCO1B1*5 genotype and female sex were associated mild statin-induced side effects. These findings expand the results of a recent genome-wide association study of statin myopathy with CK > 3x normal to milder, statin-induced, muscle side effects.

### A clinician's guide to statin drug-drug interactions [^529f46d0]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

The statins are widely used worldwide to reduce risk for cardiovascular events in both the primary and secondary prevention settings. Although generally quite safe, the statins can be associated with a variety of serious side adverse effects, including myalgia, myopathy, and changes in plasma enzymes of hepatic origin. Although rare, the most serious of these is rhabdomyolysis. Several drugs can interfere with the metabolism and disposal of the statins, thereby increasing risk for adverse events. It is important that clinicians treating patients with statins be aware of the potential for drug-drug interactions between each statin and specific other drugs and take measures to prevent them. The prediction of potential drug-drug interactions derives from basic pharmacokinetic principles. Certain drug interactions are predicted by measuring the effect of interacting drugs on blood plasma concentrations of the statin. Individual patient variations resulting in part from polymorphisms in the metabolizing enzymes confound some of these predictions. Based on these known effects, a new classification for predicting statin drug interactions is proposed. This report discusses likely prescription and nonprescription interactions as well as potential alternatives for special populations.

### Comparative effectiveness of generic atorvastatin and lipitor® in patients hospitalized with an acute coronary syndrome [^1101f1ba]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Limitations

Our study has some limitations. We were able to create a well‐balanced cohort through the use of propensity score methods. However, some risk factors (eg, smoking, physical activity) were not available. It is unlikely these factors were imbalanced enough in our cohort to impact our results. Because most in the brand group were from 2008 to 2010, and in the generic group from 2010 to 2012, there is possible confounding attributed to a temporal improvement in outcomes. In our propensity‐matched cohort, baseline patient characteristics, medications within 7 days of index ACS discharge, and interventional cardiovascular procedures occurring during the ACS hospitalization were well balanced between groups, reducing the likelihood of confounding. In addition, our sensitivity analysis restricted to 1 year pre‐ and postpolicy change found similar results. Furthermore, analysis of mortality rates indicated no significant changes during our study's 4‐year time frame. Our study is limited to an older cohort of patients ≥ 65 years. Smaller between‐group differences are likely in younger patients. Although we found no significant difference in severe side effects, such as rhabdomyolysis and diabetes between the generic atorvastatin and Lipitor ® groups, we were unable to evaluate common side effects, such as myalgias and gastrointestinal symptoms associated with statins given that they are not captured adequately in our data sources. We also do not have data on race/ethnicity. Our study did not evaluate the impact of generic versus brand drug copay because the generic copay does not differ in Ontario.

In conclusion, our large, population‐based study found that there is no difference in major adverse cardiovascular outcomes at 1 year in older ACS patients prescribed generic atorvastatin products after hospitalization compared with those prescribed Lipitor ®. Our findings support the use of generic atorvastatin in ACS, which could lead to substantial cost saving without diminishing population clinical effectiveness.

Statin intolerance — definitions from select organizations describe criteria for inability to tolerate statins and assessment of statin-associated muscle symptoms. NLA Expert Panel on Statin Intolerance 2014 defines "the inability to tolerate at least two statins: one statin at the lowest starting daily dose and another statin at any daily dose", with adverse findings that are "temporally related to statin treatment and reversible upon statin discontinuation, but reproducible by rechallenge" after excluding other determinants; it specifies lowest starting doses as "rosuvastatin 5 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 10 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 40 mg and pitavastatin 2 mg". A Unified Definition from an International Lipid Expert Panel requires "The inability to tolerate at least two different statins - one statin at the lowest starting average daily dose and the other statin at any dose" with confirmed adverse effects or biomarker abnormalities, improvement "upon dose decrease or discontinuation", and that changes are "not attributable to established predispositions such as drug-drug interactions and recognized conditions". The European Atherosclerosis Society statement notes assessment should "take account of the nature of the muscle symptoms, the elevation in CK levels and their temporal association with statin initiation, discontinuation, and re-challenge".

Proprotein convertase subtilisin–kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors could be considered for patients with previous ischaemic stroke or TIA who (a) have elevated LDL-cholesterol despite aggressive lipid-lowering treatment (defined as atorvastatin 40/80 mg (or rosuvastatin 20/40 mg) plus ezetimibe 10 mg), or (b) have specific statin-related complications (e.g. myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, other idiosyncratic side-effects) (Grade B).
Should lipid lowering therapy be given for primary prevention?

Lipid lowering treatment in combination with lifestyle changes is recommended for primary prevention in patients who have high 10-year risk for cardiovascular events (Grade A). The drug-class and the intensity of the lipid-lowering treatment as well as the treatment goals are thus depend on patient characteristics (Grade A).

### Associations between statins and adverse events in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review with pairwise, network, and dose-response meta-analyses [^8e671ed2]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this systematic review of randomised controlled trials, we examined the associations between statins and adverse events in adults without a history of cardiovascular disease. We found a slightly increased risk of self-reported muscle symptoms after treatment with statins but no increased risk of clinically confirmed muscle disorders. Statins were associated with liver dysfunction, renal insufficiency, and eye conditions, but were not associated with diabetes. The absolute increases in the risks of these adverse events were small, and not comparable (numerically or clinically) with the reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events achieved by treatment with statins.

Analyses by type of statin showed that atorvastatin, lovastatin, and rosuvastatin were associated with some adverse events, but few significant differences were seen between the statins. A possible modest dose-response relationship was identified for the effect of atorvastatin on liver dysfunction, but the pharmacological parameters were imprecise and the shape of the dose-response curve was unclear. The dose-response relationships for the other types of statins and adverse effects were inconclusive.

Comparison with other studies

Most previous systematic reviews of trials examining statins for primary prevention did not find an association between statins and myalgia, myopathy, or rhabdomyolysis, based on small numbers of included studies and inconsistent definitions of outcomes. A previous review found no association between statins and myalgia or other mild muscle symptoms (eg, muscle weakness and stiffness) but excluded some landmark trials, owing to a constrained study population. In contrast, a recent review showed an association between statins and overall muscle problems, but the review included a wide range of conditions with varying severities and incidences. In our review, we searched for more comprehensive data from studies, including those previously omitted, and classified muscle problems as self-reported symptoms or clinically confirmed disorders, to resolve the inconsistency and variety of definitions of outcomes in trials. This approach allowed us to clarify that statins are associated with a small increased risk of muscle symptoms, but the evidence for muscle disorders in patients with no history of cardiovascular disease was insufficient.

### Managing statin myopathy [^2968ccf2]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately 10% of patients treated with statins experience some form of muscle-related side effects in clinical practice. These can range from asymptomatic creatine kinase (CK) elevation, to muscle pain, weakness, and its most severe form, rhabdomyolysis. Higher risk patients for statin myopathy are those older than 80, with a small body frame, on higher statin doses, on other medications, or with other systemic diseases including hepatic or renal diseases, diabetes mellitus, or hypothyroidism. The cause of statin myopathy is presumed to be the same for its variable presentation but has not been defined. In patients with myopathic symptoms, their symptoms and CK levels determine whether statin therapy can be continued or must be stopped.

### SLCO1B1*5 allele is associated with atorvastatin discontinuation and adverse muscle symptoms in the context of routine care [^7754f63a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG‐CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the industrialized world. Statins decrease cardiovascular event rate in the context of both primary and secondary prevention. The combined 2018 American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce the atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk for adults recommend moderate to high intensity statin therapy for patients at high risk of cardiovascular events. In patients with known cardiovascular disease, each 1 mmol/L reduction in low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowers the annual incidence of major vascular events by 20%. Despite compelling data to support clinical efficacy, statins are still not optimally utilized. Reasons for this discrepancy include provider underprescribing and patient nonadherence.

In general, statins are considered safe and well tolerated. Although they can cause asymptomatic elevation in hepatic transaminases, statin‐induced liver injury is extremely rare. Conversely, muscle pain (myalgias) and muscle damage (myopathy) occur quite often in the context of statin therapy. Statin‐associated musculoskeletal symptoms (SAMSs) frequently lead to patient nonadherence or discontinuation. In observational studies, myalgias have been reported in as many as 10% of patients taking statins. Most of these cases do not have laboratory evidence of muscle damage. Myopathy occurs much less frequently, ranging from 1% to fewer than 0.1%, depending upon the degree to which creatine kinase (CK) levels are elevated in the systemic circulation. Rhabdomyolysis, the most extreme example of this adverse drug reaction (with CK levels exceeding 50 times the upper limit of normal), is rare with an incidence of 1:1,000,000 on statin monotherapy.

Other adverse reactions reported in placebo-controlled trials include:

Body as a Whole: malaise, pyrexia

Digestive System: abdominal discomfort, eructation, flatulence, hepatitis, cholestasis

Musculoskeletal System: musculoskeletal pain, muscle fatigue, neck pain, joint swelling

Metabolic and Nutritional System: transaminases increase, liver function test abnormal, blood alkaline phosphatase increase, creatine phosphokinase increase, hyperglycemia

Nervous System: nightmare

Respiratory System: epistaxis

Skin and Appendages: urticaria

Special Senses: vision blurred, tinnitus

Urogenital System: white blood cells urine positive

Elevations in Liver Enzyme Tests

Persistent elevations in serum transaminases, defined as more than 3 times the ULN and occurring on 2 or more occasions, occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively.

One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver enzyme tests in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent liver enzyme elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin.

Adverse effects of traditional ADT — risks, comparative data, and mitigation: ADT has a variety of adverse effects (e.g., hot flashes, sexual and metabolic effects, musculoskeletal changes, and cardiovascular disease), and "the side effects of continuous ADT increase with the duration of treatment". Some forms may carry lower risk; for example, "relugolix was associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events than leuprolide" in HERO, although the FDA considered the HERO cardiovascular findings exploratory and did not allow inclusion in prescribing information, and overall head‑to‑head evidence on cardiovascular toxicity is very limited. Cognitive risks remain uncertain, and "patients and their medical providers should be advised about these risks prior to treatment". Many side effects "are reversible or can be avoided or mitigated"; physical activity "should be recommended", and "use of statins also should be considered".

### Is statin-associated cognitive impairment clinically relevant? A narrative review and clinical recommendations [^1926a3e0]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore the impact of statin use on cognition.

Data Sources

A literature search was performed using MEDLINE (1950-November 2011), EMBASE (1980-November 2011), and the Cochrane Library (1960-November 2011) using the search terms "cognition/drug effects", "delirium, dementia, amnestic, cognitive disorders/chemically induced", "memory disorders/chemically induced", "hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors/adverse effects", and "hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors". A bibliographic search on included references was also conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies were included for analysis if they were conducted in humans and examined the impact of statin use on cognition as either a primary or secondary endpoint; case reports and case series were also included for analysis.

Data Synthesis

Reports of statin-associated cognitive impairment were found primarily in observational studies (eg, case reports/series). One randomized controlled trial demonstrated that simvastatin impaired some measures of cognition compared to placebo. Conversely, in the majority of randomized controlled trials and observational studies, statins were found to have either a neutral or beneficial effect on cognition. Preliminary data suggest that statins that are less lipophilic (ie, pravastatin and rosuvastatin) may be less likely to contribute to cognitive impairment due to limited penetration across the blood-brain barrier. These drugs would be a logical alternative in cases where cognitive impairment secondary to another statin is suspected.

Conclusions

Despite several reports of statin-associated cognitive impairment, this adverse effect remains a rare occurrence among the totality of the literature. If statin-associated cognitive impairment is suspected, a trial discontinuation can reveal a temporal relationship. Switching from lipophilic to hydrophilic statins may resolve cognitive impairment. The vascular benefits and putative cognitive benefits outweigh the risk of cognitive impairment associated with statin use; therefore, the current evidence does not support changing practice with respect to statin use, given this adverse effect.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atorvastatin calcium tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Gastrointestinal Disorders: pancreatitis

General Disorders: fatigue

Hepatobiliary Disorders: fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure

Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis

Injury: tendon rupture

Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, myositis.

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use.

Nervous System Disorders: dizziness, peripheral neuropathy.

There have been rare reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with the use of all statins. Cognitive impairment was generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). There have been rare reports of new-onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, and reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered.

Psychiatric Disorders: depression

Respiratory Disorders: interstitial lung disease

Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis)

Although statins are generally safe and well tolerated, some patients experience muscle complaints that can be attributed to their use. Those with muscle discomfort but no demonstrable muscle weakness or creatine kinase (CK) elevations may have statin-associated muscle symptoms. Individuals with elevated CK levels, with or without muscle discomfort or weakness, may have statin-associated myotoxicity. Rare patients have statin-associated autoimmune myopathy, a disease characterized by proximal muscle weakness, elevated CK levels, and autoantibodies recognizing hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase. In this review, the author provides the clinician with a practical approach to diagnosing and managing patients with each of these statin side effects.

Statin-associated muscle adverse effects — The most frequently reported complaints with statin therapy are skeletal muscle-related symptoms (myalgias). Less commonly, myopathy is defined as unexplained muscle pain or weakness accompanied by creatine kinase (CK) concentration > 10 times the upper limit of normal and occurs in ~1/10,000 patients per year; a rare muscle-related side effect is rhabdomyolysis, characterized by CK typically > 40 times the upper limit of normal, occurring in ~1/100,000 patients per year of treatment.
