## Question

What are common hypertension medications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which hypertension medications are most common and how to categorize them by class, mechanism, and guideline-backed first-line status. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which drug classes are consistently recommended as first-line across major guidelines. Then, I should verify which specific agents within those classes are most frequently used in practice. Next, I will consider special populations and comorbidity-driven choices. After that, I should review combination therapy patterns and single-pill combinations. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable list of the most common medications with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the first-line classes. Across contemporary guidelines, five classes are repeatedly endorsed as foundational: thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and beta-blockers, with the caveat that beta-blockers are generally reserved for compelling indications rather than routine first-line use in uncomplicated hypertension [^88e45e41] [^716b0afa] [^00ddcc1a].

> Wait, let me verify the hierarchy within these classes. Thiazide-type diuretics, CCBs, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs are the core first-line options for most adults, whereas beta-blockers are typically not first-line in uncomplicated hypertension unless there is a compelling indication such as heart failure, ischemic heart disease, or arrhythmia, so I should not overstate beta-blockers as routine first-line even though they remain common in practice [^88e45e41] [^716b0afa] [^00ddcc1a].

> I will now examine the most commonly used agents within each class, starting with thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics. Chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide are the predominant thiazide-type diuretics, with chlorthalidone often preferred in trials and guidelines for its potency and duration, while indapamide is a thiazide-like option frequently used internationally and included on the WHO Essential Medicines List [^29937ba2] [^e3025d91].

> Next, I should review calcium channel blockers. Dihydropyridine CCBs such as amlodipine, felodipine, and nifedipine are the most commonly prescribed, with amlodipine dominating real-world regimens due to efficacy, tolerability, and once-daily dosing; non-dihydropyridine agents like diltiazem and verapamil are used less often for hypertension unless there are specific indications such as arrhythmia control [^notfound].

> Let me consider ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Within ACE inhibitors, lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril, and benazepril are frequently used, with lisinopril and ramipril particularly common in U.S. practice. Among ARBs, losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, and telmisartan are the most prevalent, and both ACE inhibitors and ARBs are first-line alternatives with similar cardiovascular outcome benefits in most patients [^00ddcc1a] [^716b0afa].

> Hold on, I should verify beta-blocker positioning. Metoprolol, carvedilol, and bisoprolol are the beta-blockers most often used when indicated, with carvedilol and bisoprolol favored in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; in uncomplicated hypertension without compelling indications, beta-blockers are generally not first-line due to inferior stroke prevention compared with other classes, so their use should be indication-driven rather than routine [^88e45e41] [^29937ba2].

> I need to check special population nuances. In Black patients, guidelines consistently recommend starting with a thiazide-type diuretic or a CCB because of stronger outcome data, and they advise against starting with an ACE inhibitor as monotherapy in uncomplicated cases. In chronic kidney disease with albuminuria, an ACE inhibitor or ARB is preferred for renal protection. In pregnancy, methyldopa and labetalol are standard antihypertensives. In older adults, many guidelines accept a systolic target of less than 150 mmHg, with individualized consideration of lower targets if tolerated [^a4680c5c] [^b80f8288] [^13f7524b] [^91d434d6].

> Next, I should review combination therapy patterns because most patients require more than one drug. The most common two-class regimens pair an ACE inhibitor or ARB with either a thiazide diuretic or a CCB, with ACEi/ARB plus thiazide being the single most frequent combination in U.S. cohorts; triple therapy typically adds the third class to achieve control, and single-pill combinations are increasingly recommended to improve adherence and simplify titration [^3f1786d9] [^2141ea9f] [^7977282f].

> Let me synthesize the most common medications by class, while keeping the caveat about beta-blockers in mind. Thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics include chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide, and indapamide; CCBs include amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil; ACE inhibitors include lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril, and benazepril; ARBs include losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, and telmisartan; and beta-blockers include metoprolol, carvedilol, and bisoprolol, with the latter two prioritized when heart failure is present [^00ddcc1a] [^716b0afa] [^29937ba2].

> But wait, what if the user is interested in emerging or less common classes. I should briefly note that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as spironolactone and eplerenone are key in resistant hypertension and are often the fourth agent, while alpha-blockers like doxazosin are generally not first-line due to inferior cardiovascular outcomes despite good blood pressure lowering, and direct renin inhibitors like aliskiren have limited routine roles; newer classes such as dual endothelin receptor antagonists are on the horizon for select refractory cases but are not yet first-line [^10724290] [^b80f8288] [^525ee209].

> I should double-check that my synthesis aligns with guideline-backed first-line choices and real-world utilization. The convergence of ESH 2023, ESC 2024, JNC 8, and AAFP guidance supports initiating with one of the four core classes or with a two-drug combination in many patients, and real-world data show ACEi/ARB plus thiazide as the most frequent two-class regimen, reinforcing the clinical relevance of the agents I have highlighted [^88e45e41] [^716b0afa] [^a4680c5c] [^00ddcc1a] [^3f1786d9].

Common hypertension medications include **thiazide diuretics** (chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide), **ACE inhibitors** (lisinopril, enalapril), **ARBs** (losartan, valsartan), **calcium channel blockers** (amlodipine, diltiazem), and **beta-blockers** (metoprolol, carvedilol). These classes are **first-line** because they lower blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular events [^716b0afa] [^a633a2d5]. Thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers are especially recommended for Black patients, while ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred for those with chronic kidney disease or diabetes [^a4680c5c] [^c0eab431]. Most patients require **combination therapy** to reach targets, and single-pill combinations are often used to improve adherence [^2141ea9f] [^f3c96c4f].

## First-line therapy recommendations

Guidelines consistently recommend **thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel blockers** as first-line options [^716b0afa] [^88e45e41]. Beta-blockers are reserved for patients with compelling indications such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, or arrhythmias [^29937ba2].

---

## Combination therapy

Most patients require **combination therapy** to achieve blood pressure targets [^ba5c879e]. Common combinations include an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker [^2141ea9f]. Single-pill combinations are increasingly recommended to improve adherence and simplify regimens [^f3c96c4f] [^7977282f].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Black patients**: Thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers are preferred due to greater efficacy in this population [^a4680c5c] [^29937ba2].
- **Chronic kidney disease or diabetes**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred for their renal protective effects [^a4680c5c] [^c0eab431].
- **Pregnancy**: Methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine are commonly used and considered safe [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies

Recent additions include **dual endothelin receptor antagonists** (e.g. aprocitentan) for resistant hypertension, offering new options for patients unresponsive to traditional therapies [^525ee209].

---

Common hypertension medications include thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers, with selection tailored to patient characteristics and comorbidities. Combination therapy is often necessary, and emerging therapies are expanding options for resistant cases.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^b5cad91b]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, < 14% of adults with hypertension have BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mm Hg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines, developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling. The guidelines recommend BP threshold to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single pill combination medications, and use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. Strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient's values, resource considerations and cost-effectiveness; health equity; acceptability, and feasibility consideration of different treatment options. The goal of the guideline is to facilitate standard approaches to pharmacological treatment and management of hypertension which, if widely implemented, will increase the hypertension control rate world-wide.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^68fc4949]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, with most deaths attributed to hypertension resulting from coronary heart disease or stroke and more than three quarters of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. The level of high blood pressure (BP) is directly related to many adverse outcomes, including CVD and kidney disease. Conversely, clinical trials have repeatedly demonstrated that lowering BP in adults with high baseline BP level provides an effective means for preventing CVD. Definitions of hypertension are useful for clinical decision-making and are typically based on CVD risk and level of BP at which antihypertensive medication is effective for preventing CVD. A common definition of hypertension is based on an average systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, or self-reported use of antihypertensive medication. Using this definition, it has been estimated that ≈1.4 billion adults have hypertension, worldwide, but < 14% have their BP controlled with antihypertensive drug therapy to an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg (< 8% in low- and middle-income countries). Even more disturbing is the recent trend in a high-income country (the United States), where rate of hypertension control to an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg reached a high of close to 54% in 2013 to 2014, but dramatically eroded to < 44% in 2017 to 2018. Given this decrease, the Surgeon General of the United States issued a report for a "Call to Action to Control Hypertension" making the control of hypertension a national priority.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Drug-induced hypertension [^98fb8247]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Untoward side effects of pharmaceuticals can result in considerable morbidity and expense to the health care system. There is likely a sizable fraction of the hypertensive population with disease either induced or exacerbated by polypharmacy. The elevation of blood pressure in drug-induced hypertension occurs through a variety of mechanisms, most notably, sodium and fluid retention, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, alteration of vascular tone, or a combination of these pathways. Recognition of common medications causing drug-induced hypertension is important to effectively control blood pressure. The epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of these agents are discussed.

### Beta-blockers for primary prevention in hypertension: era bygone? [^959e3ab0]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are used commonly worldwide in clinical practice for lowering blood pressure. Most of the agents in this class are efficacious in reducing blood pressure, although they vary widely in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. This variability may confer significant differences in clinical benefits associated with use of specific agents. Although commonly used in managing hypertension, the role of beta-blockers for primary prevention in uncomplicated hypertension has been controversial. Evidence from recent trials suggest relatively poor efficacy toward primary prevention and worse outcomes for certain end points, when compared with other blood pressure-lowering agents, Recently updated National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for England and Wales reflect this concern and have changed the indication for beta-blockers for blood pressure control from primary agents to use as an add-on agent in patients requiring multiple therapy. In this review, considering the extended debate on this topic, we discuss the general properties of beta-blockers and evidence from clinical trials supporting or refuting their use in various clinical scenarios. Newer beta-blockers have additional properties which may be beneficial. Although, whether these additional benefits will help in primary prevention is not clear.

### Common questions about the initial management of hypertension [^c0eab431]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most common chronic condition treated by family physicians. Elevated blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and death. Treatment of hypertension reduces the risk of these events. Several lifestyle modifications are associated with improvements in blood pressure, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, sodium restriction, regular exercise, and moderate weight loss. There is strong evidence that reducing diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg is beneficial in adults older than 30 years. Although there is good evidence to support reducing systolic blood pressure to less than 150 mm Hg in adults older than 60 years, the evidence in younger adults is insufficient to recommend a specific goal. Black patients with chronic kidney disease who are treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg experience slower declines in glomerular filtration rates than patients treated with other medications. A blood pressure goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg is recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease and in those with diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are the preferred medications in nonblack patients; thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers are preferred in black patients.

### Clinical trial design principles and outcomes definitions for device-based therapies for hypertension: a consensus document from the hypertension academic research consortium [^1ad6939b]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite its recognition as the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, the awareness, treatment, and control of blood pressure (BP) have plateaued if not modestly declined. In the United States alone, for example, more than half of individuals with hypertension — representing > 29 million people — are estimated to have BP exceeding professional society and guideline-recommended treatment goals. As the most commonly diagnosed condition and largest contributor to mortality in industrialized countries, hypertension is present in > 1 in 3 individuals, and the risk of cardiovascular mortality doubles for every 20 mm Hg and 10 mm Hg increase in the systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively. With population growth and aging, the global prevalence of hypertension and associated adverse outcomes are expected to continue to escalate.

Irrespective of baseline hypertension severity, even moderate reductions in BP translate into clinically meaningful reductions in cardiac, renal, and cerebral vascular-related adverse events. Recent large randomized clinical trials have also demonstrated the clinical benefits of more intensive BP reduction, leading to revision of guideline-directed treatment goals to further lower SBP and DBP standards. Countering evidence-based efforts to improve BP with a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical therapies are routine challenges in clinical practice that include patient intolerance of medication-related adverse effects, general nonadherence with prescribed therapy, and physician inertia for treatment of an illness that remains largely silent until onset of clinically irreversible conditions.

### JNC 8 guidelines for the management of hypertension in… [^5d59f71b]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In the general population, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg or higher in adults 60 years and older, or 140/90 mm Hg or higher in adults younger than 60 years.
- In patients with hypertension and diabetes, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, regardless of age.
- Initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, or ARB in the general nonblack population or a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker in the general black population.
- If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased, or a second medication should be added.

From the AFP Editors Hypertension is one of the most important preventable contributors to disease and death in the United States, leading to myocardial infarction, stroke, and renal failure when it is not detected early and treated appropriately. The Eighth Joint National Committee recently released evidence-based recommendations on treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Pharmacologic Treatment In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial anti-hypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial treatment should include a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker.

If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased or a second medication should be added. Blood pressure should be monitored and the treatment regimen adjusted until the target blood pressure is reached. Adults with CKD and hypertension should receive an ACE inhibitor or ARB as initial or add-on therapy, based on moderate evidence that these medications improve kidney-related outcomes in these patients.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^e304e24c]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In the above guidelines, the WHO provides the most current and relevant evidence-based global public health guidance on the initiation of treatment with pharmacological agents for hypertension in adults. The guidelines are expected to be valid for a period of 5 years. This period reflects the fact that new research findings are likely to become available in the meantime but also represents a feasible time frame, considering the costs, time and other resources that are needed to update such guidelines. If the evidence base or user needs change before the 5-year mark, consideration will be given to producing updates sooner. More large randomized controlled trials, powered for CVD and/or mortality outcomes, are needed to shed light on the research gaps mentioned in discussion above especially for subpopulations that have not been adequately represented in previous trials.

### Which drug should be used to treat patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension? [^5dd8a901]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent data and guidelines on selecting the initial antihypertensive drug.

Recent Findings

The main driver of benefit from blood pressure-lowering therapy is blood pressure reduction, and there is little evidence supporting additional drug class-specific benefits in primary prevention of major cardiovascular outcomes. The results also confirm that in the patient with uncomplicated hypertension as well as in those patients with diabetes without nephropathy, initial therapy with 'newer therapies' (i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers) are effective, but not more effective than thiazide diuretics, at reducing stroke, coronary heart disease, morbidity or mortality, or all-cause mortality.

Summary

While compelling indications may exist for specific drug classes in those with specific target organ damage (i.e. heart failure, renal insufficiency, and coronary artery disease), thiazide diuretics remain unsurpassed in lowering blood pressure and in preventing hypertension-related clinical outcomes. Despite a more favorable metabolic profile, alpha-blockers are less effective in preventing cardiovascular disease, especially heart failure and stroke. Calcium channel blockers produce a similar reduction in blood pressure and cardiovascular disease outcomes compared with thiazide-type diuretics, although they are consistently less effective in preventing heart failure. In the absence of heart failure or renal disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have shown little advantage in clinical trials over diuretics in preventing cardiovascular disease and are not indicated as an initial therapy in Blacks.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Sex-and gender-based reporting in antihypertensive medication literature informing hypertension guidelines [^45dd6bf7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Globally, hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in men and women. Although the number of adults living with hypertension doubled between 1990 and 2019 to 1.3 billion, 4 of 5 individuals are not adequately treated. Underscoring blood pressure control as 1 of the most important determinants of cardiovascular and kidney health, the World Health Organization has recently set a global target of a 25% relative reduction in the prevalence of increased blood pressure by 2025.

However, despite increasingly recognized sex (biological) and gender (sociocultural) differences in the prevalence, cause, and control of hypertension as well as antihypertensive effects of interventions, clinical recommendations for hypertension management endorse a 1‐size‐fits‐all approach. We assessed the incorporation of sex and gender reporting in the antihypertensive medication literature informing hypertension guidelines.

2014 Hypertension Guideline (JNC 8) — methodology and scope compared with JNC 7: The panel defined critical questions with a methodology team and focused analyses on randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence, including an initial systematic review and subsequent panel review according to a standardized protocol. Definitions of hypertension and prehypertension were not addressed but thresholds for pharmacological treatment were defined; lifestyle modifications were recommended by endorsing the Lifestyle Work Group. Drug therapy recommended selection among 4 specific medication classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEI] or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB], calcium channel blocker [CCB], or diuretics) and doses based on RCT evidence, with specific medication selections for racial, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetic subgroups. The evidence review addressed a limited number of high-priority questions, and the report was reviewed by experts, including those affiliated with professional and public organizations and federal agencies, with no official sponsorship inferred.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^ed44f735]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

Primary Objective

To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane clinical trial register, using standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

Main Results

Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Controversies in hypertension [^2403cb8c]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension remains the most common risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Its incidence is rising in both ageing and obese populations, but its control remains inadequate worldwide. We address several persisting controversies that may interfere with appropriate management of hypertension. They include: the reasons behind the increasing incidence of hypertension and the possible ways to slow the process, especially by lifestyle changes; the need for overall cardiovascular risk assessment; the major issues in the decision to institute drug therapy and the choice of drugs; and the importance of screening for various identifiable causes. We provide the background for these controversies, followed by some opinions on how to guide practitioners to offer more effective management of hypertension.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^8eb2328e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^e3025d91]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

In 1978, the World Health Organization (WHO) published one of the earliest clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of arterial hypertension, which were later updated in 1999 and 2003. In 2007, the WHO published some recommendations for the management of hypertension in guidelines for the assessment and management of total CVD risk. However, these are now outdated considering new evidence and practices. Guidance is particularly needed now on some controversial issues, such as the threshold level of BP at which to start pharmacological treatment and whether laboratory testing and CVD risk assessment are needed before initiating antihypertensive pharmacological therapy. In the past decade, the WHO included diagnosis and management of hypertension in a total CVD risk approach as part of the WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (WHO PEN) 2007, 2010, and 2013. However, this approach preceded recent advances in the pharmacological management of hypertension. More recently, the WHO has provided information about the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the Global HEARTS Initiative including the HEARTS Technical Package and the HEARTS in the Americas Program. However, these too provide general practical information and not specific guidelines and recommendations. The WHO Essential Medicines List includes ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and thiazide diuretics for management of hypertension. In June 2019, single-pill combination antihypertensive medications were added to the WHO Essential Medicines List.

Herein, we summarize the recommendations of the 2021 WHO Guidelines for the Pharmacological Treatment of Hypertension in Adults. They include guidance on the BP threshold for the initiation of pharmacological treatment for hypertension, initial and longer-term visit intervals for follow-up of treated patients, treatment target BP levels, and the best use of health care workers for management of hypertension. The 2021 WHO hypertension guidelines aim to provide the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for pharmacological treatment of hypertension in nonpregnant adults, with a particular focus on practice in middle- and low-income countries.

Although these guidelines do not address modifiable risk factors for hypertension such as unhealthy diet, overweight, obesity, physical inactivity, or consumption of alcohol, a comprehensive treatment plan for hypertension should address these risk factors through lifestyle modifications and other interventions. Likewise, treatment of hypertension should be accompanied by management of other CVD risk factors such as cigarette smoking, diabetes, lipid abnormalities, and comorbid conditions.

### Hypertension: empirical evidence and implications in 2014 [^d6d6cd51]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Comparing treated and non-treated hypertensives

The correct epistemological question is: How much is total and CV mortality decreased if HTN is treated? The number of studies attempting to answer this question are considerably fewer than those comparing normotensives and hypertensives, most of them refer to older peopleand they compare the effectiveness of various types of drugs to treat HTN. Overall, the findings of these studies are even more conflicting than the studies comparing normotensives to hypertensives. Their conclusions range from considerable increases in mortality rates and CV and related disease to significant benefits if HTN is not treated.

A meta-analysison the effects of treatment concluded that "treatment with any commonly-used regimen reduces the risk of total major CV events, and larger reductions in blood pressure produce larger reductions in risk". A study by Gu et al, based on 5086 hypertensive participants with a higher than 140/90 BP, concluded that "uncontrolled and untreated hypertension was associated with increased risk of total and CV mortality among the general hypertensive population". Another study by Barengo et al found that in men, all-cause and CVD mortality was significantly higher in the hypertensive subgroups compared with the normotensive group but in treated and controlled hypertensive women at baseline there was no increase in CVD or all-cause mortality. One more study by Dahlöf et al on people between 70 and 84 years old, found highly significant and clinically relevant reductions in CV morbidity and mortality among patients who treated their HBP.

A study by Gudmundsson et al based on 19 390 participants (9328 men and 10 062 women) aged 33–37 years at the time of attendance from 1967 to 1996 concluded that there were no significant benefits by treating HTN with drugs. Another studyinvestigating the association between CV outcomes and antihypertensive drug treatment for around 30 000 older women found that those receiving no medications compared to those receiving diuretics as monotherapy had a smaller (not statistically significant) risk for CHD, stroke and CVD death. However, the crude CV death rate of hypertensives taking no medication was the lowest (0.011%) compared to those receiving one or two drugs (0.035%) occurring among those taking diuretics and calcium channel blockers. These results occurred even though the baseline SBP of the no medications group was higher (149 mm Hg) than for those receiving drug treatment; the SBPs of the women who were receiving therapy before they began the therapy was unknown.

### Misconceptions and facts about treating hypertension [^e85e464b]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a powerful risk factor strongly linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Because of its high prevalence, health care providers at many levels are involved in treating hypertension. Distinct progress has been made in improving the rates of hypertension awareness and treatment over years, but the overall control of hypertension remains inadequate. Several recent guidelines from different sources have been put forward in an attempt to bridge the gap between existing evidence and clinical practice. Despite this effort, several misconceptions about treating hypertensive cardiovascular disease continue to persist among clinicians. This review highlights some of the misconceptions regarding antihypertensive therapy.

### Hypertension guidelines: criteria that might make them more clinically useful [^6457830e]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease prevention depends on reduction of risk factors, including hypertension. Guidelines designed to improve management of hypertension are widely available. Their purpose is to assemble the available data from basic biomedical science, epidemiology, and clinical science in an accessible form with which physicians and patients can make reasoned decisions for individual cases. However, guidelines have been neither widely accepted, nor effectively implemented. We recommend a strategy for guideline preparation designed to yield a product more user friendly, accessible, and effective. Guideline recommendations and the evidence used to make them should be based on an explicit grading system. Relevant clinical as well as nonclinical factors must be considered. Moreover, because the goal of antihypertensive therapy is to prevent cardiovascular events, and the likelihood of such events is determined by multifactor or absolute risk assessment, risk, rather than level of blood pressure (BP), should determine the need for therapy. Similarly, the benefit of therapy must be assessed by reduction in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.

### Initial antihypertensive regimens in newly treated patients: real world evidence from the oneFlorida + clinical research network [^cbaa3d79]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Hypertension affects an estimated 120 million individuals in the United States and is the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death. Nearly all of these individuals ultimately require antihypertensive therapy to achieve blood pressure control, and as a consequence, several antihypertensive drugs are among the most commonly used medications worldwide. Consensus US and international guidelines have long recommended certain antihypertensive classes as "first‐line" therapies — namely, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and, until relatively recently, β‐blockers. However, for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, guidelines generally do not prioritize any of these classes except in select circumstances, leaving prescribers to choose from some 30 to 40 antihypertensive drugs when initiating antihypertensive therapy.

Real‐world antihypertensive utilization patterns have been studied extensively, but in almost all cases, the focus of these studies has been on treatment patterns in prevalent hypertension cohorts. These studies provide useful insight into overall antihypertensive use in populations. However, they rarely have distinguished between patients who are early in their treatment course from those with long‐standing hypertension and who may have extensive treatment histories and multidrug regimens that have evolved over time. Thus, very little is known about contemporary patterns of early antihypertensive care, including initial antihypertensive regimens and to what extent these accord with care typically recommended in consensus guidelines. These gaps are noteworthy in light of the fact that only ≈1 in 5 US patients with hypertension have blood pressure controlled to < 130/80 mm Hg. Thus, delays in achieving blood pressure control are exceedingly common in routine practice and extend high‐risk periods, leading to worse outcomes. A greater understanding of how antihypertensive regimens emerge and evolve early in therapy may aid in identifying quality care gaps for which interventions can be achieved.

To address this gap, we used the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium (hereafter, OneFlorida+) to characterize initial treatment regimens among a diverse cohort of new users of antihypertensive therapy. We were principally interested in the distribution of classes, specific antihypertensive drugs within classes, how these distributions differed in prespecified demographic and clinical groups, and their trends over time.

### Pharmacogenomics of blood pressure response to antihypertensive treatment [^3ca5349b]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

PURPOSE IDENTIFICATION: Inter-individual variability in blood pressure response to treatment is well documented, but a clinically useful means to distinguish responders from non-responders has been elusive. With the advent of new technologies and genomic knowledge, more investigators are seeking to identify genetic determinants of blood pressure response to therapy.

Study Selection

We identified studies of candidate polymorphisms from an initial PubMed search using the MESH terms 'Hypertension: Drug Therapy' and 'Genetics' or 'Pharmacogenetics', limiting results to English-language publications on studies in human adults. We further identified specific polymorphisms of interest noted in earlier reviews and performed additional PubMed searches based on these candidate genes. Pertinent studies were further extracted from the references of studies already identified. We focused on clinical trials that measured blood pressure response to a medication or class of medications over a minimum of 4 weeks.

Data Extraction

We evaluated studies looking at blood pressure response to commonly used classes of antihypertensive medications by major genetic variants. RESULTS OF ANALYSIS: Although many studies show that blood pressure response to a given class of antihypertensive medications varies by genotype for different polymorphisms, none of the genotypes identified consistently predicted blood pressure response.

Conclusions

Common variants may influence response to diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers, but studies of polymorphisms have generally yielded conflicting results. The inclusion of pharmacogenomic studies in large clinical trials and other more innovative investigative methods may provide greater clarity of the potential role for genotyping in the treatment of patients with hypertension.

### Self-medication among people living with hypertension: a review [^7b3d5aff]. Family Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Self-medication is commonly practised by patients, underpinned by health beliefs that affect their adherence to medication regimens, and impacting on treatment outcomes.

Objectives

This review explores the scope of self-medication practices among people with hypertension, in terms of the scale of use, types of medication and influencing factors.

Method

A comprehensive search of English language, peer-reviewed literature published between 2000 and 2014 was performed. Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria; 22 of these focused on complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs).

Results

Anti-hypertensive medications are listed among the 11% of products that patients reportedly obtain over-the-counter (OTC) for self-medication. On average, 25% of patients use CAMs, mostly herbs, to lower blood pressure. Recommendations by family, friends and neighbours are the most influential factors for self-medication with CAMs. Faith in treatment with CAMs, dissatisfaction with conventional medicine and the desire to reduce medication costs are also cited. Most (70%) patients with hypertension take OTC medicines to treat minor illnesses. The concurrent use of anti-hypertensive medications with analgesics and herbal medicines is commonly practised. The sociodemographic profile of patients engaging in self-medication differs markedly in the articles reviewed; self-medication practices cannot be attributed to a particular profile. Low disclosure of self-medication is consistently reported.

Conclusion

This review highlights a high proportion of people with hypertension practise self-medication. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of self-medication with OTC and anti-hypertensive medications on hypertension treatment. Health professionals involved in hypertension management should be mindful of any types of self-medication practices.

### Medication adherence-still the holy grail [^975c1dcf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

"Drugs don't work in patients who don't take them". C. Everett Koop, MD, Former Surgeon General of the United States, 1982–1989.

Medication therapy is usually a staple in common chronic disease management. Yet, among chronic diseases that are mostly asymptomatic, as hypertension is, medication nonadherence is the norm. While there are many different classes of antihypertensive medications with distinct pharmacologic mechanisms designed to target various underpinnings of hypertension pathophysiology, it is difficult to identify the best agent for a given patient with hypertension, and the reality is that most patients require at least 2 antihypertensive medications to achieve adequate blood pressure (BP) lowering. The usual stepwise approach to hypertension management can be frustrating for patients and providers alike, and contributes to nonadherence and prescribing inertia, respectively.

### Combination therapy for hypertension [^ba5c879e]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Two or more drugs are needed to control blood pressure in the majority of patients with hypertension. The most commonly used combinations include a diuretic; however, results of two large, controlled trials show that better cardiovascular protection is provided by a combination of a renin-angiotensin inhibitor and a long-acting calcium-channel blocker than combinations that include a diuretic.

### Resistant hypertension: a clinical perspective [^69c8fc55]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is a common clinical entity, defined as suboptimal blood pressure response to multiple therapies after excluding medication nonadherence and secondary forms of hypertension. Patients with resistant hypertension generally share several comorbidities. Resistant hypertension is more common in individuals of African descent. Blood pressure should be optimized using multiple strategies, including lifestyle changes and single-pill combination therapies, with the aim of reducing cardiovascular events while reducing side effects from using antihypertensive therapy. A renin/aldosterone-based diagnostic and treatment approach will help tailor therapy. The use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists or amiloride as appropriate is favored.

### Guideline-driven management of hypertension: an evidence-based update [^98e5ce8f]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Several important findings bearing on the prevention, detection, and management of hypertension have been reported since publication of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline. This review summarizes and places in context the results of relevant observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and meta-analyses published between January 2018 and March 2021. Topics covered include blood pressure measurement, patient evaluation for secondary hypertension, cardiovascular disease risk assessment and blood pressure threshold for drug therapy, lifestyle and pharmacological management, treatment target blood pressure goal, management of hypertension in older adults, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, resistant hypertension, and optimization of care using patient, provider, and health system approaches. Presenting new information in each of these areas has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, treatment, and control which remain essential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the future.

### Anti-hypertensive medication combinations in the United States [^6b3386c2]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Examining the anti-hypertensive regimens of individuals with different comorbidities may offer insights into how we can improve hypertension management.

Methods

The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2013–2015) was used to describe the most common single-, two-, three-, and four-drug hypertension regimens among hypertensive adults in four different comorbidity groups: 1. Hypertension only; 2. Hypertension and diabetes; 3. Hypertension and cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease or stroke history); and 4. Hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

Results

15,901 adults with hypertension taking anti-hypertensive medications were included in the study. 58.6% (95% CI: 57.3–59.8) took multiple anti-hypertensive medications, but the proportion of adults taking multiple anti-hypertensives varied by comorbidity group. Regimens including an ACE-inhibitor/ARB were the most prevalent regimens among individuals taking ≥ 2 anti-hypertensive medications. The most common two-drug regimen for both the hypertension-only and hypertension-diabetes groups was an ACE-inhibitor/ARB with thiazide. The most prevalent regimen for the two cardiovascular disease groups was an ACE-inhibitor/ARB with beta-blocker.

Conclusions

Most individuals with hypertension use between 2–5 medications and the medications comprising these regimens vary by comorbidity. The ACCOMPLISH trial suggested that certain combinations may lead to superior cardiovascular outcomes. Research comparing the efficacy of different hypertension medication combinations among individuals with different comorbidities could lead to better patient hypertensionrelated outcomes.

### Hypertension: empirical evidence and implications in 2014 [^284e373b]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

High blood pressure (HBP) or hypertension (HTN) is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Despite this fact, there is widespread agreement that the treatment of HBP, over the last half century, has been a great achievement. However, after the release of the new Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure-8 (JNC-8) guidelines, there have been heated debates with regard to what are the most evidence-based blood pressure goals. While JNC-8 claims that the goal blood pressure for otherwise healthy patients with mild hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140–159 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90–99 mm Hg) should be < 140/90 mm Hg; a recent Cochrane meta-analysis is in direct conflict with these recommendations. Indeed, a 2012 Cochrane meta-analysis indicated that there is no evidence that treating otherwise healthy mild hypertension patients with antihypertensive therapy will reduce CV events or mortality. Additionally, the Cochrane meta-analysis showed that antihypertensive therapy was associated with a significant increase in withdrawal due to adverse events. Thus, the current evidence in the literature does not support the goals set by the JNC-8 guidelines. In this review we discussed the strengths and limitations of both lines of evidence and why it takes an evidence-based medication to reduce CV events/mortality (eg, how a goal blood pressure is achieved is more important than getting to the goal). As medications inherently cause side effects and come at a cost to the patient, the practice of evidence-based medicine becomes exceedingly important. Although the majority of HTN studies claim great advantages by lowering HBP, this review finds severe conflicts in the findings among the various HTN studies, as well as serious epistemological, methodological and statistical problems that cast doubt to such claims.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^807a661f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

High-value care in hypertension for adults aged 60 years or older — most patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 150 mm Hg or greater who receive antihypertensive medications will benefit, with acceptable harms and costs, from treatment to a blood pressure (BP) target of less than 150/90 mm Hg. When prescribing drug therapy, clinicians should select generic formulations over brand-name drugs, which have similar efficacy, reduced cost, and therefore better adherence, and clinicians should consider the patient's treatment burden. Because some patients may have falsely elevated readings in clinical settings ("white-coat hypertension"), it is important to ensure accurate BP measurement before initiating or changing treatment of hypertension, and the most accurate measurements come from multiple BP measurements made over time.

### Analysis of dual combination therapies used in treatment of hypertension in a multinational cohort [^5a9f3d8e]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is the leading global risk factor associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease, contributing worldwide to more than 7 million deaths and 57 million disability-adjusted life-years annually. In 2015, approximately 1.13 billion adults had hypertension, yet fewer than 30% had achieved their blood pressure control goal. Notably, the burden of hypertension is particularly salient in the Asia Pacific region, given that this region has 60% of the world's population and has experienced a rapid increase in prevalence of hypertension since 1980.

Approximately 70% of patients with hypertension cannot achieve their blood pressure control goal with monotherapy. Despite the wide availability of antihypertensive agents, considerable uncertainty remains regarding the optimal choice for a second agent for use in escalation from monotherapy. Clinical trials lack head-to-head comparisons of second antihypertensive agents added to monotherapy, and only 2 trials (Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living With Systolic Hypertension [ACCOMPLISH]and Combination Therapy of Hypertension to Prevent Cardiovascular Events [COPE]) directly compared combination regimens in patients with hypertension who required 2 drugs. These trials, however, provided comparisons between few agents, not drug classes; included primarily patients from Western countries; and did not systematically assess heterogeneity in patient subgroups. The absence of head-to-head comparison in clinical trials has limited the ability of clinical guidelines to provide recommendations about the preferred choice of second medication for treatment escalation. However, it is plausible that not all dual combination therapies have the same mean risks and benefits. Moreover, some combinations may be associated with better outcomes in particular patient subgroups. Evidence about the choice of medication in escalating treatment to 2 agents may better inform clinical decisions and provide needed evidence for practice guidelines.

### 'Essential'arterial hypertension: time for a paradigm change [^be6a01af]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Essential hypertension is a life-sentence

Labelling a patient as affected by essential hypertension is not without serious consequences, because this is a chronic condition that, albeit treatable, is by definition incurable, since its cause(s) and underlying mechanisms are unknown. In the best scenario, following current guidelines, the patient diagnosed with essential hypertension will be instructed to implement lifestyle changes and will be prescribed antihypertensive medications, both of which measures should last life-long. Moreover, the need for antihypertensive medications usually increases over time, along with the development of organ damage. More often, the patient will only receive drug prescription which, while controlling the high BP values only in a proportion of the cases, will not eliminate the excess cardiovascular risk associated with persistently high BP in many patients, leaving them with a 'residual risk'. Over time, several patients requiring an escalating dose of a single agent and/or more antihypertensive agents will experience side effects with the treatment. These two facts are known to negatively impact on patient's adherence to long-term treatment and contribute, along with other factors, to the disappointing control rate of high BP worldwide.

On the contrary, identification of secondary hypertension, and institution of treatment targeting the underlying cause, will permit to achieve cure of high BP and/or a decreased need for medications in most of the cases. Therefore, the arguments to encourage doctors to undertake all the efforts that are necessary to identify a curable cause of hypertension are strong.

### Fixed-drug combinations as first-line treatment for hypertension [^598d0d5d]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

As combinations of drugs from different classes that have synergistic or additive effect and properties to cancel out each others' untoward hemodynamic and metabolic effects become more and more widely used, their use as first-line therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed hypertensive patients is growing in popularity as well. The possibility to begin therapy with a fixed 2-drug combination may be preferable to starting with monotherapy followed by upward titration and addition of other agents. More and more combinations are coming out on the market and proving their effectiveness in randomized controlled trials and in large multicenter studies. One suggestion is the "polypill", a fixed combination of multiple agents that address various components of the metabolic syndrome and coexisting common risk factors in both high-risk patients with conditions requiring polypharmacy, and in healthy asymptomatic individuals.

### Optimal systolic blood pressure target, time to intensification, and time to follow-up in treatment of hypertension: population based retrospective cohort study [^b61b9a8c]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is the single most common risk factor for both cardiovascular and overall disease burden and mortality worldwide, and the medical treatment of hypertension mitigates this risk. Management of hypertension is also among the most common reasons for ambulatory visits to physicians' clinics among non-pregnant adults worldwide. However, many key aspects of optimal medical management for hypertension remain unclear.

The evidence that medically treating patients with stage 1 (140–159 mm Hg) systolic hypertension improves outcomes is limited, and current guidelines differ substantially in their recommendations for management. In addition, for all patients little evidence is available to guide the optimal time interval between measurement of elevated blood pressure and addition or dose escalation of antihypertensive medications ("medication intensification") or between medication intensification and follow-up measurement of blood pressure. Routine clinical practice differs from clinical trials in that substantial delays may exist between the observation of an elevated blood pressure and medication intensification, or between medication intensification and follow-up measurement of blood pressure, but the effect of such delays on patients' outcomes is not understood.

We therefore did a retrospective cohort study to investigate the systolic intensification threshold, time to intensification, and time to follow-up that are associated with the lowest risk of cardiovascular events or death.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of nonselective β-blockers for primary hypertension [^4fcf4687]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers are one of the classes of drugs frequently used to treat hypertension. Quantifying the blood pressure (BP) lowering effects of nonselective beta-blockers provides important information that aids clinical decision making.

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related effects of nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as compared with placebo in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel or cross-over trials. Studies had to contain a nonselective beta-blocker monotherapy arm with a fixed dose. Participants enrolled into the studies had to have primary hypertension at baseline. Duration of studies had to be between three and 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (GW and AL) independently confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data.

Main Results

We included 25 RCTs that evaluated the BP lowering effects of seven nonselective beta-blockers in 1264 people with hypertension. Among the 25 RCTs, four were parallel studies and 21 were cross-over studies. Overall, nonselective beta-blockers lowered systolic BP and diastolic BP compared with placebo. Nonselective beta-blockers, in the recommended dose range, did not showed a convincing dose-response relationship by direct comparison. The once (1x) and twice (2x) starting dose subgroups contained the largest sample size. The estimate of BP lowering efficacy for nonselective beta-blockers by combining the 1x and 2x starting dose subgroup was -10 mmHg (95% CI -11 to -8) for systolic BP and -7 mmHg (95% CI -8 to -6) for diastolic BP (low-quality evidence). Nonselective beta-blockers starting at the 1x recommended starting doses lowered heart rate by 12 beats per minute (95% CI 10 to 13) (low-quality evidence). The dose-response relationship in heart rate was evident by both direct and indirect comparison. Due to imprecision, there was no clear evidence of an effect of nonselective beta-blockers on pulse pressure in any dose subgroups except for a small reduction with the 2x starting dose (-2.2 mmHg, 95% CI -3.7 to -0.7) (very low quality evidence). The point estimates in the 1x, four times (4x) and eight times (8x) starting dose subgroups were similar to the 2x starting dose subgroup. Therefore, it would appear that if nonselective beta-blockers do lower pulse pressure, the magnitude is likely to be about 2 mmHg. There were very limited data (two studies) on withdrawals due to adverse effects (risk ratio (RR) 0.84; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.82).

Authors' Conclusions

In people with mild-to-moderate hypertension, nonselective beta-blockers lowered peak BP by a mean of -10/-7 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) and reduced heart rate by 12 beats per minute. Propranolol and penbutolol were the two drugs that contributed to most of the data for nonselective beta-blockers. This estimate is likely exaggerated due to the presence of extreme outliers and other sources of bias. If we removed the extreme outliers from the analysis, the estimate for non-selective beta-blockers was lower (-8/-5 mmHg (systolic/diastolic)). Nonselective beta-blockers did not show a convincing graded dose-response in the recommended dose range for systolic BP and diastolic BP, while higher dose nonselective beta-blockers provided greater reduction of heart rate. Using higher dose nonselective beta-blockers might cause more side effects, such as bradycardia, without producing an additional BP lowering effect. The effect of nonselective beta-blockers on pulse pressure was likely small, at about 2 mmHg.

JNC 8 — Recommendation 9 (treatment strategy and titration) states that the main objective of hypertension treatment is to attain and maintain goal blood pressure (BP). If goal BP is not reached within a month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug from one of the classes in recommendation 6 (thiazide-type diuretic, CCB, ACEI, or ARB), and the clinician should continue to assess BP and adjust the treatment regimen until goal BP is reached. If goal BP cannot be reached with 2 drugs, add and titrate a third drug from the list provided; do not use an ACEI and an ARB together in the same patient. If goal BP cannot be reached using the strategy in recommendation 6 because of a contraindication or the need to use more than 3 drugs to reach goal BP, antihypertensive drugs from other classes can be used. Expert Opinion – Grade E.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^0041cbd1]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Despite assertions to the contrary, there is greater congruity between the 2017 ACC/AHA and 2018 ESC/ESH CPGs than previous BP guidelines on each side of the Atlantic. Additional harmonization of the 2 guidelines in the future would be helpful. Ways to achieve this goal could include the use of processes that better approximate each other, liaison membership from each writing committee to the other, temporal synchronization of guideline preparation allowing ongoing communication between writing committees, structured open discussion of the science underpinning recommendations by the writing committees and sharing systematic reviews related to key questions, peer review of each report by members of the other guideline writing committee, and joint presentations/publications, such as the one provided here, to compare the ACC/AHA and the ESC/ESH recommendations and to place them in the context of the populations and practice communities for which they are being written. Much of this is already happening to some extent, but it is informal and would likely benefit from a more structured approach. The ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guidelines have a common purpose of assisting clinicians, the public health community, and the public in achieving the goal of better health. Current rates of treatment and control of hypertension, however defined, remain suboptimal in Europe and the United States. The more convergent the major American and European guideline recommendations are with each other, the more unified the message to patients, clinicians, professional societies, governmental agencies, and the public. Greater congruence would thus be expected to underscore a common purpose and command the attention necessary to catalyze changes in practice leading to improvement in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control in the future.

### Consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension [^60d930f5]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Box.
Criteria for Classification of Recommendations

We found inconsistent guidance for a disconcertingly high proportion of reference recommendations. This suggests that clinicians evaluating and treating hypertension are often faced with impossible expectations, in that following one guideline's recommendations would mean going against recommendations from another guideline.

Regardless of measures taken to improve CPG development, a high degree of consistency and strong guidance may be unrealistic in hypertension management. The direct evidence for precise actions is often limited, the thresholds for action are often more continuous than binary, and the relative importance of benefits and harms is sensitive to an individual patient's values and preferences.

### Worldwide trends in hypertension prevalence and progress in treatment and control from 1990 to 2019: a pooled analysis of 1201 population-representative studies with 104 million participants [^fec9ef56]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension, along with pre-hypertension and other hazardously high blood pressure, is responsible for 8.5 million deaths from stroke, ischaemic heart disease, other vascular diseases, and renal disease worldwide. Hypertension can be detected in the community and primary care facilities, and several effective drugs are available at fairly low cost for treating patients with hypertension and reducing the risk of its sequelae. Improving the effective coverage of treatment for patients with hypertension is an objective of many global, regional, and national initiatives, and programmes.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) for articles published from inception to Jan 15, 2021, using the search terms ((hypertension[Title] AND (((medication OR treatment) AND control) OR aware*) AND "blood pressure") OR (cardiovascular[Title] AND risk factor*[Title] AND "blood pressure" AND (((medication OR treatment) AND control) OR aware*))) AND (trend* OR global OR worldwide) NOT patient*[Title]. No language restrictions were applied. We found a few multi-country studies that reported hypertension prevalence, treatment, and control. These studies used up to 135 data sources that had sampled from national or sub-national populations or data from small communities. Few multi-country studies reported trends over time. The largest of these analyses covered snapshots in 2000 and 2010 and grouped countries into high income versus low income and middle income. We also found several studies that analysed trends in individual countries. To our knowledge, there is no study on long-term trends in, nor the contemporary levels of, hypertension prevalence, detection, treatment, and control that covers the entire world.

### Novel pharmacological approaches to lowering blood pressure and managing hypertension [^525ee209]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension is the leading cause of death globally, primarily due to its strong association with cardiovascular disease. The global prevalence of hypertension has surged over the past three decades, driven by rising rates of diabetes mellitus and obesity. Despite current antihypertensive therapies, only a small proportion of patients with hypertension achieve adequate blood pressure control, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies. In this Review we explore the challenges and emerging opportunities in hypertension management. Aprocitentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, is the first agent from a novel class of antihypertensive drug to be licensed since 2007 and exemplifies innovative treatments on the horizon. Here we also address the complex factors contributing to poor hypertension control, including genetic influences, lifestyle factors, therapeutic inertia and poor patient adherence. We discuss the limitations of existing therapies and highlight promising new pharmacological approaches to hypertension management. Integrating these novel treatments alongside current pharmaceuticals combined with improved diagnostic and management strategies could substantially reduce the global burden of hypertension and associated cardiovascular disease.

### Managing hypertension using combination therapy… [^bd7fbec6]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Choice of Agents Figure 1 is an algorithm that can guide combination therapy in patients with hypertension. 1, 6 JNC8, ESC, and ACC/AHA guidelines agree that for most patients, combination therapy should include a thiazide diuretic, a CCB, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARB. They further agree that a patient should not take an ACEI and ARB simultaneously. 4–6 Therapy should be escalated at one-month intervals using any of the three accepted strategies.
6. The ACC/AHA recommends chlortha lidone as the preferred thiazide diuretic and recommends that central-acting alpha agonists be avoided. 4 JNC8 recommends that for black patients, at least one agent should be a thiazide diuretic or CCB. 6 Other drug classes may be considered for patients who do not achieve adequate blood pressure control on maximal triple therapy, or for those with comorbidities such as heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease with proteinuria.

4–6 Table 4 lists fixed-dose combination medications that are currently available. 1, 5. 31 The JNC8 found insufficient evidence to recommend preferential use of ACEIs or ARBs in patients with heart failure and hypertension 6; however, the JNC8 recommendations were published before the PARADIGM-HF results. The beta blockers carvedilol, extended-release metoprolol, and bisoprolol have shown improvements in morbidity and mortality. One of these agents should be initiated in patients with HFrEF unless they have contraindications. 32–34 Beta blockers are usually added once the patient no longer has symptoms of volume overload. ACEIs and ARBs reduce proteinuria and decrease progression to end-stage renal disease in patients with proteinuria.

DIABETES Using a fixed-dose combination of an ACEI and a thiazide diuretic in adults with diabetes, the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension trial showed that a blood pressure decrease of 5. 6/2. 2 mm Hg led to lower rates of microvascular and macrovascular events and of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

### Resistant hypertension: a review of diagnosis and management [^10724290]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Resistant hypertension-uncontrolled hypertension with 3 or more antihypertensive agents-is increasingly common in clinical practice. Clinicians should exclude pseudoresistant hypertension, which results from nonadherence to medications or from elevated blood pressure related to the white coat syndrome. In patients with truly resistant hypertension, thiazide diuretics, particularly chlorthalidone, should be considered as one of the initial agents. The other 2 agents should include calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for cardiovascular protection. An increasing body of evidence has suggested benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as eplerenone and spironolactone, in improving blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension, regardless of circulating aldosterone levels. Thus, this class of drugs should be considered for patients whose blood pressure remains elevated after treatment with a 3-drug regimen to maximal or near maximal doses. Resistant hypertension may be associated with secondary causes of hypertension including obstructive sleep apnea or primary aldosteronism. Treating these disorders can significantly improve blood pressure beyond medical therapy alone. The role of device therapy for treating the typical patient with resistant hypertension remains unclear.

### Hypertension in pregnancy [^13f7524b]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy. Preeclampsia, in particular, is associated with substantial risk to both the mother and the fetus. Several risk factors have been recognized to predict risk for preeclampsia. However, at present no biomarkers have sufficient discriminatory ability to be useful in clinical practice, and no effective preventive strategies have yet been identified. Commonly used medications for the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy include methyldopa and labetalol. Blood pressure thresholds for initiating antihypertensive therapy are higher than outside of pregnancy. Women with prior preeclampsia are at increased risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease.

### Developing hypertension guidelines: an evolving process [^89afb108]. American Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertension guidelines provide up-to-date information and recommendations for hypertension management to healthcare providers, and they facilitate translation of new knowledge into clinical practice. Guidelines represent consensus statements by expert panels, and the process of guideline development has inherent vulnerabilities. Between 1977 and 2003, under the direction of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) issued 7 reports. The evolution of the JNC recommendations reflects the acquisition of observational and clinical trial data and the availability of newer antihypertensive drugs. Despite 5 years in preparation, NIH did not release a JNC 8 report and recently made the decision to withdraw from issuing guidelines. The responsibility for issuing hypertension-related guidelines was transferred to the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology. Without the endorsement of the NIH or the AHA, JNC 8 committee members recently published their guideline report. Notably, there have been discrepancies of JNC recommendations over time as well as discrepancies with recommendations of other professional organizations. The Institute of Medicine recently recommended criteria for "trustworthy" guidelines. Criticisms of the guideline process, and of the guidelines themselves, should not obscure their likely contribution to improved hypertension control and to decreases of mortality rates of stroke and cardiovascular disease over the past several decades. Nevertheless, translation of guidelines into clinical practice remains a challenge.

### General practitioners' perspectives, preferences, and practices in prescribing antihypertensive medication in primary, uncomplicated hypertension [^bfb96376]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

International guidelines consider most antihypertensive medication (AHM) classes as equivalent options for treating primary hypertension. However, limited research has examined whether general practitioners (GPs) share this view or have specific prescribing preferences. Understanding GPs' perspectives is crucial for identifying how guidelines are implemented in daily practice. This study explores the perspectives, preferences, and prescribing practices of Dutch GPs regarding AHM classes in patients with primary hypertension who have no cardiovascular comorbidities or diabetes.

Methods

We conducted a qualitative study with semi-structured interviews among Dutch GPs. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed.

Results

We interviewed 18 Dutch GPs (56% female) and identified three key themes: contextual factors when initiating treatment, preferences for AHM classes, and considerations on combination therapy. GPs consider lifestyle modifications, patient age, and initial blood pressure (BP) when deciding on treatment. Most GPs do not view all AHM classes as interchangeable, with their preferences shaped by perceived efficacy, side effects, and patient-specific factors, including ethnicity and patient preferences. GPs often favour a gradual titration approach, starting with one class before adjusting the dosage or adding another.

Conclusion

GPs adopt a multifaceted, patient-centred approach to hypertension, prioritizing lifestyle interventions and weighing short-term risks against long-term benefits. We identified several discrepancies between guideline recommendations and everyday practice-particularly regarding the perceived non-equivalence of AHM classes and limited support for initiating combination therapy. Incorporating GPs' perspectives into guideline development may lead to more practical, tailored recommendations that improve adherence and patient outcomes in real-world care.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^ac07c61d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias, and performed data entry. The primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial), and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarised data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This update included one new study in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. As none of the four included studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment, we asked investigators for data for this subgroup. One study (PREVER-treatment 2016) used a combination of thiazide-type diuretic/potassium-sparing diuretic; as the former is not indicated in monotherapy, we analysed this study separately. The three original trials in the main comparison (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants) included outpatients, mostly European and white people. Two trials only included people with type 2 diabetes; the remaining trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia, or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. It is very uncertain whether combination therapy versus monotherapy reduces total mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 21.72), cardiovascular mortality (zero events reported), cardiovascular events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.41), serious adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92), or withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.35); all outcomes had 568 participants, and the evidence was rated as of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and for using a subgroup that was not defined in advance. The confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit. The PREVER-treatment 2016 trial, which used a combination therapy with potassium-sparing diuretic (monotherapy: 84 participants; combination therapy: 116 participants), included outpatients. This trial was conducted in Brazil and had a follow-up of 18 months. The number of events was very low and confidence intervals very wide, with zero events reported for cardiovascular mortality and withdrawals due to adverse events. It is very uncertain if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants, and hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the review question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

4.3 Pharmacological interventions

Pharmacological treatment of HTN plays a central role in its management. Several drugs have been developed and proven effective in the treatment of HTN. However, the use of antihypertensive medication differs widely by world region. Overall, the use of antihypertensive medication is more common in high‐income versus middle‐ or low‐income regions (56% vs. 29%). The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study showed that overall control was worst in low‐income and lower‐middle‐income countries (11%), compared with 19% in high‐income countries and 16% in upper‐middle‐income countries. Some reasons for the low frequency of treatment and control of HTN included insufficient therapy and poor access to the healthcare system.

HTN guidelines support low‐dose pharmacological therapy initially and subsequent up‐titration and/or addition of new drugs based on the achieved BP and tolerability, as low‐dose combinations of antihypertensive agents are more effective in BP‐lowering and well‐tolerated than high‐dose monotherapies. A single‐pill combination of drugs at lower doses is recommended as it may provide improvements in adherence, efficacy, and tolerability of therapy, and most of the patients will require two or more drugs to achieve de BP targets. In 2019, single‐pill antihypertensive drug combinations were listed on the WHO Essential Medicine list. Nowadays single‐pill combinations exist with two or three antihypertensive agents.

Clinician therapeutic inertia is a contributing factor for failure to achieve BP targets. Prescription of a fixed‐dose combination when initiating antihypertensive treatment may overcome therapeutic inertia as it can reduce the number of follow‐up visits needed and has been demonstrated to achieve a higher rate of BP control.

Inadequate supplies of essential antihypertensive drugs are a major barrier to the delivery of optimal care for the management of HTN in low‐resource settings. Relying on simple treatment protocols with specific drugs and doses at each step is recommended to facilitate the procurement of large volumes of medicines of choice, which simplifies the supply chain and lower prices.

Another important aspect relates to low adherence to anti‐hypertensive medication, which remains a major contributing factor to uncontrolled BP. Barriers to achieve high medical adherence are multifactorial and include complex medication regimens, convenience factors (e.g. dosing and frequency), forgetfulness, issues with treatment of asymptomatic disease (including fear of possible or experienced adverse events and perceived lack of treatment benefit), cost of treatment and limited access to care.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^69f07091]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance. Confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants and, hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### Evaluation and management of resistant hypertension: core curriculum 2024 [^f20b1974]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above goal despite confirmed adherence to 3 first-line antihypertensive agents or when blood pressure is controlled with 4 or more medications at maximal or maximally tolerated doses. In addition to meeting these criteria, identifying patients with true resistant hypertension requires both accurate in-office blood pressure measurement as well as excluding white coat effects through out-of-office blood pressure measurements. Patients with resistant hypertension are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events and are more likely to have a potentially treatable secondary cause contributing to their hypertension. Effective treatment of resistant hypertension includes ongoing lifestyle modifications and collaboration with patients to detect and address barriers to optimal medication adherence. Pharmacologic treatment should prioritize optimizing first-line, once daily, longer acting medications followed by the stepwise addition of second-, third-, and fourth-line agents as tolerated. Physicians should systematically evaluate for and address any underlying secondary causes. A coordinated, multidisciplinary team approach including clinicians with experience in treating resistant hypertension is essential. New treatment options, including both pharmacologic and device-based therapies, have recently been approved, and more are in the pipeline; their optimal role in the management of resistant hypertension is an area of ongoing research.

### Case-based applications of the 2025 AHA / ACC / multispecialty high blood pressure guideline [^12c9db79]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects nearly half of all adults in the United States and is the leading, preventable cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide. The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and 11 other professional organizations recently published an updated 2025 guideline to reflect the latest advances in the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure. To bridge the gap between this guideline update and individualized patient care, this Special Article presents 4 hypothetical cases of high blood pressure, focusing on management in the outpatient setting. These cases illustrate how to apply a risk-based approach to high blood pressure management that incorporates blood pressure levels, cardiovascular disease risk factors and the predicting risk of cardiovascular disease events cardiovascular disease equations. They also highlight notable updates in the 2025 guideline such as recommendations for lifestyle approaches, initiation of medications, blood pressure goals, primary aldosteronism screening, and management of high blood pressure before, during and after pregnancy. By contextualizing the 2025 guideline within these hypothetical case scenarios, this Special Article provides practical guidance to health care teams to offer the most up-to-date, evidence-based care of high blood pressure.

### Resistant hypertension: diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association professional education committee of the council for high blood pressure research [^26b078d2]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

Resistant hypertension is a common clinical problem faced by both primary care clinicians and specialists. While the exact prevalence of resistant hypertension is unknown, clinical trials suggest that it is not rare, involving perhaps 20% to 30% of study participants. As older age and obesity are 2 of the strongest risk factors for uncontrolled hypertension, the incidence of resistant hypertension will likely increase as the population becomes more elderly and heavier. The prognosis of resistant hypertension is unknown, but cardiovascular risk is undoubtedly increased as patients often have a history of long-standing, severe hypertension complicated by multiple other cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. The diagnosis of resistant hypertension requires use of good blood pressure technique to confirm persistently elevated blood pressure levels. Pseudoresistance, including lack of blood pressure control secondary to poor medication adherence or white coat hypertension, must be excluded. Resistant hypertension is almost always multifactorial in etiology. Successful treatment requires identification and reversal of lifestyle factors contributing to treatment resistance; diagnosis and appropriate treatment of secondary causes of hypertension; and use of effective multidrug regimens. As a subgroup, patients with resistant hypertension have not been widely studied. Observational assessments have allowed for identification of demographic and lifestyle characteristics associated with resistant hypertension, and the role of secondary causes of hypertension in promoting treatment resistance is well documented; however, identification of broader mechanisms of treatment resistance is lacking. In particular, attempts to elucidate potential genetic causes of resistant hypertension have been limited. Recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of resistant hypertension remain largely empiric due to the lack of systematic assessments of 3 or 4 drug combinations. Studies of resistant hypertension are limited by the high cardiovascular risk of patients within this subgroup, which generally precludes safe withdrawal of medications; the presence of multiple disease processes (eg, sleep apnea, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic disease) and their associated medical therapies, which confound interpretation of study results; and the difficulty in enrolling large numbers of study participants. Expanding our understanding of the causes of resistant hypertension and thereby potentially allowing for more effective prevention and/or treatment will be essential to improve the long-term clinical management of this disorder.

### The use of single-pill combinations as first-line treatment for hypertension: translating guidelines into clinical practice [^b1623a3f]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2008 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend the first-line prescription of two antihypertensive drugs in single-pill combinations (SPCs), also known as fixed-dose combinations, for the treatment of most patients with hypertension. This recommendation is based on a large amount of data, which shows that first-line treatment with SPCs supports reaching blood pressure targets rapidly and reducing cardiovascular outcome risk while keeping the therapeutic strategies as simple as possible and fostering adherence and persistence. As this approach constitutes a big shift from the stepped-care approaches that have been dominant for many years, practicing physicians have expressed concerns about using SPCs as first-line agents. In this review, we will discuss the barriers to the uptake of this recommendation. We will also offer suggestions to reduce the impact of these barriers and address specific concerns that have been raised.

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^bbf9517c]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension, but currently systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each. Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. Data from trials clearly indicate that, for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of < 150 mm Hg and a DBP of < 90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower — SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg. As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy. Because controlling BP to < 140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

In the general population aged ≥ 60 years, if pharmacologic treatment for high BP results in lower achieved SBP (eg, < 140 mm Hg) and treatment is well tolerated and without adverse effects on health or quality of life, treatment does not need to be adjusted (Expert Opinion - Grade E).

If goal BP is not achieved with 2 drugs, select a third drug from the list (thiazide-type diuretic, CCB, ACEI, or ARB), avoid the combined use of ACEI and ARB, and titrate the third drug up to the maximum recommended dose to achieve goal BP.

### Hypertension [^dd5d6ad3]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Raised blood pressure is the biggest single contributor to the global burden of disease and to global mortality. The numbers of people affected and the prevalence of high blood pressure worldwide are expected to increase over the next decade. Preventive strategies are therefore urgently needed, especially in less developed countries, and management of hypertension must be optimised. Genetic advances in some rare causes of hypertension have been made lately, but the aggregate effect on blood pressure of all the genetic loci identified to date is small. Hence, intervention on key environmental determinants and effective implementation of trial-based therapies are needed. Three-drug combinations can control hypertension in about 90% of patients but only if resources allow identification of patients and drug delivery is affordable. Furthermore, assessment of optimal drug therapy for each ethnic group is needed.

### Are there benefits to specific antihypertensive drug therapy? [^457ccf62]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

The antihypertensive drug classes that have reduced cardiovascular events safely either in large placebo-controlled trials or in comparison with other effective antihypertensive drugs in large morbidity trials are diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Although control of blood pressure (BP) is a primary goal of therapy, evidence from several clinical trials suggests that certain antihypertensive agents provide clinical benefits independent of their effect on BP. In the recently reported Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), an ACE inhibitor, a CCB, and an alpha-blocker reduced coronary events and mortality to a similar extent as a thiazide-type diuretic, but the diuretic reduced one or more major cardiovascular events, especially heart failure, more than the other agents. In the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) trial, the ARB losartan reduced cardiovascular morbidity (primarily stroke) more than the beta-blocker atenolol. Although an ARB has not yet been compared with a diuretic in a morbidity trial, as most patients require more than one drug to control BP, and a diuretic plus an ARB is a very effective and well-tolerated combination, this uncertainty applies to a minority of patients. A primary goal in treating hypertension should be to reach a patient's goal BP, but initial selection of drugs based on hypertension morbidity study results and other compelling indications should be given priority.

Antihypertensive Drug Treatment Strategy

As outlined in Tables 6–8, both guidelines recommend use of agents from the following 4 drug classes: diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in adults with no compelling indication for selection of a specific BP-lowering medication.

The ACC/AHA indicates a preference for the longer-acting thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone compared with other diuretic agents because chlorthalidone was the diuretic used in many of the landmark event–based randomized clinical trials. Both guidelines advise combination therapy in most adults with hypertension (usually, an initial combination of ACE inhibitors or ARB, a diuretic, and/or a CCB). The ACC/AHA specifically recommends combination therapy for Black patients and for adults with more severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and an average SBP/DBP > 20/10 mm Hg above their target BP). In addition, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends that initial antihypertensive drug therapy in Black patients should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. The ESC/ESH guideline also recommends that initial treatment in most Black patients should be with a 2-drug combination, comprising a diuretic and CCB, either in combination with each other or with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The ACC/AHA notes that single-pill combinations improve treatment adherence but may contain lower-than-optimal doses of the thiazide diuretic component. The ESC/ESH recommends a core drug combination treatment strategy for most patients including patients with uncomplicated hypertension, patients with HMOD, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or peripheral artery disease. This strategy comprises initial dual combination therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB and CCB or diuretic), preferably in a single-pill combination, followed, if still above target BP, by triple therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB, CCB and diuretic) using a single-pill combination, followed if still above the target by the addition of spironolactone or other diuretic, α-blocker, or β-blocker and consideration of referral to a specialist center. Both guidelines recommend against simultaneous use of ACE inhibitors and ARB. Likewise, both guidelines provide specific advice on choice of BP-lowering medications in adults with hypertension and various comorbidities/conditions, and in special patient groups, as well. In the ESC/ESH guidelines, β-blockers are considered to be first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with a specific indication for their use, because, in comparison with other BP-lowering drugs, β-blockers are usually equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events with the exception of less efficacy for stroke prevention. Therefore, their use is primarily recommended in specific (most importantly cardiac) indications and in pregnant women or women planning pregnancy.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^747df5ae]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hypertension — initial combination therapy considerations: Combination therapy for treating HTN is common, and the ACCOMPLISH study confirmed that combination therapy is safe and effective. In ALLHAT, only 26% of participants reached goal blood pressure (< 140/90 mm Hg) with monotherapy, and larger reductions of blood pressure (e.g., 20/10 mm Hg or more) often require at least two medications; initiating therapy with two drugs is effective and well tolerated, apart from a slight increase in dizziness incidence for some combination dosing. The systematic evidence review conducted for this CPG update did not identify any studies that met inclusion criteria comparing one-drug initiation with sequential titration versus two-drug initiation, but providers and patients may wish to consider combination therapy when selecting initial therapy. Initial combination therapy may reduce the number of titrations and visits to achieve blood pressure goal, patients with a compelling indication for more than one class of antihypertensive agent may benefit from initial combination therapy, and combination pills, when available, may reduce medication co-payments. Whether using sequential or initial combination therapy, providers should attempt to achieve dosing ranges that have been found to impact important clinical outcomes, recognizing that fixed-dose combination therapy may not always be available or prescribed.

Antihypertensive Medication Regimens

Overall, there were 189 unique class regimens defined by combinations of antihypertensive medication classes used (Table S1). The most frequent 2‐class regimen was an ACEI or ARB and a thiazide (20.1%; 95% CI, 17.5%–22.7%), used by an estimated 6.9 million US adults (95% CI, 5.8–8.0 million) (Table 3). The combination of an ACEI or ARB and a β‐blocker was used by 13.5% (95% CI, 11.1%–15.9%) (4.6 million US adults [95% CI, 3.7–5.5 million]), and 9.2% (95% CI, 7.7%–10.7%) (3.1 million US adults [95% CI, 2.6–3.7 million]) used an ACEI or ARB and a CCB. The most frequent 3‐class regimens used were an ACEI or ARB and a thiazide diuretic combined with either a CCB (5.3% [95% CI, 3.8%–6.9%], 1.8 million US adults [95% CI, 1.3–2.4 million]) or a β‐blocker (5.2% [95% CI, 4.0%–6.5%], 1.8 million US adults [95% CI, 1.3–2.3 million]). The most frequently used 4‐drug regimen was an ACEI or ARB, a thiazide, a CCB, and a β‐blocker (3.1% [95% CI, 1.9%–4.2%], 1.0 million US adults [95% CI, 659 500–1.4 million]). An estimated 0.4% (95% CI, 0.1%–0.7%) of the cohort (133 200 US adults [95% CI, 20 600–245 800]) were taking an ACEI or ARB, an other diuretic, a β‐blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

New developments in antihypertensive drug treatment include optimizing the use of established drugs, the introduction of novel compounds, and a renewed appreciation that hypertension is but one of various cardiovascular risk factors that must be addressed in managing the patient with raised blood pressure. Thus, the approach used must be tailored to the individual patient both in terms of drug choice and dose as well as preventive measures. New drug development depends very much on improving our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in hypertension and seems likely to be applied at the level of the renin angiotensin system and other local factors governing vascular smooth muscle function.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^ddc9d27c]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians hypertension guideline — Recommendation 3 states that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying treatment in other adults aged 60 years or older, based on individualized assessment, to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for stroke or cardiac events; Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

### Optimizing hypertension management in clinical practice [^17932ecc]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

A clear relationship exists between elevated blood pressure (BP) and various manifestations of cardiovascular disease. Despite the availability of numerous treatment guidelines, hypertension remains inadequately controlled, with only a small proportion of patients achieving target BP levels. Many factors, both patient and physician related, contribute to this poor level of hypertension control. Major determinants include the implementation of inappropriate treatment regimens that do not enable patients to achieve goal and poor patient compliance. For example, it is widely acknowledged that most patients require two or more antihypertensive drugs to achieve BP goal; however, physicians may be reluctant to employ such treatment strategies. The aim of this review is to explore factors that contribute to poor hypertension control rates and how to overcome these, including the rationale for selecting combination therapy, with particular reference to angiotensin II receptor blocker combinations.
