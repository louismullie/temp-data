## Question

Taking linzess and develop diarrhea. Can I skip a dose of linzess and take Imodium?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is appropriate to skip a dose of linaclotide (Linzess) and use loperamide (Imodium) to manage diarrhea, and how to do that safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism and expected adverse effects of linaclotide. Then, I should verify what the FDA label says about managing diarrhea and missed doses. Next, I will review loperamide's indications, dosing, and cautions. After that, I need to check for any direct drug–drug interactions or mechanistic conflicts. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise plan and confirm when to escalate care or adjust linaclotide therapy long term.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and adverse effect profile of linaclotide. Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C agonist that increases intestinal chloride and bicarbonate secretion and accelerates transit; diarrhea is the most common adverse reaction and is usually mild to moderate, often starting within the first 1–2 weeks of therapy, with severe diarrhea reported in a minority of patients, which is why dose reduction or temporary suspension is sometimes needed [^115FY1wz] [^116x37Ug] [^1119uoDJ].

> Wait, let me verify the label's guidance on managing diarrhea and missed doses. The FDA labeling advises that if severe diarrhea occurs, dosing should be suspended and the patient rehydrated; it also instructs that if a dose is missed, the patient should skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time, not doubling up, which supports the idea of intentionally skipping a dose when diarrhea is problematic [^115FY1wz] [^111d8hXS].

> I will now examine loperamide's role and dosing. Loperamide is indicated for control and symptomatic relief of acute nonspecific diarrhea and chronic diarrhea in adults; typical adult dosing is 4 mg initially, then 2 mg after each unformed stool, not to exceed 16 mg/day, with attention to hydration and avoidance in settings where inhibiting peristalsis is dangerous, such as suspected inflammatory diarrhea with fever or blood, or known obstruction risk [^1157LbBo] [^116wDzwt] [^115N6Nhg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about interactions. I need to check whether there is a mechanistic conflict between linaclotide's pro-secretory, pro-motility effects and loperamide's anti-motility effects. There is no direct pharmacokinetic interaction because linaclotide is minimally absorbed and acts locally, and loperamide acts peripherally on opioid receptors to slow transit; clinically, using loperamide to blunt linaclotide-induced diarrhea is a rational, mechanistically complementary strategy rather than a true antagonism, and guidelines for other diarrheal contexts endorse loperamide as first-line symptomatic therapy when infection is not suspected, which supports its use here as supportive care while the linaclotide dose is adjusted [^113YzUSj] [^112Udzyb] [^112ZYDcS].

> Let me synthesize a practical plan. If diarrhea develops on linaclotide, it is reasonable to skip the next scheduled linaclotide dose and treat symptomatically with loperamide using standard adult dosing, while ensuring aggressive oral rehydration; if diarrhea persists beyond 48 hours, worsens, or is accompanied by red flags such as fever, blood in stool, severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or signs of dehydration, then linaclotide should be held and medical evaluation sought, with consideration of dose reduction or alternative therapy once stabilized [^111d8hXS] [^116wDzwt] [^115N6Nhg].

> But wait, what if the diarrhea is severe from the outset. I should confirm that the label directs suspension of linaclotide in severe diarrhea and emphasizes rehydration; indeed, the FDA warns that severe diarrhea can lead to electrolyte disturbances and hypotension, so holding linaclotide and prioritizing fluids and electrolytes is the correct first step in that scenario, with loperamide considered only after excluding inflammatory or infectious causes and once the patient is clinically safe [^115FY1wz] [^115N6Nhg].

> Next, I should review longer-term management if diarrhea recurs. If diarrhea is recurrent or dose-limiting, discuss with the prescriber the option of dose reduction, particularly for CIC where 72 mcg is an approved and often better-tolerated option than 145 mcg, and for IBS-C where some patients may benefit from lower off-label dosing strategies or alternative secretagogues; real-world and trial data show that dose reductions or temporary suspensions are common and effective strategies to mitigate diarrhea while preserving benefit [^1119uoDJ] [^1115bEkq] [^114W2s8y].

> I should double-check that I am not overlooking any contraindications. Loperamide should be avoided in the presence of inflammatory diarrhea with fever or blood, suspected obstruction or ileus, and in certain infectious colitides; likewise, linaclotide is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected mechanical GI obstruction, so persistent or severe abdominal pain should prompt reassessment before resuming therapy [^114jxRY5] [^1125teH8].

> In summary, yes, it is appropriate to skip a dose of linaclotide and use loperamide for diarrhea management, provided you monitor for red flags, maintain hydration, and reassess the linaclotide dose if diarrhea persists or recurs; this approach aligns with the FDA label, loperamide's indications and dosing, and mechanistic reasoning, and it is commonly used in clinical practice to balance efficacy and tolerability [^111d8hXS] [^116wDzwt] [^115FY1wz].

Yes, you can **skip a dose of Linzess** if you develop diarrhea and take **Imodium (loperamide)** to manage symptoms. Linzess-induced diarrhea is common and usually mild to moderate [^116zoUSB]; skipping a dose and using loperamide is reasonable. If diarrhea persists or becomes severe, **stop Linzess and consult your clinician** [^115FY1wz]. Monitor for dehydration and use electrolyte replacement as needed [^115N6Nhg].

---

## Clinical evidence on diarrhea associated with linaclotide

Diarrhea is the **most common adverse effect** of linaclotide, occurring in approximately 20% of patients in clinical trials [^116x37Ug]. Most cases are mild to moderate, typically begin within the first 2 weeks of treatment, and often resolve with continued use or dose adjustment [^1119uoDJ]. Severe diarrhea occurs in about 2% of patients and may necessitate dose reduction or discontinuation [^116x37Ug].

---

## Clinical evidence on loperamide (Imodium) for diarrhea management

Loperamide is a widely used antidiarrheal that slows intestinal transit and reduces stool frequency. It is effective for acute and chronic diarrhea, including drug-induced diarrhea, and is **generally safe when used as directed** [^1157LbBo]. The recommended adult dose is 4 mg initially, followed by 2 mg after each unformed stool, not exceeding 16 mg per day [^116wDzwt].

---

## Safety considerations when combining linaclotide and loperamide

There are **no known direct drug-drug interactions** between linaclotide and loperamide. Their mechanisms differ — linaclotide increases intestinal secretion and transit, whereas loperamide slows transit — so loperamide can counteract linaclotide-induced diarrhea without significant adverse effects. However, monitor for constipation if loperamide is used excessively or for prolonged periods [^115N6Nhg].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines and expert opinion support **symptomatic management** of linaclotide-induced diarrhea, including temporary dose omission and use of antidiarrheal agents such as loperamide. If diarrhea persists or becomes severe, dose reduction or discontinuation of linaclotide is recommended [^1119uoDJ] [^115FY1wz].

---

## Practical recommendations for patients

Based on current evidence and clinical experience, the following **practical recommendations** are provided:

- **Skip a dose**: If you experience significant diarrhea after taking linaclotide, it is reasonable to skip the next scheduled dose.

- **Use loperamide**: Loperamide can be used to manage diarrhea symptoms. Follow the recommended dosing instructions and avoid exceeding the maximum daily dose.

- **Monitor symptoms**: If diarrhea persists or becomes severe, discontinue linaclotide and consult your healthcare provider [^111d8hXS].

- **Hydration**: Ensure adequate fluid and electrolyte intake to prevent dehydration [^115N6Nhg].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

While loperamide is generally safe, **excessive use** can lead to constipation, abdominal distension, or, rarely, toxic megacolon — particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or infectious diarrhea. Use loperamide cautiously and discontinue if constipation or abdominal distension occurs [^115N6Nhg].

---

## Conclusion and clinical advice

In summary, it is clinically reasonable to **skip a dose of linaclotide** and use loperamide to manage diarrhea. This approach is supported by clinical evidence and expert guidelines. If diarrhea persists or becomes severe, discontinue linaclotide and consult your healthcare provider [^111d8hXS] [^113j8hYM].

### Low-dose linaclotide (72 μ g) for chronic idiopathic constipation: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1119uoDJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The most common AE was diarrhea, which was reported by 28 (7.0%) placebo patients, 79 (19.2%) linaclotide 72-μg patients, and 91 (22.1%) linaclotide 145-μg patients (72-μg OR = 3.17; CI (2.01, 5.00) and 145-μg OR = 3.79; CI (2.42, 5.94)). Most diarrhea was reported to be mild or moderate in severity. Severe diarrhea was reported by 3 patients (0.7%) in the placebo group, 2 patients (0.5%) in the linaclotide 72-μg group, and 10 patients (2.4%) in the linaclotide 145-μg group. Of the patients who developed diarrhea, 10.7% of patients in the placebo group had onset within the first 7 days of treatment, compared with 54.4% in the linaclotide 72-μg group and 51.6% in the linaclotide 145-μg group; the median times to onset of the first episode of diarrhea were 33.5 days in the placebo group compared with 5.0 days and 7.0 days in the linaclotide 72-μg and 145-μg groups, respectively. No SAEs of diarrhea were reported during the trial. No clinically significant sequelae (e.g. orthostatic hypotension or dehydration) or occurrences of potentially clinically significant vital signs or laboratory values for sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine were reported in patients with diarrhea. Diarrhea was the most common AE leading to treatment discontinuation, occurring in no patients in the placebo group and 2.4% and 3.2% of patients in the 72-μg and 145-μg groups, respectively. Temporary dose interruptions due to diarrhea not leading to discontinuation were reported by 0.7%, 1.2%, and 1.5% of placebo, linaclotide 72-μg, and 145-μg patients, respectively.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation

In placebo-controlled trials in patients with CIC, 3% of patients treated with 72 mcg (Trial 5) and between 5% and 8% (Trials 3, 4, and 5) of patients treated with 145 mcg of LINZESS discontinued prematurely due to adverse reactions compared to between less than 1% and 4% (Trials 3, 4, and 5) of patients treated with placebo.

In patients treated with 72 mcg LINZESS, the most common reason for discontinuation due to adverse reactions was diarrhea (2% in Trial 5) and, in patients treated with 145 mcg LINZESS, the most common reasons for discontinuation due to adverse reactions were diarrhea (between 3% and 5% in Trials 3, 4, and 5) and abdominal pain (1% in Trials 3 and 4). In comparison, less than 1% of patients in the placebo group withdrew due to diarrhea or abdominal pain (Trials 3, 4, and 5).

Adverse Reactions Leading to Dose Reductions

In the open-label, long-term trials, 1129 patients with CIC received 290 mcg of LINZESS daily for up to 18 months. In these trials, 27% of patients had their dose reduced or suspended secondary to adverse reactions, the majority of which were diarrhea or other GI adverse reactions.

Secretagogues — linaclotide for adults with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) who do not respond to over-the-counter (OTC) agents — the panel suggests the use of linaclotide over management without linaclotide (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). It can be used as a replacement or as an adjunct to OTC agents; duration of treatment in trials was 12 weeks, but the drug label does not provide a limit; it may be associated with side effects of diarrhea leading to discontinuation of treatment. In three 12-week randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trials, linaclotide at 145 and 290 μg daily increased complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week (MD 1.37, 95% CI 1.07–1.95) and spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week (MD 1.97, 95% CI 1.59–2.36), improved stool consistency (MD 1.25, 95% CI 1.11–1.39 higher), and increased rates of global relief (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.63–2.35). Responder rates increased compared with placebo (RR 3.14, 95% CI 1.68–5.88), 119 more per 1,000 (from 38 to 271 more), but participants might be 3 times more likely to have diarrhea leading to treatment discontinuation (RR 3.35, 95% CI 2.09–5.36), 38 more per 1,000 (from 8 to 154 more).

### Clinical response to linaclotide at week 4 predicts sustained response in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and improvements in digestive and extra-digestive symptoms [^114HKDcx]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

The proportion of week 12 clinical responders in the present study (ITT population: 25.0%; CP population: 36.7%) supports the previously reported findings of two large phase III trials of linaclotide. These trials utilized the US Food and Drug Administration-mandated responder criteria of ⩾30% reduction in average daily worst abdominal pain score and an increase by ⩾1 complete spontaneous bowel movement from baseline in the same week for at least 50% of weeks, and reported responder proportions of 33.7% and 33.6%, respectively, after 12 weeks of linaclotide treatment.

The overall safety profile of linaclotide in this trial was consistent with that previously reported, with diarrhea being the most frequent AE. Diarrhea was reported in 35.4% of patients and led to discontinuation in 12.5%, regardless of relatedness to study medication; only 96 patients were included in this analysis, which should be taken into consideration when interpreting these data. The majority (95%) of AEs of reported diarrhea were mild or moderate and typically not prolonged, with a median duration of 9 days. In the previous two phase III studies, treatment-emergent AEs of diarrhea with linaclotide treatment were reported in 19.7% and 19.5% of patients, respectively, and AEs of diarrhea with linaclotide treatment led to discontinuation in 4.5% and 5.7% of patients, respectively. No new safety signals were observed in the present study.

### Linaclotide (Linzess) [^116x37Ug]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

a:Reported in at least 2% of LINZESS-treated patients and at an incidence greater than placebo

b:"Abdominal pain" term includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain.

Adverse reactions in an additional placebo-controlled trial in 614 IBS-C patients randomized to placebo or LINZESS 290 mcg once daily on an empty stomach for 12 weeks (Trial 6) were similar to those in Table 1.

Diarrhea

Diarrhea was the most commonly reported adverse reaction of the LINZESS-treated patients in the pooled IBS-C pivotal placebo-controlled trials. In these trials, 20% of LINZESS-treated patients reported diarrhea compared to 3% of placebo-treated patients. Severe diarrhea was reported in 2% of the LINZESS-treated patients versus less than 1% of the placebo-treated patients, and 5% of LINZESS-treated patients discontinued due to diarrhea vs less than 1% of placebo-treated patients. The majority of reported cases of diarrhea started within the first 2 weeks of LINZESS treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation

In placebo-controlled trials in patients with IBS-C, 9% of patients treated with LINZESS and 3% of patients treated with placebo discontinued prematurely due to adverse reactions. In the LINZESS-treatment group, the most common reasons for discontinuation due to adverse reactions were diarrhea (5%) and abdominal pain (1%). In comparison, less than 1% of patients in the placebo group withdrew due to diarrhea or abdominal pain.

3.3 Safety

The most frequently reported adverse event was diarrhea. During the 4‐week double‐blind treatment period, the incidence of diarrhea was significantly higher in the linaclotide group compared to the placebo group (13.0% vs 1.1%, P = 0.002). During the long‐term open‐label treatment period, the incidence of overall adverse events in the linaclotide‐linaclotide group was comparable to that in the placebo‐linaclotide group (Table 3). For all the patients who reported diarrhea, the maximum severity was mild or moderate; discontinuation due to diarrhea was 3.3% and 0%, respectively, in the linaclotide and placebo groups in part 1 and 3.3% and 0%, respectively, in the linaclotide‐linaclotide and placebo‐linaclotide group in part 2. The difference between the linaclotide and placebo groups for incidence of diarrhea in part 1 was 11.9% (95% CI, 3.6‐20.2%) with RR of 11.74 (95% CI, 1.56‐88.42) and number needed to harm (NNH) of 9 (95% CI, 5‐28). Of the 15 patients whose dose was reduced to 0.25 mg based on the investigators' judgment, four patients had diarrhea after dose reduction and 10 patients completed the 52 weeks of treatment in part 2. A total of two serious adverse events (breast cancer and abdominal pain) occurred in two patients who received linaclotide‐linaclotide; however, neither event was considered to be treatment‐related. No deaths were reported during the study. There were no clinically significant differences in hematologic or blood chemical results, findings on urinalysis, or vital signs among the treatment groups.

### Linaclotide (Linzess) [^117PKU2c]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Less Common Adverse Reactions

Defecation urgency, fecal incontinence, dyspepsia, and viral gastroenteritis were reported in less than 2% of patients in the LINZESS treatment group and at an incidence greater than in the placebo treatment group.

Functional Constipation (FC) in Pediatric Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age

The safety of LINZESS 72 mcg once daily was evaluated in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age with FC in a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (Trial 7) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. There were 164 patients per treatment group.

Diarrhea was the most common adverse reaction and was reported in 4% of LINZESS-treated patients compared to 2% of placebo-treated patients. One patient in the LINZESS-treated group reported severe diarrhea and discontinued treatment. No patient in the placebo-treated group discontinued treatment due to severe diarrhea. Most reported cases of diarrhea started within the first 2 weeks of LINZESS treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Other adverse reactions reported at a higher incidence in the LINZESS group than the placebo group included nausea (2 patients) and abdominal discomfort and dehydration (1 patient each).

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of LINZESS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash (including hives or urticaria)

Gastrointestinal reactions: Hematochezia, nausea, rectal hemorrhage

### Advances in the management of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: the role of linaclotide [^1172j148]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) is a commonly prevalent and clinically challenging disorder to treat. Until recently, most therapeutic agents had limited ability to address the complexity of symptoms inherent to the syndrome. The development of linaclotide provides a physiologically sound approach to treatment of the multiple symptoms of IBS-C. Clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy of linaclotide, and a platform to better understand the symptomatology of IBS-C. Based on recent clinical evidence, linaclotide should be considered for patients with IBS-C because it improves abdominal pain and bowel symptoms. In phase III trials, linaclotide met the US Food and Drug Administration responder endpoint with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 5.1–7.9, and European Medicines Agency coprimary endpoints at 12 weeks with a NNT of 4.39–7.69, and at 26 weeks with a NNT of 4.93–5.68. It is safe and effective, with diarrhea reported as the most common adverse effect, which leads to discontinuation of the medication in approximately 5% of patients.

### A 12-week, randomized, controlled trial with a 4-week randomized withdrawal period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linaclotide in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^116zoUSB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Safety

A total of 228 of 406 linaclotide-treated patients (56.2%) reported at least one treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) compared with 210 of 396 placebo-treated patients (53.0%) in the 12-week treatment period (Table 4). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity (93.8%, linaclotide; 98.1%, placebo). The incidences of diarrhea (P < 0.0001), flatulence (P = 0.0084), and abdominal pain (P = 0.0462) TEAEs were significantly greater in the linaclotide-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients. The most common TEAE in the 12-week treatment period was diarrhea, experienced by 19.5% of linaclotide-treated patients compared with 3.5% of placebo-treated patients. The occurrences of diarrhea were reported to be mild or moderate in 71 of 79 linaclotide-treated patients (89.9%) and 13 of 14 placebo-treated patients (92.9%) who experienced diarrhea. There were no SAEs of diarrhea reported during the trial. None of the patients who reported diarrhea experienced clinically significant sequelae (e.g. orthostatic hypotension or dehydration). More than half of linaclotide-treated patients who experienced diarrhea had onset within the first 2 weeks of treatment. Diarrhea was the most common AE resulting in treatment discontinuation in linaclotide-treated patients (5.7 vs. 0.3% in placebo-treated patients); overall, AEs resulted in the premature discontinuation of 32 patients (7.9%) and 11 patients (2.8%) taking linaclotide and placebo, respectively, in the treatment period.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^1114bjN7]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Linaclotide for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) — The AGA recommends using linaclotide in patients with IBS-C. (Strong recommendation, high certainty in the evidence of effects). Linaclotide is FDA-approved for IBS-C at 290 μg once daily and for CIC at 72 μg and 145 μg once daily. Evidence includes 3 RCTs with 1773 patients (linaclotide n = 890; placebo, n = 883) and a third 12‑week phase 3a trial with 3318 patients; co‑primary end points required improvement in weekly abdominal pain/abdominal discomfort and weekly IBS degree of relief for ≥ 6 of 12 weeks. In the third phase 3a trial, ≥ 30% abdominal pain/discomfort reduction occurred in 60.0% with linaclotide vs 48.8% with placebo, and an IBS relief score of ≤ 2 in 31.7% vs 15.4%; the FDA end point was met by 34.8% vs 21.3%. Across 4 RCTs, linaclotide 290 μg (n = 1307) vs placebo (n = 1055) improved the FDA responder end point (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.77–0.85) with FDA end point achievement 34.0% vs 18.8%, and also improved adequate relief (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.67–0.76), abdominal pain (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78–0.88), and CSBMs (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.83–0.89). Diarrhea occurred in 16.3% with linaclotide vs 2.3% with placebo; discontinuations due to diarrhea were 3.4% vs 0.2% (RR, 14.4; 95% CI, 4.65–48.03), with no SAEs due to diarrhea and no deaths reported.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Advise patients:

Diarrhea

To stop LINZESS and contact their healthcare provider if they experience unusual or severe abdominal pain, and/or severe diarrhea, especially if in combination with hematochezia or melena [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Accidental Ingestion

Accidental ingestion of LINZESS in children especially in patients less than 2 years of age may result in severe diarrhea and dehydration. Instruct patients to take steps to store LINZESS securely and out of reach of children, and to dispose of unused LINZESS [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

Administration and Handling Instructions

To take LINZESS once daily on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes prior to a meal at approximately the same time each day [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
If a dose is missed, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take 2 doses at the same time.
To swallow LINZESS capsules whole. Do not crush or chew capsules or capsule contents.
For patients who are unable to swallow the capsule whole, LINZESS capsules can be opened and administered orally in either applesauce or with bottled water or administered with water via a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube, as described in the Medication Guide.
To keep LINZESS in the original container. Do not subdivide or repackage. Protect from moisture. Do not remove desiccant from the container. Keep bottles closed tightly in a dry place.

### Loperamide hydrochloride (imodium) [^115N6Nhg]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Fluid and electrolyte depletion often occur in patients who have diarrhea. In such cases, administration of appropriate fluid and electrolytes is very important. The use of IMODIUM® does not preclude the need for appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy.

In general, IMODIUM should not be used when inhibition of peristalsis is to be avoided due to the possible risk of significant sequelae including ileus, megacolon and toxic megacolon. IMODIUM must be discontinued promptly when constipation, abdominal distention or ileus develop.

Treatment of diarrhea with IMODIUM is only symptomatic. Whenever an underlying etiology can be determined, specific treatment should be given when appropriate (or when indicated).

Patients with AIDS treated with IMODIUM for diarrhea should have therapy stopped at the earliest signs of abdominal distention. There have been isolated reports of toxic megacolon in AIDS patients with infectious colitis from both viral and bacterial pathogens treated with loperamide hydrochloride.

IMODIUM® should be used with special caution in young children because of the greater variability of response in this age group. Dehydration, particularly in younger children, may further influence the variability of response to IMODIUM®.

### UK clinical experience up to 52 weeks with linaclotide for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^115yqGzk]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

At 52 weeks, a high proportion of patients had discontinued treatment with linaclotide. The majority of patients discontinuing linaclotide treatment did so within the first 4 weeks, with only a small proportion of patients who continued on linaclotide after 12 weeks subsequently discontinuing. The most common reason for discontinuation was AEs, occurring in 25.2% of patients. In the two phase III studies, 7.9% and 10.2% of patients in the linaclotide treatment group discontinued due to a treatment-emergent AE. The higher rate of discontinuations due to AEs reported in the present study may be attributable to the manner in which the data were collected. Patients indicated whether they had taken linaclotide for fewer than 4 days over the past week; if they answered 'yes', they were considered to have discontinued. However, this could have been a temporary interruption of treatment and not a permanent discontinuation. Furthermore, this was a low-intensity, observational study with limited face-to-face study visits, and higher discontinuation rates may therefore be expected compared to those seen in a phase III study with more intensive patient follow up and more frequent patient contact. These results may therefore represent a more 'real-world' outcome.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

(1 capsule = 2 mg)

Patients should receive appropriate fluid and electrolyte replacement as needed.

Acute Diarrhea

Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool. Daily dose should not exceed 16mg (eight capsules). Clinical improvement is usually observed within 48 hours.

Children: In children 2 to 5 years of age (20 kg or less), the non-prescription liquid formulation (IMODIUM® A-D 1 mg/7.5 mL) should be used; for ages 6 to 12, either IMODIUM® Capsules or IMODIUM® A-D Liquid may be used. For children 2 to 12 years of age, the following schedule for capsules or liquid will usually fulfill initial dosage requirements:

Recommended First Day Dosage Schedule

Two to five years: 1 mg t.i.d. (3mg daily dose) (13 to 20 kg)

Six to eight years: 2 mg b.i.d. (4mg daily dose) (20 to 30 kg)

Eight to twelve years: 2mg t.i.d. (6mg daily dose) (greater than 30 kg)

Recommended Subsequent Daily Dosage

Following the first treatment day, it is recommended that subsequent IMODIUM® doses (1 mg/10 kg body weight) be administered only after a loose stool. Total daily dosage should not exceed recommended dosages for the first day.

Chronic Diarrhea

Children: Although IMODIUM® has been studied in a limited number of children with chronic diarrhea; the therapeutic dose for the treatment of chronic diarrhea in a pediatric population has not been established.

Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM® should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses.

The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. IMODIUM® administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.

### Low-dose linaclotide (72 μ g) for chronic idiopathic constipation: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115QqpXV]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this trial of patients with chronic constipation, linaclotide 72 μg once daily achieved statistical significance (controlling for multiplicity) for the primary endpoint and 9 of 10 secondary endpoints when compared to placebo. The primary endpoint (12-week CSBM overall responder) required patients to have ≥ 3 CSBMs and an increase from baseline of ≥ 1 CSBM, within the same week, for ≥ 9 of 12 weeks. This is a particularly rigorous endpoint, when considering that the average baseline CSBM rate among patients in this trial was 0.2 per week and 76% reported 0 CSBMs. The linaclotide 72-μg dose also achieved statistical significance for the sustained responder endpoint, which required patients meeting the 12-week CSBM overall responder to also be weekly responders for ≥ 3 of the last 4 weeks of the treatment period. Monthly CSBM responders to 72-μg linaclotide increased numerically from month 1 to 3 and were significantly different from placebo for each month. Less symptomatic patients (i.e. those with > 1 SBM/week during baseline) also showed a significant response to 72-μg linaclotide compared to placebo with a slightly higher response compared to the overall population. All secondary endpoints, with the exception of abdominal discomfort, showed statistically significant improvement with 72 μg of linaclotide compared to placebo.

Linaclotide 72 μg demonstrated efficacy that was similar to linaclotide 145 μg for the responder parameters and the 12-week change-from-baseline parameters. Nonetheless, for some of the change-from-baseline efficacy endpoints (e.g. CSBM frequency), there was a slightly greater effect with the 145-μg dose than with the 72-μg dose. This modest dose effect is consistent with dose-dependent increases in bowel frequency seen in the earlier phase 2b dose-ranging study of linaclotide.

Consistent with linaclotide's pharmacology and established safety profile, diarrhea was the most common TEAE. Diarrhea infrequently led to discontinuation of treatment (2.4%, 3.2%, and 0 for linaclotide 72 μg, 145 μg, and placebo, respectively). Severe diarrhea was uncommon and was experienced by 0.5%, 2.4%, and 0.7% of linaclotide 72 μg, 145 μg, and placebo patients.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Dose Reductions

In the open-label, long-term trials, 2147 patients with IBS-C received 290 mcg of LINZESS daily for up to 18 months. In these trials, 29% of patients had their dose reduced or suspended secondary to adverse reactions, the majority of which were diarrhea or other GI adverse reactions.

Less Common Adverse Reactions

Defecation urgency, fecal incontinence, vomiting, and gastroesophageal reflux disease were reported in < 2% of patients in the LINZESS-treatment group and at an incidence greater than in the placebo treatment group.

Patients should be instructed to take linaclotide without food, at least 30 minutes before the first meal of the day, and linaclotide is contraindicated in individuals with known or suspected mechanical GI obstruction. The use of linaclotide might be associated with diarrhea leading to discontinuation or dose reduction; in one study, 4.7% discontinued the medication because of diarrhea.

The efficacy results for the 9 out of 12 weeks and the 6 out of 12 weeks responder endpoints are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. In both trials, the proportion of patients who were responders to LINZESS 290 mcg was statistically significantly higher than with placebo.

In each trial, improvement from baseline in abdominal pain and CSBM frequency was seen over the first 12-weeks of the treatment periods. For change from baseline in the 11-point abdominal pain scale, LINZESS 290 mcg began to separate from placebo in the first week. Maximum effects were seen at weeks 6–9 and were maintained until the end of the study. The mean treatment difference from placebo at week 12 was a decrease in pain score of approximately 1.0 point in both trials (using an 11-point scale). Maximum effect on CSBM frequency occurred within the first week, and for change from baseline in CSBM frequency at week 12, the difference between placebo and LINZESS was approximately 1.5 CSBMs per week in both trials.

In each trial, in addition to improvements in abdominal pain and CSBM frequency over the first 12 weeks of the treatment period, improvements were observed in the following when LINZESS was compared to placebo: SBM frequency [SBMs/week], stool consistency [as measured by the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS)], and amount of straining with bowel movements [amount of time pushing or physical effort to pass stool].

### Effect of linaclotide in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113HjpRF]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment options for constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) are limited. While linaclotide improved IBS-C symptoms in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), results vary among studies and the magnitude of benefit is unclear.

Methods

Two investigators independently extracted data on study participants, methods and outcomes (i.e., symptoms, quality of life, and adverse events) from eligible articles i.e. RCTs comparing linaclotide with placebo in adult patients with IBS-C with a follow-up of 12 weeks or longer. The grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to rate the quality of evidence.

Key Results

Of 182 identified citations, three RCTs enrolling 1773 patients met the inclusion criteria. Compared with placebo, fewer patients on linaclotide failed to achieve responses i.e. FDA endpoint (1604 patients, risk ratio [RR] = 0.80; 95%CI 0.76–0.85), adequate IBS symptom relief (1773 patients, RR = 0.73; 95%CI 0.65–0.82), and clinically meaningful improvement in IBS-QOL (1659 patients, RR = 0.78; 95%CI 0.72–0.86). The incidence of diarrhea leading to discontinuation of treatment was higher for linaclotide (1773 patients, RR = 14.75; 95%CI 4.04–53.81). The quality of evidence was rated as moderate for FDA endpoint and adequate relief response, high for diarrhea, and low for IBS-QOL. Generalizability may be limited by the study population (i.e., predominantly white female patients), lack of data regarding prior therapy, and availability of few RCTs. The number of patients is insufficient to identify rare adverse events.

Conclusions & Inferences

Linaclotide is moderately effective in improving symptoms of IBS-C with diarrhea being the major side effect. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of linaclotide for IBS-C.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Exposure in clinical development included approximately 2570, 2040, and 1220 adult patients with either IBS-C or CIC, treated with LINZESS for 6 months or longer, 1 year or longer, and 18 months or longer, respectively (not mutually exclusive).

Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups in all studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)].

Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C) in Adults

Most Common Adverse Reactions

The data described below reflect exposure to LINZESS in the two placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 1605 adult patients with IBS-C (Trials 1 and 2) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients were randomized to receive placebo or 290 mcg LINZESS once daily on an empty stomach for up to 26 weeks. Table 1 provides the incidence of adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of IBS-C patients in the LINZESS treatment group and at an incidence that was greater than in the placebo group.

### Low-dose linaclotide (72 μ g) for chronic idiopathic constipation: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114AGkTk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

As in previous linaclotide studies, AEs were elicited from patients via non-leading questions and were all recorded and analyzed; "diarrhea" was not objectively defined as part of the AE reporting process. Thus, it is difficult to interpret whether diarrhea reported as an AE simply represented a significant change in stool consistency or frequency, as would be expected from a drug like linaclotide, or truly represented an adverse event. For patients with chronic constipation, looser stools may be welcome, and in linaclotide clinical trials are actually associated with higher treatment satisfaction. A better measure of the impact of diarrhea on patients than simple prevalence may be to look at dropout rates due to diarrhea, as this provides a measure of a patient's willingness to continue therapy. In the present study, dropout rates due to diarrhea were low across all groups (< 5%). Serious adverse events were infrequent and balanced across treatment groups (≤ 1% of patients in any group). In both trials, there were no clinically meaningful differences observed in clinical laboratory or vital signs parameters between the linaclotide and placebo groups. Therefore, when considering both treatment efficacy and tolerability in clinical practice, we hypothesize that patients with milder constipation or a greater responsiveness to GC-C agonism may obtain sufficient benefit with the 72-μg dose. Similarly, patients with more severe constipation and abdominal symptoms, or less sensitivity to GC-C agonism may benefit from the higher, 145-μg dose.

The results from this trial demonstrate that linaclotide at a daily dose of 72 μg for up to 12 weeks is safe and well tolerated, and may provide clinicians with an additional dosing option for treating the heterogeneous CIC patient population.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Diarrhea: Patients may experience severe diarrhea. If severe diarrhea occurs, suspend dosing and rehydrate the patient. (5.2)

5.1 Risk of Serious Dehydration in Pediatric Patients Less Than 2 Years of Age

LINZESS is contraindicated in patients less than 2 years of age. In neonatal mice (human age equivalent of approximately 0 to 28 days), linaclotide increased fluid secretion as a consequence of age-dependent elevated GC-C agonism which was associated with increased mortality within the first 24 hours due to dehydration. There was no age-dependent trend in GC-C intestinal expression in a clinical study of children 2 to less than 18 years of age; however, there are insufficient data available on GC-C intestinal expression in children less than 2 years of age to assess the risk of developing diarrhea and its potentially serious consequences in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

5.000000000000000e+00 2 Diarrhea

In adults, diarrhea was the most common adverse reaction of LINZESS-treated patients in the pooled IBS-C and CIC double-blind placebo-controlled trials. The incidence of diarrhea was similar between the IBS-C and CIC populations. Severe diarrhea was reported in 2% of 145 mcg and 290 mcg LINZESS-treated patients, and in < 1% of 72 mcg LINZESS-treated CIC patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Diarrhea has also been reported in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age with FC treated with LINZESS. In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, diarrhea was the most common adverse reaction and was reported in 4% of pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age treated with LINZESS 72 mcg once daily. Severe diarrhea was reported in one LINZESS-treated patient [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In post-marketing experience, severe diarrhea associated with dizziness, syncope, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia and hyponatremia) requiring hospitalization or intravenous fluid administration have been reported in patients treated with LINZESS.

If severe diarrhea occurs, suspend dosing and rehydrate the patient.

IBS-C secretagogues (linaclotide and plecanatide) — efficacy and adverse events: There are currently 2 US FDA-approved agents for the treatment of IBS-C — linaclotide 290 μg and plecanatide 3 mg. For linaclotide, meta-analysis showed a relative risk of symptom persistence vs placebo of 0.89 (95% CI 0.76–0.98; NNT = 6) and an OR of response of 2.43 (95% CI 1.48–3.98; NNT = 6), with 34% of 802 enrollees in 2 phase III North American studies meeting the US FDA endpoint; significant separation from placebo occurred by the end of week 1 and was maintained. For plecanatide 3 mg daily, the relative risk of symptom persistence was 0.88 (95% CI 0.82–0.94; NNT = 10) and the OR of response 1.87 (95% CI 1.47–2.38; NNT = 9), with approximately 26% of 728 individuals meeting the endpoint; overall treatment satisfaction was significantly improved (P < 0.001). The most common treatment-emergent adverse event (AE), diarrhea, occurred in approximately 20% with linaclotide vs 3% with placebo (P < 0.0001), with severe diarrhea in 2% and 5% withdrawing; in plecanatide studies, diarrhea, severe diarrhea, and withdrawal due to diarrhea occurred in 4.3%, 0%, and 1.2%, respectively. In summary, once-daily linaclotide (290 μg) and plecanatide (3 mg) seem effective for relieving overall and individual symptoms of IBS-C, responses develop quickly and are maintained over time, and discontinuation rates due to diarrhea are low and both are well-tolerated.

### Randomized controlled trial of linaclotide in children aged 6–17 years with functional constipation [^116jMxqi]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase-C agonist, was recently approved in the United States for treatment of children 6–17 years old with functional constipation (FC). This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of several linaclotide doses in children 6–17 years old with FC.

Methods

In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study, 173 children with FC (based on Rome III criteria) were randomized to once-daily linaclotide (A: 9 or 18μg, B: 18 or 36μg, or C: 36 or 72μg) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio for 6- to 11-year-olds (dosage determined by weight: 18 to < 35 or ≥ 35kg) and linaclotide (18, 36, 72, or 145μg) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio for 12- to 17-year-olds. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in weekly spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) frequency throughout the 4-week treatment period. Adverse events (AE), clinical laboratory values, and electrocardiograms were monitored.

Results

Efficacy and safety were assessed in 173 patients (52.0% aged 6–11 years; 48.0% aged 12–17 years); 162 (93.6%) completed the treatment period. A numerical improvement in mean SBM frequency was observed with increasing linaclotide doses (1.90 in 6- to 11-year-olds [36 or 72μg] and 2.86 in 12- to 17-year-olds [72μg]). The most reported treatment-emergent AE was diarrhea, with most cases being mild; none were severe.

Conclusions

Linaclotide was well tolerated in this pediatric population, with a trend toward efficacy in the higher doses, warranting further evaluation.

### Novel pharmacological therapies for management of chronic constipation [^114YFfzC]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Lembo et alconducted 2 multicenter (208 centers in the United States and 8 Canadian centers) randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled with parallel group, phase III studies (trial 303 and 01) involving 1276 patients with CC. Patients received 145 or 290 mcg of linaclotide once daily for 12 weeks versus placebo. The primary endpoint was ≥ 3 CSBMs per week and an increase of one or more CSBM from baseline lasting at least 9 of the 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was achieved in 21.2% and 16% with a dose of 145 mcg and 19.4% and 21.3% with dose of 290 mcg of linaclotide compared with 3.3% and 6.0% for placebo (P < 0.01). In addition, improvements in all secondary endpoints were found [frequency, stool consistency scales, straining, abdominal discomfort, bloating, constipation severity, and quality of life assessment (PAC-QoL)] with both doses of linaclotide than placebo(Table 3). Trial 303 also included at the end of the treatment a period of 4 weeks of double-blind randomized crossover therapy with 290 mcg linaclotide or placebo (patients initially assigned to any dose of linaclotide continued with the same dose of linaclotide or placebo, according to the randomization, and patients who initially received placebo were randomized to linaclotide 290 mcg). Interestingly, patients who continued taking linaclotide and those who were switched from placebo to linaclotide had a sustained increase in CSBMs during such period of time, and in addition patients who were switched from linaclotide to placebo showed a decrease in the range of CSBM similar to that of the placebo group during the initial period of treatment. Long-term use studies of linaclotide in CC are pending.

Summary of Primary and Secondary or Relevant Endpoints of Linaclotide Trials

Safety

In all studies conducted at 2, 4, and 12 weeks with linaclotide, the most significant adverse event was diarrhea (14% to 16% in trials 301 and 01) that was usually present within the first 2 weeks of treatment. Other events reported included flatulence and abdominal pain, but only diarrhea had a higher incidence as compared with the placebo group. The rate of treatment discontinuation in trials 303 and 01 was 4.2%.

This study further confirmed the safety and tolerability of linaclotide in Chinese patients with IBS-C. Compared with previous publications, the 12-week reported rate of AEs was lower than those reported by the international Phase III trial, the Japanese Phase III trial, and a North American trial (24.0% vs 30.3%–56.2%). Such observation could be attributed to the lower proportion of patients who completed the 12-week treatment with linaclotide in this real-world study than those in previous trials with stricter treatment protocols (23.7% vs 76.8%–92.1%).

Consistent with previous studies, diarrhea was the most reported AE. The proportion of patients reporting diarrhea in this study (10.0%) was similar to those in a previous Chinese real-world study conducted among patients with IBS-C and a Chinese sub-cohort analysis of the aforementioned international Phase III trial (11.3% and 8.3%, respectively), but much lower than that in the previous North American trial (19.5%). The low rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs in this study was also consistent with the aforementioned Chinese sub-cohort analysis (2.4% vs 1.8%). In general, in the real-world setting of our study, linaclotide was safe, and well-tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with that reported in clinical trials.

Use of concomitant medications for constipation

At baseline, 42.7% of patients in the ITT population reported use of laxatives, enemas, or suppositories; use of rescue medication was reported in 12.5% of ITT patients between baseline and week 4, and there was a further decrease to 11.5% between weeks 4 and 12.

Quality of life

Linaclotide treatment was associated with an improvement in the mean (SD) global quality of life in constipation-20 questionnaire score, from 32.3 (13.8) at baseline to 37.2 (14.2) at week 12 (p = 0.005) in the ITT population, and from 33.1 (13.6) at baseline to 38.0 (13.9) at week 12 (p = 0.001) in the CP population. Significant improvements at week 12 were observed in the physical (p < 0.001, ITT and CP populations), emotional (p < 0.005, ITT population; p = 0.007, CP population), and rectal physical role (p ≤ 0.001, ITT and CP populations) subscales; however, there was no significant change in the social role subscale.

Prediction of clinical response at week 12

None of the evaluated baseline demographics or clinical characteristics were independently associated with a clinical response at week 12. However, clinical response at week 4 was independently associated with a clinical response at week 12, with an odds ratio of 6.5 [95% CI: 2.1, 19.8;].

Safety

In the ITT population, 67.7% of patients experienced at least one AE, with diarrhea being the most common, occurring in 34 (35.4%) patients (Table 2) and leading to treatment discontinuation in 12 (12.5%) patients. In total, 42 incidences of diarrhea were reported, 41 of which were deemed treatment-related; of these cases, 43.9% were rated mild, 51.2% were moderate, and 4.9% were severe. Nearly half (48.8%) of the AEs of diarrhea related to study medication occurred in week 1. The median duration of diarrhea related to study drug was 9 days, with 36.6% of episodes lasting ≤ 7 days. No serious AEs or deaths occurred.

Clinical Trial Data

The adverse effects reported during clinical investigations of IMODIUM® (loperamide hydrochloride) are difficult to distinguish from symptoms associated with the diarrheal syndrome. Adverse experiences recorded during clinical studies with IMODIUM® were generally of a minor and self-limiting nature. They were more commonly observed during the treatment of chronic diarrhea.

The adverse events reported are summarized irrespective of the causality assessment of the investigators.

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were reported at least as often in patients on loperamide hydrochloride as on placebo, are presented in the table below.

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were more frequently reported in patients on placebo than on loperamide hydrochloride, were: dry mouth, flatulence, abdominal cramp and colic.

2) Adverse events from 20 placebo-controlled studies in patients with chronic diarrhea

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were reported at least as often in patients on loperamide hydrochloride as on placebo, are presented below in the table below.

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were more frequently reported in patients on placebo than on loperamide hydrochloride were: nausea, vomiting, headache, meteorism, abdominal pain, abdominal cramp and colic.

### Linaclotide: a novel approach to the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome [^111H3isN]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of linaclotide for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Data Sources

A literature search using PubMed (1966-August 2011) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-July 2011) was conducted using the terms linaclotide and MD-1100. Additional publications were identified by reviewing bibliographies. Abstracts were included in the absence of published full studies. Product information was requested from the manufacturer.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The search was limited to English-language publications. All available clinical trials of linaclotide pertinent to the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of linaclotide as a treatment for IBS were included. Animal studies were included in the absence of data in humans.

Data Synthesis

Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C agonist currently being studied in Phase 3 trials for the treatment of IBS with constipation. Controlled clinical trials have found that linaclotide significantly improves the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements per week, in addition to symptoms such as abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, and straining. The most common adverse event associated with linaclotide is diarrhea.

Conclusions

Linaclotide appears to be a safe and effective treatment for IBS. Additional clinical trials will more fully elucidate the safety profile of linaclotide and better define its place in therapy.

3.5. Safety

Six patients receiving linaclotide 290 µg discontinued treatment due to AEs compared with 2 patients receiving linaclotide 145 µg and 3 receiving placebo. Diarrhea was the most common TEAE, reported by 24 (27.6%), 32 (36.8%), and 13 (16.7%) patients in the linaclotide 145 µg, linaclotide 290 µg, and placebo groups, respectively (Table 2). The majority (51.8%) of linaclotide-treated patients who reported diarrhea did so within the first week of treatment; 10 patients (5.7%) experienced an episode of diarrhea on day 1. For most patients in the safety population, treatment-related diarrhea was mild to moderate in severity; there were no serious AEs related to diarrhea. Diarrhea led to discontinuation in 1 (1.1%), 5 (5.7%), and 1 (1.3%) patient in the linaclotide 145 µg, linaclotide 290 µg, and placebo groups, respectively. Other TEAEs leading to discontinuation were back pain and edema in 1 patient each (1.1%) in the linaclotide 145 and 290 µg groups, respectively, with none in the placebo group. All other TEAEs occurred less frequently and at similar rates between the treatment groups. The majority (> 95%) of reported TEAEs for all patients were mild or moderate in severity.

Table 2
Incidence of overall and treatment-related TEAEs in the safety population.

Serious AEs were reported by 1 patient (1.1%) in the linaclotide 290 µg group compared with 5 patients (6.4%) in the placebo group. No serious AEs were reported in the linaclotide 145 µg group. The 1 serious AE (transient ischemic attack) experienced by a linaclotide-treated patient was not considered to be treatment-related. One death occurred during the study in a placebo-treated patient (cardiac arrest in a patient with a medical history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and type 2 diabetes mellitus) and was considered unrelated to treatment.

There were no clinically meaningful differences between the placebo and linaclotide treatment groups in the incidence of abnormal electrocardiogram findings, physical examination findings, laboratory parameters, or vital signs. There were no differences between the placebo and linaclotide treatment groups for pain requiring an opioid (assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory–Short Form), suggesting that linaclotide has no effect on the efficacy of opioid treatments.

### Efficacy and safety of linaclotide for opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic noncancer pain syndromes from a phase 2 randomized study [^117MJrW8]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

Constipation is the most common adverse event (AE) of opioid therapy. This multicenter, phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of linaclotide in treating opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with chronic noncancer pain syndromes (NCT02270983). Adults with OIC (< 3 spontaneous bowel movements [SBMs]/week) related to chronic noncancer pain were randomized 1:1:1 to receive linaclotide 145 µg, linaclotide 290 µg, or placebo once daily for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in 8-week SBM frequency rate (SBMs/week). Secondary efficacy endpoints included 6/8-week SBM 3 + 1 responders, time to first SBM, and changes from baseline in 8-week stool consistency, abdominal bloating, and straining. Additional endpoints included treatment satisfaction and adequate relief responders. In total, 254 patients were randomized: 87, 88, and 79 received linaclotide 145 µg, linaclotide 290 µg, and placebo, respectively. The mean changes from baseline in SBMs/week during the treatment period were 2.9 and 3.5 in the linaclotide 145 and 290 µg groups (P < 0.01 for both doses), respectively, vs 1.6 in the placebo group. Diarrhea, the most common AE, was generally mild, resulting in 1.1%, 5.7%, and 1.3% of patients discontinuing in the linaclotide 145 μg, linaclotide 290 μg, and placebo groups, respectively. No serious AEs related to diarrhea were reported in any treatment group. Compared with placebo, linaclotide-treated patients had significant improvements in stool consistency, straining, abdominal bloating, and treatment satisfaction scores (P < 0.05). Linaclotide significantly improved OIC symptoms and was well tolerated in patients with chronic noncancer pain.

### High-dose linaclotide is effective and safe in patients with chronic constipation: a phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a long-term open-label extension study in Japan [^114Mv6LP]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A previous phase II dose-ranging study of linaclotide in a Japanese chronic constipation (CC) population showed that 0.5 mg was the most effective dose. This study aimed to verify the hypothesis that 0.5 mg of linaclotide is effective and safe in Japanese CC patients.

Methods

This was a Japanese phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (part 1), and long-term, open-label extension (part 2) study of linaclotide. CC patients (n = 186) diagnosed using the Rome III criteria were randomly assigned to linaclotide 0.5 mg (n = 95) or placebo (n = 91) for a 4-week double-blind treatment period in part 1, followed by an additional 52 weeks of open-label treatment with linaclotide in part 2. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in weekly spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) frequency at the first week. Secondary endpoints included responder rate for complete SBM (CSBM), changes in stool consistency, and severity of straining.

Key Results

Part 1: Change in weekly mean SBM frequency in the first week of treatment with linaclotide (4.02) was significantly greater than that with placebo (1.48, P < 0.001). Linaclotide produced a higher CSBM responder rate (52.7%) compared to placebo (26.1%, P < 0.001). Part 2: Patients continued to show improved SBM frequency with linaclotide. Through parts 1 and 2, the most common drug-related adverse event was mild and occasionally moderate diarrhea.

Conclusions and Inferences

The results of this study indicate that a linaclotide dose of 0.5 mg/day is effective and safe in Japanese CC patients.

### Dose-finding study of linaclotide in Japanese patients with chronic constipation: a phase II randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study [^112V9AJL]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Based on the previous phase II/III studies of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in Japan that demonstrated the efficacy and safety of linaclotide 0.5 mg/d, we evaluated linaclotide at doses of 0.5 mg/d and lower in the treatment of Japanese patients with chronic constipation (CC).

Methods

This was a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study of linaclotide for Japanese patients with CC (n = 382, 64 men, 318 women, age 20–75). After a baseline period of two weeks, patients were randomized to receive placebo (n = 80), or 0.0625 mg (n = 82), 0.125 mg (n = 71), 0.25 mg (n = 73) or 0.5 mg (n = 76) of linaclotide during a two-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in weekly spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) frequency during the first week. Secondary endpoints included complete SBM (CSBM) responder rates and IBS-QOL. Safety and adverse events were also evaluated.

Key Results

The change in SBM frequency during the first week (mean) was 3.89, 3.11, 3.87, and 3.85 for 0.0625 mg, 0.125 mg, 0.25 mg, and 0.5 mg for linaclotide, significantly higher than for placebo (1.91, P < 0.05). The CSBM responder, which is an important parameter, showed the greatest improvement at the 0.5 mg during the 2 week. The most frequent adverse event in the linaclotide groups was diarrhea.

Conclusions & Inferences

Our results suggest that 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/d are effective doses of linaclotide for treating CC in Japanese patients. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02425722, supported by Astellas Pharma, Inc.

### Efficacy and safety of linaclotide for opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic noncancer pain syndromes from a phase 2 randomized study [^112bMGgc]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

The overall incidence of diarrhea in placebo-treated (16.7%) and linaclotide-treated (32.2%) patients with OIC in this study was higher than rates observed for other OIC medications (which are generally < 10%). The rates were also higher than those observed in previous linaclotide placebo-controlled studies in patients with IBS-C and CIC (14% to 20% vs 3% to 5% in the linaclotide and placebo groups, respectively), but the absolute differences in diarrhea rates are comparable.,

Although the causative mechanism for constipation in patients with OIC differs from that in patients with IBS-C and CIC, the exact reasons for the higher incidence of diarrhea are not clear in the current study. Differences in study design are known to alter AE reporting rates, and because linaclotide is available for other indications, it is plausible that an existing knowledge of expected diarrhea contributed to the higher diarrhea incidence reported in this study.

Treatment with linaclotide 290 µg/day improved overall treatment satisfaction scores beginning at week 1, and these changes were sustained throughout the entire 8-week study period. These findings are consistent with previous results showing similar improvements in treatment satisfaction for both IBS-C and CIC.

The study was accurately powered to evaluate the primary endpoint; however, the sample size of the treatment groups was small (< 100) and study duration was short (8 weeks). Other than declaration of the primary endpoint, there were no adjustments for multiple comparisons, and P values are presented for descriptive purposes only. Furthermore, although linaclotide demonstrated efficacy and safety over the 8-week treatment period, no follow-up or extension period was included to confirm the results over time or to assess for rebound once therapy was discontinued. Extrapolating from data from previous IBS-C and CIC trials, we surmise that the likelihood of rebound constipation would be low. Finally, although enrolled patients agreed to maintain a stable opioid dosing regimen throughout the study, opioid dosing compliance and the impact of any opioid dosing variations on the study results were not evaluated.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^116FJwpr]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Plecanatide for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) — The overall certainty in evidence for plecanatide was MODERATE, and the panel made a conditional recommendation for the use of plecanatide in individuals with IBS-C. In individuals with IBS-C, plecanatide treatment results in greater improvement in the FDA end point for IBS-C, as well as the components of the FDA end point, though the improvement may be small in some patients. Diarrhea was the most common adverse event and 12% of patients withdrew from the trials due to diarrhea from plecanatide; the odds of diarrhea and diarrhea-related withdrawals were similar between plecanatide and linaclotide based on meta-regression, and the trials were considered to have low risk of bias.

### Two randomized trials of linaclotide for chronic constipation [^116wzzko]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Linaclotide is a minimally absorbed peptide agonist of the guanylate cyclase C receptor. In two trials, we aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of linaclotide in patients with chronic constipation.

Methods

We conducted two randomized, 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, dual-dose trials (Trials 303 and 01) involving 1276 patients with chronic constipation. Patients received either placebo or linaclotide, 145 μg or 290 μg, once daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was three or more complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week and an increase of one or more CSBMs from baseline during at least 9 of the 12 weeks. Adverse events were also monitored.

Results

For Trials 303 and 01, respectively, the primary end point was reached by 21.2% and 16.0% of the patients who received 145 μg of linaclotide and by 19.4% and 21.3% of the patients who received 290 μg of linaclotide, as compared with 3.3% and 6.0% of those who received placebo (P < 0.01 for all comparisons of linaclotide with placebo). Improvements in all secondary end points were significantly greater in both linaclotide groups than in the placebo groups. The incidence of adverse events was similar among all study groups, with the exception of diarrhea, which led to discontinuation of treatment in 4.2% of patients in both linaclotide groups.

Conclusions

In these two 12-week trials, linaclotide significantly reduced bowel and abdominal symptoms in patients with chronic constipation. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the potential long-term risks and benefits of linaclotide in chronic constipation.

2.3 Study design

The phase III study was conducted in Japan from June 2016 to November 2017 at 39 hospitals and clinics with departments of gastroenterology. The study included a pre‐treatment period (a screening period of up to 4 weeks and a 2‐week bowel habit observation period) and a 56‐week treatment period. The treatment period included a 4‐week double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, comparative study period (part 1) and a 52‐week open‐label, uncontrolled study period (part 2).

Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, using a web‐based system, to receive either linaclotide tablets at a dose of 0.5 mg or placebo tablets, administered orally once daily before breakfast for 4 weeks. After a completion of 4 weeks of treatment, patients meeting the transfer criteria (Table S1) were assigned to an additional 52 weeks of treatment with linaclotide 0.5 mg once daily before breakfast. Visits were scheduled every 4 weeks (or at discontinuation) to assess treatment efficacy, drug compliance, and occurrence of adverse events. Dose reduction to 0.25 mg and optional re‐escalation to 0.5 mg were allowed by the investigators following the week 4 visit in part 1 through the week 12 visit of the treatment period in part 2 (See the details in Table S1). All patients, investigators, and sponsors were kept blinded until all observations and evaluations in part 1 were completed, statistical analysis plans were finalized, and all the data had been entered into the database.

### Linaclotide: promising IBS-C efficacy in an era of provisional study endpoints [^114Qfk47]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Recent disappointing developments in the pharmacotherapy of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have not dampened the enthusiasm surrounding linaclotide, a novel guanylate cyclase-C agonist for the management of constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C). Two recent phase 3 studies reporting on a single, daily dose of linaclotide are presented in this issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology. Importantly, these studies are the first to examine a provisional Food and Drug Administration (FDA) combined response endpoint for IBS-C, which mandates improvements of both abdominal pain and defecatory symptoms. Potential limitations of this FDA endpoint relate to a lack of inclusion of other potentially important IBS symptoms and an inability to directly compare findings with other recent IBS-C trials. Both studies successfully reached this endpoint in approximately one-third of study subjects, resulting in numbers needed to treat (NNT) of five to eight, to achieve an FDA responder. Individual symptom responses to linaclotide were seen in nearly 50% of participants, and potential explanations for these discrepancies when compared with the FDA endpoint are offered. Adequate relief measures also were assessed and, with NNTs of 3.4–6.8, compared favorably with other contemporary IBS-C studies. Overall, both linaclotide trials found the medication to be safe in terms of serious adverse events, though the secretagogue mechanism of action led to diarrhea in approximately one in five subjects. Together, these studies inspire several other important questions regarding linaclotide, including its role in the management of IBS-C relative to existing treatment options, such as lubiprostone. Greater clinical use of linaclotide will reveal whether the observed responses measured with the FDA provisional endpoint will translate into real-world experiences of improvement in IBS patients.

### Low-dose linaclotide (72 μ g) for chronic idiopathic constipation: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114nGeEv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Patient disposition, demographics, and baseline characteristics

Of the 2,244 patients who provided informed consent, 1223 patients were randomized and received at least one dose of trial medication (Figure 1). Because all patients received the treatment to which they were randomized, the ITT and safety populations were identical. A total of 1,078 patients (88.1%) completed all 12 weeks of the treatment period. The treatment groups were generally balanced with respect to demographics, and baseline bowel and abdominal symptoms (Table 1). Mean compliance rate with study drug dosing (assessed by counting pills returned at study visits) up to study discontinuation/completion during the 12-week treatment period was > 97%.

Efficacy results

A total of 13.4% of patients receiving linaclotide 72 μg met the 12-week CSBM overall responder primary endpoint compared with 4.7% of patients receiving placebo (P < 0.0001; odds ratio = 3.0, 95% confidence interval = 1.8, 5.2; Figure 2). These results were comparable to the approved linaclotide 145 μg dose group, in which 12.4% of patients met responder criteria (nominal P < 0.0001; OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.6, 4.9). Nominal P -values are presented for the 145-μg dose, as these results were not controlled for multiplicity. Sustained response, defined as 12-week CSBM overall responder+weekly responder for ≥ 3 of the final 4 weeks of treatment, was significantly higher in the linaclotide 72-μg and 145-μg groups compared to placebo: 12.4, 11.2, and 4.7% of patients in the linaclotide 72, 145 μg, and placebo groups, respectively (Table 2).

### Real-world safety of linaclotide in Chinese patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation: a multicenter, single-arm, prospective observational study [^114rgADU]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Several North American Phase III trials and a Japanese Phase III trial have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of linaclotide in treating IBS-C. – An international Phase III trial that primarily recruited Chinese patients further confirmed that linaclotide treatment was associated with significantly greater improvements in bowel habits and abdominal symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, discomfort, and bloating) compared to placebo treatment. The trial also reported that diarrhea was the most common adverse event (AE) in the linaclotide group, but discontinuation due to diarrhea was rare. These favorable results led to the approval of linaclotide 290-μg oral capsule by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China in 2019.

Marketing authorization holders are required by NMPA to further assess the safety of their newly approved drugs in the Chinese population within 5 years of approval. Moreover, there is a lack of large-scale, real-world studies to examine the impact of linaclotide on the quality of life and treatment satisfaction of patients with IBS-C. Thus, in this study, we aim to further examine the safety and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of linaclotide treatment in Chinese patients with IBS-C.

Patient disposition, demographics, and baseline characteristics

A total of 121 patients were screened; 109 patients completed the screening phase and 96 entered the treatment phase (ITT population). During the study, 36 patients discontinued linaclotide treatment. The reasons for discontinuation were AEs (n = 12, 12.5%), withdrawal of consent (n = 3, 3.1%), protocol deviation (n = 9, 9.4%), and lack of efficacy (n = 12, 12.5%). A total of 60 patients completed the treatment phase (CP population; Figure 1).

### A randomized controlled and long-term linaclotide study of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation patients in Japan [^112swgvz]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical testing was required to verify the effect of linaclotide 0.5 mg/d in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in Japan.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (Part 1) and long-term, open-label extension (Part 2) study of linaclotide at 60 hospitals and clinics in Japan. Patients with IBS-C diagnosed using Rome III criteria (n = 500) were randomly assigned to linaclotide 0.5 mg (n = 249) or placebo (n = 251) for a 12-week treatment period followed by open-label treatment with linaclotide (n = 324) for an additional 40 weeks. The primary endpoints were the responder rate of global improvement of IBS symptoms and complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) during 12 weeks. The secondary endpoints included responder rates of SBM and abdominal pain/discomfort relief.

Key Results

Part 1: The responder rates for global improvement and for CSBM frequency were significantly higher for linaclotide compared to placebo (P < 0.001). Secondary endpoints including responder rates for SBM and abdominal pain/discomfort relief in the linaclotide group were also significantly greater than those in the placebo group. Part 2: Patients switched from placebo to linaclotide showed similar responder rates for global improvement and CSBM frequency to those in patients who continued to receive linaclotide, supporting sustained efficacy. Diarrhea was seen in 14.5% of patients; all cases were mild or moderate.

Conclusions and Inferences

This study suggests that a linaclotide dose of 0.5 mg is effective and safe for IBS-C patients in Japan.

### Linaclotide improves abdominal pain and bowel habits in a phase IIb study of patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^113iPZrU]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Linaclotide, a minimally absorbed, 14-amino acid peptide agonist of guanylate cyclase-C, has shown benefit in a proof-of-concept study for the treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation (IBS-C). We assessed the efficacy and safety of linaclotide at a daily dose range of 75–600 μg in IBS-C.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study of 420 patients with IBS-C given oral linaclotide at doses of 75, 150, 300, or 600 μg or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. End points included change from baseline in daily bowel habits, daily abdominal symptoms, and weekly global assessments, in addition to responder criteria.

Results

All doses of linaclotide significantly improved bowel habits, including frequency of spontaneous bowel movements and complete spontaneous bowel movements (primary end point), severity of straining, and stool consistency. Abdominal pain was significantly reduced from baseline, compared with placebo; mean changes in abdominal pain (assessed on a 5-point scale) from baseline were -0.71, -0.71, -0.90, and -0.86 for linaclotide doses of 75, 150, 300, and 600 μg, respectively, compared with -0.49 for placebo. Likewise, most doses of linaclotide significantly improved other abdominal symptoms, including discomfort and bloating, and global measures of IBS-C compared with placebo. Effects were observed within the first week and were sustained throughout 12 weeks of treatment. Except for diarrhea, the incidence of adverse events was similar between placebo and linaclotide groups.

Conclusions

Linaclotide, across a wide range of doses, significantly improved symptoms of IBS-C, including abdominal pain and bowel symptoms. Diarrhea was the only dose-dependent adverse event and was usually of mild or moderate severity.

### Linaclotide for treating patients with irritable bowel syndrome with predominant constipation: a multicentre study of real-world data in China [^114iqat5]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The most common adverse event associated with linaclotide treatment in this study was diarrhoea. The safety of linaclotide observed in this 12-week study was similar to that observed in phase 3 trials, and there was no indication of additional adverse events following long-term use. Diarrhoea was the most common adverse reaction associated with treatment, with 11.3% of patients reporting mild diarrhoea after linaclotide treatment and no patients developing severe diarrhoea. In clinical practice, diarrhoea is considered a marker of drug activity rather than an adverse event in many patients.

In this study, approximately 79.3% and 100% of patients were very satisfied or satisfied with the ability of linaclotide to relieve IBS-C symptoms at weeks 4 and 12, respectively, similar to a previous phase 3 IBS-C trial that showed that patients were relatively satisfied or very satisfied with the treatment effect at week 12. The patients' IBS-SSS scores after linaclotide treatment were 51.81 ± 54.42 at week 4 and 9.3 ± 30.39 at week 12. The satisfaction rate was basically consistent with the IBS-SSS score. There are two reasons for the gradual increase in the satisfaction rate to 100%: (1) the effect of linaclotide fully developed through the period of drug use and (2) patients with poor treatment response stopped taking the medication at an early stage.

At 12 weeks, linaclotide treatment was discontinued in 55.7% of the patients, while most patients stopped linaclotide in the first 4 weeks. The most common cause of withdrawal was symptom remission in approximately 30.9% of the patients, followed by adverse events in 11.3%. However, in two phase 3 clinical studies, linaclotide was stopped in 7.9% and 10.2% of the patients. This high withdrawal rate may be due to real-world studies reflecting the true wishes of patients, which may be higher than that in phase 3 clinical studies. Therefore, these results may represent a more actual result. Meanwhile, 30 patients stopped the treatment early because of improved symptoms. In the follow-up at week 12, the number of defecations, BSFS scores and abdominal pain scores were significantly improved. This indicates that linaclotide treatment perhaps elicits a long-lasting effect. Patients with IBS-C do not necessarily need to adhere to long-term medications; rather, the dosing frequency and interval of their medications can be adjusted according to their symptoms.

### Safety and efficacy of linaclotide in children aged 7–17 years with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^116TqmgS]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase-C agonist, was recently approved in the United States for the treatment of children 6–17 years old with functional constipation. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of various linaclotide doses in children 7–17 years old with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).

Methods

In this 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 2 study, children with IBS-C were randomized to once-daily placebo or linaclotide (Dose A: 18 or 36µg, B: 36 or 72µg, and C: 72µg or 145µg, or 290µg); those aged 7–11 years in a 1:1:1:1 allocation based on weight (18 to < 35kg:18µg, 36µg, or 72µg; or ≥ 35kg: 36µg, 72µg, or 145µg), and those aged 12–17 years in a 1:1:1:1:1 allocation (the higher option of Doses A-C or 290µg). The primary efficacy endpoint was a change from baseline in 4-week overall spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) frequency rate over the treatment period. Adverse events and clinical laboratory measures were also assessed.

Results

Efficacy, safety, and tolerability were assessed in 101 patients. In the intent-to-treat population, numerical improvement was observed in overall SBM frequency rate with increasing linaclotide doses (A: 1.62, B: 1.52, and C: 2.30, 290µg: 3.26) compared with placebo. The most reported treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea and pain, with most cases being mild and none being severe.

Conclusions

Linaclotide was tolerated well in this pediatric population, showing numerical improvement in SBM frequency compared with placebo.

### Randomized trial of 2 delayed-release formulations of linaclotide in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^114taRJD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, in this phase 2b study of 2 novel linaclotide DR formulations, DR1 seemed to have similar efficacy for improvements in bowel function and abdominal pain compared with the commercially available IR preparation. Importantly, MD-7246 maintained improvement in abdominal pain relief relative to placebo with little impact on bowel symptoms and very low rates of treatment-associated diarrhea. MD-7246 should, therefore, be examined as an option for treating IBS-related abdominal pain without altering bowel habits. Further MD-7246 studies across the spectrum of IBS subtypes, including those with diarrhea predominance, should be considered based on these observations.

### A 12-week, randomized, controlled trial with a 4-week randomized withdrawal period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linaclotide in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^113YzUSj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

In the subset of patients who were assessed for linaclotide exposure, no quantifiable plasma levels of linaclotide were detected following trial-medication dosing at the randomization and week 4 trial visits. All patients tested (72 placebo and 64 linaclotide) had levels lower than the limit of quantification for linaclotide (< 0.2 ng/ml) and its primary metabolite, MM-419447 (< 2.0 ng/ml).

During the RW period, TEAEs occurred in 22.2% of linaclotide–linaclotide patients, 22.1% of linaclotide–placebo patients, and 30.6% of placebo–linaclotide patients. With the exceptions of diarrhea and abdominal pain, the incidence of TEAEs was similar across the three treatment sequences. The incidence of diarrhea was 1.9, 0.6, and 11.7%, in linaclotide–linaclotide, linaclotide–placebo, and placebo–linaclotide patients, respectively. The incidence of abdominal pain was 1.3% in the linaclotide–linaclotide patients and 2.4% in the placebo–linaclotide patients; there were no TEAEs of abdominal pain in the linaclotide–placebo patients. There was no evidence of "rebound" (i.e. worsening in IBS-C symptoms compared with the baseline period in the linaclotide–placebo patients). No SAEs were reported during the RW period.

### Efficacy and safety of linaclotide for opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic noncancer pain syndromes from a phase 2 randomized study [^116p5BEY]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

Improvements in other efficacy endpoints, such as time to first SBM and reduction in OIC symptoms, were also similar between linaclotide and lubiprostone. Treatment with linaclotide 145 and 290 µg reduced median time to first SBM to 26.5 and 28.7 hours, respectively, vs a reduction in median time to first SBM to 23.5 or 28.5 hours with lubiprostone. Furthermore, improvements from baseline in 8-week constipation symptom severity were greater with linaclotide in this study vs those reported for lubiprostone (1.9, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.1 vs ∼1.0, ∼1.1, ∼0.6, and ∼0.7 for stool consistency, straining, abdominal bloating, and OIC severity, respectively). Although these comparisons are not based on head-to-head trials between the 2 medications, the current data support the efficacy of linaclotide in this patient population.

Safety data revealed that both doses of linaclotide are well tolerated in patients with OIC, and the results are consistent with the established safety profile of linaclotide in patients with IBS-C or CIC. The most commonly reported AE in linaclotide-treated patients was diarrhea, with the majority of cases characterized as mild in severity. Rates of severe diarrhea (1.1%) and treatment discontinuation due to diarrhea (3.4%) were low and also consistent with previous linaclotide studies in IBS-C (2% severe diarrhea and 5% discontinuations due to diarrhea) and CIC (2% severe diarrhea and 2% to 5% discontinuations due to diarrhea). Furthermore, the placebo-adjusted rate of discontinuation due to diarrhea in this study (4.4% for linaclotide 290 μg) is similar to the placebo-adjusted rate of discontinuation due to diarrhea from prior randomized trials (3.7%), as shown in a pooled safety analysis.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Patients

Of 340 patients who provided written informed consent, 186 patients were randomized into the placebo group (n = 91) or the linaclotide group (n = 95) in part 1. Of these 186 patients, a total of 165 patients completed the 4‐week treatment in part 1 and all of them received linaclotide (Figure 1). The demographics and baseline characteristics were similar across the groups (Table 1). As for linaclotide dosage, 15 (8.5%) patients had their dose reduced to 0.25 mg based on the investigators' judgment; no cases were subsequently escalated back to the 0.5 mg dose.

### Real-world safety of linaclotide in Chinese patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation: a multicenter, single-arm, prospective observational study [^115tuAeL]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase-C agonist, is indicated for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). However, real-world data on the safety and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of linaclotide are scarce in Chinese patients with IBS-C.

Objectives

To assess the real-world safety and PROs of linaclotide in the Chinese IBS-C population.

Design

Multicenter, prospective observational study.

Methods

Adults with IBS-C who had taken or planned to take at least one dose of linaclotide 290μg were enrolled and followed up for 3months. Face-to-face visits were conducted at baseline (V1), Week 4 ± 7days (V2), and Week 12 ± 7days (V3). Primary endpoints included the incidences of adverse events (AEs), AEs by severity, adverse drug reactions (ADRs), serious AEs (SAEs), and AEs leading to treatment interruption, discontinuation, and death. Secondary endpoints included mean treatment satisfaction at V2 and V3, and mean overall Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Quality of Life (IBS-QoL) at V2.

Results

Out of 3000 enrolled patients, 2963 took at least one dose of linaclotide and were analyzed. Overall, 712 patients (24.0%) reported 1095 AEs, which were mostly mild (89.9%). Diarrhea, reported in 297 out of the 2963 patients analyzed (10.0%), was the most common AE. No severe diarrhea was reported. Totally, 319 patients (10.8%) reported ADRs. Forty-six patients (1.6%) reported 50 SAEs and two cases were considered related to linaclotide treatment. Fifty-one (1.7%) and 70 patients (2.4%) interrupted and discontinued treatment due to AEs, respectively. One patient died of hepatic cancer, which was considered unrelated to linaclotide treatment. During the follow-up, the mean (± SD) treatment satisfaction increased numerically and continuously (V1, 2.8 ± 1.3 (n = 1721); V2, 3.5 ± 1.1 (n = 1705); V3, 3.9 ± 1.0 (n = 833)). The mean (± SD) overall IBS-QoL increased numerically from 73.2 ± 16.6 (n = 1924) at V1 to 80.2 ± 15.5 (n = 1738) at V2.

Conclusion

In the Chinese real-world setting, linaclotide was safe and well tolerated in patients with IBS-C. Numerically, there are trends toward improvement in PROs with linaclotide treatment.

### Clinical response to linaclotide at week 4 predicts sustained response in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and improvements in digestive and extra-digestive symptoms [^112iUh51]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common and chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain and altered bowel movements. IBS is a disorder of gut–brain interactionand is subtyped by its predominant stool patterns including IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea, IBS with a mixed stool pattern, and unclassified IBS.

IBS affects approximately 11% of the global population and 11.5% in Europe, including an estimated 10% of people in Spain. IBS-C is estimated to account for approximately one-third of all IBS cases, and is one of the most common reasons for patient visits to both primary care physicians and gastroenterologists. Mean overall costs for IBS-C in a United States (US) community center analysis were US$11,406 over a 2-year period, and in Europe, the mean annual overall costs to the healthcare system for moderate-to-severe IBS-C were €4639.

While some patients with IBS-C may experience mild or intermittent symptoms, for some, these symptoms are severe and debilitating. IBS is also associated with a significant GI and non-GI comorbidity burden, which contributes to the significant impact of IBS-C on patients' health-related quality of life. As a result, IBS-C is associated with a high economic and humanistic burden due to greater use of healthcare resources and work productivity loss, including presenteeism and activity impairment.

IBS-C management options include nonpharmacological measures such as dietary modifications, increasing physical activity, and psychological therapy. Pharmacological therapy of IBS-C includes antispasmodics, over-the-counter medications (e.g. laxatives), as well as approved prescription medications such as lubiprostone and linaclotide. – In two phase III trials, linaclotide significantly improved pain, constipation, and abdominal bloating in patients with IBS-C and is therefore approved by the European Medicines Agency for moderate-to-severe IBS-C in adults.

### Efficacy of linaclotide for patients with chronic constipation [^111YfXjL]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Linaclotide is a minimally absorbed peptide agonist of the guanylate cyclase-C receptor that stimulates intestinal fluid secretion and transit and reduces pain in animal models. We assessed the safety and efficacy of a range of linaclotide doses in patients with chronic constipation.

Methods

We performed a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 310 patients with chronic constipation. Patients were randomly assigned to groups given 75, 150, 300, or 600 microg oral linaclotide or placebo once daily for 4 weeks. Symptom assessments included spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs), complete SBMs, stool consistency, straining, abdominal discomfort, and bloating. Severity of constipation, adequate relief of constipation, global relief of constipation, treatment satisfaction, quality of life, adverse events, clinical laboratory data, and electrocardiogram results were assessed.

Results

All doses of linaclotide improved the weekly rate of SBM (primary end point) compared with placebo; the increases in overall weekly number of SBMs from baseline were 2.6, 3.3, 3.6, and 4.3 for linaclotide doses of 75, 150, 300, and 600 microg, respectively, compared with 1.5 for placebo (P ≤ .05 for each pair-wise comparison of a linaclotide dose to placebo). Likewise, linaclotide significantly improved the weekly rate of complete SBM, stool consistency, straining, abdominal discomfort, bloating, global assessments, and quality of life. The most common and only dose-related adverse event was diarrhea (only 6 patients discontinued treatment because of diarrhea).

Conclusions

Linaclotide therapy was associated with few adverse events and produced rapid and sustained improvement of bowel habits, abdominal symptoms, global relief, and quality of life in patients with chronic constipation.

### Management of chronic multisymptom illness: synopsis of the 2021 US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guideline [^112yuAiB]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) guideline — linaclotide and plecanatide for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation — states: We suggest offering linaclotide and plecanatide for patients with CMI and symptoms consistent with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation who do not respond to a trial of osmotic laxatives (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). Guanylate cyclase-C agonists such as linaclotide and plecanatide may improve symptoms and quality of life (QoL) in patients with IBS with constipation who have not responded to a trial of osmotic laxatives. In one SR and meta-analysis involving six randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which assessed a total of 6,472 patients, linaclotide (290 mg/day) (OR: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.48 to 3.98; NNT = 6) and plecanatide (3 mg/day, OR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.47 to 2.38, NNT = 9; 6 mg/day, OR: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.48 to 2.48; NNT = 9) were more effective than placebo in meeting the FDA responder endpoint for IBS with constipation at a 12 week follow-up. Evidence for adverse events (AEs) from five RCTs found that linaclotide (290 mg/day) and plecanatide (3 or 6 mg/day) were more likely than placebo to experience diarrhea and study withdrawal due to diarrhea at 12 week follow-up, with rates of diarrhea as an AE occurring in approximately 3 to 6% of patients. Evidence from 5 RCTs indicates no difference between linaclotide (290 mg/day) and plecanatide (3 mg/day) in efficacy based on the FDA responder endpoint at 12 to 26 weeks follow-up, and no difference in the incidence of diarrhea or study withdrawal rates between these agents. In another SR involving four RCTs, which assessed a total of 1,773 patients, outcomes for clinically meaningful improvement in IBS-related quality of life favored linaclotide (RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.72 to 0.86). The long-term efficacy and safety of plecanatide was demonstrated in an analysis of 2,272 patients with follow-up of up to 53 weeks, which found a safety profile similar to the 12 week results.

### Efficacy and safety of linaclotide in treatment-resistant chronic constipation: a multicenter, open-label study [^112Fabae]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linaclotide in patients with chronic constipation (CC) or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) who did not respond to treatment with magnesium oxide (MgO).

Methods

This study was designed as a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, exploratory study. Patients with CC or IBS-C who took MgO and those meeting the medication initiation criteria were administered linaclotide at a daily dosage of 500μg for 12weeks. The primary endpoint was a change in the Japanese version of the Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (JPAC-QOL) score from baseline, which was evaluated by using a paired t-test.

Key Results

The patients' mean age (± standard deviation) was 67.6 ± 13.82years. The full analysis set included 61 patients. The JPAC-QOL total score was 1.60 at baseline and 0.70 at 12weeks, with a significant mean change of -0.89 ± 0.721 (p < 0.001). Several secondary endpoints also showed improvement. The frequency of spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) and complete SBM increased by 2.70 ± 7.254 (p < 0.01) and 2.81 ± 5.254 times, respectively (p < 0.001). The Bristol Stool Form Scale, abdominal bloating severity, and straining severity scores improved by 1.33 ± 1.274 (p < 0.001), -0.16 ± 0.563 (p < 0.05), and -0.46 ± 0.795 (p < 0.001) points, respectively. The safety analysis set included 65 patients, 7 of whom had diarrhea, which improved with dose reduction and drug withdrawal.

Conclusion & Inferences

The study was conducted in an older adult population, similar to real clinical practice. Linaclotide may be an option for treating CC that shows an inadequate response to conventional therapy.

### Recommended guidelines for the treatment of cancer treatment-induced diarrhea [^117E3WVW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update and expand on previously published clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of cancer treatment-induced diarrhea.

Methods

An expert multidisciplinary panel was convened to review the recent literature and discuss recommendations for updating the practice guidelines previously published by this group in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 1998. MEDLINE searches were performed and the relevant literature published since 1998 was reviewed by all panel members. The treatment recommendations and algorithm were revised by panel consensus.

Results

A recent review of early toxic deaths occurring in two National Cancer Institute-sponsored cooperative group trials of irinotecan plus high-dose fluorouracil and leucovorin for advanced colorectal cancer has led to the recognition of a life-threatening gastrointestinal syndrome and highlighted the need for vigilant monitoring and aggressive therapy for this serious complication. Loperamide remains the standard therapy for uncomplicated cases. However, the revised guidelines reflect the need for recognition of the early warning signs of complicated cases of diarrhea and the need for early and aggressive management, including the addition of antibiotics. Management of radiation-induced diarrhea is similar but may not require hospitalization, and chronic low- to intermediate-grade symptoms can be managed with continued loperamide.

Conclusion

With vigilant monitoring and aggressive therapy for cancer treatment-induced diarrhea, particularly in patients with early warning signs of severe complications, morbidity and mortality may be reduced.

### UK clinical experience up to 52 weeks with linaclotide for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^1142iGxa]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The threshold for improvement in IBS-SSS overall score in this study was a reduction of ⩾50 points, in line with numerous studies making use of the IBS-SSS and the original description of this measure.– However, a single study based on a cohort of 277 patients with IBS has suggested that a change of 95 points might represent a minimal clinically important difference. A 50% improvement from baseline in IBS-SSS score has also been proposed as a responder definition; however, this criterion requires further validation. –

Linaclotide treatment also led to significant improvements in quality of life. Pooled analysis of the linaclotide phase III trials demonstrated that linaclotide led to significant improvements versus placebo in quality of life, as assessed with the IBS-QOL, with over half of linaclotide-treated patients displaying a response after 12 weeks of treatment. These findings are supported by the significant improvements seen in IBS-QOL total score and across all subscales in the present study at both 12 and 52 weeks.

The most common AEs reported with linaclotide treatment in the present study were diarrhoea and abdominal pain. The safety profile observed with linaclotide in this 1-year study is similar to that seen in the phase III trials, with no signs of additional adverse events developing as a result of prolonged use. AEs of diarrhoea that were related, probably or possibly related, or unrelated to the study drug were reported in 26.7% of patients in the present study, and were reported (regardless of relatedness) in 19.5% and 19.7% of patients in the two phase III studies, respectively. The higher incidence of diarrhoea observed in this study may be attributable to approximately 40% of patients continuing laxative use after linaclotide initiation. In the present study, AEs of diarrhoea were more common among patients with baseline laxative use versus patients without. These findings are in line with the recommendation that linaclotide should not be coadministered with laxatives at the start of treatment.

14.2 Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC) in Adults

The efficacy of LINZESS for the treatment of CIC was established in two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter clinical trials in adult patients (Trials 3 and 4). A total of 642 patients in Trial 3 and 630 patients in Trial 4 [overall mean age of 48 years (range 18 to 85 years), 89% female, 76% white, 22% black, 10% Hispanic] received treatment with LINZESS 145 mcg, 290 mcg, or placebo once daily and were evaluated for efficacy. All patients met modified Rome II criteria for functional constipation. Modified Rome II criteria were less than 3 Spontaneous Bowel Movements (SBMs) per week and 1 of the following symptoms for at least 12 weeks, which need not be consecutive, in the preceding 12 months:

Straining during greater than 25% of bowel movements
Lumpy or hard stools during greater than 25% of bowel movements
Sensation of incomplete evacuation during greater than 25% of bowel movements

Patients were also required to have less than 3 CSBMs per week and less than or equal to 6 SBMs per week during a 2-week baseline period. Patients were excluded if they met criteria for IBS-C or had fecal impaction that required emergency room treatment.

### Evaluation and management of pediatric refractory constipation: recommendations from the NASPGHAN neurogastroenterology and motility committee [^114rPxkL]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Linaclotide — mechanism, pediatric response, safety, and regulatory status: Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C receptor agonist that increases intestinal fluid secretion, accelerates intestinal transit, and decreases visceral pain. A retrospective study of 60 children with FC showed that 45% had a positive clinical response at the first follow-up (median 2.5 months); reported constipation decreased from 83% to 64% and median BM frequency increased from 4 to 7 per week, while 18% discontinued due to adverse events. The safety profile of long-term use in pediatric patients has yet to be determined; linaclotide has received FDA approval for ages 6–17 years with FC, can cause excessive diarrhea which may lead to discontinuation, and is contraindicated in patients with concern for intestinal obstruction and in children younger than 2 years of age.

### Determining an optimal dose of linaclotide for use in Japanese patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation: a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^111pxf18]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical testing to determine a suitable dose of linaclotide for Japanese patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) was needed.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial. Japanese patients with IBS-C diagnosed using Rome III criteria (n = 559, men/women: 49/510) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 linaclotide doses (0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, or 0.5 mg) or placebo for the 12-week treatment period. The primary endpoint was responder rate of global assessment of relief of IBS symptoms during 12 weeks. The secondary endpoints included responder rates of complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM), SBM and abdominal pain/discomfort relief and others.

Key Results

The primary endpoint was 23.2%, 36.2%, 38.7%, 34.8%, and 38.3% in placebo (n = 112), 0.0625 (n = 116), 0.125 (n = 111), 0.25 (n = 112), and 0.5 (n = 107) mg of linaclotide groups with the difference from the placebo group in each linaclotide group (13.0%, 15.5%, 11.6%, 15.1%, P > .05). Monthly responder rate of global assessment of relief of IBS symptoms at month 3 (48.6%), responder rate of CSBM during 12 weeks (45.8%), and responder rate of abdominal pain/discomfort relief during 12 weeks (32.7%) in the 0.5 mg were significantly higher than those in placebo group (29.5%, P < .01; 25.9%, P < .01; and 18.8%, P < .05 respectively). The most frequent adverse event in the linaclotide groups was diarrhea.

Conclusions & Inferences

This study suggests that a linaclotide dose of 0.5 mg may be appropriate in Japanese patients with IBS-C.

### A 12-week, randomized, controlled trial with a 4-week randomized withdrawal period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linaclotide in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^111AQTsy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

In addition to abdominal pain, linaclotide improved several other important abdominal symptoms that are frequently reported by IBS-C patients, including abdominal bloating and abdominal discomfort, beginning during the first week of treatment and continuing throughout the 12-week treatment period. Linaclotide also improved bowel function, including SBM and CSBM frequency, straining, stool consistency, and constipation severity. However, in contrast to the gradual improvement in abdominal symptoms, improvement in bowel function occurred more rapidly. Most linaclotide-treated patients experienced an SBM within 24 h of the first dose of linaclotide (67.4 vs. 43.8% for placebo, P < 0.0001); maximal improvement in bowel function usually occurred within the first week. Thus, improvement with linaclotide in abdominal (sensory) symptoms such as abdominal pain may be attributable to more than improvement in bowel function alone. Preclinical data suggest that cGMP, which is released intra- and extracellularly following GCC activation by linaclotide, can reduce the firing of pain-sensing visceral afferent fibers. Further studies are under way that may provide a better understanding of the mechanisms by which linaclotide exerts its beneficial effects directly on abdominal sensory symptoms.

Diarrhea was the most common TEAE in linaclotide-treated patients and appears to be an extension of linaclotide's pharmacological effects. Although diarrhea was reported in 19.5% of linaclotide-treated patients, only 2% reported that they had severe diarrhea and only 5.7% discontinued the drug due to diarrhea. The incidence of SAEs was similar between linaclotide- and placebo-treated patients (n = 2 patients in each group); diarrhea was not reported as an SAE.

In conclusion, linaclotide significantly improved abdominal and bowel symptoms in this phase 3 trial (12-week treatment period+4-week RW period).

### Linaclotide for constipation-predominant IBS [^114kJTEM]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic relapsing disorder characterised by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with defaecation, abdominal bloating and a change in bowel habit. IBS may be classified by the change in bowel function as 'diarrhoea predominant' (IBS-D), 'constipation predominant' (IBS-C) or mixed, or may be unclassified. Although it is not thought to be associated with the development of serious disease, IBS is a debilitating condition often resulting in reduced quality of life and significant use of healthcare resources. Current drug treatment strategies target the patient's predominant symptoms and typically involve the use of an antispasmodic and either a laxative or antidiarrhoeal agent. Linaclotide (Constella-Almirall) is an oral guanylate cyclase-C receptor agonist licensed for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe IBS-C in adults. In this article, we consider the evidence for linaclotide and how its use fits with current management strategies for IBS-C.

### Prevention and management of adverse events related to regorafenib [^112bzjP9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Diarrhea

Diarrhea is common among patients receiving regorafenib. Five grades of diarrhea are described in the CTCAE version 4.03 (Table 1). Although grade 1 diarrhea (an increase of < 4 stools per day over baseline) may not present a significant problem for patients, grade 2 diarrhea (increase of 4–6 stools per day over baseline) can have a moderate effect on quality of life, limiting the patient's ability to leave the house, and grade 3 diarrhea (increase of ≥ 7 stools per day over baseline and incontinence) severely affects self-care activities of daily living (ADL). That said, in our experience, the prolonged occurrence of grade 2 diarrhea may negatively affect a patient's quality of life and ADL more than a short-lasting grade 3 event, and so it is important that patients are educated about the need to report and manage any occurrence of diarrhea.

Dietary advice that may minimize the likelihood of diarrhea (e.g. ensuring a low intake of fiber) should be given to patients on initiation of treatment. In order to effectively manage diarrhea and prevent symptoms from increasing in severity, patients should be advised to contact their healthcare team if they have an increase of more than three stools per day. Patients should also be educated about the variation in stool form and advised that changes to stool number or consistency do not always indicate diarrhea that requires treatment. The Bristol stool chart is a useful tool to help explain the variation to patients — stools are classified into seven types, with types 5–7 tending towards diarrhea.

We recommend that patients experiencing diarrhea of grades 1 and 2 should be advised to take loperamide (two 2-mg tablets) after the first stool and one additional tablet every 2 h, until 12 h after the last watery stool, for a maximum of 48 h. It is important to confirm that the patient is experiencing diarrhea, as the use of loperamide could otherwise cause constipation. In addition, the risk of developing constipation is increased in a patient already taking opioids for cancer-related pain. If loperamide does not control the diarrhea, for example when diarrhea remains grade 3 or higher after the 48-h loperamide period, the patient is likely to become dehydrated — the patient should be encouraged to increase fluid intake and hospital admission should be considered.

AGA irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) — loperamide recommendation and evidence: The AGA suggests using loperamide in patients IBS-D-. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty). No new studies have evaluated the efficacy of loperamide in the management of patients with IBS, and evidence comes from two small, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials; there was a lack of beneficial effect on global improvement of symptoms of IBS and urgency, with no improvement in urgency and no data on IBS-QOL or adverse events. Loperamide is FDA-approved for the treatment of diarrhea, and the optimal dose and method of using loperamide is not known and can vary between patients based on symptom patterns.

### Clinical response to linaclotide at week 4 predicts sustained response in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and improvements in digestive and extra-digestive symptoms [^116hataW]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

IBS-C is a chronic condition requiring long-term management, and patient dissatisfaction with available treatment options or lack of response to treatment can result in negative outcomes such as repeated physician consultations, use of multiple treatments (over-the-counter or prescription medications), medication switching, use of unproven medications, or unnecessary surgery. Therefore, it is important to understand the effectiveness of any treatment over time. The ability to identify patients who will or will not respond to a treatment, both in the short and long term, would be of substantial clinical value and will be important in establishing reasonable patient, prescriber, and payer expectations of the effectiveness of a treatment. Current treatment recommendations for linaclotide suggest a first follow-up visit 4 weeks after initiation, with a second visit at 12 weeks and periodically thereafter, depending on the individual patient's needs.

The aim of this study was to identify factors that may help predict a short- and long-term clinical response to linaclotide and to assess the impact of linaclotide on IBS-C symptoms, including GI, digestive nonintestinal, and extra-digestive symptoms after 12 weeks.

### Effectiveness and tolerability of linaclotide in the treatment of IBS-C in a "real-life" setting: results from a Portuguese single-center study [^111BFccK]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Although linaclotide has been approved to treat moderate to severe IBS-C, no data are available on its effectiveness and tolerability in patients in a real-life setting.

Methods

A prospective single-center study of the effectiveness and tolerability of linaclotide was carried out on patients (n = 40) with moderate to severe IBS-C, all fulfilling the Rome IV criteria. Clinical information was recorded using a dietary questionnaire at baseline, and 3 and 6 months after initiating treatment. The end-points to measure effectiveness included abdominal pain and bloating (11-NRS), the number of bowel movements and patient satisfaction. Tolerability was assessed through the frequency of adverse events.

Key Results

In terms of efficacy, an improvement in abdominal pain and in the intensity of bloating was evident in the cohort after 6 months of linaclotide therapy. The proportion of patients with moderate or severe symptoms of bloating fell from 93.3% to 33.3% and those with pain from 93.4% to 20%. Weekly bowel movements also improved and accordingly, 97% of the patients were moderately or very satisfied with the treatment. At the end of the study, diarrhea was the most frequent adverse event (10%), although it was considered mild in 66.7% of these subjects and moderate in 33.3%. A lack of efficacy (n = 3) and excessive diarrhea (n = 7) were motives for discontinuing the treatment.

Conclusions and Inferences

Linaclotide proved to be a safe and effective drug to reduce the main symptoms of IBS-C in everyday clinical practice, with an improvement comparable to that seen in clinical trials.

### Safety and efficacy of linaclotide in children aged 2–5 years with functional constipation: phase 2, randomized study [^117198tE]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase-C agonist, was recently approved in the United States for the treatment of children 6–17 years of age with functional constipation (FC). This study evaluated the dose-response, safety, and efficacy of 4 weeks of linaclotide compared with placebo in children 2–5 years of age with FC.

Methods

In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multidose study, 35 children with FC (based on Rome III criteria) were randomized 3:1 to receive linaclotide (18, 36, or 72μg, for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and 5:1 to receive linaclotide 9, 18, 36, or 72μg (group 4), or matching placebo. Key endpoints were the changes from baseline in overall spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) frequency (SBMs/week), stool consistency, and straining, as well as the proportion of days with fecal incontinence during the study intervention period. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded.

Results

Of the randomized patients, 34 (97.1%) completed the treatment period and 33 (94.3%) completed the posttreatment period. Mean change from baseline over the treatment period for three of the four key efficacy endpoints showed greater improvement in the linaclotide 72μg group versus placebo. A dose-response trend was seen for stool consistency in patients receiving linaclotide. Four patients randomized to linaclotide experienced treatment-emergent AEs, one of which was treatment-related (mild diarrhea). All AEs were mild or moderate and none were severe.

Conclusions

Linaclotide was well tolerated in this pediatric population and an efficacy trend was seen with linaclotide 72μg versus placebo.

### Clinical response to linaclotide at week 4 predicts sustained response in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and improvements in digestive and extra-digestive symptoms [^116saHDz]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Linaclotide is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation (IBS-C) in adults. This study aimed to assess factors predictive of a clinical response and improvements in non-IBS symptoms with linaclotide treatment in a Spanish patient population.

Methods

In this open-label phase IIIb study, patients with moderate-to-severe IBS-C received linaclotide 290 μg once daily for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was clinical response at week 12, defined as > 30% reduction in IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) or IBS-SSS < 75 plus self-reported response of feeling 'better' or 'much better' versus the baseline. Digestive nonintestinal and extra-digestive symptom scores were assessed. Baseline characteristics and week 4 clinical response were assessed as predictors of week 12 clinical response.

Results

A total of 96 patients were eligible; 91 were female and the mean age was 47.4 years. Mean (SD) baseline IBS-SSS was 371 (72.5). In the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations, 22.9% and 31.7% were clinical responders at week 4, respectively, and 25.0% and 36.7% were clinical responders at week 12. Digestive nonintestinal and extra-digestive symptom scores were significantly improved at weeks 4 and 12. Baseline characteristic was not associated with week 12 clinical response; however, clinical response at week 4 was predictive of response at week 12 (OR: 6.5; 95%IC: 2.1–19.8). The most common adverse event was diarrhea inclusive of loose or watery stools (35.4%).

Conclusions

Linaclotide improves IBS-C symptoms, including digestive nonintestinal and extra-digestive symptoms. A clinical response at week 4 may predict response at week 12.

### Clinical response to linaclotide at week 4 predicts sustained response in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and improvements in digestive and extra-digestive symptoms [^116znua4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This trial demonstrated that linaclotide is an effective treatment for IBS-C that improves GI, digestive nonintestinal, and extra-digestive symptoms related to the disorder. In line with previous findings, linaclotide is effective in patients with IBS-C, regardless of factors such as baseline disease severity and the presence of anxiety or depression. Furthermore, a clinical response to linaclotide after 4 weeks of treatment, based on simultaneous improvement in symptom severity and global improvement, may predict a response with continued use; results from this study suggest that improvements may be observed by week 12. Taken together, these findings may allow for better clinical decision-making, as they validate the comparable efficacy of linaclotide in patients with severe IBS symptoms and provide a basis for evaluation of response to linaclotide over time in clinical practice.

For five of the six secondary 12-week change-from-baseline endpoints, the linaclotide 72-μg group demonstrated statistically significant improvements compared with placebo (Table 2). The mean number of CSBMs and SBMs per week increased during treatment with linaclotide 72 μg by 1.7 and 2.4, respectively (both P < 0.0001). Mean stool consistency score in the linaclotide 72-μg group was 3.6, an increase of 1.7 from baseline, compared to 3.0, an increase of 1.1 from baseline, for the placebo group (P < 0.0001). The linaclotide 72-μg group also had 12-week-change-from-baseline improvements in abdominal symptoms (11-point NRS) relative to placebo, including improvement in abdominal bloating (−1.4 for 72 μg vs. −1.1 for placebo; P = 0.0063) and abdominal pain (an additional study endpoint, −1.2 for 72 μg vs. −1.0 for placebo; nominal P = 0.0183). For each of these parameters, improvement was seen during the first week of treatment and was sustained throughout the trial (Figure 3). Weekly change-from-baseline results over the 12 weeks of treatment for the linaclotide 145-μg group were similar to the 72-μg group, with modest dose ordering observed (Table 2, Figure 3).

### Linaclotide for the treatment of refractory lower bowel manifestations of systemic sclerosis [^113qzXDz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first report examining the tolerability and clinical response of SSc patients with severe GI disease treated with linaclotide for constipation. Our experience suggests that linaclotide is a safe and effective option in SSc patients with significant lower GI disease manifestations who have not responded adequately to other medications. Patients used linaclotide for a mean duration of 22.6 months for treatment. We found that 90% (28/31) of patients had a favorable response to linaclotide, either as monotherapy or when used in combination with other agents. While, diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain were common side effects, no major drug-related adverse events were reported in this cohort of SSc patients, which was likely related to the minimal systemic absorption of this medication. Guidelines for electrolyte monitoring have not been developed for this patient population, though the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommend monitoring of patients "prone to a disturbance of water or electrolyte balance should be specifically monitored".

The majority of patients in this study had severe lower GI disease, with 74% having a history of recurrent pseudo-obstruction or malabsorption (n = 20) and/or dependence on total parenteral nutrition (n = 3). Though pseudo-obstruction in SSc has historically been attributed to small bowel dysmotility, in our Scleroderma Center, we have found that pseudo-obstruction in SSc is instead associated with severe colonic hypomotility. A recent study also determined that severe colonic involvement is under-reported in the SSc population, and that this complication is associated with a high mortality rate of 27%. Table 1 illustrates that the patients in our cohort tried multiple medications without sufficient symptomatic relief prior to linaclotide initiation. Many of these medications were continued or added for further optimization after linaclotide initiation, highlighting that linaclotide can be effective as monotherapy or in combination with other agents for constipation in SSc. Linaclotide now provides physicians with another therapeutic option for the management of such patients in the clinical setting. Prospective randomized-controlled studies will be important in determining whether the early initiation of linaclotide in patients with lower GI disease manifestations, such as colonic dysmotility, can reduce the risk of recurrent pseudo-obstruction, hospitalization, and death in the longer term.

### Linaclotide for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation: a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate efficacy and safety [^116fSw5Z]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Linaclotide is a minimally absorbed peptide guanylate cyclase-C agonist. The objective of this trial was to determine the efficacy and safety of linaclotide treatment in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) over 26 weeks.

Methods

This phase 3, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial randomized IBS-C patients to placebo or 290 μg of oral linaclotide once daily for a 26-week treatment period. The primary and the secondary efficacy assessments were evaluated over the first 12 weeks of treatment. Primary end points included the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) end point for IBS-C (responder: a patient who reported (i) improvement of ≥ 30% from baseline in average daily worst abdominal pain score and (ii) increase of ≥ 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) from baseline, both in the same week for ≥ 6 / 12 weeks) and three other primary end points, based on improvements in abdominal pain and CSBMs for 9/12 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored.

Results

In all, 804 patients (mean age = 44 years, female = 90%, white = 78%) were evaluated; 33.7% of linaclotide-treated patients were FDA end point responders, vs. 13.9% of placebo-treated patients (P < 0.0001) (number needed to treat = 5.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.9, 7.1). The pain responder criterion of the FDA end point was met by 48.9% of linaclotide-treated patients vs. 34.5% of placebo-treated patients (number needed to treat = 7.0, 95% CI: 4.7, 13.1), and the CSBM responder criterion was met by 47.6% of linaclotide-treated patients, vs. 22.6% of placebo patients (number needed to treat = 4.0, 95% CI: 3.2, 5.4). Remaining primary end points (P < 0.0001) and all secondary end points (P < 0.001), including abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, and bowel symptoms (SBM and CSBM rates, Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) score, and straining), were also statistically significantly improved with linaclotide vs. placebo. Statistically significant differences from placebo were observed for responder and continuous end points over 26 weeks of treatment. AE incidence was similar between treatment groups, except for diarrhea, which caused discontinuation in 4.5% of linaclotide patients vs. 0.2% of placebo patients.

Conclusions

Linaclotide 290 μg once daily significantly improved abdominal and bowel symptoms associated with IBS-C over 26 weeks of treatment.

Table 2
Co-medications used with linaclotide

The majority of patients in our study had severe lower GI disease. At the time of linaclotide initiation, 23 patients (74%) were classified as having severe GI disease by their treating physician by the Medsger GI severity score [severe score ≥ 3 denotes a history of recurrent pseudo-obstruction, malabsorption, or need for artificial nutrition]. Ten patients also had whole gut scintigraphy studies, with 70% (7/10) of these patients having severely abnormal colonic transit [median percent colonic emptying of only 9.5% at 72 h (normal ≥ 67%)]. Eight patients had anorectal manometry, with abnormal findings in 7 patients (87.5%). Three patients had dyssenergy and four had hypotensive squeeze. Nine patients had UCLA GIT scores completed prior to linaclotide initiation and had scores in the severe range (1.01–3.00), with a mean constipation domain score of 1.03 (SD: 0.55).

Symptom response and dosing

Patients in our study were on therapy for a mean duration of 22.6 months (SD ± 18 months) and 90% (28/31) of patients responded to treatment with linaclotide. We then compared response and side effects reported in patients who required low versus high-dose linaclotide (Table 3). In our cohort, 13 patients (42%, 13/31) were on a high dose prescription whereas 18 patients were on a low-dose regimen (58%, 18/31). Interestingly, diarrhea, cramping and bloating were more commonly identified in the low-dose group, with 50% (9/18) in low dose and 15% (2/13) in the low dose group (p = 0.066) reporting these symptoms. Six patients (1 low dose and 5 high dose) stopped the medication due to lack of efficacy with this treatment. This ranged from short term failures (3 months) to discontinuation after 51 months of usage.

### Linaclotide reduced response time for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation symptoms: analysis of 4 randomized controlled trials [^112n2dFk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

There are several agents approved for treating the symptoms of IBS-C, each with their efficacy and safety established in randomized controlled trials. Clinical decisions regarding treatment selection are aided somewhat by the use of FDA-recommended standardized end points across clinical trials, as exemplified by the ability to make indirect comparisons of efficacy between secretagogues in IBS-C. Although the dichotomous end point, incorporating responses in both abdominal pain and CSBMs that function together in a single stringent end point, is useful for establishing clinical efficacy and in offering a standard of comparison, it does not necessarily provide clinicians with sufficient information to establish treatment plans and set expectations for patients with varying symptom profiles in routine clinical practice.

When treating patients with IBS-C, it is necessary to recognize that multiple symptoms contribute to a patient's experience. The relative burden of each symptom and treatment efficacy will likely vary among individual patients (,–), as will time to response. In clinical practice, providers want to be able to work with their patients to set realistic expectations of symptom improvement and to provide time lines as to when treatment benefits may occur. Data concerning these issues will reduce the likelihood of prematurely stopping a treatment, which might benefit the patient subsequently and temper expectations. The analyses presented here provide useful insights into the time to response for individual abdominal symptoms and CSBM frequency and allow examination of patient profiles that may predict time to response. Our analyses suggest that more than half of patients with IBS-C who initiate linaclotide treatment will experience a decrease of ≥ 30% in the severity of abdominal pain and/or abdominal discomfort within 3 weeks and abdominal bloating within 4 weeks. Of note, the time to CSBM response did not coincide clearly with the time to response for abdominal symptoms. The median time to an increase of ≥ 1 CSBM from baseline preceded the median time to abdominal symptom responses, but the median time to achieving a normal CSBM frequency (≥ 3 CSBMs/week) lagged slightly behind both abdominal pain and discomfort responses. This is consistent with known actions of linaclotide in preclinical models. Further supporting this concept, studies conducted with delayed release formulations of linaclotide, designed to be released in the distal ileum and colon, suggest that its analgesic and bowel modulatory actions may be mediated by 2 distinct guanylate cyclase C agonism pathways.

### UK clinical experience up to 52 weeks with linaclotide for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation [^115w1A2j]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

We undertook a 1-year, multicentre, prospective, observational, single-arm study conducted in the gastroenterology and specialist surgical departments of eight secondary or tertiary care centres in the UK, with recruitment occurring from 16 January 2015 to 16 October 2015. There were no changes to patient management for the purposes of any part of this study and patients were not required to attend any visits in addition to their routine care, but were required to complete questionnaires during routine visits. The study observation period was 52 weeks in duration following the initiation of linaclotide for each patient. The use of concomitant treatments for IBS-C during the study was permitted, and patients withdrawing from linaclotide treatment may have been offered other treatment options, which were not recorded as part of the study.

The study received independent NHS Research Ethics Committee (REC) approval from the East of England, Hatfield REC (reference 14-EE-1221), and also received NHS Trust/Health Board Research and Development department approval at each study centre. All participants provided written, informed consent. Data can be obtained by contacting.

Study population

Eligible patients were men and women aged 18 years and over who had been initiated on linaclotide therapy, at a standard dose of 290 μg orally once daily, at a participating research centre as part of their usual care, and who were able and willing to complete questionnaires and consented to their medical records being used for research purposes. The study aimed to achieve a high level of recruitment of patients initiating linaclotide therapy at participating centres.
