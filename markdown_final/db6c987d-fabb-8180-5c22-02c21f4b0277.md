## Question

Antibiotic for cat scratch

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antibiotic selection for cat scratch disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the causative organism and the natural history of disease. Then, I should verify when antibiotics are indicated versus when observation is appropriate. Next, I will review first-line therapy and dosing, including pediatric adjustments. After that, I need to check alternatives for special populations, especially immunocompromised patients and pregnancy. I will then examine severe or disseminated manifestations and duration of therapy. Finally, I should consider wound care, prevention, and what to do if there is no improvement, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the basics: cat scratch disease is caused by Bartonella henselae, a gram-negative bacillus transmitted primarily via cat scratches or bites, with fleas facilitating feline reservoirs; most immunocompetent patients have a self-limited course with regional lymphadenopathy that resolves over weeks to months, so I need to ensure I don't over-treat uncomplicated cases.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics; I should verify indications. Routine antibiotics are not recommended for typical, self-limited CSD in immunocompetent hosts because the disease often resolves without therapy, and benefits are modest at best, so observation with supportive care is reasonable in most cases [^112CqJAg] [^112KNGJG].

> I will now examine when treatment is warranted; I need to check the scenarios that change management. Indications include moderate to severe systemic symptoms, significant lymphadenopathy causing pain or functional impairment, hepatosplenic or ocular involvement, immunocompromise, or disease persisting beyond about 3 months; in these settings, antibiotics can shorten symptom duration and reduce complications, so I should tailor therapy to severity and host factors [^113evuCy] [^112KNGJG].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy and dosing; let me verify the regimen. Azithromycin is the preferred agent for uncomplicated CSD when treatment is indicated, with adults ≥ 45 kg receiving 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily on days 2–5, and children < 45 kg receiving 10 mg/kg on day 1 followed by 5 mg/kg daily on days 2–5; this regimen is supported by IDSA and aligns with FDA labeling for CSD [^111sf6kj] [^116bEYUr] [^1169EcKD].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for azithromycin; I should double-check the magnitude of benefit. A small randomized trial showed faster lymph node regression with azithromycin compared with placebo, with about 80% reduction in node size by 30 days in the treated group versus 46% with placebo, which supports a modest but clinically meaningful effect in selected patients [^1144AXEB].

> For immunocompromised patients, I need to ensure I escalate appropriately. In HIV or other immunocompromised hosts, preferred therapy is doxycycline 100 mg orally or intravenously every 12 hours, or erythromycin 500 mg orally or intravenously every 6 hours, typically for at least 3 months given the risk of relapse and chronicity; for CNS involvement, adding rifampin 300 mg every 12 hours is reasonable, and for endocarditis, combination doxycycline plus rifampin for 6 weeks followed by prolonged doxycycline is recommended [^1122ALq3] [^113evuCy] [^1153AL6G].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant; I should confirm safety. During pregnancy, avoid tetracyclines; use a macrolide such as erythromycin or azithromycin as first-line therapy for CSD, and if a cephalosporin is considered in more severe disease, prefer third-generation agents because first- and second-generation cephalosporins lack reliable activity against Bartonella [^112dDfwK] [^114kw9Ms].

> I will now examine severe or disseminated manifestations and duration; let me think about osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and ocular disease. For osteomyelitis or other deep infections, prolonged therapy with doxycycline, often with rifampin, for 3 months or more is typical based on case series and HIV OI guidance; for endocarditis, 6 weeks of doxycycline plus rifampin followed by continued doxycycline is standard; for ocular disease, doxycycline is commonly used with adjunctive local or systemic corticosteroids in select cases, though high-quality trial data are limited [^113evuCy] [^111Dhb3t] [^113aq5s8].

> Hold on, I should verify wound care and prevention because antibiotics alone are not enough. Prompt cleansing of scratches or bites with soap and water for at least 20 minutes reduces risk, and in immunocompromised patients, comprehensive flea control for cats and avoidance of rough play are key; there is no evidence supporting routine testing or treatment of healthy cats, and primary chemoprophylaxis for humans is not recommended [^113czjuU] [^113Fz7Vd] [^116fTePo].

> Let me reconsider what to do if there is no improvement; I should confirm next steps. If lymphadenopathy persists beyond 3–4 months or suppurates, consider aspiration or incision and drainage for diagnostic material and symptom relief, and reassess for alternative diagnoses or complications; in rare refractory cases, surgical excision of chronically inflamed nodes may be required, particularly in immunocompromised hosts [^115k6Jec] [^11493uvT].

> In summary, I need to ensure my approach matches severity and host status: for immunocompetent patients with mild disease, observe; for moderate disease or when treatment is desired, use azithromycin for 5 days; for immunocompromised patients or severe/disseminated disease, use doxycycline or erythromycin for at least 3 months, adding rifampin for CNS or endocarditis; adjust for pregnancy by avoiding tetracyclines and prioritizing macrolides; and always pair therapy with meticulous wound care and prevention strategies [^111sf6kj] [^1122ALq3] [^112dDfwK] [^113czjuU].

---

For immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated cat scratch disease, **no routine antibiotics** are needed because the illness is self-limited [^112CqJAg]; consider azithromycin only if symptoms are severe or persistent, using 500 mg on day 1 then 250 mg daily for 4 more days [^111sf6kj] [^1169EcKD]. For immunocompromised patients or those with disseminated disease (bacillary angiomatosis, hepatosplenic involvement, CNS disease, or endocarditis), **treat with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for at least 3 months** [^1122ALq3] [^1153AL6G]; add rifampin 300 mg twice daily for severe or CNS disease [^113evuCy]. Azithromycin is an alternative for mild disease or when doxycycline is contraindicated, but it is less reliable for severe manifestations [^117PbxdS]. Always combine therapy with wound care and flea control [^113czjuU].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy is **not routinely recommended** for immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated CSD because the disease is self-limited [^112CqJAg]. Antibiotics may be considered in the following scenarios:

- **Severe or persistent symptoms**: Significant lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms, or prolonged illness (> 3 months) [^115PoqEx].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: HIV/AIDS, immunosuppressive therapy, or other immunodeficiencies [^1122ALq3].

- **Disseminated disease**: Bacillary angiomatosis, hepatosplenic involvement, CNS disease, or endocarditis [^113evuCy].

---

## First-line antibiotic therapy

### Immunocompetent patients

For immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated CSD, **observation and supportive care** are generally sufficient [^112CqJAg]. If antibiotics are deemed necessary, azithromycin is the **first-line agent**:

- **Azithromycin**: 500 mg orally on day 1, followed by 250 mg daily for 4 additional days (total 5 days) [^111sf6kj] [^1169EcKD].

- **Pediatric dosing**: 10 mg/kg on day 1, followed by 5 mg/kg daily for 4 additional days [^111sf6kj].

Azithromycin has been shown to reduce the duration of lymphadenopathy and hasten clinical recovery in uncomplicated cases [^1144AXEB].

---

### Immunocompromised patients or disseminated disease

For immunocompromised patients or those with disseminated CSD, **prolonged antibiotic therapy** is recommended:

- **Doxycycline**: 100 mg orally or intravenously every 12 hours for at least 3 months [^1122ALq3] [^1153AL6G].

- **Alternative**: Erythromycin 500 mg orally or intravenously every 6 hours for at least 3 months [^1122ALq3].

For severe infections (e.g. CNS involvement or endocarditis), **add rifampin** 300 mg orally or intravenously every 12 hours to doxycycline or erythromycin [^113evuCy].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies

Alternative antibiotic therapies may be considered in cases of intolerance or resistance to first-line agents:

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Dosage** |
|-|-|-|
| Clarithromycin | Alternative macrolide | 500 mg orally twice daily [^117PbxdS] |
| Ciprofloxacin | Alternative fluoroquinolone | 500 mg orally twice daily for 7–10 days [^11385iEn] |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | Alternative agent | 1–2 double-strength tablets orally twice daily |

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Antibiotic therapy, particularly with azithromycin, has been shown to **reduce the duration of lymphadenopathy** and accelerate clinical recovery in uncomplicated CSD [^1144AXEB]. In immunocompromised patients or those with disseminated disease, prolonged therapy with doxycycline (with or without rifampin) is effective in controlling infection and preventing relapse [^notfound].

---

## Potential side effects and contraindications

- **Azithromycin**: Generally well-tolerated; potential side effects include gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and rare QT prolongation.

- **Doxycycline**: Gastrointestinal upset, photosensitivity, and contraindicated in pregnancy and children under 8 years due to risk of tooth discoloration and impaired bone growth.

- **Erythromycin**: Gastrointestinal upset, hepatotoxicity, and drug interactions.

---

## Adjunctive therapies and supportive care

Supportive care remains essential in managing CSD. This includes **analgesics** for pain and antipyretics for fever, warm compresses to relieve lymphadenopathy discomfort, and patient education on the self-limited nature of the disease and the importance of adherence to prescribed therapy if antibiotics are indicated [^notfound].

---

## Prevention strategies

Preventive measures focus on reducing exposure to Bartonella henselae:

- **Flea control**: Regular flea control in cats to reduce transmission risk [^113czjuU].

- **Wound care**: Prompt cleansing of cat scratches or bites with soap and water [^113czjuU].

- **Education**: Informing patients, particularly immunocompromised individuals, about the risks associated with cat exposure and scratches [^113Fz7Vd].

---

Antibiotic therapy for cat scratch disease is **selective**, with azithromycin for immunocompetent patients with severe or persistent symptoms and doxycycline-based regimens for immunocompromised patients or those with disseminated disease. Supportive care and prevention remain integral to management.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Bartonella — Preventing exposure in HIV-infected patients: HIV-infected patients, specifically those who are severely immunocompromised (CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm³), are at high risk of severe disease when infected by B. quintana and B. henselae. The major risk factors for acquisition of B. henselae are contact with cats infested with fleas and receiving cat scratches, and immunocompromised individuals should consider the potential risks of cat ownership (AIII). Patients who want cats should acquire animals that are older than age 1 year and in good health (BII), avoid rough play with cats and situations in which scratches are likely (AII), avoid contact with flea feces and wash any cat-associated wound promptly with soap and water (BIII), and include a comprehensive, ongoing flea-control program under the supervision of a veterinarian (BIII). No evidence indicates any benefits to cats or their owners from routine culture or serologic testing of the pet for Bartonella infection or from antibiotic treatment of healthy, serologically positive cats (BII). The major risk factor for B. quintana infection is body lice infestation, and patients who are homeless or in marginal housing should be informed that body louse infestation can be associated with serious illness and provided with appropriate measures to eradicate body lice, if present (AII).

### Animals in healthcare facilities: recommendations to minimize potential risks [^1144UcET]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Risks of animals in healthcare — evidence base and pathogen scope are described, noting that few scientific studies have addressed the potential risks of animal-to-human transmission of pathogens in the healthcare setting, experience from case reports and outbreak investigations is minimal, and general knowledge plus limited research indicates cause for concern; human strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have increasingly been described in cats, dogs, horses, and pigs, with animals potentially acting as sources of MRSA exposure in healthcare facilities, and a wide range of pathogens exist including common healthcare-associated pathogens, emerging infectious diseases, common zoonotic pathogens, rare but devastating zoonotic pathogens, and pathogens associated with bites and scratches.

### Cat-scratch disease [^111vkaUN]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cat scratch disease:

- **Definition**: CSD is a bacterial infection caused by Bartonella henselae, an aerobic Gram-negative bacillus.
- **Pathophysiology**: CSD is caused by Bartonella henselae, an aerobic Gram-negative bacillus. Bartonella henselae can infect feline erythrocytes and fleas, which can contaminate saliva and then be introduced into humans through biting and clawing by cats. The cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, is the vector responsible for horizontal transmission of the disease from cat to cat, and its bite can also infect humans. In addition, tick bites may transmit the bacterium to humans.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the annual incidence of CSD is estimated at 4.5 cases per 100,000 person-years, while the incidence of CSD requiring hospitalization is estimated at 0.19 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: In the classic disease course, a papule or pustule develops 3–30 days following a scratch or a bite, and regional lymphadenopathy develops about 3 weeks after inoculation. Suppurative lymphadenopathy may develop in 10% of cases. Less than 2% of patients develop extranodal disease (for example CNS, liver, spleen, bone, and lung involvement).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In most patients, especially children, the disease is self-limited, and resolves without specific treatment. In immunosuppressed patients, Bartonella henselae can lead to bacillary angiomatosis and bacillary peliosis, which have high rates of relapse and require prolonged antibiotics.

### Cat-scratch disease [^112KNGJG]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Cat-scratch disease is a common infection that usually presents as tender lymphadenopathy. It should be included in the differential diagnosis of fever of unknown origin and any lymphadenopathy syndrome. Asymptomatic, bacteremic cats with Bartonella henselae in their saliva serve as vectors by biting and clawing the skin. Cat fleas are responsible for horizontal transmission of the disease from cat to cat, and on occasion, arthropod vectors (fleas or ticks) may transmit the disease to humans. Cat-scratch disease is commonly diagnosed in children, but adults can present with it as well. The causative microorganism, B. henselae, is difficult to culture. Diagnosis is most often arrived at by obtaining a history of exposure to cats and a serologic test with high titers (greater than 1:256) of immunoglobulin G antibody to B. henselae. Most cases of cat-scratch disease are self-limited and do not require antibiotic treatment. If an antibiotic is chosen, azithromycin has been shown in one small study to speed recovery. Infrequently, cat-scratch disease may present in a more disseminated form with hepatosplenomegaly or meningoencephalitis, or with bacillary angiomatosis in patients with AIDS.

### Cat-scratch disease in the United States, 2005–2013 [^114p79BT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database (Truven Health Analytics, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) for 2005–2013. This database contains information on employer-sponsored private health insurance claims from employees, their spouses, and their dependents from all 50 states. The database contains records for persons < 65 years of age only.

The MarketScan database includes information about inpatient admissions, outpatient clinic visits, and emergency department visits with associated billing codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). A case was defined as illness in any patient with an insurance claims record for inpatient or outpatient care that included the ICD-9-CM code for cat-scratch disease (078.3) as either a principal or secondary diagnosis. Only the first record with the 078.3 code was counted and considered the incident event. Patients who had been admitted as inpatients and had also had outpatient visits were counted as inpatients.

Because some persons in the database were covered by an included health insurance plan for only part of each year, we calculated the denominators for incidence calculations by summing the total number of person-months by year, region, age, and sex. We then divided these sums by 12 to yield the number of person-years for each category. To assess changes in the epidemiology of CSD over time, we divided the dataset into two 3-year periods (2005–2007 and 2011–2013), with a washout period of 3 years in between.

The cost of hospitalization and outpatient visits was calculated by summing total payments for the initial encounter plus any subsequent encounter with the 078.3 code up to 1 year afterward. Total costs included the primary insurance payment, co-insurance, and patient copayment. Costs for procedures such as phlebotomy and laboratory testing were included if they had an associated 078.3 code. Costs of inpatient medications were incorporated into the total payments for hospital stay. Outpatient prescriptions were included in the total cost calculation if they were for an antimicrobial drug recommended for treatment of CSD and prescribed within 30 days before or after the initial outpatient 078.3 encounter.

### Bone infection in cat-scratch disease: a review of the literature [^114d5bPq]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the main features of bone infection associated with Cat-scratch disease (CSD).

Methods

We searched for articles indexed in the international literature databases by using the following key words: "Bartonella", "bone", "cat-scratch", "osteomyelitis" and "osteolytic".

Results

Cases of 47 patients were reviewed. The median age was 9 years, with an equal sex distribution. Bone pain and fever were the main symptoms. The presence of fever and increased age were more common in patients with bone infection than classically reported in uncomplicated (i.e. nodal) CSD. The vertebral column and pelvic girdle were the most common sites of infection. Radiological examination typically confirmed bone osteolysis. All patients recovered without complications or chronic infection, although they received a various combination antibiotic regimen and duration therapy. The mechanism by which infection might spread to the bone is via the haematogenous route, accounting for most of the disseminated cases and via the lymphatic route, for those with regional limited extension.

Conclusions

Bone infection is rare but should be considered when bone pain and fever are present in a patient with nodal CSD. The prognosis is good, whatever treatment is given. Thus bone biopsy should be recommended only in a difficult diagnostic setting, when other bacteria or malignant disease are suspected.

### Ocular complications of cat scratch disease [^111Dhb3t]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cat scratch disease (CSD) in humans is caused by infection with Bartonella henselae or other Bartonella spp. The name of the disease reflects the fact that patients frequently have a history of contact (often involving bites or scratches) with infected cats. Patients with CSD typically develop lesions at the site where the skin is broken together with regional lymphadenopathy but may go on to exhibit systemic symptoms and with deep-seated infections at a range of sites including the eye. Patients with CSD may present with a range of inflammatory eye conditions, including Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome, neuroretinitis, multifocal retinitis, uveitis and retinal artery occlusion. Bartonella spp. are fastidious bacteria that are difficult to culture from clinical specimens so microbiological diagnosis is frequently made on the basis of positive serology for anti- Bartonella antibodies or detection of bacterial DNA by PCR. Due to the lack of clinical trials, the evidence base for optimal management of patients with CSD-associated eye infections (including the role of antibiotics) is weak, being derived from single reports or small, uncontrolled case series.

Dog or cat bites — Preemptive antibiotics are recommended for high-risk patients and rabies postexposure prophylaxis may be needed. Preemptive early antimicrobial therapy for 3–5 days is recommended for patients who are immunocompromised, asplenic, have advanced liver disease, have preexisting or resultant edema of the affected area, have moderate to severe injuries (especially to the hand or face), or have injuries that may have penetrated the periosteum or joint capsule (strong, low). Postexposure prophylaxis for rabies may be indicated; consultation with local health officials is recommended to determine if vaccination should be initiated (strong, low).

### Status epilepticus due to cat scratch disease: recognition, diagnosis, and thoughts on pathogenesis [^111wrF6e]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Despite the publication of a number of case reports since the 1950s, physician awareness of the unique relationship between cat scratch disease (CSD) and acute encephalopathy remains limited. This report alerts emergency medicine physicians to include CSD encephalopathy (CSDE) in the differential diagnosis when a previously healthy child presents with status epilepticus. Prompt recognition of this relationship impacts the selection of initial diagnostic studies and antibiotic choices and permits reliable insight into prognosis. The 2 cases are from different eras and demonstrate the significant diagnostic advances in the past 3 decades for Bartonella henselae infection. Both children were treated with antibiotics, and both had resolution of all neurological symptoms. However, the role of antibiotics in the treatment and outcome of CSDE remains speculative. Lastly, the report suggests potential areas of investigation to address immune-mediated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CSDE.

Bartonella infection prevention in adults and adolescents with HIV — risk awareness, pet exposure, and lice control — states that major risk factors for acquisition of B. henselae are contact with cats infected with fleas and receiving cat scratches; immunocompromised individuals should consider the potential risks of cat ownership (AIII); people with HIV who want cats should acquire animals that are older than 1 year of age and in good health (BII), from a known environment with documented health history and free of fleas; stray or flea-infested cats should be avoided; declawing is not advised, but individuals with HIV should avoid rough play and situations in which scratches are likely (AII); people with HIV should avoid contact with flea feces and wash any cat-associated wound promptly with soap and water (BIII); cat care should include a comprehensive, ongoing flea-control program under veterinarian supervision (BIII); no evidence indicates benefits from routine culture/serologic testing of pets for Bartonella or from antibiotic treatment of healthy, serologically positive cats (BII); the major risk factor for B. quintana infection is body lice infestation, and people with HIV who are experiencing homelessness or in marginal housing should be informed and provided measures to eradicate body lice, if present (AII); primary chemoprophylaxis for Bartonella-associated disease is not recommended (BIII); and regardless of CD4 count, people with HIV and solid organ transplantation may be at risk of more severe Bartonella infections.

### Cat scratch disease and bartonellaceae: the known, the unknown and the curious [^117LLA2G]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Since the early 1900s, Bartonella species were known only to cause human disease resulting from very restricted geographic (bartonellosis) or environmental influences ("trench fever"). In the 1990s, and in parallel, cat scratch disease and bacillary angiomatosis were definitively linked to Bartonella species. Subsequently, widespread use of modern diagnostic methods revealed the broad ecologic niche of this organism and greatly expanded our knowledge of the epidemiology and clinical presentations associated with this genus. A large number of reservoirs and vectors involved with Bartonella propagation and transmission to humans have been identified; cats and various arthropods remain the most well-studied to date. Though not completely understood, it appears that specific immune-modulated interactions between the infecting species and host-related factors play a major role in the observed breadth of human clinical syndromes associated with Bartonellae, the large differences in immunopathologic features of tissue samples among different syndromes and potentially the varied responses to antimicrobial therapy. Further, the clinical management for cat scratch disease in particular is quite variable among clinicians, reflecting a poor evidence base. No preventive measures have been developed beyond suggestions to avoid at-risk behavior with known vectors.

Advise patients with HIV consider cat ownership to acquire cats that are older than 1 year of age and in good health
from a known environment, having a documented health history, and free of fleas. Avoid acquiring stray cats and cats with flea infestation. Do not advise declawing but advise avoiding rough play with cats and situations in which scratches are likely.

Cat-scratch disease involves a prolonged and/or complicated course, and lymph node drainage is usually required. Culture and molecular techniques often yield negative results, but immunofluorescence assays may give early information, and elevated antibodies may persist for months. Cat-scratch disease should be suspected in patients with prominent swelling of lymph nodes draining from the upper limbs, limited systemic involvement, and typical epidemiological-clinical features. The temporal antibody response during the sub-acute course remains unknown. Although biomolecular assays are available, the time between onset and investigation is an obstacle to positive results. The role of surgical debridement and the unpredictable activity of antimicrobial agents warrant further investigation.

Infections developing in damaged skin

Infections developing in damaged skin are a heterogeneous group including bite wounds (animal and human bites), pressure ulcers and burn wounds.

Bite wounds (animal and human bites)

Human bite microbiology generally includes Streptococcus spp, S. aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp, Fusobacterium spp and Eikinella spp.

Dog bite microbiology generally includes Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella multocida, Bacteroides spp, Fusobacterium spp, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and S. aureus.

Cat bite microbiology generally includes Pasteurella spp, Capnocytophaga spp, Bartonella henselae (Cat-scratch diseases should be treated with azithromycin 500 mg day 1, 250 mg/day for the next 4 days), S. aureus, Bacteroides spp and Fusobacterium spp.

If managed incorrectly, these infections can develop into more complicated SSTIs.

Treatment
Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue
Antibiotic prophylaxis as principle is not recommended. It is recommended in selected patients.
Antibiotic therapy in selected patients for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 7–10 days if lack of symptom resolution at 5 days.
Tetanus prophylaxis in bite wounds

Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue are the most important factors in preventing infection and can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive wound infection. Primary wound closure is not recommended for wounds, with the exception of those to the face, which should be managed with copious irrigation, cautious debridement, and pre-emptive antibiotics.

The comprehensive meta-analyses of Medeiros et al. in the Cochrane Database demonstrated no evidential basis for reducing the infection rate by prophylactic antibiotics, except for selected cases. Despite the poor state of the evidence wounds that are moderate to severe, have associated crush injury, have associated edema (either preexisting or subsequent), that are on the hands or in proximity to a bone or a joint, or that are in compromised hosts should receive 3–5 days of antibiotic therapy.

A broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against aerobic and anaerobic organisms is required, if systemic signs of infection or severe cellulitis arise.

Human bites that have broken the skin and drawn blood can theoretically transmit hepatitis B, C, and HIV. A patient who has sustained a bite should always confirm that their tetanus booster is up to date.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 9 refugees, immigrants, and migrants [^115LGjQK]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Bite-Associated Infections — Wound infections after cat and dog bites are caused by multiple microorganisms, including S. aureus, α-, β-, and γ-hemolytic streptococci, several genera of gram-negative organisms, and several anaerobes. Pasteurella multocida infection classically occurs after cat bites but can also occur after dog bites, with lesions that develop quickly and are often painful. Patients lacking spleens are at particular risk for severe cellulitis and sepsis due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection after dog bites. Management of cat and dog bites includes consideration of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, as well as tetanus immunization and antibiotic treatment, and avoid primary closure of dog bites to the hand or puncture wounds anywhere on the body. Monkey bite management includes wound care, tetanus immunization, rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, and consideration of antimicrobial prophylaxis; bites and scratches from Old World macaque monkeys have been associated with fatal encephalomyelitis due to B virus infection in humans, and valacyclovir is the recommended post-exposure prophylaxis after high-risk macaque exposure.

### Cat-scratch disease manifesting as uveitis and binocular fundus nodular lesions: a case report [^113aq5s8]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite being described as self-limited in immunocompetent individuals, cat scratch disease (CSD) still carries the potential for visual function impairments. The management of CSD-associated ocular infections lacks a strong evidence base, primarily relying on case reports or case series due to the absence of clinical trials. In the presented case, the patient exhibited a favorable response to pharmacological therapy consisting of doxycycline hyclate and corticosteroids, resulting in significant improvements in both visual acuity and ocular structural integrity. We attributed the favorable visual prognosis in this case to: (a) the patient being in the early stage of the disease, (b) the lesion not severely affecting the macula and optic nerve, and (c) the patient receiving effective and standardized treatment after a definitive diagnosis.

There are alternative approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of the patient. Vitrectomy is a viable diagnostic and therapeutic option. Once the patient experiences worsening vitreous opacity, rapid progression of retinal lesions, or retinal detachment, we would promptly proceed with vitrectomy as a treatment. However, in the diagnostic process of this case, ocular lesions progressed slowly, allowing us to implement a treatment plan that is safer and less damaging to the patient. Considering the potential risk of sub-tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection exacerbating infectious diseases before establishing definitive diagnosis, it is not among our alternative treatment options. Even if the patient is diagnosed with non-infectious uveitis, there's no evidence about the better choice of blindly administering sub-tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection compared to the standardized corticosteroid pulse therapy and immunosuppressive treatment. Therefore, we do not recommend performing sub-tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection in such patients before a definitive diagnosis is established.

In conclusion, we reported a rare case of CSD characterized by binocular fundus nodular lesions. The patient's prognosis demonstrated the favorable therapeutic effects of antibiotics and corticosteroids in the management of CSD.

### Bartonella henselae in skin biopsy specimens of patients with cat-scratch disease [^113F4XCS]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we found live B. henselae in the primary inoculation site after a cat scratch. An incubation period of 2–3 weeks was necessary to obtain B. henselae isolates from the skin lesion, therefore, cultures are not proposed for point-of-care diagnosis. To reduce the delay in diagnosis, real-time RT-PCR enables rapid detection and identification of CSD in skin biopsy specimens and swabs. Probably crucial for the isolation of B. henselae was the fact that the skin biopsy specimens and the swab were sampled early after appearance of the skin papule and that patients did not receive treatment. Two of 3 patients recovered without antimicrobial drug treatment, which leads us to believe that treatment with antimicrobial drugs is not necessary for immunocompetent patients. A cutaneous swab of the skin lesion in the early stage of CSD infection may replace the more painful skin or lymph node biopsies.

Bartonella (cat-scratch disease) in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on anti–tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNFα) therapy — clinical features, diagnosis, and prevention are outlined: Bartonella infections may present with fever and regional lymphadenopathy and up to 25% may spread hematogenously to cause disseminated disease. B henselae is fastidious and thus recovery in routine bacterial cultures is difficult; serologic testing and direct testing of tissue or body fluids by staining and Bartonella polymerase chain reaction are useful for diagnosis, and a 4-fold rise in antibody titers obtained 2 to 4 weeks apart confirms the diagnosis, although caution in immunocompromised hosts is warranted. No data to support routine laboratory serologic testing before anti-TNFα for these risk factors exist; screening for a history of animal exposure before initiating immunosuppressive therapy is encouraged. Immunocompromised people should avoid contact with cats that scratch or bite, young cats (< 12 months), and strays; proper hand hygiene after exposure to animals and promptly washing any scratches or bites with soap and water is imperative, and pasteurization of dairy products for consumption is recommended.

### Cat scratch disease sepsis in an immunocompromised patient [^1151g7zY]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

As a greater number of households have pets, the likelihood of zoonotic infections can rise too. Although in most healthy individuals these infections are self-limiting, they are more serious and can lead to adverse outcomes in the immunocompromised. There is minimal information available for the immunocompromised patient who are pet owners or on pet handling. We report a case of cat scratch disease-related sepsis in an immunocompromised patient. This case illustrates the need for a detailed history, including a pet history, in immunocompromised patients presenting with fever of unknown origin and the need for UK-based information for the immunocompromised on pet care and risks associated with having a pet.

Bartonellosis — Epidemiology and prevention in HIV infection notes that bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is caused by either Bartonella quintana or Bartonella henselae, and "Twenty-four species and three subspecies of Bartonella have been isolated and are officially recognized… and eight have been isolated from humans", but "only B. henselae and B. quintana infections have been identified in HIV-infected patients". BA "most often occurs late in HIV infection, in patients with median CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4 cell) counts < 50 cells/mm³". Exposure patterns differ: "Development of BA lesions caused by B. henselae is statistically linked to cat exposure", while "BA caused by B. quintana is associated with body louse infestation and homelessness", and "To avoid exposure to B. quintana, HIV-infected patients should avoid body lice and, if infected, treat the infestation". For B. henselae, "Cats are the most common vector (via a scratch)… ", and "In some areas of the United States, the prevalence of B. henselae bacteremia in pet cats approaches 50%", supporting that "Control of cat flea infestation and avoidance of cat scratches are therefore critical strategies for preventing B. henselae infections in patients who are HIV infected".

### Cat-scratch disease: a rare cause of osteomyelitis [^115jigpn]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Cat-scratch disease is a zoonosis caused by Bartonella henselae, characterised by regional lymphadenopathy. Rarer presentations, such as osteomyelitis, can occur. We present an adolescent girl with severe right lumbar pain and fever, without animal contacts or recent travels. On examination, pain on flexion of torso, movement limitation and marked lordosis were noted, but there were no inflammatory signs, palpable masses or lymph nodes. Serological investigations revealed elevated inflammatory markers. Imaging revealed a paravertebral abscess with bone erosion. Several microbiological agents were ruled out. After a second CT-guided biopsy, PCR for Bartonella spp was positive. At this point, the family recalled having a young cat some time before. Cat-scratch disease was diagnosed, and complete recovery achieved after treatment with doxycycline and rifampicin. Cat-scratch disease is a challenging diagnosis in the absence of typical features. However, B. henselae must be investigated if common pathogens are ruled out and response to therapy is poor.

### Persistent cat scratch disease requiring surgical excision in a patient with MPGN [^11493uvT]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 13-year-old immunosuppressed patient with unrelenting cat scratch disease despite 9 months of antibiotic therapy. The patient was being treated with mycophenolate and prednisone for membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (type 1) diagnosed 13 months before the onset of cat scratch disease. Cat scratch disease was suspected due to epitrochlear lymphadenitis and an inoculation papule on the ipsilateral thumb, and the diagnosis was confirmed by the use of acute and convalescent titers positive for Bartonella henselae. The patient experienced prolonged lymphadenitis despite azithromycin and rifampin therapy, and she developed a draining sinus tract ∼4 months after initial inoculation while receiving antibiotics. Acute exacerbation of the primary supratrochlear node prompted incision and drainage of the area, with no improvement in the disease course. Ultimately, excision of all affected nodes and the sinus tract 9 months after the initial diagnosis was required to achieve resolution. Bartonella was detected at a high level according to a polymerase chain reaction assay in the excised nodes. Persistent treatment with oral antibiotics may have prevented disseminated infection in this immunosuppressed patient. Surgical excision of affected nodes should be considered in patients with cat scratch disease that persists beyond 16 weeks.

### Cat scratch disease and arthropod vectors: more to it than a scratch? [^112o24ST]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Cat scratch disease is a common infection, particularly in children, and clinicians need to be aware of its potential transmission to humans by arthropod vectors such as fleas and ticks in addition to animal bites and scratches. The absence of a vertebrate bite or scratch does not preclude infection with Bartonella henselae.

Methods

Literature regarding arthropod transmission of B. henselae was reviewed.

Results

B. henselae and related bacterial species are transmitted among cats and dogs by arthropod vectors. In the absence of these vectors, disease does not spread amongst the animals. On the other hand, disease can be spread to humans by bite and scratch as well as by arthropod vectors. Animals commonly infected with B. henselae and arthropod vectors are discussed.

Conclusions

Clinicians should be aware that a common illness, cat scratch disease, can be transmitted by arthropod vectors and a history of an animal scratch or bite is not necessary for disease transmission.

### Cat-scratch disease presenting as a solitary splenic abscess in an elderly man [^113E78Lo]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Patients with cat-scratch disease (CSD), which is caused by Bartonella henselae, typically present with local lymphadenopathy with a brief period of fever and general symptoms. Most cases are self-limiting and usually afflict children and young adults. Although rare, CSD can lead to serious complications, especially in immunocompromised patients. These rare complications often require intensive treatment. We describe the case of a 79-year-old man who presented with general malaise and a high fever. The physical examination findings were unremarkable. Of note, the lymph nodes were not enlarged. An abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast revealed a solitary splenic abscess and no lymphadenopathy. The initial antibiotic treatment was ineffective and a splenectomy was indicated. A history of contact with cats raised the possibility of CSD, which was confirmed by a positive serology test result for B henselae. Antibiotic treatment with azithromycin successfully treated the splenic abscess and splenectomy was avoided.

### Cat-scratch disease in the United States, 2005–2013 [^114fsD7B]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

CSD causes a substantial burden of disease nationwide and disproportionately affects children. Because CSD is a zoonotic infection that is maintained and spread among cats by fleas, comprehensive flea control for cats can help reduce the risk for human infection. Risk may also be reduced by washing hands after contact with cats, to remove potentially infectious flea feces that could enter breaks in the skin. Furthermore, because cats that hunt outdoors are at substantially greater risk for B. henselae bacteremia, limiting hunting activity of cats may reduce risk for human infection. Educational efforts should focus on cat owners, particularly those with children in the household or those with immunocompromising conditions. Additional research is warranted to elucidate the reasons for epidemiologic differences noted in this study and risk factors for severe disease.

### The flea's knees: a unique presentation of cat scratch disease [^113VY7EQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A 4-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with right leg pain and associated limp for one day. There was no trauma or injury; she had no fever or recent illness. Her exam was notable for tenderness and swelling to the right knee, most prominent in the popliteal region. Initial laboratory testing was unremarkable except for a mildly elevated C-reactive protein. She had normal radiographs of the right lower extremity. A soft tissue ultrasound demonstrated popliteal lymphadenopathy, a rare finding in children. Reassessment of the patient revealed cat flea bites to the leg, which prompted concern for Bartonella henselae infection causing Cat-scratch Disease (CSD). The patient was treated empirically with Azithromycin and her Bartonella titers returned two days later consistent with active infection. This is a rare clinical report describing popliteal lymphadenitis and lower extremity arthropathy caused by Bartonella henselae infection secondary to cat flea bites.

### Mycoplasma phocimorsus in woman with tendinous panaritium after cat scratch, Denmark [^114UdS9j]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Future research should investigate whether cats are natural carriers of M. phocimorsus because they are carriers of Bartonella henselae, which is frequently found in blood and claw samples and is known to cause cat-scratch disease. Whether M. phocimorsus is part of the normal bacterial flora in cats or was a transient colonizer before zoonotic transmission is still uncertain. An explanation could involve wet food containing fish remnants as the source, or the cat may have been in contact with a stranded marine mammal, in which mycoplasmas are known to colonize mucosal surfaces.

In summary, this patient had prolonged hospitalization and multiple surgeries as the result of her infection. Empirically, infections are often treated with β-lactam antibiotic drugs, but they are ineffective against Mycoplasma spp. because these bacteria lack a cell wall. Moreover, conventional bacteriologic cultures usually yield negative results for Mycoplasma spp. which generally do not grow on media used for standard bacteriologic cultures because they require specialized media for growth. Consequently, healthcare providers should recognize the significance of integrating diagnostic techniques such as 16S rRNA gene analysis for bacterial identification.

### Encephalopathy with retinitis due to cat-scratch disease [^116eJabT]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Cat-scratch disease is one of several diseases known to be caused by Bartonella species. Some infections due to Bartonella resolve spontaneously without treatment with antibiotics, but in other cases the disease can be fatal without treatment. This case study reports a 7-year-old male who presented with an unexplained encephalopathy and unusual retinal findings associated with evidence supporting infection by B. henselae. The 7-year-old male presented with a 2-week history of general malaise and cervical lymphadenopathy progressing onto fever, headache, vomiting, and confusion associated with meningism. Lumbar puncture revealed a raised cerebrospinal fluid protein, low glucose, and raised white cell count. Abnormal retinal findings and raised antibodies titres to B. quintana indicated a diagnosis of cat-scratch disease. He was treated with azithromycin orally for 3 weeks and made a complete recovery.

### Erythematous pink papules following a cat bite [^112m5qSc]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What treatment would be most appropriate for this patient?
A. Rifampin and isoniazid for 6 months
B. Cephalexin for 10 days
C. Fluconazole for 6 weeks
D. Azithromycin and doxycycline for 4 months
E. Ciprofloxacin for 2 weeks

Answers:
A. Rifampin and isoniazid for 6 months – Incorrect. Rifampin and isoniazid are more appropriate for the treatment of latent tuberculosis. While rifampin does have activity against some atypical mycobacterium, M chelonae is unlikely to respond well to this antibiotic combination.
B. Cephalexin for 10 days – Incorrect. Cephalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin with limited activity against atypical mycobacterium. It is more often used to target staphylococcal or streptococcal infections.
C. Fluconazole for 6 weeks – Incorrect. Fluconazole is an antifungal agent that is not effective against mycobacterium species.
D. Azithromycin and doxycycline for 4 months – Correct. Combination therapy with a macrolide antibiotic and tetracycline for a long-term period (at least 3 months) are appropriate to target M chelonae. Ideally, antibiotic treatment is based on specific susceptibilities if available. The use of doxycycline over other tetracyclines such as minocycline minimizes the risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions.
E. Ciprofloxacin for 2 weeks – Incorrect. Fluoroquinolones alone are inappropriate for the treatment of this atypical mycobacterium and would need to be combined with a macrolide or tetracycline to account for resistance.

The results of his primary care physician's initial clinical examination suggested lymphadenopathy secondary to lymphadenitis, and the patient was treated over a 4-week period with two rounds of antibiotics. However, the mass did not resolve, and it subsequently became fluctuant. The patient was referred to our institution, where we diagnosed cat-scratch disease.

### Periorbital cellulits – a mistaken diagnosis! [^113Hy7nG]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

A 12-year-old girl presented with a 1 week history of orbital swelling associated with granuloma, purulent discharge from the eye and preauricular and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Initial conventional treatment for presumed preseptal cellulitis was unsuccessful. Despite treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics, the preseptal cellulitis progressed to orbital cellulitis with restriction of eye movements in addition to the marked conjunctival chemosis and haemorrhage. A detailed history revealed she had been in close contact with newborn kittens at home and biopsy of the granuloma demonstrated Bartonella species, confirming the diagnosis of cat scratch disease. The child received a course of appropriate oral and topical antibiotics and steroids. Unfortunately eyesight in the right eye remains poor on follow-up.

### Bone scintigraphy in children with cat scratch disease [^1121W2LT]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

The objective of this study was to evaluate the degree and incidence of bone involvement in patients with cat scratch disease.

Methods

Patients admitted between 2004 and 2011 at the pediatric department for cat scratch disease and a positive serology for Bartonella henselae were identified. Only those having undergone a bone scintigraphy (BS) were included in this retrospective study.

Results

Sixteen girls and 8 boys with a mean age of 7 years were studied. Bone scintigraphy was positive in 6 (25%), but only 2 had bone pain. Axial involvement was present in all 6 patients, and appendicular lesions in 3 of them. Three patients had a BS control, with improvement or normalization after treatment with antibiotics.

Conclusions

Bone involvement occurs infrequently in patients with cat scratch disease and is not always associated with specific signs. Cat scratch disease must be suspected in patients with fever of unknown origin presenting multifocal lesions on BS.

### A novel vaccine platform using glucan particles for induction of protective responses against Francisella tularensis and other pathogens [^113mc1J7]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Tularaemia: a challenge for vaccinology

F. tularensis is an intracellular pathogen and the causative agent of the disease tularaemia. Capable of infecting a wide range of hosts, its normal zoonotic hosts are rodents and lagomorphs, but humans can be accidental hosts. The most common form of human tularaemia is ulceroglandular tularaemia, which arises following the bite of an infected insect or arthropod vector. However, it was reported recently that almost half the isolates studied from human cases in Nebraska were cat‐associated, with transmission by bites and scratches 48. In humans, the most acute presentation is respiratory or pneumonic tularaemia, following inhalation of infectious aerosols. The organism has a very low aerosol infectious dose for humans, requiring fewer than 50 CFU to establish respiratory infection 49. Following inhalation, the most highly virulent strains can have a case fatality rate of up to 30% if untreated, but appropriate antibiotic therapy reduces this to approximately 2% 50. Diagnosis based on symptoms is difficult, as the presentation can range from mild pneumonia to an acute infection with high fever, malaise, chills, cough, delirium and pulse–temperature dissociation, all of which are extremely non‐specific. The high aerosol infectivity, morbidity and mortality led to the organism being developed as a biological weapon by various nations, including the reported production of antibiotic‐resistant strains 50, 51. Tularaemia responds well to timely antibiotic therapy. Aminoglycosides, particularly streptomycin, have been used extensively for the treatment of tularaemia, but streptomycin is rarely used now due to adverse side effects, and gentamicin is a suitable alternative which has been used to treat cases of pneumonic tularaemia on Martha's Vineyard 52. However, aminoglycosides are reserved for the most serious cases due to the requirement for parenteral dosing and monitoring of serum levels. Ciprofloxacin is currently the preferred choice of drug for the oral treatment of uncomplicated tularaemia 50. Relapse is common following short courses and some patients may require respiratory support and intensive care should sepsis develop. Suppurating nodes are a common cause of treatment failure, and these may require draining 53. Failure can also arise as a result of delayed initiation of antibiotics or if therapy is withdrawn prematurely (reviewed by Caspar et al. 54) As such, there is strong interest in developing effective medical countermeasures to prevent and treat tularaemia, particularly vaccines.

An otherwise healthy 9-year-old girl presented with bilateral recurrent anterior uveitis. Thirteen months later, the diagnosis of cat-scratch disease (ocular bartonellosis) was suspected when neuroretinitis appeared. Confirmation was based on serological test results positive for Bartonella henselae. Antibiotic treatment completely cured the disease, and there have been no further manifestations during a follow-up period of 6 years.

### Cat-scratch disease in the United States, 2005–2013 [^1115EUvX]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Although the syndrome of CSD was first defined in 1950, identification of the etiologic agent and development of diagnostic tests did not occur until the mid-1980s and later. Therefore, the epidemiology of CSD may have changed in the past few decades because of improved diagnostic tests for CSD and other conditions that mimic CSD. Patients with typical signs of CSD and compatible exposure history can be given a presumptive clinical diagnosis; diagnostic tests such as serology, PCR, and culture can be useful for confirming typical CSD or for diagnosing atypical CSD.

To better define the current epidemiology and burden of CSD in the United States, we analyzed a large medical claims database to 1) describe national patterns of clinician-diagnosed CSD among inpatients and outpatients, 2) evaluate changes in disease patterns during the study period, and 3) identify demographic groups at higher risk for CSD. Improved understanding of CSD may facilitate recognition by clinicians and identification of risk groups for whom education about cats and flea control is particularly helpful.

### Thoracic osteomyelitis and epidural abscess formation due to cat scratch disease: case report [^111vB89r]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis of the spine with associated spinal epidural abscess represents an uncommon entity in the pediatric population, requiring prompt evaluation and diagnosis to prevent neurological compromise. Cat scratch disease, caused by the pathogen Bartonella henselae, encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical presentations; however, an association with osteomyelitis and epidural abscess has been reported in only 4 other instances in the literature. The authors report a rare case of multifocal thoracic osteomyelitis with an epidural abscess in a patient with a biopsy-proven pathogen of cat scratch disease. A 5-year-old girl, who initially presented with vague constitutional symptoms, was diagnosed with cat scratch disease following biopsy of an inguinal lymph node. Despite appropriate antibiotics, she presented several weeks later with recurrent symptoms and back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed 2 foci of osteomyelitis at T-8 and T-11 with an associated anterior epidural abscess from T-9 to T-12. Percutaneous image-guided vertebral biopsy revealed B. henselae by polymerase chain reaction analysis, and she was treated conservatively with doxycycline and rifampin with favorable clinical outcome.

### Cat-scratch disease manifesting as uveitis and binocular fundus nodular lesions: a case report [^115Pq1UZ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cat-scratch disease typically presents with various ocular manifestations such as uveitis, vitritis, retinitis, retinochoroiditis, and optic neuritis. However, fundus nodular lesions was rarely reported. In our study, we reported a case of Cat-Scratch disease with binocular fundus nodular lesions.

Case presentation

An 11-year old male presented with uveitis in the right eye and bilateral fundus nodular lesions after indirect contact with unvaccinated cats. Comprehensive ancillary examinations including wide-angle fundus photography, ultrasonography, fluorescein fundus angiography, optical coherence tomography, and orbital magnetic resonance imaging were performed to elucidate the multidimensional features of the binocular lesions. Metagenomics next-generation sequencing was utilized to confirm the diagnosis of Cat-scratch disease. The patient's condition showed improvement after a 6-month combination treatment regimen involving systemic administration of doxycycline hyclate and methylprednisolone tablets, as well as local application of mydriatic and corticosteroid eye drops.

Conclusions

We firstly reported a case of Cat-scratch disease presenting simultaneously with uveitis and fundus nodular lesions caused by Bartonella henselae infection in a child. Timely diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids showed promising outcomes for the prognosis of these ocular disorders.

### Cat scratch disease presenting as acute mastoiditis [^116hrp49]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To present the first published case of Cat Scratch Disease presenting as acute mastoiditis and review the relevant literature to discuss the Otolaryngologic manifestations of this disease and its treatment.

Design

A case report and literature review of the Otolaryngologic manifestations of Cat Scratch Disease.

Methods

A case report of a clinical scenario followed by a standard literature review. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane database were used to find articles related to the Otolaryngologic manifestations of Cat Scratch Disease.

Results

A 6 year-old female presented to the Otolaryngologist with the typical appearance of acute mastoiditis. CT Scan confirmed breakdown of the osseous septae of the mastoid and mastoidectomy was undertaken. Granulation tissue and infected lymph nodes adjacent to the mastoid cortex were positive for Cat Scratch Disease. The patient was treated expectantly and recovered uneventfully.

Conclusion

This is the first literature report of Cat Scratch Disease presenting as an acute mastoiditis.

### Ocular manifestation of cat-scratch disease in HIV-positive patients [^113pxeqi]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To characterize ocular manifestations of cat-scratch disease in HIV-positive patients.

Design

Retrospective case series study.

Methods

Records and photography of patients with the diagnosis of cat-scratch disease and HIV were reviewed.

Results

From 2001 and 2004 three patients with cat-scratch disease and HIV were identified. All patients presented with subretinal mass associated with an abnormal vascular network. Fluorescein angiography revealed this abnormal vascular network more clearly. All patients were treated with antibiotics alone with good response.

Conclusions

Subretinal mass associated with abnormal vascular network is characteristic of cat-scratch disease in HIV-positive patients. Fluorescein angiography is important to characterize this vascular pattern, and patients may benefit from systemic treatment.

### Bartonella as a cause of mechanical prosthetic aortic root endocarditis [^111gTbQx]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Bartonella henselae infection is typically associated with cat scratch disease. This microorganism can also lead to culture-negative infective endocarditis in immunocompromised patients. We present a rare case of a previously healthy 65-year-old man with B. henselae-associated endocarditis of a prosthetic aortic root. All blood cultures, as well as cultures of the resected aortic valve vegetations, remained negative. Polymerase chain reaction with specific bacterial primers with DNA sequencing was used to identify B. henselae as the etiologic agent. This was successfully managed by an aortic root re-replacement using a mechanical conduit, reimplantation of coronaries ostia, and antibiotic therapy.

Bartonella spp. and Brucella spp. in anti-TNF therapies — background and epidemiology indicate these are potential zoonotic granulomatous infections in adults receiving anti-TNF therapies, with Bartonella spp. and Brucella spp. infection rates of < 1/100,000 patients associated with infliximab use; there have been no published cases in children with inflammatory bowel disease receiving anti-TNF therapies. Cats are a natural reservoir for Bartonella henselae; contact with kittens that are asymptomatic but more likely to have bacteremia is associated with human infection from a scratch or bite or via hands contaminated by flea feces touching an open wound or mucosal surface, and brucellosis is a zoonotic disease transmissible through contact of mucous membranes, cuts in the skin, inhalation of contaminated aerosols, or ingestion of infected foods (most commonly unpasteurized dairy products).

### Encephalopathy in an adult with cat-scratch disease [^114hTkur]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

We report the case of a 53-year-old healthy man, presenting with confusion. The patient had been clinically diagnosed with cat-scratch disease (CSD) and prescribed a 10-day course of doxycycline orally. Approximately a week after he had completed the treatment, he was admitted to our department with confusion. Neurological examination revealed expressive dysphasia with no motor or sensory deficits. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed only increased content. Imaging with CT and MRI of the brain did not reveal any abnormalities, and funduscopy was normal. Serology confirmed Bartonella henselae infection. CSD-associated encephalopathy was confirmed based on the clinical manifestations, CSF findings and positive serology. The patient was treated with a combination of doxycycline and rifampin and he rapidly improved with complete neurological recovery within 7days. Encephalopathy is an unusual manifestation of CSD in adults with excellent prognosis.

### Murine typhus: an unlikely cause of cat scratch fever with ascending rash [^112ZLaky]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Murine typhus is an acute febrile illness characterized by symptoms such as fever, headache, myalgias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and a truncal rash, leading to hospitalization in 10% of patients. The typhus fever group of rickettsial agents includes R. typhi, R.prowazekii, and O. tsustugamushi. Murine typhus is caused by R. typhi and is also known as flea-borne typhus or endemic typhus. Transmission typically involves rodent vectors, but many patients never recall a specific exposure history.

Delayed diagnosis and treatment of murine typhus can result in a prolonged fever lasting weeks and may lead to end-organ damage or fatality if left untreated. Severe cases often present with early laboratory abnormalities, as observed in this patient. Murine typhus has been associated with secondary hemophagocytic syndrome, characterized by cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, and splenomegaly, which were also present in this case. As with other rickettsial infections, doxycycline remains the mainstay of treatment.

Our patient presented with the symptomatic triad of headache, fever, and rash, a combination seen in only one-third of murine typhus cases, along with hallmark lab abnormalities. However, the ascending hand rash is an atypical presentation compared to the classically reported maculopapular rash on the trunk and extremities. The clinical presentation in this case shares features with other infectious diseases, such as the visual floaters and chorioretinitis seen in toxoplasmosis, and localized rash with lymphadenopathy characteristic of cat scratch disease caused by Bartonella henselae. Additionally, the serologies may reflect potential cross-reactivity among different Rickettsial species titers.

The ophthalmologic manifestations of R. typhi seen in this case are rarely seen, but existing reports aided in reaching the diagnosis. Early fundoscopic examination and thorough skin examination can help refine the differential diagnosis while awaiting serologic results. Given the low risk associated with doxycycline, its administration is justified prior to confirmatory diagnosis of murine typhus, as early treatment can prevent serious complications, as evidenced by this case.

Diagnosis of murine typhus in this case may have been complicated and delayed by a positive viral test, concerns over potential acetaminophen-induced transaminitis, and recent travel history. While doxycycline effectively prevented end-organ damage, the patient experienced prolonged effects of R. typhi infection, including slowly resolving anemia and lymphadenopathy. This case represents a unique presentation of murine typhus, characterized by an identifiable mammal exposure, an atypical rash, systemic infection, and disseminated chorioretinitis.

### The continuing ophthalmic challenge of… [^117AV37E]. Ophthalmology Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The World Health Organization estimates that 61% of all human diseases are zoonotic. When Henri Parinaud observed his initial series of POGS patients in 1889, he shrewdly suspected a single disease of animal origin. It then took half a century to determine that most cases were a subset of cat scratch disease and a full century to discover the etiology. Ophthalmologists, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology's Registry of Ophthalmic Pathology all played a significant role in determining Bartonella henselae to be its major cause. Bartonella henselae has several features that have led to speculation about its potential as a public health threat. Our lack of knowledge about several aspects of this bacterium B. henselae is a marked vulnerability. In regard to its epidemiology, its true incidence and prevalence are approximations or assumptions. The disease is self-limited at present and responds to some available antibiotics but is capable of undergoing mutations to make it more virulent. We need to monitor the disease, be aware of its geographic diversity, and better understand its pathobiology.

The ophthalmic community must be proactive, starting with clinical recognition. Residency programs can familiarize residents with the disease's clinical aspects and the laboratory test needed to make the diagnosis. The American Board of Ophthalmology can promote such awareness through its initial and continuing certification assessments. The American Academy of Ophthalmology, through its IRIS® Registry, can bolster the data on incidence and prevalence, and the National Eye Institute can encourage more detailed knowledge of the molecular genetics of B. henselae and the pathogenesis of the diseases. The CDC can provide more up-to-date statistics on its occurrence including its morbidity in childhood and in patients over 65 years. The global "Stop Spillover" virus-hunting effort might include Bartonella bacteria among those diseases it tracks.

Since 1985, essentially all cases of POGS reported in the literature refer to patients shown by serology or molecular testing to have B. henselae infections. In the future, this eponym should refer only to cases fitting Parinaud's original clinical description that are caused by B. henselae and are a subset of cat scratch disease. We suggest discontinuing the use of the term "Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome" and replacing it with "Parinaud's oculoglandular disease".

### The expanded spectrum of bartonellosis in children [^115ZYfb4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Bartonella spp cause various clinical syndromes immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. Domestic cats are the natural reservoir, and vectors of B henselae. B henselae infection usually occurs early in childhood, is generally asymptomatic, and in most cases revolves spontaneously. It may, however, produce a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, the most frequent feature being cat-scratch disease. Disseminated atypical B. henselae infection may follow cat-scratch disease alter a symptom-free period or may present de novo mimicking a wide range of clinical disorders. A careful clinical history researching an intimate contact with a kitten associated with a specific serology and an abdominal ultrasound for typical hepatosplenic involvement may follow a rapid and accurate diagnosis.

### Cat-scratch disease of the head and neck in a pediatric population: surgical indications and outcomes [^115k6Jec]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the presentation of pediatric patients with head and neck manifestations of cat-scratch disease, one of the most common causes of subacute or chronic lymphadenitis in children, and to determine surgical indications and outcomes.

Study Design

Case series.

Subjects and Methods

All pediatric patients from infancy to age 19 years who presented with clinical symptoms of cat-scratch disease and had an IgG serological test result of more than 1:128 for Bartonella henselae.

Results

Nine patients had cat-scratch disease of the head and neck. Median age at presentation was 4 years; median time from symptom onset to presentation was 20 days. Six (67%) children underwent surgical procedures, and median time from presentation to surgical procedure was 43 days.

Conclusion

Despite conservative treatment, a minority of pediatric patients with cat-scratch disease may require surgical drainage of abscess and removal of lymph nodes. Surgical treatment provides tissue for diagnosis, is generally well tolerated, affords improved recovery, and has minimal complications.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113guAep]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Bartonellosis — epidemiology and prevention in people with HIV notes that BA (bacillary angiomatosis) most often occurs late in HIV infection in patients with median CD4 T lymphocyte cell counts < 50 cells/mm³, and in people with HIV, bartonellosis is often a chronic illness lasting for months to more than a year with BA lesions and intermittent bacteremia. Development of BA lesions caused by B. henselae is statistically linked to cat exposure, whereas BA caused by B. quintana is associated with body louse infestation and homelessness; the body louse serves as the vector of B. quintana to humans. To avoid exposure to B. quintana, people with HIV should avoid body lice exposure and have prompt eradication of lice if infestation occurs. The cat flea is the vector of B. henselae in cats, and cats are the most common vector (via a scratch) responsible for transmitting B. henselae to humans. In some areas of the United States, the prevalence of B. henselae bacteremia in pet cats approaches 50%; infection is more common among kittens and feral cat populations. Controlling cat flea infestation and avoiding cat scratches are therefore critical strategies for preventing B. henselae infections in people with HIV. Thirty-seven species and three subspecies of Bartonella have been described and are officially recognized; fourteen of these Bartonella species have been implicated in human infections.

### Evaluation and management of neck masses in children [^1169ZRzn]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Neck masses in children usually fall into one of three categories: developmental, inflammatory/reactive, or neoplastic. Common congenital developmental masses in the neck include thyroglossal duct cysts, branchial cleft cysts, dermoid cysts, vascular malformations, and hemangiomas. Inflammatory neck masses can be the result of reactive lymphadenopathy, infectious lymphadenitis (viral, staphylococcal, and mycobacterial infections; cat-scratch disease), or Kawasaki disease. Common benign neoplastic lesions include pilomatrixomas, lipomas, fibromas, neurofibromas, and salivary gland tumors. Although rare in children, malignant lesions occurring in the neck include lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, thyroid carcinoma, and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Workup for a neck mass may include a complete blood count; purified protein derivative test for tuberculosis; and measurement of titers for Epstein-Barr virus, cat-scratch disease, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, and toxoplasmosis if the history raises suspicion for any of these conditions. Ultrasonography is the preferred imaging study for a developmental or palpable mass. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is recommended for evaluating a malignancy or a suspected retropharyngeal or deep neck abscess. Congenital neck masses are excised to prevent potential growth and secondary infection of the lesion. Antibiotic therapy for suspected bacterial lymphadenitis should target Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococcus. Lack of response to initial antibiotics should prompt consideration of intravenous antibiotic therapy, referral for possible incision and drainage, or further workup. If malignancy is suspected (accompanying type B symptoms; hard, firm, or rubbery consistency; fixed mass; supraclavicular mass; lymph node larger than 2 cm in diameter; persistent enlargement for more than two weeks; no decrease in size after four to six weeks; absence of inflammation; ulceration; failure to respond to antibiotic therapy; or a thyroid mass), the patient should be referred to a head and neck surgeon for urgent evaluation and possible biopsy.

### Bartonella henselae in skin biopsy specimens of patients with cat-scratch disease [^114vTMnN]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

During the past 2 years, we identified live Bartonella henselae in the primary inoculation sites of 3 patients after a cat scratch. Although our data are preliminary, we report that a cutaneous swab of the skin lesion from a patient in the early stage of cat-scratch disease can be useful for diagnosis of the infection.
