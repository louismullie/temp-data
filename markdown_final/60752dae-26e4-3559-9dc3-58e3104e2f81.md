## Question

What is the best measure of kidney function?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the best measure of kidney function is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core concept of kidney function and why glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is central. Then, I should verify the hierarchy of methods to assess GFR, including estimated GFR (eGFR) and measured GFR (mGFR). Next, I will examine the strengths and limitations of creatinine-based eGFR, cystatin C, and combined approaches. After that, I need to check when mGFR is indicated and which exogenous markers and protocols are preferred. Finally, I will integrate special populations and synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation that aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: kidney function is best indexed by GFR because it integrates nephron function and correlates with clinical outcomes, even though we cannot directly measure "true" GFR in humans and must rely on clearance-based proxies and estimates, which is why both eGFR and mGFR carry error relative to true GFR [^117PWaEL] [^111NHckj].

> Wait, let me verify the hierarchy before jumping to conclusions. Contemporary guidelines endorse a tiered approach: start with creatinine-based eGFR for initial assessment, add cystatin C to improve accuracy when needed, and proceed to mGFR when decisions hinge on precise GFR, which operationalizes the principle that the "best" measure depends on the clinical question and required accuracy rather than a single universal test [^1115RY7m] [^111wmBGB] [^1158bsBB].

> I will now examine creatinine-based eGFR as the initial test. It is inexpensive, widely available, and suitable for screening, diagnosis, staging, and monitoring CKD in steady state, but it is confounded by muscle mass, diet, age, sex, and assay issues, and is less precise at higher GFR, so clinicians must interpret results in context and recognize when estimates are likely unreliable [^117AShmo] [^112x7Nwn] [^111gSNZi].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of cystatin C. Cystatin C is less influenced by muscle mass and diet, and combining creatinine and cystatin C in CKD-EPI improves accuracy and reduces misclassification; guidelines recommend eGFRcr-cys when eGFRcr is suspected to be inaccurate or when greater precision is needed for decisions like drug dosing or staging, acknowledging residual error in select populations [^114JiJo2] [^1158bsBB] [^111Ji8Wk].

> Next, I should review when measured GFR is the "best" choice. mGFR using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous markers (iohexol, iothalamate, EDTA, DTPA) is the reference standard when accuracy materially affects management, such as narrow therapeutic index drugs, discordant clinical pictures, extreme body composition, or when eGFR is unreliable; it detects early GFR changes and is less affected by non-GFR determinants, but it requires specialized protocols and quality assurance [^11179K6y] [^111b9PUo] [^114phwkj].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts where the "best" measure shifts. In older adults with sarcopenia, in people with obesity or amputations, in advanced liver disease, in pregnancy, in pediatrics, and in critically ill patients with non-steady state, eGFRcr may be misleading and eGFRcr-cys or mGFR should be prioritized; in cancer therapeutics and clinical trials, direct mGFR is often preferred for eligibility and dosing when precision is paramount [^111Ji8Wk] [^112kCqyZ] [^111yQt5P] [^1158msPy].

> But wait, what if I overstated that mGFR is always the gold standard? I should double-check the nuance. While inulin clearance is historically the gold standard, it is rarely used clinically due to logistics; iohexol plasma clearance is the most practical and widely validated mGFR method today, and even mGFR has biological and methodological variability, so the "best" measure is the one that matches the decision's required accuracy and is feasible in the care setting [^11179K6y] [^114phwkj] [^112szhmr].

> I need to ensure I address acute kidney injury and non-steady states. In AKI, creatinine lags and eGFR equations are invalid, so clinicians should avoid eGFR-based dosing and instead monitor creatinine kinetics, consider short timed clearances, or use emerging functional markers; mGFR can be considered when precise GFR is essential and feasible, recognizing that most protocols are not designed for rapid turnaround in the ICU [^1169M5Da] [^113rsGX2] [^1158msPy].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise answer. For most patients, the best initial measure is a validated creatinine-based eGFR reported with serum creatinine, interpreted with awareness of non-GFR determinants. If accuracy is insufficient or eGFRcr is suspect, add cystatin C and use the combined equation. If decisions demand high precision or eGFR is unreliable, measure GFR with a standardized plasma clearance method such as iohexol. And in special populations or non-steady states, tailor the approach and avoid overreliance on eGFRcr alone [^1115RY7m] [^114JiJo2] [^11179K6y].

> Final answer, keeping it clinically actionable: there is no single "best" measure of kidney function for all scenarios. GFR remains the best overall index of kidney function, and the optimal method is a tiered strategy — start with creatinine-based eGFR, escalate to creatinine plus cystatin C eGFR when more accuracy is needed, and use measured GFR with exogenous markers when precision materially affects management, with explicit attention to population-specific limitations and non-steady-state conditions [^117PWaEL] [^1115RY7m] [^1158bsBB].

The best measure of kidney function is **measured GFR (mGFR)** using plasma or urinary clearance of an exogenous filtration marker (e.g. iohexol, iothalamate, or 51Cr-EDTA) [^11179K6y], as it is the reference standard for accuracy across the GFR range [^117PWaEL]. When mGFR is not available, **eGFR using creatinine and cystatin C (eGFRcr-cys)** is the most accurate alternative [^114JiJo2], especially when creatinine-based estimates are unreliable [^1158bsBB]. Serum creatinine alone is inadequate due to non-GFR determinants (muscle mass, diet, assay interference) [^117AShmo]; cystatin C improves accuracy but is less available and may be confounded by inflammation or corticosteroids [^111Ji8Wk]. Use mGFR when precise GFR is critical (e.g. drug dosing, transplant evaluation) [^11179K6y] [^112yiJoE], and eGFRcr-cys when mGFR is unavailable or impractical [^114JiJo2].

---

## Measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR)

mGFR is the **reference standard** for kidney function assessment [^117PWaEL], providing the most accurate and precise measurement of GFR across the full range of kidney function [^111b9PUo]. It involves measuring the clearance of an exogenous filtration marker (e.g. iohexol, iothalamate, or 51Cr-EDTA) from plasma or urine [^11179K6y]. mGFR is **less influenced by non-GFR determinants** than endogenous markers, making it particularly valuable in clinical scenarios requiring high accuracy, such as:

- Drug dosing with narrow therapeutic indices [^116hYhHF]
- Evaluation for kidney transplantation [^114qJiWz]
- Diagnosis and staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD) when precise GFR is critical [^1158bsBB]

However, mGFR is **resource-intensive**, requiring specialized equipment, trained personnel, and multiple blood samples, which limits its routine use in clinical practice [^111b9PUo].

---

## Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)

eGFR is a widely used alternative to mGFR, calculated from serum biomarkers (primarily creatinine and cystatin C) using validated equations [^115bx5dJ]. eGFR is **convenient, inexpensive, and widely available**, making it the standard initial assessment of kidney function in most clinical settings [^117AShmo].

---

### Creatinine-based eGFR (eGFRcr)

Creatinine-based eGFR (eGFRcr) is the most commonly used initial test for kidney function assessment [^1115RY7m]. It is calculated using serum creatinine, age, sex, and race (in some equations) [^115bx5dJ]. However, eGFRcr has several **limitations**:

- **Non-GFR determinants**: Creatinine levels are influenced by muscle mass, diet, and assay interference, leading to potential inaccuracies [^117AShmo].
- **Accuracy**: eGFRcr is less accurate at higher GFR levels and in certain populations (e.g. elderly, obese, amputees, chronic liver disease) [^117AShmo].
- **Lag time**: Creatinine changes lag behind acute changes in GFR, limiting its utility in acute kidney injury (AKI) [^1169M5Da].

---

### Cystatin C-based eGFR (eGFRcys)

Cystatin C is an alternative endogenous filtration marker that is less influenced by muscle mass, diet, and assay interference than creatinine [^111Ji8Wk]. eGFRcys is **particularly useful** in populations where creatinine-based estimates may be unreliable, such as:

- Elderly individuals
- Patients with sarcopenia or obesity
- Chronic liver disease

However, cystatin C levels can be influenced by inflammation, corticosteroid use, and thyroid dysfunction, which may limit its accuracy in certain clinical scenarios [^111Ji8Wk].

---

### Combined creatinine and cystatin C eGFR (eGFRcr-cys)

Combined creatinine and cystatin C eGFR (eGFRcr-cys) provides the **most accurate eGFR estimate** [^notfound], leveraging the complementary strengths of both markers. It is recommended when greater accuracy is needed or when creatinine-based estimates are suspected to be inaccurate [^114JiJo2].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize a **stepwise approach** to kidney function assessment:

- **Initial assessment**: Use serum creatinine with a validated eGFR equation (eGFRcr) [^1115RY7m].
- **Increased accuracy**: If eGFRcr is inaccurate or greater precision is needed, add cystatin C and calculate eGFRcr-cys [^114JiJo2].
- **Definitive assessment**: When precise GFR is critical (e.g. drug dosing, transplant evaluation), measure GFR using plasma or urinary clearance of an exogenous marker (mGFR) [^11179K6y].

---

## Summary of advantages and limitations

| **Measure** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| mGFR | - Reference standard <br/> - High accuracy <br/> - Less influenced by non-GFR determinants | - Resource-intensive <br/> - Limited availability <br/> - Invasive |
| eGFRcr | - Widely available <br/> - Inexpensive <br/> - Convenient | - Influenced by muscle mass, diet, assay interference <br/> - Less accurate at higher GFR |

### Defining acute kidney injury: what is the most appropriate metric? [^116vMrdK]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the most widely accepted measure of kidney function. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as a reduction in GFR. GFR is, however, rarely measured in clinical practice; instead, serum markers (primarily creatinine) are used to define AKI. Because serum creatinine level is not linearly related to GFR, the performance of this marker is associated with ascertainment bias and poor sensitivity. In this article we discuss the limitations and pitfalls of using serum markers to define AKI, and offer some suggestions for the future.

### Determining the glomerular filtration rate-an overview [^114UEkAB]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Correct determination of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as an indicator of kidney function bears great importance because clinical decision-making depends on it at many occasions. During the last years, a huge body of literature has been published on estimation and measurement of GFR. The increasing pace with which novel estimation formulae, current and newer biomarkers, assay standardization procedures as well as invasive measurement methods of GFR were published, has been overwhelming for many clinicians. This concise review summarizes central issues in determining kidney function by listing some of the most important publications. It explains fundamental principles in GFR estimation and measurement, the influence of clinical characteristics on endogenous biomarkers, and obstacles in biomarker assessment. Thus, it is thought to be a guide for clinicians through the confusing jungle of GFR determination.

### Measured and estimated glomerular filtration rate: current status and future directions [^117PWaEL]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

Evaluation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is central to the assessment of kidney function in medical practice, research and public health. Measured GFR (mGFR) remains the reference standard, but the past 20 years have seen major advances in estimated GFR (eGFR). Both eGFR and mGFR are associated with error compared with true GFR. eGFR is now recommended by clinical practice guidelines, regulatory agencies and public health agencies for the initial evaluation of GFR, with measured GFR (mGFR) typically considered an important confirmatory test, depending on how accurate the assessment of GFR needs to be for application to the clinical, research or public health setting. Our approach is to use initial and confirmatory tests as needed to develop a final assessment of true GFR. We suggest that GFR evaluation might be improved by more complete implementation of current recommendations and by further research to improve the accuracy of mGFR and eGFR.

### Measured GFR as a confirmatory test for estimated GFR [^113rqiZW]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical assessment of kidney function is central to the practice of medicine. GFR is widely accepted as the best index of kidney function in health and disease, and accurate values are required for optimal decision making. Estimated GFR based on serum creatinine is now widely reported by clinical laboratories, and in most circumstances, estimated GFR is sufficient for clinical decision making. GFR estimates may be inaccurate in the non-steady state and in people in whom non-GFR determinants differ greatly from those in whom the estimating equation was developed. If GFR estimates are likely inaccurate or if decisions based on inaccurate estimates may have adverse consequences, a measured GFR is an important confirmatory test. Endogenous creatinine clearance is the most common method used to measure GFR in clinical practice but may be difficult to obtain or fraught with error. We review methods for GFR measurement using urinary and plasma clearance of exogenous filtration markers and focus on urinary clearance of iothalamate and plasma clearance of iohexol compared with inulin clearance. We suggest plasma clearance of nonradioactive markers be more widely implemented in clinical settings. Further research is necessary on the impact of the use of measured GFR as a confirmatory test.

### Nomenclature for kidney function and disease-executive summary and glossary from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference [^111ejHjx]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The rationale for the 2019 KDIGO conference was that the worldwide burden of kidney disease is rising, but public awareness remains limited, underscoring the need for effective communication by all stakeholders in the kidney health community. Despite this need, the nomenclature for describing kidney function and disease lacks uniformity and clarity. Two decades ago, a survey of hundreds of published articles and meeting abstracts reported a broad array of overlapping, confusing terms for CKD and advocated adoption of unambiguous terminology. Nevertheless, terms flagged by that analysis as problematic, such as 'chronic renal failure' and 'pre-dialysis', still appear in current-day publications. A coherent, shared nomenclature could improve communication at all levels, including not only to better appreciate the burden of disease but also to aid understanding about how patients feel about their disease, allow more effective communication between kidney disease specialists and other clinicians, advance more straightforward comparison and integration of datasets, enable better recognition of gaps in knowledge for future research, and facilitate more comprehensive public health policies for acute and CKDs.

Developing consistent, patient-centred, and precise descriptions of kidney function and disease in the scientific literature is an important objective to align communication in clinical practice, research, and public health. While some terms have been in use for decades, the increased exchange of information among stakeholders makes it timely to revisit nomenclature to ensure consistency. The goal is to facilitate communication within and across disciplines and between practitioners and patients, with the ultimate hope of improving outcomes through consistency and precision.

Attendees at the conference included editors of many kidney subspecialty journals, kidney subspecialty editors at high-impact general medical journals and a few journals from other subspecialties, experienced authors of clinical kidney health research, and patients. Guiding principles of the conference were that the revised nomenclature should be patient-centred, precise, and consistent with nomenclature used in the KDIGO guidelines. The discussion focused on the general description of acute and CKD and kidney measures, rather than specific kidney diseases and particular measures of function and structure. Classifications of causes of kidney disease and procedures, performance measures, and outcomes metrics for dialysis and transplantation were considered beyond the scope of discussion.

### Estimating glomerular filtration rate: is it good enough? And is it time to move on? [^114tXwSF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to examine a dominant narrative in nephrology over the past decade: that measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the gold standard measure of kidney function; accurate assessment of GFR is critical and paramount; and further efforts to refine GFR estimation should continue.

Recent Findings

Studies that have simultaneously compared measured GFR and estimated GFR (using endogenous filtration markers such as creatinine, or newer ones such as cystatin C or β-trace protein) against some external metric of kidney function have failed to show that measured GFR is consistently superior, which is what one would expect if measured GFR were truly the 'gold standard'.
Summary

Compared with estimated GFR, measured GFR does not consistently predict renal-related outcomes better. Clinical decision-making almost never requires precise and accurate knowledge of a patient's static GFR value. Efforts at perfecting cross-sectional estimates of GFR may have reached a point of diminishing returns.

### Glomerular filtration rate: when to measure and in which patients? [^111KXMDL]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Of the glomerular, tubular and endocrine functions of the kidney, nephrologists have mostly focused their attention on the glomerular functions-albuminuria and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)-to grade the severity of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although both albuminuria and GFR are associated with renal and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the utility of measured GFR (mGFR) has been questioned. GFR when measured adequately is the most precise measure of glomerular function and can be useful to individualize therapy among patients with CKD. In situations where estimated GFR is known to provide imprecise estimates of glomerular function, for example, sarcopenia and advanced cirrhosis, the measurement of GFR may be especially important. We discuss several clinical situations where mGFR can potentially influence the quality of life or complications of therapy because of interventions based on imperfect knowledge of GFR. We reason that although large databases may not detect the benefits of mGFR at the population level, precision medicine requires that therapy be individualized based on the best estimate of GFR that can be obtained particularly when the risk of harm is increased. The recent standardization of mGFRs is a step in the right direction and may help in treating the individual patient with CKD with a lower risk of complications and a better quality of life. We call for research in these subgroups of patients where it is clinically felt that mGFR is useful for clinical decision-making.

### Refining GFR estimation: a quest for the unobservable truth? [^115D3Jas]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is central to evaluating kidney health, remains challenging. Measured GFR is not widely available and lacks standardization. Estimated GFR can be highly inaccurate for some patients and has limited applicability to many patient populations, such as those who are acutely ill. Recent metabolomic advances show promise for identifying new filtration markers that might enhance GFR estimation. Improving GFR assessment will require refinement in both GFR measurement and estimation methods.

### Youth with single kidneys-what is the evidence of risk? [^117SJKD5]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Children and youth with a congenital or acquired single functioning kidney are at risk for development of kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. How best to use surrogate measures associated with risk factors poses many problems. The risk of progressive kidney disease for those with a single functioning kidney varies, and how to assess it remains imperfect. Developing better measures to determine the risk of chronic kidney disease-renal functional reserve and imaging that includes nephron number-may be within reach and would likely positively affect the outcome.

### Heterogeneity in methods of estimating kidney function for cancer clinical trial eligibility [^111yQt5P]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Kidney function is frequently impaired in patients with cancer due to preexisting chronic kidney disease, cancer-associated factors, and prior anticancer treatments. Given these multifactorial insults, accurate assessment of kidney function is critical to determining patient eligibility for clinical trial enrollment. Measurement of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using clearance of exogenous markers provides the most accurate measure of kidney function but is not practical clinically. Although serum creatinine (sCr) level alone has been used to estimate kidney function, it can be influenced by non-GFR physiologic determinants, such as sarcopenia, and nephrology and oncology organization guidelines recommend against using sCr level alone. Several equations incorporating clinical and demographic variables have been developed to improve the estimation of kidney function. Recently, there have been calls for harmonization of most aspects of cancer clinical trial eligibility to foster feasibility, inclusivity, comparability, and generalizability. We sought to understand the landscape of approaches used to estimate kidney function for contemporary cancer clinical trial eligibility.

The discussion focused on general description of acute and CKD and kidney measures, rather than specific kidney diseases and particular measures of function and structure. Classifications of causes of kidney disease and procedures, performance measures and outcome metrics for dialysis and transplantation were considered beyond the scope of discussion.

As described in detail in the conference report, the meeting attendees reached general consensus on the following recommendations: (i) to use 'kidney' rather than 'renal' or 'nephro-' when referring to kidney disease and kidney function; (ii) to use 'kidney failure' with appropriate descriptions of presence or absence of symptoms, signs and treatment rather than 'end-stage kidney disease' (ESKD); (iii) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of acute kidney diseases and disorders and acute kidney injury (AKI) rather than alternative descriptions to define and classify the severity of these; (iv) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of CKD rather than alternative descriptions to define and classify it; and (v) to use specific kidney measures, such as albuminuria or decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), rather than 'abnormal' or 'reduced' kidney function to describe alterations in kidney structure and function (Table 1). Accordingly, the proposed glossary contains five corresponding sections, and comprises specific items for which there was general agreement among the conference participants (Table 2). For each section, the glossary includes preferred terms, abbreviations, descriptions and terms to avoid, with the acknowledgment that journals may choose which of the recommendations to implement, and that journal style will dictate when and how to abbreviate terms to be consistent with nomenclature for other diseases.

### A clinician's guide to monitoring kidney function in lithium-treated patients [^114zPDXe]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Bipolar disorder treatment guidelines recommend kidney-function monitoring at regular intervals for patients taking lithium, but they tend not to provide specifics with regard to what to measure and how to ensure that the results most accurately reflect true kidney function. This overview clarifies those practical aspects of monitoring that are often overlooked or misunderstood.

Data Sources

Utilized English language materials were obtained by PubMed searches (1970–2009), from the Lithium Information Center database, and from books. Search terms included lithium, kidney function, creatinine, creatinine clearance, GFR, GFR prediction equations, albuminuria, and urine concentration.

Data Synthesis

Urine osmolality most accurately reflects urine concentrating ability, although specific gravity is usually adequate for clinical purposes. Serum creatinine concentration can be influenced by extrarenal factors, but even when these are controlled, it remains a less than ideal measure of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Prediction equations are used commonly to estimate GFR and are an advance over serum creatinine alone, but even they are not as useful when GFR is only mildly impaired. Urine albumin measurement is important, but it requires greater standardization and sensitivity to maximize its potential.

Conclusions

The safe and effective use of lithium requires regular monitoring of kidney function. Doing so effectively requires knowledge of what to measure, how to ensure accurate results, and how to properly interpret them.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^116hYhHF]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Dose adjustments by level of GFR emphasizes considering kidney function for medication dosing and identifies when higher accuracy methods are needed. Specifically, "Practice Point 4.2.1: Consider GFR when dosing medications cleared by the kidneys". The text explains that "Many medications and/or their active metabolites are excreted by the kidneys" and that "Failure to properly account for the effect of GFR when designing appropriate drug-dosing regimens can predispose a person to treatment failure or adverse events". For situations requiring greater precision, "Practice Point 4.2.3: Where more accuracy is required for drug-related decision-making (e.g., dosing due to narrow therapeutic or toxic range), drug toxicity, or clinical situations where eGFR estimates may be unreliable, use equations that combine both creatinine and cystatin C, or measured GFR may be indicated". The guideline also notes regulatory recognition that "any contemporary, widely accepted, and clinically applicable estimating GFR equation is considered reasonable to assess GFR in pharmacokinetic studies".

### Estimating and measuring glomerular filtration rate: methods of measurement and markers for estimation [^1157BXf1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the best overall measure of kidney function. Reference GFR measurements (e.g. inulin clearance) are laborious. Estimation of GFR using equations based on endogenous filtration markers is simpler, cheaper and easy to apply in practice but suffers from limited accuracy and reproducibility. This review summarizes the recent studies comparing measured and estimated GFR in various populations and disease settings. We consider the utility of newer estimating equations based on standardized methodology, including those incorporating cystatin C.

Recent Findings

Equations proposed by the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Consortium slightly improve the accuracy of GFR estimation compared with those used formerly. The black ethnicity coefficient in the CKD-EPI equation may not be transferable across other black populations and the equations require further validation in other ethnic groups. All currently reported equations fall short of ideal. Incorporation of cystatin C into the CKD-EPI equation improves precision and offers hope of a GFR estimate that may not require ethnic adjustment.

Summary

The ideal biomarker and equation to estimate GFR would provide reproducible and accurate results across the entire range of GFRs, populations and diseases. Newer GFR markers and equations are required to fulfil this holy grail of research.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^112QNQKS]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Decision framework for measuring GFR states that decisions to measure GFR should be made by both nephrologists and other physicians, that physicians determine how accurate GFR needs to be for a given clinical decision, and that "If greater accuracy is needed than can be achieved using eGFR, mGFR is recommended", with greater accuracy potentially required due to non-GFR determinants affecting eGFR or due to the clinical setting.

### Estimated glomerular filtration rate: time for a performance review? [^114Xpk82]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Measurement of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is an essential element in assessing renal function. Formulaic estimations of GFR (eGFRs) are widely used but have many pitfalls. Application of eGFR without adjustment for the effects of aging and gender results in overdiagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). eGFR formulae also contain variables that independently influence the risk of CKD and cardiovascular disease. eGFR needs a performance review to foster its evolution as a clinically useful tool.

### Measurement and estimation of GFR for use in clinical practice: core curriculum 2021 [^111NHckj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is fundamental to clinical practice, public health, and research. The kidney has several critical functions; GFR is used as an overall assessment of these kidney functions. GFR is used to diagnose, stage, and manage chronic kidney disease (CKD); ascertain the prognosis for chronic kidney disease-related events and mortality; and determine drug dosages. GFR is the rate at which the glomerulus filters plasma to produce an ultrafiltrate and can be assessed from clearance or serum levels of filtration markers. Clearance measurements using exogenous filtration markers are difficult to perform in routine clinical practice, so GFR is more commonly estimated through equations based on serum concentrations of endogenous filtration markers, most commonly creatinine. These GFR estimates are reasonably accurate, but optimal care for patients may require a confirmatory test for a more accurate GFR assessment. Confirmatory tests currently available include cystatin C-based equations, urinary or plasma clearance of exogenous filtration markers, or urinary clearance of creatinine. Appreciation of the concept of GFR and methods for optimal assessment in routine practice or special circumstances, and their strengths and limitations, are critical in making judicious use of the available tools.

### The global burden of chronic kidney disease: estimates, variability and pitfalls [^113xZiQX]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2017). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is currently defined by abnormalities of kidney structure or function assessed using a matrix of variables - including glomerular filtration rate (GFR), thresholds of albuminuria and duration of injury - and is considered by many to be a common disorder globally. However, estimates of CKD prevalence vary widely, both within and between countries. The reasons for these variations are manifold, and include true regional differences in CKD prevalence, vagaries of using estimated GFR (eGFR) for identifying CKD, issues relating to the use of set GFR thresholds to define CKD in elderly populations, and concerns regarding the use of one-off testing for assessment of eGFR or albuminuria to define the prevalence of CKD in large-scale epidemiological studies. Although CKD is common, the suggestion that its prevalence is increasing in many countries might not be correct. Here, we discuss the possible origins of differences in estimates of CKD prevalence, and present possible solutions for tackling the factors responsible for the reported variations in GFR measurements. The strategies we discuss include approaches to improve testing methodologies for more accurate assessment of GFR, to improve awareness of factors that can alter GFR readouts, and to more accurately stage CKD in certain populations, including the elderly.

### Hemodialysis treatment time: as important as it seems? [^111o74iS]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Hemodialysis treatment time and Kt/V can both be considered to be primary measures of hemodialysis adequacy, because when either goes to zero, mortality is certain in patients without residual kidney function. Treatment time is important, but it needs to be adjusted based on surface-area-normalized Kt/V, residual kidney function, and expected ultrafiltration rate. Rescaling dose of dialysis measured as Kt/V to body surface area prevents ultrashort dialysis in small patients, women, and children with minimal residual kidney function. Most if not all of the observational studies of associations between outcome and dialysis session length are probably confounded by dose targeting bias. Once adequate Kt/V (taking into account body surface area) has been provided, adequate dialysis time probably is most relevant in terms of limiting the need for a high fluid removal rate. The latter may adversely impact survival by causing recurrent ischemia to cardiovascular and other tissues. There is little high-quality evidence at this time to support a minimum 4-hour treatment time for all patients, regardless of body size, solute removal, or residual kidney function. On the other hand, there is little evidence that prolonging weekly treatment time up to 24 hours per week is harmful. The final decision regarding treatment time is best individualized, based on patient acceptability and experience, residual kidney function, body surface-area-normalized Kt/V, and expected ultrafiltration rate.

### Kidney function estimating equations: where do we stand? [^115i4Q8p]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is central to the diagnosis, evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. This review summarizes recent data on the performance of equations using serum creatinine to estimate the GFR, particularly the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation.

Recent Findings

During 2005 GFR estimation has received substantial attention with a focus on comparing the MDRD Study equation with the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Several large studies (n > 500) have appeared. Most studies discuss creatinine calibration but few were able to standardize measurements. Studies that did calibrate the creatinine had improved performance. Overall, the MDRD Study equation performed well in populations with a low range of GFR and often outperformed the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Both equations have lower precision in high GFR populations, and the MDRD equation under-estimated the GFR in a number of studies. Efforts are underway to develop improved prediction equations by pooling data across many study populations.

Summary

Equations for estimating the GFR from serum creatinine are useful for systematic staging of chronic kidney disease. The MDRD Study equation and systematic creatinine assay calibration improve the level of precision and accuracy in many settings. GFR estimates are less useful in the normal range of GFR, however, and are sensitive to the population under study.

### How best to estimate glomerular filtration rate? Novel filtration markers and their application [^115ZeVaX]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic kidney disease is an increasing health burden. Estimating equations using serum concentrations of creatinine and cystatin C facilitate the assessment of kidney function as reflected in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Reduced eGFR is associated with increased risk for numerous adverse outcomes and is an important aspect in many clinical situations. However, current equations are suboptimal in some clinical settings. The review focuses on approaches to improve the estimation of GFR and aims to familiarize the reader with the underlying methodological hypotheses how new markers could contribute to improve the overall performance of estimating equations.

Recent Findings

Low molecular weight proteins such as β-trace-protein and β-2-microglobulin, as well as newly discovered metabolites, show promise as new filtration markers, as they might be beneficial in populations in which creatinine or cystatin C are inaccurate. We propose that the combination of multiple novel markers, alone or in combination with creatinine, cystatin C or demographics, can potentially improve GFR estimation. For special populations such as dialysis patients, separate equations have been developed to estimate residual kidney function.

Summary

Current GFR estimating equations are an essential part of routine clinical practice but have limitations. The use of multiple markers combined in a single equation appears to be the most promising approach. Future research is required to validate proposed equations in diverse populations.

### Serum cystatin C as a marker of glomerular filtration rate [^114VFrRf]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Glomerular filtration rate is widely accepted as the best overall measure of kidney function. Currently available methods to estimate glomerular filtration rate have strengths and limitations. Cystatin C is a novel endogenous filtration marker being considered as a potential replacement for serum creatinine. This review summarizes the currently available glomerular filtration rate estimating equations based on cystatin C and the literature comparing cystatin C and creatinine as filtration markers.

Recent Findings

In most cystatin C estimating equations, inclusion of age and sex did not substantially improve their performance. Equations yield different glomerular filtration rate estimates for the same level of cystatin C. Variation among equations may be due to differences among the assays or populations in the individual studies. Studies comparing cystatin C with creatinine or creatinine-based estimating equations show heterogeneous results, with some showing improved performance and others showing equivalent performance even in similar populations. These heterogeneous results may be due to inappropriate comparisons between equations developed in one population with those developed in another, or to the differences between assays or population characteristics.

Summary

Cystatin C shows promise as an alternative to serum creatinine but several important questions remain before it can be recommended for use in clinical practice.

### Measuring glomerular filtration rate in acute kidney injury: yes, but not yet [^113rsGX2]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury has become a major focus for nephrologists and critical care physicians. The development of structural biomarkers is proceeding, but the results to date have been disappointing. The use of a shortened creatinine clearance as a functional acute kidney injury biomarker is not new but has not been compared with that of other diagnostic approaches. A rapid, repeatable, and accurate measured glomerular filtration rate would be the gold standard for a functional biomarker and is not far off.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease in adults: part II. glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and other markers [^115uJsQ9]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation published clinical practice guidelines on chronic kidney disease in February 2002. Of the 15 guidelines, the first six are of greatest relevance to family physicians. Part II of this two-part review covers guidelines 4, 5, and 6. Glomerular filtration rate is the best overall indicator of kidney function. It is superior to the serum creatinine level, which varies with age, sex, and race and often does not reflect kidney function accurately. The glomerular filtration rate can be estimated using prediction equations that take into account the serum creatinine level and some or all of specific variables (age, sex, race, body size). In many patients, estimates of the glomerular filtration rate can replace 24-hour urine collections for creatinine clearance measurements. Urine dipsticks generally are acceptable for detecting proteinuria. To quantify proteinuria, the ratio of protein or albumin to creatinine in an untimed (spot) urine sample is an accurate alternative to measurement of protein excretion in a 24-hour urine collection. Patients with persistent proteinuria have chronic kidney disease. Other techniques for evaluating patients with chronic kidney disease include examination of urinary sediment, urine dipstick testing for red and white blood cells, and imaging studies of the kidneys (especially ultrasonography). These techniques also can help determine the underlying cause of chronic kidney disease. Family physicians should weigh the value of the National Kidney Foundation guidelines for their clinical practice based on the strength of evidence and perceived cost-effectiveness until additional evidence becomes available on the usefulness of the recommended quality indicators.

### Aligning kidney function assessment in patients with cancer to global practices in internal medicine [^112kCqyZ]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence quality/certainty: clinical consensus; strength of recommendation: strong.

1.1 The most accurate method of assessing kidney function in adult patients with cancer is by directly measured GFR.

1.2 eGFR CKD-EPI is a more accurate and precise estimation of directly measured GFR than other estimation methods of kidney function. eGFR CKD-EPI is reported automatically in pathology results, accounts for creatinine assay standardisation, and aligns with international nephrology recommendations.

1.3 eGFR CKD-EPI requires stable kidney function and should be performed as close as possible to the time of administering the anticancer drug(s) to ensure it is a reflective estimation of the patient's steady state kidney function. This is especially important if the anticancer drug(s) is guided by kidney function for dosing and/or demonstrates nephrotoxic potential, where eGFR CKD-EPI < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², where the patient is acutely unwell (or has recently recovered from an acute illness) or displays signs of unstable kidney function (including development of acute kidney injury).

1.4 eGFR CKD-EPI may be unreliable in certain clinical situations involving, but not limited to, extremes of body size or muscle mass (e.g. obesity, non-obese sarcopenia, high muscle mass), amputees, persons with paraplegia or conditions of skeletal muscle, individuals with exceptional dietary habits (e.g. creatine supplements), advanced liver disease, untreated hypothyroidism, drugs interfering with creatinine secretion or the creatinine assay, and ureteric obstruction.

1.5 eGFR CKD-EPI is unsuitable for assessing kidney function in kidney replacement therapy, pregnant women, and patients < 18 years of age.

### Screening for kidney diseases: older measures versus novel biomarkers [^112YaAVE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Biomarkers have been used to screen for kidney disease since creatinine was recognized to be correlated with renal function. The measurement of serum creatinine as a screening test for kidney disease falls short, however, because serum creatinine is not particularly sensitive for the diagnosis of kidney disease. Creatinine reflects renal filtering capacity, which has a lot of reserve and is therefore not sensitive to acute or chronic kidney injury unless the injury is substantial enough to compromise the filtering ability. The sensitivity of serum creatinine is further diminished in certain patient populations that are prone to kidney disease because of the physiology of creatinine. Therefore, researchers are seeking new biomarkers that can aid in the diagnosis of both acute and chronic kidney diseases. The limitations of creatinine in screening for kidney diseases in specific patient populations as well as new potential biomarkers that are actively being researched are discussed in this review.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD: summary of recommendation statements and clinical approach to the patient [^114qJiWz]. Kidney International (2014). Medium credibility.

GFR as an index of kidney function — evaluation in kidney donor candidates emphasizes expression, baseline values, and testing approach: The level of GFR is widely accepted as the best overall index of kidney function in health and disease, and normal levels of GFR are expressed per 1.73 m² because GFR is proportional to kidney size. Based on a large body of evidence, mean GFR in healthy young adult white individuals is approximately 125 mL/min per 1.73 m², with a wide range. It is not possible to directly measure GFR in humans; thus, the "true" GFR cannot be known with certainty. We recommend that the transplant program use the best available method to assess GFR in donor candidates, recognizing that at many centers, more than one method may be available, but the accuracy of various methods for measuring and estimating GFR is not known with sufficient certainty to set a specific threshold for each method. The guidelines recommend 2-stage testing (initial testing followed by confirmatory testing as necessary).

### Accuracy of a GFR estimating equation over time in people with a wide range of kidney function [^111N2RMq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is important for clinical decision making. GFR estimates from serum creatinine level provide an unbiased but imprecise estimate of GFR at single time points. However, the accuracy of estimated GFR over time is not well known.

Study Design

Longitudinal study of diagnostic test accuracy.

Settings & Participants

4 clinical trials with longitudinal measurements of GFR and serum creatinine on the same day, including individuals with and without kidney disease with a wide range of kidney function, diverse racial backgrounds, and varied clinical characteristics.

Index Test

GFR estimated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.

Reference Test

GFR measured using urinary clearance of (125)I-iothalamate.

Results

Data included 19,735 GFR measurements in 3,531 participants during a mean follow-up of 2.6 years. Mean values at baseline for measured and estimated GFR and error (measured GFR - estimated GFR) were 73.1 (95% CI, 71.6 to 74.5), 72.7 (95% CI, 71.5 to 74.0), and 0.14 (95% CI, -0.35 to 0.63) mL/min/1.73 m², respectively. Mean rates of change in measured and estimated GFR and error were -2.3 (95% CI, -2.4 to -2.1), -2.2 (95% CI, -2.4 to -2.1), and -0.09 (95% CI, -0.24 to 0.05) mL/min/1.73 m² per year (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.2, respectively). Variability (ie, standard deviation) among participants in rate of change in measured GFR, estimated GFR, and error was 4.3, 3.4, and 3.3 mL/min/1.73 m² per year, respectively. Only 15% of participants had a rate of change in error > 3 mL/min/1.73 m² per year, and only 2% had a rate of change in error > 5% per year.

Limitations

Participants' characteristics were not available over time.

Conclusion

The accuracy of GFR estimates did not change over time. Clinicians should interpret changes in estimated GFR over time as reflecting changes in measured GFR rather than changes in errors in the GFR estimates in most individuals.

### Potential utility of renal functional reserve testing in clinical nephrology [^111WFfQa]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The precise assessment of both renal baseline function and renal reserve function would elevate nephrology care on another level. RFR measurement would be useful to precisely diagnose impaired renal function, predict future disease course, differentiate between benign vs. pathologic hyperfiltration, analyze links to mitochondrial stress and inflammation, and to individualize therapies. More robust methodology is required to standardize GFR stimulation and GFR measurement, and more evidence is required to understand the true impact of RFR on kidney function and outcomes. We suggest therefore that what can be counted should be counted.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^111gU5LE]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) — assessment of kidney function emphasizes serum creatinine for acute changes, while measured GFR is most accurate but not recommended for routine practice, and alternative markers/formulas have limitations. Measurement of the serum creatinine concentration is described as a simple, inexpensive and widely available method for estimating GFR that is reliable for detecting acute changes; the level of serum creatinine at year 1 after transplantation is a risk factor for subsequent outcomes and may help guide care. Although measurement of GFR with inulin, iothalamate, iohexol or other suitable markers provides the most accurate measure of allograft function in KTRs, the Work Group did not recommend their use in routine clinical practice due to cost, low patient acceptance, and lack of availability outside of academic medical centers. Measurement of cystatin C has been used and is independent from body weight, but there is a paucity of validation studies for cystatin C estimates of GFR in KTRs. Formulas to estimate GFR have been tested in KTRs, but no formula has been consistently shown to be superior to any other formula.

### Time to rethink the current paradigm for assessing kidney function in drug development and beyond [^112gnCiP]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important health issue that affects ~ 9.1% of the world adult population. Serum creatinine is the most commonly used biomarker for assessing kidney function and is utilized in different equations for estimating creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The Cockcroft–Gault formula for adults and "original" Schwartz formula for children have been the most commonly used equations for estimating kidney function during the last 3–4 decades. Introduction of standardized serum creatinine bioanalytical methodology has reduced interlaboratory variability but is not intended to be used with Cockcroft–Gault or original Schwartz equations. More accurate equations (for instance, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD‐EPI) for adults and bedside Schwartz or Chronic Kidney Disease in Children Schwartz equation for children) based on standardized serum creatinine values (and another biomarker — cystatin C) have been introduced and validated in recent years. Recently, the CKD‐EPI equation refitted without a race variable was introduced. Clinical practice guidance in nephrology advocates a shift to these equations for managing health care of patients with CKD. The guidance also recommends use of albuminuria in addition to GFR for CKD diagnosis and management. Significant research with large data sets would be necessary to evaluate whether this paradigm would also be valuable in drug dose adjustments. This article attempts to highlight some important advancements in the field from a clinical pharmacology perspective and is a call to action to industry, regulators, and academia to rethink the current paradigm for assessing kidney function to enable dose recommendation in patients with CKD.

### Impact of the estimation equation for GFR on population-based prevalence estimates of kidney dysfunction [^113WKP55]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is defined by morphological and functional damage to the kidney. Clinical assessment of kidney function is central to the routine clinical practice and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the best overall index-indicator of excretory kidney function in health and disease. In the epidemiological setting, decreased kidney function may be defined by a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m². As directly measuring GFR is often cumbersome in routine clinical practice, researchers have developed and validated several GFR estimating equations that include demographic and clinical variables as surrogates for muscle mass and unmeasured factors that affect serum creatinine level, such as age, sex and race. Some of these equations are meanwhile recommended by clinical guidelines as the preferred method for assessment of GFR in the routine clinical care.

### Using multiple measures for quantitative trait association analyses: application to estimated glomerular filtration rate [^114AQ8eG]. Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Studies of multiple measures of a quantitative trait can have greater precision and thus statistical power compared with single-measure studies, but this has rarely been studied in the relation to quantitative trait measurement error models in genetic association studies. Using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a quantitative measure of kidney function, as an example we constructed measurement error models of a quantitative trait with systematic and random error components. We then examined the effects on precision of the parameter estimate between genetic loci and eGFR, resulting from varying the correlation and contribution of the error components. We also compared the empirical results from three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of kidney function in 9049 European Americans: a single measure model, a three-measure model of the same biomarker of kidney function and a six-measure model of different biomarkers of kidney function. Simulations showed that given the same amount of overall errors, inclusion of measures with less correlated systematic errors led to greater gain in precision. The empirical GWAS results confirmed that both the three- and six-measure models detected more eGFR-associated genomic loci with stronger statistical association than the single-measure model despite some heterogeneity among the measures. Multiple measures of a quantitative trait can increase the statistical power of a study without additional participant recruitment. However, careful attention must be paid to the correlation of systematic errors and inconsistent associations when different biomarkers or methods are used to measure the quantitative trait.

### Recommendations for clinical trial design in acute kidney injury from the 31st Acute Disease Quality Initiative consensus conference. A consensus statement [^111DxHWX]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Baseline kidney health may be assessed in a variety of ways ranging from clinical history to detailed evaluation of numerous measures of kidney functional capacity and cellular/tissue pathology (Fig. 2). These methods vary in availability, cost, practicality, and accuracy, representing distinct aspects of kidney health (function vs. extent of underlying renal parenchymal disease). A basic assumption in AKI studies is that individuals recruited for trials have quantified, stable kidney health before the insult occurred even though measures of premorbid kidney function may be unavailable. In these cases, it may be reasonable to impute baseline kidney function based on clinical background as recommended in the KDIGO guideline.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^111gSNZi]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — eGFR uncertainty and laboratory measurement quality — eGFR is an imperfect estimate of measured GFR (mGFR), with the report stating, "At best, 90% of eGFR will fall within 30% of mGFR". Uncertainty can be mitigated because "Optimization of laboratory measurements of creatinine and cystatin C can help to reduce the uncertainty inherent in GFR estimation", and laboratories must address "accuracy… imprecision… and specificity". Performance targets align to biologic variation since "Analytical variability that is less than half the within-person biological variability is generally considered desirable", and use of international reference standards for creatinine and cystatin C "help to ensure the accuracy of results".

### Screening, identifying, and treating chronic kidney disease: why, who, when, how, and what? [^112nFe9N]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

How?

CKD is defined by either a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m² and/or evidence of kidney damage, usually defined by the presence of albuminuria, for 3 or more months. Other markers of kidney damage include urine sediment abnormalities, structural abnormalities on imaging, and kidney biopsy morphologic findings. Once identified, CKD is risk-stratified by cause-GFR category-albuminuria category (C-G-A classification), see the heat map Fig. 1.

GFR

GFR is considered the standard assessment of kidney function and has been assessed in routine clinical practice with eGFR using the endogenous filtration marker serum creatinine. For screening purposes, we recommend testing serum creatinine which is included on the basic and comprehensive metabolic panels (BMP and CMP, respectively). Equations for estimating GFR using creatinine have undergone multiple iterations for improvement in precision and reduction in bias. The eGFR should be calculated utilizing the most recent 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine equation that was refit without race as a coefficient in the U.S. Clinicians may utilize the NKF website for the eGFR calculator.

Creatinine, while the current clinical standard endogenous biomarker for estimating GFR, has numerous non-GFR determinants that may over- and under-estimate GFR, see Table 2; Fig. 2. Cystatin-C has been under investigation as an endogenous biomarker for estimating GFR that does not share the same limitations of creatinine, and when combined with creatinine results in a more accurate estimation. At this time, given limited clinical availability of cystatin-C, we recommend addition of cystatin-C by utilizing the 2021 CKD-EPI combined creatinine and cystatin-C equation when more precision is required in the absence of non-GFR determinants for either biomarker.

### Evaluation and enhancement of standard equations for renal function estimation in individuals with components of metabolic disease [^1118cCxj]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Given that half of all medications or their metabolites are cleared by the kidney and roughly 3 billion prescriptions for medications are written annually many individuals may be at risk for underdosing (or overdosing) if renal function isn't appropriately assessed. While renal dysfunction places patients at risk for adverse events when dosing is not appropriately adjusted, dosage reductions when not necessary may increase risk of treatment failure which is especially concerning with antibiotics or chemotherapeutic agents. Moreover, inaccurate assessment of renal function may influence patient selection in clinical trials. Underestimation of CrCl may therefore exclude potential clinical trial candidates. Currently, FDA draft guidance for assessment of renal function in pharmacokinetic studies does not indicate a preference as to which formula is used to estimate kidney function. Overall, clinicians should consider the patient population to determine the best strategy to assess renal function. In the clinical setting, determination of renal function to select a drug or drug dosing should not be done with the renal function estimate alone (i.e. Cockcroft-Gault), but rather an assessment of the clinical situation and repercussions for under or over dosing of the medication.

Further research is warranted to identify novel biomarkers to accurately estimate CrCl. Despite improvement of estimation using a modification of the Cockcroft-Gault or development of new equations using nonlinear regression to estimate CrCl, there remains residual error that cannot be explained. This error may be related to inherent limitations of using serum creatinine in the equations (extrarenal degradation and tubular secretion). Future studies should aim at identification of biomarkers that can accurately estimate renal function.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to drug dose adjustments, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider using equations combining both creatinine and cystatin C, or measured GFR where more accuracy is required for drug-related decision-making (such as dosing due to narrow therapeutic or toxic range), drug toxicity, or clinical situations where eGFR by creatinine estimates may be unreliable.

Table 2
Summary of recommendations for GFR assessment during drug development

Overall, given all the advancements and knowledge build‐up described in this manuscript, there is a need to unify the approach toward characterizing kidney function and dosing recommendations in subjects with kidney impairment. One approach can be through recommending equations appropriate to the method of serum creatinine measurement to characterize kidney function in regulatory guidance and update all currently available labeling to indicate which equation should be used by the healthcare provider to inform dosing recommendation in patients with impairment of the kidneys. KDIGO guidelines propose chronic kidney disease prognosis utilizing GFR as well as albuminuria. We propose to test whether utilizing GFR along with albuminuria could help reduce the variability in the relationship between drug pharmacokinetics and kidney function in comparison with the current paradigm of utilizing GFR alone for kidney function categorization. Note that KDIGO‐based categorization was designed to predict CKD classification and prognosis which overlaps with but is distinct from kidney function assessment and its impact on drug pharmacokinetics to aid dose recommendations. Therefore, significant research with large data sets is required to evaluate whether the paradigm recommended by KDIGO for predicting CKD prognosis can also be applied toward creating a better prediction of drug pharmacokinetics than the current GFR‐based approach. If successful, this can help minimize mis‐categorization of patients with impairment of the kidneys and thus provide a better risk–benefit profile for this underserved special population.

Towards an improved AKI diagnosis?

Although the kidney has many functions, AKI is mostly defined as a decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The KDIGO workgroup proposed a consensus definition and staging system for clinical practice (the KDIGO definition) that relies on the increase of serum creatinine (Scr) within 7 days and/or the presence of oliguria (Fig. 1), both surrogate markers of GFR. This definition has enabled to streamline research in the field. However, both Scr and urine output may also be influenced by non-renal and non-GFR-related factors and are, therefore, imperfect markers of reduced GFR. Consequently, the diagnosis of AKI by KDIGO criteria should be interpreted in the clinical context. Controversy on how to determine baseline kidney function is another drawback of the consensus definition. Despite the concerns about oliguria as a marker of kidney function, there is evidence that oliguria identifies patients with worse outcomes. In addition, because of the long half-life of creatinine and the presence of renal functional reserve (renal reserve capacity that can be recruited before basal GFR starts to decline), Scr requires time to accurately reflect GFR resulting in delayed recognition of kidney dysfunction. Potential solutions for a more timely detection of a reduced GFR could be measurement of creatinine clearance over 2 or 4 h, kinetic eGFR calculated from two serial creatinine measurements, or utilizing the plasma disappearance of an injected compound like iohexol that is dependent on renal clearance. These methods have not been extensively investigated or used in the ICU setting. Bedside real-time GFR measurements using injection of a dye and fluorescent probes and enabling earlier diagnosis of kidney dysfunction are under investigation, but do not yet have regulatory approval. Cystatin-C, another marker of glomerular filtration, might be useful in settings of muscle wasting, but is also affected by comorbidity.

### Time to rethink the current paradigm for assessing kidney function in drug development and beyond [^115PF1g2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

KDIGO guidelines recommend that nephrologists approach kidney disease classification as well as prognosis with a composite of cause, GFR categories (index of kidney function in health and disease), and albuminuria categories (marker of kidney damage). Independent of eGFR, albuminuria has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular and kidney events as well as cognitive decline in addition to overall mortality. In line with the eGFR‐based estimates, KDIGO guidelines agree that eGFR values < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² correspond with severe kidney impairment irrespective of the degree of albuminuria. However, they deviate from eGFR‐based categorization for eGFR values ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² as demonstrated in Table 1.

Table 1
CKD classification

This eGFR and albuminuria‐based categorization was developed by KDIGO based on correlation of these parameters with diagnosis and progression of CKD in subjects with various forms of kidney diseases and has been applied successfully by nephrologists for almost a decade. It is worthwhile testing whether this algorithm may serve as a better predictor of drug pharmacokinetics as well and thus provide a more nuanced and accurate framework for dose modifications of drugs whose exposure is impacted by kidney impairment.

Selection of GFR estimating equations — use of validated eGFR: We recommend using a validated GFR estimating equation to derive GFR from serum filtration markers (eGFR) rather than relying on the serum filtration markers alone (1D). Practice Point 1.2.4.1 advises to use the same equation within geographical regions (as defined locally [e.g., continent, country, and region] and as large as possible), noting that within such regions, equations may differ for adults and children. The recommendation places a high value on using an estimating equation validated in the population of interest, and the key points are to use an equation validated and most suited to the population of interest; there is potential for harm if people get different eGFR values when receiving care in different settings, and there is benefit to clinical care, research, and public health with the use of validated equations such that decisions, research findings, and public policy are informed by accurate estimates of CKD.

### What should European nephrology do with the new CKD-EPI equation? [^116Hz5Rd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Knowledge about a patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is central to the practice of medicine. It is needed to diagnose and classify chronic kidney disease (CKD), and helpful to establish prognosis. In addition, it is used to decide when to start specific medication, how to dose medication and when to refer patients for specialist nephrology care or when to start kidney function replacement treatment. GFR can best be measured (mGFR) by injection of exogenous tracers, such as iothalamate and iohexol, and serial blood sampling. This is a relatively cumbersome and expensive technique, and is therefore only used in specific cases. In clinical practice, equations are used to estimate GFR (Fig. 1 and Table 1). These equations use readily available information about patient characteristics, such as age and sex, and about creatinine as an endogenous filtration marker. The oldest equation is the one developed by Cockcroft and Gault in 1976. It should be noted that their equation does not estimate GFR, but creatinine clearance. Creatinine clearance is determined not only by glomerular filtration of creatinine, but also by tubular secretion of creatinine. Tubular creatinine clearance can amount to up to 50% of total creatinine clearance, especially in subjects with impaired kidney function and obesity. Consequently, the Cockcroft–Gault equation should not be used to estimate kidney function because it can overestimate GFR considerably. In that respect it is surprising that the summary of product characteristics for many drugs evaluated by regulatory agencies, even novel drugs, still refer to the Cockcroft–Gault creatinine clearance for dose adjustment. The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was developed in 1999 to improve prediction of GFR, which was a major step forward also because it was widely accepted. In 2009 it was replaced by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, which was more accurate at higher GFR. This latter equation has become the standard method for estimating GFR across the world.

### Potential utility of renal functional reserve testing in clinical nephrology [^116pv4Bk]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review is to discuss the concept of renal functional reserve (RFR) and its potential relevance in clinical practice.

Recent Findings

The RFR is a measure of the change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from baseline to a peak value when the kidney is stimulated to increase its function. This concept has a strong physiologic basis in nephrology and the presence, magnitude or absence of RFR capacity may have prognostic significance in many clinical scenarios where individuals are at risk of hyperfiltration or kidney dysfunction. Unlike in other medical specialties, where organ reserve function is reliably measurable and used routinely, measurement of RFR in nephrology has not been integrated into clinical care. Methodologic challenges including standardization of methods to stimulate GFR and the ability of measures of GFR to discriminate acute dynamic changes in GFR upon kidney stimulation have hampered the robustness and use of RFR measurements in research and clinical care.

Summary

Given the emergence of many new disease-modifying therapies in nephrology, it is imperative that we move forward and develop more robust tools to further our understanding of kidney physiology and pathophysiology, such as the RFR, which should be integrated into research and clinical care to support optimal personalization of therapeutic kidney care strategies.

### A comparison of estimates of glomerular filtration in critically ill patients with augmented renal clearance [^1178HugL]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Accurate assessment of renal function in the critically ill is essential, not only to detect acute kidney injury, but also for the appropriate prescription of pharmaceuticals and timely application of therapeutic strategies. Although the kidneys have a range of functions in normal homeostasis, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) remains the most widely accepted index of renal function in both health and disease. Largely, any assessment of GFR in clinical practice focuses on identifying renal impairment, where serum creatinine concentrations are typically employed as a key biomarker for this purpose. In respect to drug prescription, elevated serum creatinine concentrations regularly trigger dose reduction for renally excreted drugs, although the converse-increasing drug dosing in response to low serum values-is infrequently considered in clinical practice.

To further improve the sensitivity of such measures to screen for and monitor chronic kidney disease (CKD), Levey and colleagues have developed a formula to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from serum creatinine concentrations and readily available demographic variables. Although initially developed in a cohort of ambulatory out-patients with CKD, the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation has been widely adopted in clinical practice, and is now routinely reported by laboratories worldwide. In particular, there has been an increasing trend to use such measures to modify drug dosing, although concerns have been raised about such practice. Perhaps a more familiar estimate of renal function in optimising drug dosing is that defined by the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Initially described in 1976 in a small cohort of male patients, this equation has been widely employed as a surrogate of GFR in both clinical and research practice, although its role in the critically ill remains uncertain.

### Renal function assessment in the era of chronic kidney disease: renewed emphasis on renal function centered patient care [^111JpJgP]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chronic kidney disease is more common than previously appreciated and it is now established as a major independent contributor to mortality. Serum creatinine is known to be an inaccurate reflection of the presence or development of chronic kidney disease. Since urologists frequently treat patients with coexistent chronic kidney disease, we reviewed the merits and limitations of the current methods to estimate renal function, and recent data indicating the importance of optimizing renal function during treatment.

Materials and Methods

A comprehensive literature review was performed to evaluate the laboratory, computational and imaging techniques for renal function estimation.

Results

Approximately 30% of elderly patients with normal serum creatinine (1.4 mg/dl or less) have chronic kidney disease based on an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m². The National Kidney Foundation currently recommends using a creatinine based estimate of glomerular filtration rate (eg Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) and has advocated a standardized classification for chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease has been independently related to morbid cardiac events and all cause mortality in a dose dependent fashion, even after controlling for a variety of potentially confounding factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Many urological interventions can precipitate or exacerbate chronic kidney disease, most notably radical nephrectomy which is greatly overused.

Conclusions

Practicing urologists should be cognizant of current methodologies to diagnose chronic kidney disease and its profound implications. Estimation of renal function is better using a serum creatinine based formula than individual serum creatinine values. Treatment goals should not be limited to avoidance of dialysis, but should also include greater efforts to optimize renal function in all patients and early referral for nephrological consultation.

All methods used to measure and estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are associated with systematic or random error, which leads to differences in measured GFR (mGFR) and estimated GFR (eGFR) from "true GFR".

### Time to rethink the current paradigm for assessing kidney function in drug development and beyond [^112szhmr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health problem that is defined by the presence of abnormalities in kidney structure or function for at least 3 months, irrespective of the cause. Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) guidelines recommend classifying CKD as well as its prognosis based on cause, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and albuminuria. It is estimated that 15% (~ 37 million) of the US adult population has CKD. In 2017, it was estimated that ~ 9.1% of the global adult population has CKD.

GFR is widely accepted as the best surrogate for kidney function. The measurement of GFR involves assessing the urinary or plasma clearance of the exogenous filtration marker inulin, which is a gold standardOther exogenous markers such as iothalamate, iohexol, and chromium‐51‐ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (51 Cr EDTA) are also utilized. However, this process is complex and cumbersome and generally not routinely performed in drug development or clinical practice. Therefore, GFR is estimated using mathematical models that rely on measurement of endogenous markers such as creatinine and cystatin C in serum. Over the years, multiple equations for GFR estimation have been proposed in the literature. There also exists a great degree of variability in the assays utilized for measurement of endogenous serum biomarkers and how they are applied for estimation of GFR. Errors in biomarker measurement or inappropriate choice of equation can lead to inaccurate GFR estimation and consequently to misclassification of the level of kidney impairment which may be deleterious to patients in terms of dose adjustments and potentially health outcomes.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Approach to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) evaluation uses an initial creatinine-based estimate with supportive testing when greater accuracy is needed. The initial test for the evaluation of GFR is creatinine-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr). If eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate, or a more accurate assessment of GFR is needed for clinical decision-making, then, if available, cystatin C should be measured, and creatinine and cystatin C–based estimated GFR (eGFRcr-cys) should be estimated; if eGFRcr-cys is expected to be inaccurate, or if an even more accurate assessment is needed, then, if available, GFR should be measured using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous filtration markers. Initial test may be estimated GFR by cystatin C (eGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys) in otherwise healthy populations with changes in creatinine generation due to non-GFR determinants, and sources of error in eGFRcr-cys include very low muscle mass, very high levels of inflammation, high catabolic states, or exogenous steroid use.

### Chronic kidney disease [^1169kRae]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a general term for heterogeneous disorders affecting kidney structure and function. The 2002 guidelines for definition and classification of this disease represented an important shift towards its recognition as a worldwide public health problem that should be managed in its early stages by general internists. Disease and management are classified according to stages of disease severity, which are assessed from glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, and clinical diagnosis (cause and pathology). Chronic kidney disease can be detected with routine laboratory tests, and some treatments can prevent development and slow disease progression, reduce complications of decreased GFR and risk of cardiovascular disease, and improve survival and quality of life. In this Seminar we discuss disease burden, recommendations for assessment and management, and future challenges. We emphasise clinical practice guidelines, clinical trials, and areas of uncertainty.

Appendix J. Approaches for eGFR calculation — glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is described as the best overall index of kidney function and a measure of how quickly plasma is filtered each minute by the nephron; in young adults normal GFR is approximately 90–130 mL/min and it declines on average 0.8–1.0 mL/min/year after age 30. In clinical practice, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is obtained from validated equations using creatinine, cystatin C, or both, and any estimate assumes steady-state kidney function; if kidney function is changing (e.g. AKI), the creatinine or cystatin C value is unstable and the estimating formulas should not be used, with rising levels in a non-steady state leading formulas to overestimate GFR and falling levels leading formulas to underestimate GFR. eGFR is used for screening for chronic kidney disease (CKD) with urine albumin/creatinine assessment, determining CKD severity, and monitoring progression of kidney disease, and knowing the level of GFR is important for medication prescribing.

### Harmonizing acute and chronic kidney disease definition and classification: report of a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference [^111proz3]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Kidney disease is an important public health problem. Both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease have been well defined and classified, leading to improved research efforts and subsequent management strategies and recommendations. For those patients with abnormalities in kidney function and/or structure who meet neither the definition of AKI nor chronic kidney disease, there remains a gap in research, care, and guidance. The term acute kidney diseases and disorders, abbreviated to acute kidney disease (AKD), has been introduced as an important construct to address this. To expand and harmonize existing definitions and to ultimately better inform research and clinical care, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organized a consensus workshop. Multiple invitees from around the globe, representing both acute and chronic kidney disease researchers and experts, met virtually to examine existing data, and discuss key concepts related to AKD. Despite some remaining unresolved questions, conference attendees reached general consensus on the definition and classification of AKD, management strategies, and research priorities. AKD is defined by abnormalities of kidney function and/or structure with implications for health and with a duration of ≤ 3 months. AKD may include AKI, but, more importantly, also includes abnormalities in kidney function that are not as severe as AKI or that develop over a period of > 7 days. The cause(s) of AKD should be sought, and classification includes functional and structural parameters. Management of AKD is currently based on empirical considerations. A robust research agenda to enable refinement and validation of definitions and classification systems, and thus testing of interventions and strategies, is proposed.

### Nomenclature for kidney function and disease-executive summary and glossary from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference [^113J7JTd]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

As described in detail in the conference report, the meeting attendees reached general consensus on the following recommendations for English language medical journals: (i) to use 'kidney' rather than 'renal' or 'nephro' when referring to kidney disease and kidney function; (ii) to use 'kidney failure' with appropriate descriptions of presence or absence of symptoms, signs, and treatment rather than 'end-stage kidney disease'; (iii) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) rather than alternative descriptions to define and classify the severity of AKD and AKI; (iv) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of CKD rather than alternative descriptions to define and classify CKD (Figure 1, Take home figure); and (v) to use specific kidney measures, such as albuminuria or decreased GFR, rather than 'abnormal' or 'reduced' kidney function to describe alterations in kidney structure and function (Table 1). Accordingly, the proposed glossary contains five corresponding sections and comprises specific items for which there was general agreement among the conference participants (, Supplementary material online, Table S1). For each section, the glossary includes preferred terms, abbreviations, descriptions, and terms to avoid, with the acknowledgment that journals may choose which of the recommendations to implement, and that journal style will dictate when and how to abbreviate terms to be consistent with nomenclature for other diseases.

Figure 1
Chronic kidney disease nomenclature used by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes. Chronic kidney disease is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for > 3 months, with implications for health. Chronic kidney disease is classified based on cause, glomerular filtration rate category (G1–G5), and albuminuria category (A1–A3), abbreviated as CGA. Prognosis of chronic kidney disease by glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria category is colour-coded as follows: green, low risk (if no other markers of kidney disease, no chronic kidney disease); yellow, moderately increased risk; orange, high risk; red, very high risk. CKD, chronic kidney disease; GFR, glomerular filtration rate; KDIGO, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^117AShmo]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Initial assessment with serum creatinine (SCr) — the guideline practice point states: "Use serum creatinine (SCr) and an estimating equation for the initial assessment of GFR". Evidence context notes that "There are no RCTs to quantify the impact for the use of less accurate methods versus more accurate methods of assessment of GFR", yet "For most clinical circumstances, estimating GFR from SCr is appropriate for diagnosis, staging and monitoring the progression of CKD", and that "professional societies throughout the world have recommended that GFR estimates should be used in association with SCr reporting". The page cautions that "Sources of error in GFR estimation from SCr concentration include non–steady-state conditions, non-GFR determinants of SCr, measurement error at higher GFR, and interferences with the creatinine assays", and that "GFR estimates are less precise at higher GFR levels than at lower levels".

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^111wmBGB]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Approach to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) evaluation using initial and supportive tests outlines a stepwise algorithm: the initial test for the evaluation of GFR is creatinine-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr); if eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate or a more accurate assessment is needed for clinical decision-making, cystatin C should be measured and creatinine and cystatin C-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr-cys) should be estimated; if eGFRcr-cys is expected to be inaccurate or an even more accurate assessment is needed, measured GFR should be measured using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous filtration markers. The flowchart directs users to consider sources of error and need for more accurate assessment and, based on the answer, to use eGFRcr or measure cystatin C, then to consider potential sources of error in eGFRcr-cys and decide whether to proceed with eGFRcr-cys or measure GFR. Additional notes specify that the initial test may be estimated GFR by cystatin C (eGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys) in otherwise healthy populations with non-GFR determinants affecting creatinine, list sources of error in eGFRcr-cys such as very low muscle mass, very high levels of inflammation, high catabolic states, or exogenous steroid use, and advise considering eGFRcys rather than eGFRcr-cys in otherwise healthy populations with decreased creatinine generation. The figure includes an Evaluation of GFR for clinical application scale with 15 30 45 60 90 120.

### Predictive performance of renal function equations for patients with chronic kidney disease and normal serum creatinine levels [^112eLXtB]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Accurate renal function measurements are important for the diagnosis and treatment of kidney disease, proper medication dosing, interpretation of possible uremic symptoms, and decision-making regarding when to initiate renal replacement therapy. Because the use of highly accurate filtration markers to measure renal function has traditionally been limited by cumbersome and costly techniques and the involvement of radioactivity (among other factors), renal function is typically estimated by using specially derived prediction equations. These formulae usually use serum creatinine levels, i.e., a marker of filtration that is insensitive to mild/moderate decreases in GFR. Although attempts have been made to validate certain renal function prediction equations among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with abnormal serum creatinine levels, this is the first study to specifically evaluate the predictive performance of these equations for patients with CKD and serum creatinine levels in the normal range. The results of eight prediction equations for 109 patients with CKD and serum creatinine levels of ≤ 1.5 mg/dl were compared with standard iohexol GFR values. The most accurate results were obtained with the Cockroft-Gault and Bjornsson equations. The most precise formulae were the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equations, although they were highly biased. Even the most accurate results exhibited levels of error that made them suboptimal for clinical treatment of these patients. These results suggest that measurement of GFR with endogenous or exogenous filtration markers might be the most prudent strategy for the assessment of renal function in the CKD population with normal serum creatinine levels. Further studies are needed to confirm the generalizability of these findings for this patient subgroup.

### Measuring quality in kidney care: an evaluation of existing quality metrics and approach to facilitating improvements in care delivery [^112JqGR8]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Leveraging quality metrics can be a powerful approach to identify substantial performance gaps in kidney disease care that affect patient outcomes. However, metrics must be meaningful, evidence-based, attributable, and feasible to improve care delivery. As members of the American Society of Nephrology Quality Committee, we evaluated existing kidney quality metrics and provide a framework for quality measurement to guide clinicians and policy makers.

Methods

We compiled a comprehensive list of national kidney quality metrics from multiple established kidney and quality organizations. To assess the measures' validity, we conducted two rounds of structured metric evaluation, on the basis of the American College of Physicians criteria: importance, appropriate care, clinical evidence base, clarity of measure specifications, and feasibility and applicability.

Results

We included 60 quality metrics, including seven for CKD prevention, two for slowing CKD progression, two for CKD management, one for advanced CKD and kidney replacement planning, 28 for dialysis management, 18 for broad measures, and two patient-reported outcome measures. We determined that on the basis of defined criteria, 29 (49%) of the metrics have high validity, 23 (38%) have medium validity, and eight (13%) have low validity.

Conclusions

We rated less than half of kidney disease quality metrics as highly valid; the others fell short because of unclear attribution, inadequate definitions and risk adjustment, or discordance with recent evidence. Nearly half of the metrics were related to dialysis management, compared with only one metric related to kidney replacement planning and two related to patient-reported outcomes. We advocate refining existing measures and developing new metrics that better reflect the spectrum of kidney care delivery.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^113Pg5LU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Preferred metric for residual kidney function in dialysis — measurement guidance notes that for both PD and HD, the preferred measure of RKF is urea clearance, with reasons including that unlike creatinine clearances, measurements of urea clearance are not confounded by renal tubular secretion. Native kidney urea clearances are lower than the kidney's GFR, so the patient is protected, whereas creatinine clearances are always higher than GFR. MDRD estimates of GFR based on serum creatinine level are not valid in patients managed with dialysis, and inclusion of native kidney urea clearances in kinetic modeling programs allows accurate calculation of G and nPCR as an aid to diet assessment.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^114phwkj]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Operational and quality considerations for measured GFR: "All nephrologists ideally should therefore have access to at least 1 method to measure GFR using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous markers". To ensure accuracy, "these clearance methods should be performed using standard operating procedures. External quality assessment (EQA) should be used for assays of the exogenous markers". Harmonization efforts are ongoing: the "European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) together with the European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine is currently harmonizing mGFR protocols for iohexol plasma clearance to deliver standardized operating procedures for GFR measurements in the near future".

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^11179K6y]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — measured GFR indications and exogenous marker selection — Practice Point 1.2.2.2 states that "Where more accurate ascertainment of GFR will impact treatment decisions, measure GFR using plasma or urinary clearance of an exogenous filtration marker (Table 9)". For people with concerns about creatinine-based estimation, "eGFRcr-cys provides the most accurate estimate and is recommended as the primary supportive test for people in whom there are concerns about eGFRcr accuracy", yet "there remain residual errors with some groups of people having a very high level of errors", and "In such people, we advocate using mGFR". Measured GFR uses clearance of exogenous markers since "GFR is measured using exogenous filtration markers and urinary or plasma clearance determination"; a systematic review "recommended the use of iothalamate, iohexol, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA) as exogenous markers of choice", whereas "A subsequent study recommended against plasma 99mTc-DTPA, especially when clearances are performed over 2–4 hours". Measurement technique affects accuracy because "the method by which the clearance of exogenous markers is measured may impact accuracy" and "for people with lower GFRs, delayed blood sampling is most accurate".

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^112JEF3r]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Oliguria as a measure of kidney function — Oliguria generally reflects a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and when GFR is normal (approximately 125 ml/min; approximately 107 ml/kg/h for a 70-kg adult), a urine volume < 0.5 ml/kg/h implies reabsorption of more than 99.5% of glomerular filtrate; oliguria is unusual with a normal GFR, and if GFR and serum creatinine (SCr) are normal and stable over 24 hours, measuring urine flow is generally not necessary to assess kidney function.

### Misapplications of commonly used kidney equations: renal physiology in practice [^114MYTaj]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Equations for estimating GFR, quantifying urinary protein excretion, and assessing renal sodium handling are widely used in routine nephrology and general medical and surgical practice. If these equations are applied in circumstances inconsistent with the clinical situations for or extrapolated beyond the limits in which they were validated, clinicians can come to erroneous conclusions, which could be detrimental for patient care. This review uses clinical vignettes to demonstrate some of the common pitfalls that clinicians may encounter in the use of these equations and considers the physiologic principles underlying their use. Equations for assessing aspects of renal function should only be used in specific clinical situations, if the underlying assumptions regarding their calculations and values are satisfied.

### Measurement of kidney function in Malawi, south Africa, and Uganda: a multicentre cohort study [^1151sBiw]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

The burden of kidney disease in many African countries is unknown. Equations used to estimate kidney function from serum creatinine have limited regional validation. We sought to determine the most accurate way to measure kidney function and thus estimate the prevalence of impaired kidney function in African populations.

Methods

We measured serum creatinine, cystatin C, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the slope-intercept method for iohexol plasma clearance (mGFR) in population cohorts from Malawi, Uganda, and South Africa. We compared performance of creatinine and cystatin C-based estimating equations to mGFR, modelled and validated a new creatinine-based equation, and developed a multiple imputation model trained on the mGFR sample using age, sex, and creatinine as the variables to predict the population prevalence of impaired kidney function in west, east, and southern Africa.

Findings

Of 3025 people who underwent measured GFR testing (Malawi n = 1020, South Africa n = 986, and Uganda n = 1019), we analysed data for 2578 participants who had complete data and adequate quality measurements. Among 2578 included participants, creatinine-based equations overestimated kidney function compared with mGFR, worsened by use of ethnicity coefficients. The greatest bias occurred at low kidney function, such that the proportion with GFR of less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m² either directly measured or estimated by cystatin C was more than double that estimated from creatinine. A new creatinine-based equation did not outperform existing equations, and no equation, including the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) 2021 race-neutral equation, estimated GFR within plus or minus 30% of mGFR for 75% or more of the participants. Using a model to impute kidney function based on mGFR, the estimated prevalence of impaired kidney function was more than two-times higher than creatinine-based estimates in populations across six countries in Africa.

Interpretation

Estimating GFR using serum creatinine substantially underestimates the individual and population-level burden of impaired kidney function in Africa with implications for understanding disease progression and complications, clinical care, and service provision. Scalable and affordable ways to accurately identify impaired kidney function in Africa are urgently needed.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^111h5Szp]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — accuracy and sources of error for estimated GFR (eGFR) versus measured GFR (mGFR) are outlined as follows: P30 for eGFR refers to the percent of eGFRs within 30% of mGFR, and if accuracy within 30% is acceptable (P30 > 80%) or optimal (P30 > 90%), eGFR may be sufficient; if greater accuracy is needed, mGFR is advised. Accuracy examples are provided: at a GFR of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m², 30% accuracy for eGFR corresponds to 42 to 78 ml/min per 1.73 m² and 15% accuracy for mGFR corresponds to 51 to 69 ml/min per 1.73 m²; at a GFR of 30 ml/min per 1.73 m², 30% accuracy for eGFR corresponds to 21 to 39 ml/min per 1.73 m² and 15% accuracy for mGFR corresponds to 26 to 35 ml/min per 1.73 m². The accuracy for mGFR is based on time-to-time variability, with P5 for mGFR referring to the percent of one mGFR that was within 15% of the second, and non-GFR determinants of endogenous filtration markers include generation, tubular handling, and extrarenal elimination.

### Grading evidence and recommendations for clinical practice guidelines in nephrology. A position statement from kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) [^113urXR2]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Considerable variation in grading systems used to rate the strength of guideline recommendations and the quality of the supporting evidence in Nephrology highlights the need for a uniform, internationally accepted, rigorous system. In 2004, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) commissioned a methods expert group to recommend an approach for grading in future nephrology guidelines. This position statement by KDIGO recommends adopting the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for the grading of evidence and guidelines on interventions. The GRADE approach appraises systematic reviews of the benefits and harms of an intervention to determine its net health benefit. The system considers the design, quality, and quantity of studies as well as the consistency and directness of findings when grading the quality of evidence. The strength of the recommendation builds on the quality of the evidence and additional considerations including costs. Adaptations of the GRADE approach are presented to address some issues pertinent to the field of nephrology, including (1) the need to extrapolate from studies performed predominantly in patients without kidney disease, and (2) the need to use qualitative summaries of effects when it is not feasible to quantitatively summarize them. Further refinement of the system will be required for grading of evidence on questions other than those related to intervention effects, such as diagnostic accuracy and prognosis.

### Effect of creatine supplementation on kidney function: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113LStoc]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A previous systematic review and meta-analysis included 5 studies (comprising 8 outcome measures) with a total of 220 participants to evaluate serum creatinine levels, and 3 studies involving 136 participants to assess glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The present systematic review and meta-analysis included a larger body of evidence, incorporating 21 studies in total of which 12 (comprising 14 outcome measures) were eligible for quantitative synthesis of serum creatinine outcomes and 5 for GFR. This expanded dataset provides more comprehensive insights into the renal safety of creatine supplementation across diverse populations, supplementation protocols, and durations. GFR is considered the best overall indicator of renal function in both healthy individuals and patients with kidney disease. Current clinical guidelines highlight that GFR reflects the integrated function of all nephrons and is therefore a more reliable index of renal health than isolated blood or urine markers. Stable GFR values are clinically more important than transient elevations in serum creatinine or other biomarkers, which may be influenced by extrarenal factors such as muscle mass, diet, or supplementation.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^112x7Nwn]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Initial assessment recommendation and caveats — Practice Point 1.2.2.1: Practice Point 1.2.2.1: Use serum creatinine (SCr) and an estimating equation for initial assessment of GFR. For most clinical circumstances, estimating GFR from SCr is appropriate; equations are available that estimate GFR using SCr and adjusting for sex and age, and professional societies have recommended that GFR estimates should be used in association with SCr reporting; key sources of error include non–steady-state conditions, non-GFR determinants of SCr, measurement error at higher GFR, and interferences with creatinine assays, and GFR estimates are less precise at higher GFR levels, so healthcare providers should remain aware of caveats that may influence accuracy in an individual person.

### Magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate kidney structure, function, and pathology: moving toward clinical application [^115ePepQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent advances in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow multiple quantitative measures to assess kidney morphology, tissue microstructure, oxygenation, kidney blood flow, and perfusion to be collected in a single scan session. Animal and clinical studies have investigated the relationship between the different MRI measures and biological processes, although their interpretation can be complex due to variations in study design and generally small participant numbers. However, emerging themes include the apparent diffusion coefficient derived from diffusion-weighted imaging, T 1 and T 2 mapping parameters, and cortical perfusion being consistently associated with kidney damage and predicting kidney function decline. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MRI has shown inconsistent associations with kidney damage markers but has been predictive of kidney function decline in several studies. Therefore, multiparametric MRI of the kidneys has the potential to address the limitations of existing diagnostic methods to provide a noninvasive, noncontrast, and radiation-free method to assess whole kidney structure and function. Barriers to be overcome to facilitate widespread clinical application include improved understanding of biological factors that impact MRI measures, development of a larger evidence base for clinical utility, standardization of MRI protocols, automation of data analysis, determining optimal combination of MRI measures, and health economic evaluation.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^112gvZAp]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

It remains unclear how to best determine baseline kidney function. What constitutes a baseline serum creatinine level is controversial and inconsistently defined. It would be ideal to have prior serum creatinine or GFR measurements widely available through electronic medical records, but this is not current practice in many parts of the world. Prior serum creatinine or GFR measures may also further elucidate the risk of AKI in patients considered at high risk on the basis of either comorbidity or an intervention. There is controversy about whether an acute decrease in serum creatinine level indicates AKI that has already occurred, and more research is needed in this area. For example, small declines in serum creatinine level need to be interpreted with caution because they may be the result of acute changes in creatinine production or volume of distribution. After a timed insult (e.g. coronary angiography, elective surgery, nephrotoxic drug exposure), serum creatinine level should be measured at an appropriate time, allowing for AKI to manifest. After AKI onset, serum creatinine level should be measured during follow-up as necessary for clinical management and care transitions (e.g. transfer to and from intensive care) and for determining changes in AKI staging and classification (AKI vs. AKD), including onset of CKD at 90 days.

How urine output should be evaluated is also an area that needs further investigation to avoid variability in reporting of AKI incidence (i.e. use of actual or ideal body weight, strict time period vs. time-averaged values). Future guidelines should address how differences in body composition (overweight, fluid overload) affect the interpretation of urine output, and whether these differences need to be considered in regard to the thresholds for AKI. Similarly, fluid status should be considered when evaluating for AKI. Fluid overload is associated with increased mortality and AKI, and it may impact the diagnosis of AKI through its impact on the volume of distribution of serum creatinine. Although there are research methods to define fluid overload, these are not routinely used in clinical practice, and it is unclear whether there is sufficient evidence to define a clinical threshold for fluid overload. In the next AKI guideline, fluid overload should be defined operationally through a rigorous literature review.
