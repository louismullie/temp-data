## Question

Is sharing bodily fluids indicated

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sharing bodily fluids is indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "sharing bodily fluids" means in different contexts. Then, I should verify the major infection risks and which fluids are high risk versus low risk. Next, I will review authoritative guidelines and labeling to see if there are any scenarios where sharing is acceptable. After that, I need to consider special exceptions like research biobanking and whether that changes the answer. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically grounded conclusion and counseling points with citations to back it up.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misinterpret the question. "Sharing bodily fluids" can refer to interpersonal exposure such as sexual contact, sharing needles or syringes, or exposure to blood and other high-risk fluids, and it can also refer to research contexts where biospecimens are collected, stored, and shared under consent for scientific purposes. I need to keep both meanings in mind as I proceed [^117HAkSs] [^115qp4jZ].

> Now, I should verify the infection risks. High-risk fluids for transmitting HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and other pathogens include blood, semen, vaginal secretions, rectal secretions, breast milk, and certain exudative fluids. Saliva is generally not considered a route for HIV transmission, though it can carry other agents like CMV, so I need to be precise here [^117HAkSs] [^1155xwve] [^114q1cSt].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance on interpersonal sharing. Multiple high-credibility sources consistently advise against sharing personal items that can carry blood or body fluids, such as toothbrushes and razors, and emphasize not sharing needles or syringes. They also counsel consistent condom use to avoid contact with semen, vaginal secretions, or blood during sex, and they extend these cautions to people with HIV, hepatitis B, and those on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis or treatment, reinforcing that sharing bodily fluids in these ways increases transmission risk and is not indicated [^11464BJs] [^114HkuFv] [^114vp9Wm] [^115CMr94] [^111TknUq] [^116k3N9a] [^11511LaV] [^115XZfAx] [^116YQMfs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm whether there are any exceptions in clinical care or public health where sharing fluids is acceptable. Occupational and travel medicine guidance treats exposures to blood and body fluids as high risk and recommends post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV when indicated, which underscores that such exposures are not routine or desirable. Even in vaccine contexts with live attenuated viruses, recipients are counseled to avoid sharing items that contact saliva or other fluids for defined periods, again signaling that sharing bodily fluids is not indicated in everyday life [^114Ktya8] [^116m6e5W].

> I will now examine the research context. In biobanking and translational research, "sharing" refers to de-identified biospecimens and data under informed consent and ethics oversight, not interpersonal exposure. This is a different domain entirely, governed by broad or dynamic consent, material transfer agreements, and privacy protections, and it does not imply that individuals should share bodily fluids with each other in daily life. So, I should be careful not to conflate these two meanings of "sharing" [^115qp4jZ] [^117VZLS2] [^1148ZmZn].

> Let me synthesize. For interpersonal contact, sharing bodily fluids is not indicated because it increases the risk of transmitting serious infections such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Authoritative guidelines uniformly recommend avoiding exposure to others' blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and rectal secretions, and they advise against sharing items contaminated with blood or body fluids. For research, "sharing" biospecimens is a regulated, consent-based process that does not translate into routine interpersonal fluid sharing being acceptable or safe [^117HAkSs] [^11464BJs] [^114HkuFv] [^115qp4jZ].

> But wait, what if someone argues that casual contact or saliva might be okay? I should double-check that nuance. While HIV is not transmitted by saliva, other pathogens are, and public health guidance still advises hand hygiene and avoidance of sharing cups or utensils in settings with high CMV prevalence, reinforcing that even "lower risk" fluids warrant caution in certain contexts. So, the bottom line remains that sharing bodily fluids in everyday interpersonal settings is not indicated and should be avoided [^114q1cSt] [^1155xwve].

> Final answer: No, sharing bodily fluids is not indicated in interpersonal contexts due to substantial infection risks. It is consistently discouraged across infection prevention, HIV prevention, and medication safety guidance, and the only regulated "sharing" pertains to de-identified biospecimens in research under informed consent, which is a separate issue entirely [^117HAkSs] [^11464BJs] [^114HkuFv] [^115qp4jZ].

Sharing bodily fluids is **not medically indicated** except in specific clinical contexts such as **blood transfusion**, **organ transplantation**, or **assisted reproduction**. Otherwise, sharing bodily fluids carries significant risks of transmitting infectious diseases, including HIV, hepatitis B and C, and other pathogens [^117HAkSs]. Medical guidance consistently advises against sharing bodily fluids and emphasizes strict infection control, safe sex practices, and avoidance of shared needles or personal items that may be contaminated with blood or body fluids [^11464BJs] [^114vp9Wm]. In research, bodily fluids may be shared only with informed consent and ethical oversight, not for direct interpersonal use [^115qp4jZ].

---

## Medical indications for sharing bodily fluids

There are **limited medical scenarios** in which sharing bodily fluids is indicated:

- **Blood transfusion**: Donated blood is screened and matched to recipient type to treat anemia, trauma, or surgical blood loss.

- **Organ transplantation**: Organs and tissues are matched and screened to prevent rejection and disease transmission.

- **Assisted reproduction**: Sperm, ova, or embryos are used in fertility treatments with rigorous screening and consent.

- **Breast milk sharing**: Medically supervised milk banks provide screened donor milk for infants when maternal milk is unavailable.

---

## Risks associated with sharing bodily fluids

Sharing bodily fluids outside these controlled settings poses **substantial risks**:

- **HIV**: Transmitted via blood, semen, vaginal secretions, breast milk, and rectal fluids [^1155xwve].

- **Hepatitis B and C**: Transmitted through blood and other body fluids [^117HAkSs].

- **Other infections**: Including CMV, Ebola, and SARS-CoV-2, depending on the fluid and exposure context [^114q1cSt] [^116Bc7Xj] [^113mhqf5].

---

## Medical guidelines and recommendations

Medical authorities consistently advise against sharing bodily fluids and recommend:

- **Safe sex**: Use condoms to prevent transmission of HIV and other STIs [^1155xwve].

- **Avoid sharing needles**: Never share injection equipment [^111Hkdt2].

- **Personal hygiene**: Do not share toothbrushes, razors, or other items that may contact blood [^11464BJs].

- **Infection control**: Use standard precautions in healthcare settings to prevent exposure to blood and body fluids [^116MoUQf].

---

## Ethical considerations in research

In research, sharing bodily fluids is governed by **strict ethical guidelines**:

- **Informed consent**: Participants must be fully informed about the use of their samples [^1148ZmZn].

- **Confidentiality**: Samples are de-identified to protect privacy [^114Afuz1].

- **Ethical oversight**: Institutional review boards approve and monitor studies [^114Afuz1].

---

## Conclusion

Sharing bodily fluids is **not medically indicated** outside of specific, controlled clinical contexts such as transfusion, transplantation, or assisted reproduction. In all other settings, it poses significant health risks and is discouraged by medical guidelines. Research use of bodily fluids requires informed consent and ethical oversight, and is not intended for direct interpersonal sharing.

### Consent for anaesthesia [^113VrghM]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2004). Low credibility.

"Informed consent" is a legal instrument that allows individuals to define their own interests and to protect their bodily privacy. In current medical practice, patients who have consented to surgery are considered to have implied consent to anaesthesia, even though anaesthesia is associated with its own particular set of risks and consequences that are quite separate from those associated with surgery. In addition, anaesthetists often perform interventions that are the only medical treatment received by a patient. Anaesthetists, therefore, should always obtain separate consent for anaesthesia, and should regard the process of consent as a stimulus for active, fluid reciprocal discussion with patients about treatment options.

Section 7. Risk screening and risk-reduction interventions — biomedical options for partners are referenced, noting the importance of engaging clinical and nonclinical providers to inform persons with HIV about preexposure prophylaxis [PrEP] and nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis [nPEP] for HIV-uninfected partners when clinically indicated to reduce risk of HIV acquisition. PrEP is described as the daily, continuous use of antiretroviral medications by an HIV-uninfected person to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition, and nPEP is described as the use of selected antiretroviral medications within 72 hours after isolated, nonoccupational exposures to body fluids potentially containing HIV to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition.

### Patient questions surrounding mask use for prevention of COVID-19 and physician answers from an evidence-based perspective: a narrative review [^116B7GK5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: I've read that masks do not work. If some studies caution against cloth masks for healthcare workers, why should the public use them?

Answer: Cloth masks protect other people from you, by reducing the number of droplets that you might release into a shared air space when you breathe, talk, cough, or sneeze. They provide another layer of protection in addition to social distancing and washing your hands. There is evidence to support a benefit for cloth masks in reducing the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas masks have not been as effective for other respiratory viruses. Medical/surgical masks have a different role. The construction and proper use of a medical mask can help protect the provider from their patients more effectively than a cloth mask such as when exposed to bodily fluids in addition to protecting their patients from respiratory particles.

Rationale: The study in questiondid show that there were significantly higher rates of respiratory infections (clinical respiratory illness, influenza-like illness, and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection) among practitioners randomized to a cloth mask arm compared to medical grade masks in a large study of practitioners (N = 1607). However, the control arm in this study was "usual practice" which included medical mask wearing. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn as to whether or not a cloth mask provides any level of protection (or not) compared to no mask.

The effectiveness of masks in both community and healthcare settings has been extensively reviewed by Chou et al; they conclude that, while the body of evidence is not enough to draw firm conclusions, they do point to a benefit for reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV-1, but no effect for influenza, influenza-like illness, or other viral respiratory illnesses. There have been no studies for SARS-CoV-2 except for observational studies that have shown a decrease in cases following implementation of required masking. A lack of benefit with masking for influenza and the common cold is in agreement with the many commentaries that argue against mask use (e.g. ref.); however, these commentaries fail to reference any studies of viruses more closely related to SARS-CoV-2.

### Advancing clinical and translational research in germ cell tumours (GCT): recommendations from the malignant germ cell international consortium [^115GSDDP]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, GCTs are rare neooplasms, characterised by substantial clinical, pathological, and biological heterogeneity. MDTs of dedicated professionals are necessarily involved in the care of these patients. Clinically meaningful observations and discoveries that improve the management of GCT patients are potentiated if multiple individuals and institutions come together and share expertise. Dedicated biobanks are critical to support the translational studies that will underpin such learning. However, many challenges lie ahead, related to universalised cataloguing and storing of GCT biospecimens (tissues and bodily fluid) and associated clinicopathological data, with appropriate governance. We present the MaGIC view of such a potential integrated infrastructure, with the aim to facilitate truly innovative and meaningful GCT research across the full spectrum of disease encountered in clinical practice, which will lead to improved outcomes for all patients affected by this orphan disease.

Radium-223 therapy — radiation precautions for patients — With each treatment in the six-part therapy, patients should receive instructions regarding limited radiation precautions for the home during the initial week, focusing on blood, stool, and body fluid precautions. Patients should be advised to sit when urinating, use disposable gloves for catheters conveying urine or other bodily fluids, clean spilled urine or other soiled surfaces or garments, wash heavily contaminated garments separately, and maintain fluid intake and bathroom usage; sharing of food or drink and sexual contact should be discouraged, as should prolonged close contact with children or pregnant women for a period of 2 weeks after injection.

### Quality of fluid balance charting and interventions to improve it: a systematic review [^115iUDUY]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review had three major findings. First, we found that although fluid balance charting is common practice in medical, surgical and ICUs, the quality of fluid balance charting is inadequate. Second, calculation errors are also common. Third, all interventions included at least two components, but the time of evaluation and the impact on the completion of fluid balance charts varied.

Quality of fluid balance charting

Half of the included studies reported that less than 50% of the fluid balance charts were complete and correctly filled, indicating that insufficient fluid balance documentation is a considerable challenge. Fluid balance charts guide clinical decisions, including prescription of intravenous fluid or medication and interventions to ensure appropriate care and reduce the risk of complications and fluid balance disorders. Thus, a thoroughly kept fluid balance chart contributes valuable data. On the contrary, it can be counterproductive if not adequately completed and put patient safety at risk by leading to erroneous conclusions.

A compelling question related to the quality of fluid balance monitoring is what is meant by 'complete' fluid balance charts. A fluid balance chart may seem complete even though some documentation is missing, indicating that certainty regarding the completeness of charts can only be determined through observations. Divergent definitions or no definition at all complicate the comparison of results. The variety of definitions may, thus, express a lack of shared understanding of fluid balance monitoring. Studies show that a standardised nursing language can improve communication among healthcare professionals, adherence to standards of care and quality of care. Therefore, a shared definition of complete fluid balance monitoring may improve charting accuracy and would enable comparisons across settings.

### Didanosine [^114vp9Wm]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Avoid doing things that can spread HIV-1 infection to others.

Do not share needles or other injection equipment.
Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, like toothbrushes and razor blades.
Do not have any kind of sex without protection. Always practice safe sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom or other barrier method to lower the chance of sexual contact with semen, vaginal secretions, or blood.

Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Medication Guide. Do not use didanosine delayed-release capsules for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give didanosine delayed-release capsules to other people, even if they have the same symptoms as you have. It may harm them.

Do not keep medicine that is out of date or that you no longer need. Dispose of unused medicines through community take-back disposal programs when available or place didanosine delayed-release capsules in an unrecognizable closed container in the household trash.

This Medication Guide summarizes the most important information about didanosine delayed-release capsules. If you would like more information about didanosine delayed-release capsules, talk with your healthcare provider. You can ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for information about didanosine delayed-release capsules that is written for health professionals.

### Integrated diagnostics: proceedings from the 9th biennial symposium of the international society for strategic studies in radiology [^111stF8Y]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

At the most basic level, systems such as health information exchanges and PCHRs facilitate integrated diagnostics by enabling physicians to rapidly assemble patients' health records and test results, regardless of where or when they were originally obtained. The resulting improvements in communication are expected to reduce medical errors and increase healthcare quality, safety, and efficiency.

In the longer term, cloud-based systems for sharing patient data could also have a tremendous impact on research into new diagnostic, treatment, and preventive methods. Today, researchers are usually only able to study patients from their own institutions. However, widespread adoption of PCHRs, for example, could make it possible for researchers to quickly and affordably recruit patients from other academic and community healthcare centres, even from other countries. In addition, research institutions may themselves share large amounts of data through cloud computing. The resulting, potentially "global" study cohorts could dwarf those of even the largest of today's multicentre studies, dramatically expanding the possibilities for population studies and the power of bioinformatics analyses.

By evaluating large, well-defined population samples over extended periods of time, population studies allow researchers to better separate the effects of environment, lifestyle, genetics, and other factors on disease development and long-term health outcomes. For example, the ongoing Rotterdam Study, initiated at Erasmus University in 1990, assesses factors influencing the development of chronic diseases in a large cohort of subjects enrolled at age 45 years or more; participants are interviewed at baseline and periodic follow-up visits, are examined in the study centre, undergo imaging, and have bodily fluids collected for molecular and genetic analyses. The Rotterdam Study has identified numerous associations between lifestyle, clinical, molecular, and genetic variables and common chronic diseases. In 2005, an MR imaging unit was added to the Rotterdam Study enabling the identification of correlations between imaging biomarkers (imaging phenotypes), clinical phenotypes, and genotypes. Through this process, the value of imaging biomarkers in predicting disease can be established and validated. By 2009, the Rotterdam Study had a population of approximately 15,000 and had resulted in nearly 1,000 research articles and reports.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116912ug]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Acute and recent HIV infection — clinical suspicion and differential diagnosis: Health care providers should consider the possibility of acute HIV infection in symptomatic people and in asymptomatic people with a possible acute (within 2–6 weeks) exposure to HIV. Signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings may include fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, diarrhea, pharyngitis, oral ulcers, thrombocytopenia, and transaminase elevation. High-risk exposures include sexual contact with someone who has HIV or is at risk of HIV infection, sharing needles, syringes, or equipment for drug preparation or injection, or contact of mucous membranes or broken skin with bodily fluids that may carry HIV. The differential diagnosis may include COVID-19, EBV and non-EBV (e.g. CMV) infectious mononucleosis syndromes, influenza, viral hepatitis, streptococcal infection, or syphilis, and diagnosis of any STI should prompt HIV testing and consideration of acute HIV infection.

### Efavirenz [^115CMr94]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

- reduce the amount of HIV-1 in your blood. This is called viral load.

- increase the number of CD4+ (T) cells in your blood that help fight off otherinfections.

Reducing the amount of HIV-1 and increasing the CD4+ (T) cells in your blood may help improve your immune system. This may reduce your risk of death or getting infections that can happen when your immune system is weak (opportunistic infections).

 Efavirenz does not cure HIV-1 infection or AIDS. You should keep taking HIV-1 medicines to control HIV-1 infection and decrease HIV-related illnesses.

 Avoid doing things that can spread HIV-1 infection to others:

- Do not share or reuse needles or other injection equipment.

- Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, like toothbrushes and razor blades.

- Do not have any kind of sex without protection. Always practice safer sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to lower the chance of sexual contact with any body fluids such as semen, vaginal secretions, or blood.

Ask your doctor if you have any questions about how to prevent passing HIV to other people.

 Who should not take efavirenz tablets? Do not take efavirenz tablets if you are allergic to efavirenz or any of the ingredients in efavirenz tablets. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in efavirenz tablets.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^11464BJs]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Blood and body fluid precautions and safe injection practices — personal items, entry restrictions, and sharps handling: Some infectious agents can be transmitted from contact with blood and other body fluids, so advise families not to share personal items such as toothbrushes or razors with others, even within their own family, and restrict entrance of an individual with open skin infections that cannot be covered or other conditions that might allow contact with their body fluids; if an infected person or their family member has behaviors (eg, biting) that might put others at risk of contact with their blood or body fluids, specific restrictions may be required, determined on an individual basis. For safe injection practices, caregivers may need to use needles to administer medications either through a central venous catheter (often called "central line" or "PICCline") or by direct injection (eg, insulin); never re-cap used needles and syringes and never reuse needles or syringes more than once. When possible, use single dose vials of medications instead of multi-dose medication vials to reduce the risk of contamination, only one single person should use a medication vial, insulin pen, or finger-stick device for blood sugar monitoring, always store these medical supplies and devices in the guest's private room, and dispose of needles separately from all other trash in a rigid, puncture-resistant container.

### International charter of principles for sharing bio-specimens and data [^117VZLS2]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

At the time of the collection of data and bio-specimens, their future specific use may be difficult to anticipate or may only be described in very broad general terms, for example, for cancer research, RD research or medical research. The question about the acceptability of broad consent, has been deeply debated in the ethics and legal literature, and there is some consensus on its acceptability, provided proper on-going ethical and legal oversight are in place (approval by ethics review boards for every single project is mandatory).

The need to re-contact and involve patients in research though, may also lead to the development of patient centric approaches to consent that provide a dynamic interaction. A number of patient centric consent strategies exploiting online technologies have been developed to help address the limits of a pure broad consent approach. Obviously longitudinal population projects are in constant contact with their participants but dynamic consent models, offer an alternative way to overcome the tension between broad and specific consent also in non-longitudinal research such as clinical trials, by ensuring on-going information and participant involvement after general consent has been provided at the time of bio-specimens collection. Different research platforms and legal frameworks may require more detailed consent, but for the sharing procedures related to prospective sampling and data acquisition we propose and outline a minimal requirement strategy. Therefore, we further propose that templates for informed consent in research projects of an epidemiological character can be accepted if based on the notion of broadly described purposes for future research, provided this is subject to ethics approval and supported by a policy of regular updates to donors and a clear option to withdraw. In fact, even when the purpose is described only in general or broad terms, information regarding the process of research may be specific on the relevant issues, for example, that the research project implies the sharing of data across research groups and national borders, that complementary information may be added through linkage to different registries' medical records, that it involves genetic analyses and collaboration with both academic and commercial partners, whether or not there is any provision for return of research findings, etc. So to overcome the lack of detailed research information at the time of consent, we suggest an integrated approach entailing broad consent coupled with provision of on-going information about the general development of project, for instance by proper communication with the participants/donors through email, phone, a newsletter, patient organizations contacts and regular website updates dedicated to them.

### Reyataz [^111TknUq]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (PATIENT INFORMATION and INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE).

REYATAZ is not a cure for HIV infection and patients may continue to experience illnesses associated with HIV infection, including opportunistic infections. Tell patients that sustained decreases in plasma HIV RNA have been associated with a reduced risk of progression to AIDS and death. Advise patients to remain under the care of a healthcare provider while using REYATAZ.

HIV Transmission

Advise patients to avoid doing things that can spread HIV infection to others.

- Do not share or reuse needles or other injection equipment.

- Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, like toothbrushes and razor blades.

- Do not have any kind of sex without protection. Always practice safer sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to lower the chance of sexual contact with semen, vaginal secretions, or blood.

- Do not breastfeed. REYATAZ can be passed to your baby in your breast milk and it is not known whether it could harm your baby. Also, mothers with HIV should not breastfeed because HIV can be passed to the baby in breast milk.

### Towards preanalytical best practices for liquid biopsy studies: a BLOODPAC landscape analysis [^112w2tng]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Liquid biopsy refers to a broad group of minimally invasive tests performed on blood or other body fluids that provide molecular or cellular information. Diverse potential clinical applications of liquid biopsy assays can inform medical decisions and improve the care of patients with cancer; however, further studies are required to evaluate the analytical and clinical validity and utility of many of these applications.

BLOODPAC is a public‐private consortium of industry, academic, non‐profit, and federal agency stakeholders with a common goal to accelerate regulatory approval and clinical implementation of novel blood‐based tests for cancer within the framework of precision medicine. Central to this effort has been the development of coordinated approaches and common infrastructure for pre‐competitive and post‐publication data sharing. Over 60 current BLOODPAC collaborators contribute to mutually agreed‐upon definitions, common approaches to data submission, collaborative efforts to fill knowledge and data gaps, and deposition of data into the BLOODPAC Data Commons. The BLOODPAC Data Commonsis a cloud‐based data platform with rules‐based access that makes data findable, attributable, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).

The BLOODPAC Preanalytical Working Group coordinated the development of 11 minimum technical (preanalytical) data elements (MTDEs) for any data submitted to the Data Commons. This development process was guided by initial analysis of data submitted to the BLOODPAC Data Commons and leveraged input from the diverse BLOODPAC membership in collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Preanalytics for Precision Medicine Project team. This work was based on the first principle that preanalytical variables can significantly influence liquid biopsy assay performance and results. The 11 preanalytical MTDEs allow the diverse BLOODPAC membership — including test developers, translational researchers, pharmaceutical partners, and clinicians — to collect and report critical standardized preanalytical data for BLOODPAC‐sponsored studies and other liquid biopsy data submitted to the BLOODPAC Data Commons. Importantly, these MTDEs are freely accessible and available to the broader community, and we recommend broad adoption of the MTDEs by the community engaged in liquid biopsy assay development.

Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, such as toothbrushes and razor blades.

Do not share or re-use needles or other injection equipment.

Ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions about how to prevent getting HIV-1 or spreading HIV-1 to other people.

What are the possible side effects of TRUVADA?

TRUVADA may cause serious side effects, including:

See "WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TRUVADA?"

New or worse kidney problems, including kidney failure. If you had kidney problems in the past or take another medicine that can cause kidney problems, your healthcare provider may do blood tests to check your kidneys before you start and while you are taking TRUVADA. Your healthcare provider may tell you to take TRUVADA less often, or to stop taking TRUVADA if you have kidney problems.

### International charter of principles for sharing bio-specimens and data [^115qp4jZ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction to the International Charter of Principles for Sharing Bio-Specimens and Data

Sharing data and bio-specimens is essential for the discovery, new knowledge creation and translation of various biomedical research findings into improved diagnostics, biomarkers, treatment development, patient care, health service planning and general population health. The growing international agreement on the need to provide access to research data sets to optimize their use and fully exploit their long-term value has been articulated in many documents, including the OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding, the Toronto Statement, and more recently the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health's White Paper. Contemporaneously, the ambitious aims set out in the International Rare Disease (RD) Research Consortium (IRDiRC.org), which seeks to develop 200 therapies and to diagnose most RDs by 2020, and the decision of the European Commission asking all members states to develop a national plan for RDs, provide further impetus. Although sharing of data and samples is thought to be beneficial for most health-related research, it is of highest importance for RD research because of the scarcity of research participants, samples, data, resources and researchers for any given RD.

Ideally, data and bio-specimens should be made widely available to the most inclusive and ethically responsible research community, but there is often resistance by institutions and individuals who fear that they will not receive recognition for their investment in building collections. Real and perceived risks of discrimination of vulnerable patients groups because of health-related data sharing also exist and must be considered in any legislation or guidelines. Collecting data and storing biological samples in accordance with ethical and scientific standards requires intellectual, institutional and economic resources and, critically, the participation of patients and the wider community including otherwise healthy volunteers.

All data and material sharing agreements should be ethically robust and mindful of the responsibilities owed to the donors to make best ethical use of the samples and data consistent with their consent.

Researchers face very different requirements for data and sample sharing. Data Transfer Agreement (DTA) and Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) are often written in legal terms, and so are not easily understood by scientists or institute administration officers who serve as a conduit for these agreements. Hence the need to provide a simplified overview of basic principles and a practical template (the MTA/DTA). The principles are equally valid and applicable for Access Agreements (AAs).

### Adolescents and young adults: the pediatrician's role in HIV testing and pre-and postexposure HIV prophylaxis [^115fq6Lb]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Table 1 Identifying and Diagnosing Acute and Recent HIV-1 Infection — acute HIV-1 infection should be considered in individuals with signs or symptoms and recent (within 2 to 6 wk) high risk of exposure to HIV-1. High-risk exposures include sexual contact with a person who has HIV-1 infection, sharing of injection drug use paraphernalia, or exposure of mucous membranes or broken skin to potentially infected bodily fluid. Acute HIV-1 infection is defined as detectable HIV-1 RNA or p24 antigen in the setting of a negative or indeterminate HIV-1 antibody test result. A reactive HIV antibody test result or Ag/Ab combination test result must be followed by supplemental confirmatory testing. A negative or indeterminate HIV-1 antibody test result in a person with a reactive Ag/Ab test result or in whom acute HIV-1 infection is suspected requires plasma HIV-1 RNA testing to diagnose acute HIV-1 infection. A positive result on a quantitative or qualitative plasma HIV-1 RNA test in the setting of a negative or indeterminate antibody test result indicates that acute HIV-1 infection is highly likely and the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection should be later confirmed by subsequent documentation of HIV antibody seroconversion. Signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings may include fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, diarrhea, oral ulcers, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and transaminase elevation.

### Applied body-fluid analysis by wearable devices [^112ij8pi]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Wearable sensors are a recent paradigm in healthcare, enabling continuous, decentralized, and non- or minimally invasive monitoring of health and disease. Continuous measurements yield information-rich time series of physiological data that are holistic and clinically meaningful. Although most wearable sensors were initially restricted to biophysical measurements, the next generation of wearable devices is now emerging that enable biochemical monitoring of both small and large molecules in a variety of body fluids, such as sweat, breath, saliva, tears and interstitial fluid. Rapidly evolving data analysis and decision-making technologies through artificial intelligence has accelerated the application of wearables around the world. Although recent pilot trials have demonstrated the clinical applicability of these wearable devices, their widespread adoption will require large-scale validation across various conditions, ethical consideration and sociocultural acceptance. Successful translation of wearable devices from laboratory prototypes into clinical tools will further require a comprehensive transitional environment involving all stakeholders. The wearable device platforms must gain acceptance among different user groups, add clinical value for various medical indications, be eligible for reimbursements and contribute to public health initiatives. In this Perspective, we review state-of-the-art wearable devices for body-fluid analysis and their translation into clinical applications, and provide insight into their clinical purpose.

### Perception of Polish patients with cancer of the ethical and legal issues related to biobank research [^116uWBFk]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Research tool

The questionnaire used in this project was developed in accordance with the recommendations of the European Statistical System. After a literature search, a preliminary questionnaire was designed. The questionnaire was then evaluated by a panel of experts (a public health specialist, a sociologist, and an ethicist) and revised based on their comments. It was then evaluated by an oncologist who provided additional comments which led to the reformulation of 5 questions. After a standardized questionnaire was developed, it was pre-tested with 20 patients with cancer. This in turn, led to the rephrasing of 3 questions. The questionnaire was finally re-evaluated by 4 additional external specialists: an oncologist, a public health specialist, a sociologist, and an ethicist. It was approved by the Poznan University of Medical Sciences Bioethics Committee.

The questionnaire itself was designed to explore questions on the assessment of the perception of patients with cancer on the ethical and legal issues related to research biobanking. The first part included questions about the preferences of patients' with cancer for the type of consent and withdrawing consent, control over data sharing, data protection, tissue ownership and profit sharing, and their opinion on the preferred compensation for sharing their samples. The second part of the survey concerned patients with cancer demographic characteristics, such as sex and age, education, place of residence (number of inhabitants), and religiosity (determined by patients' declaration on "What role does religion play in your life?"), the type of tumor and the stage of disease. All items in the questionnaire were designed as close-ended questions and patients were asked to choose from a limited range of pre-defined options. The questionnaire used close-ended questions with a 5-Likert scale ranging from 1 (strong dissatisfaction or disagreement) to 5 (high satisfaction or agreement).

At the same time, since research shows that people's awareness of biobanks in Poland is low, before completing the survey all respondents were provided with a definition of a research biobank ("A biobank is a collection of human biological samples, ie, bodily fluid, DNA or tissues, and associated information (ie, demographic, socio-economic, genealogical, lifestyle, and environmental data) collected from patients and healthy persons, organized systematically to help researchers study the way genes, the environment, and lifestyle might affect a person's health"). All the questions asked were formulated in simple language using descriptive definitions without technical jargon to facilitate the completion of the survey.

### Genetic research and the collective good: participants as leaders to reconcile individual and public interests [^117EViMU]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

The proponents of an obligation to participate in medical research claim that the use of medical data or samples falls under this case. The use of Henrietta Lacks' cells is a typical example of what the bioethicist Rhodes calls 'use of leftover biological samples', a research practice with which she associates no anticipated risks or burdens and for which, as a consequence, she argues, informed consent may be 'unnecessary'. Rhodes argues that in cases like this, which involve 'no physical risk to the individual', individual liberty limitation is justifiable in the pursuit of 'the common good', and to participate in medical research is in fact a 'duty' (ibidem).

On a similar note, Chadwick and Berg, referring to sharing genetic information in the context of rare diseases, argued that: 'It is questionable whether individuals should be free, from an ethical point of view, to refuse to help in an effort to relieve suffering for what could be regarded as trivial reasons'. Harrisargued that a moral obligation to participate in medical research is 'straightforwardly derivable from either of two of the most basic moral obligations we have as persons': the obligation not to harm others (elsewhere referred to as the argument of beneficence) implies a moral obligation to contribute to medical research if this likely leads to a lessening of disease burden. Likewise, the principle of fairness (the free-rider argument in Schaefer et al) implies that, as everyone is likely to benefit from the advances of medical research, 'we have an obligation in justice to contribute to the social practice which produces them'. For Ballantyne and Schaefer, obligation to participate in medical research is all the more binding in relation to sharing health data, as 'bodily integrity is maintained and the harms of participation are much lower'.

General information about the safe and effective use of entecavir tablets

Entecavir tablets do not stop you from spreading the hepatitis B virus (HBV) to others by sex, sharing needles, or being exposed to your blood. Talk with your healthcare provider about safe sexual practices that protect your partner. Never share needles. Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, like toothbrushes or razor blades. A shot (vaccine) is available to protect people at risk from becoming infected with HBV.

Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Patient Information leaflet. Do not use entecavir tablets for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give entecavir tablets to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them.

This Patient Information leaflet summarizes the most important information about entecavir tablets. If you would like more information, talk with your healthcare provider. You can ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for information about entecavir tablets that is written for health professionals.

### Updated U.S. public health service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to HIV and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis [^111enuq2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2005). Low credibility.

This report updates U.S. Public Health Service recommendations for the management of health-care personnel (HCP) who have occupational exposure to blood and other body fluids that might contain human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although the principles of exposure management remain unchanged, recommended HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens have been changed. This report emphasizes adherence to HIV PEP when it is indicated for an exposure, expert consultation in management of exposures, follow-up of exposed workers to improve adherence to PEP, and monitoring for adverse events, including seroconversion. To ensure timely postexposure management and administration of HIV PEP, clinicians should consider occupational exposures as urgent medical concerns.

### Intravenous fluids: issues warranting concern [^1141CaQa]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Editor,

We are making a clarion call for the development and availability of intravenous fluids that have a physiological composition and complete and transparent labeling. Intravenous administrations of fluid are used in peri-operative medicine to maintain homeostasis and to restore normal physiology in a wide variety of clinical scenarios. These scenarios include their routine use during anaesthesia and surgery in adults and children, and in the treatment of the critically ill suffering from a variety of pathologies. The physiological end-points targeted by the infusions include systemic blood volume, and in turn, cardiac output, tissue perfusion, metabolic function, electrolyte concentrations and acid — base balance. Although colloids have the advantage of remaining predominantly intravascular, they may cause haemostasis and renal dysfunction. As a result, crystalloids that are free of these risks and much less expensive than colloid solutions, are currently used in nearly all situations.

Crystalloid solutions vary widely in chemical composition, affecting their efficacy and ability to cause adverse effects, including those related to volume loading and electrolyte imbalance. Their side effects may have serious consequences both in adults and children especially when the infusion volume is large and given over a long duration. The solutions used for intravenous infusions contain biologically active chemicals and so are categorised as drug products by local agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). However, despite this designation, fluid physiology receives little attention in medical education and in the medical and scientific literature. This problem is exacerbated by packaging of the solutions that lacks information about chemical composition, such as osmolality and potential base excess (BE pot), dose, indications, contraindications and potential side-effects. This absence of transparency has prompted wide-spread frustration among clinicians, as reflected in the international nature of the contributing authors above. We recommend that labeling of the various crystalloid formulations be updated to reflect their physiological consequences, and that the protocols related to the infusion of these fluids be more widely taught, standardised and evidence-based.

### Use of Ebola vaccine: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, United States, 2020 [^116m6e5W]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Precautions: Vaccine Virus Transmission

Ervebo contains a replication-competent, live attenuated virus; therefore, potential exists for transmission of vaccine virus through close personal contact. Vaccine virus RNA has been detected by rRT-PCR in the blood and saliva of vaccinated persons as long as 14 days after vaccination. Vaccine virus RNA has been detected in the urine of vaccinated persons as long as 7 days after vaccination. Vaccine virus RNA has been detected by rRT-PCR in synovial fluid and skin vesicles in vaccinated persons as long as 20 days after vaccination. Live vaccine virus has been isolated in skin vesicles in vaccinated persons as long as 9 days after vaccination (Table).

The following precautions should be taken to prevent potential vaccine virus transmission:

Vaccine recipients should not donate blood for at least 6 weeks postvaccination.
Vaccine recipients should avoid sharing needles, razors, or eating utensils; drinking from the same cup; using the same toothbrushes; and open-mouth kissing for 2 weeks after vaccination. Persons who develop oral sores after receiving vaccine should avoid these activities until the sores heal.
Out of an abundance of caution, vaccine recipients should use effective barrier prophylaxis methods during any sexual interaction (regardless of childbearing status or sexual orientation) for 2 months after vaccination.
Vaccine recipients should consider avoiding close association with and exposure of high-risk persons to their blood and bodily fluids for up to 6 weeks after vaccination. High-risk persons include immunocompromised persons, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and children aged < 1 year.
Vaccine recipients should attempt to avoid exposing livestock to their blood and bodily fluids for at least 6 weeks after vaccination.
Both maculopapular and vesicular rashes have been described in some individuals after vaccination. Persons who develop a rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the rash with a bandage until healed. Contaminated bandages should be placed in a sealed plastic bag and disposed of in the trash. Hands should be washed with soap and water after disposing the plastic bag.

Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness

The duration of protection against EBOV after vaccination with Ervebo is unknown. In addition, vaccination with Ervebo might not protect all persons. Vaccinated persons should continue to adhere to recommended infection control practices to prevent EBOV infection and transmission among health care workers and laboratorians.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^113rNrW6]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

There is little research that has been directly conducted into shared haemodialysis care, however there is considerable evidence of the benefits of supported self-care in other long term conditions. Low health literacy amongst dialysis patients is associated with worse survival whereas self-motivation and education can result in better care, for example, in phosphate control and fluid balance. As with the broader NHS, dialysis services are experiencing considerable pressure to deliver high quality in the face of fiscal challenge, and an important mechanism to ensure that quality of care is maintained, is to engage service users as true partners in their own treatment: self-management is an ambition in 'Kidney Health: Delivering Excellence'. To achieve this, health care professionals need to enhance their roles, becoming educators and facilitators, supporting patients to take a greater role in their own care, and increasing their opportunities for dialysing at home.

Shared haemodialysis care impacts on all domains of health. Central among these are: the enhanced patient safety that comes from education on infection control (see the WHO campaign 'Save lives: clean your hands'); the enhanced equity consequent on offering all patients training in their treatment rather than only those planning haemodialysis at home; and the enhanced experience when patients can put themselves onto dialysis, or manage their own alarms, without waiting for a nurse.

The process of haemodialysis can be broken down into approximately 14 tasks (Appendix 5). The exact arrangements may vary between units but the concept is essentially the same: that centre-based patients are given the opportunity to train to perform one or more of these tasks. It is key that patient involvement is voluntary, and that learning is individualised to the style and speed of the individual. Shared haemodialysis care is associated with a range of barriers and enablers that are best explored through quality improvement work, in order to design favourable conditions for successful implementation.

Guideline 8.3 - Intradialytic exercise

We recommend that intradialytic exercise should be available in all units, as a treatment for enhancing physical functioning, in patients without contraindications. [1B]

We suggest that intradialytic exercise be considered as a method of enhancing quality of life. [2C]

We suggest that exercise regimes be devised by appropriately trained staff. [2C]

### Intravenous fluids: issues warranting concern [^114Gw4Lw]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we recommend strongly that the medical community take Lönnqvist's appeal ('time for a solution')seriously, and urge medical companies and manufacturers to provide improved infusion solutions that are physiologically composed and balanced (Table 1), and which include clear and detailed guidance for their safe and effective use. We believe that these relatively simple steps, which can be achieved without increasing costs, will have a substantial clinical benefit in reducing morbidity and potentially saving lives.

### Responses to open peer commentaries about "Timely dying in dementia: use patients' judgments and broaden the concept of suffering" and "Can an effective end-of-life intervention for advanced dementia be viewed as moral? " [^111NFBwz]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Allen stated, "Every patient has the ethical and legal right" "to shorten suffering… by ceasing assisted feeding and drinking". I agree — provided patients had capacity during ACP, when they voluntarily made a clear and convincing request after their provider shared sufficient information for them to give their informed consent.

Allen states he relies on competent, trained professionals to determine the etiology and reversibility of a PLAD's not eating — instead of placing food and fluid within the patient's reach, which he claims is neither effective as a defense against a charge of euthanasia nor a way to determine the etiology of not eating.

Here, Allen may be assuming facts not in evidence. I am not aware of any data that support the ability of "trained, competent professionals" to determine with 100% accuracy, which patients can, and which cannot, regain their ability to independently eat and drink — before beginning medical dehydration. I do not share Allen's confidence in "competent trained professionals'" ability to determine the cause(s) of not eating. Most common is dementia‐caused brain damage that led either to losing their ability to recognize items as food and fluid (agnosia) or to losing their ability to coordinate moving their hands to put food and fluid in her mouth (dyspraxia). But Allen failed to acknowledge the Perspective essay's list of clinical situations that could — albeit with an unknown but likely small percentage of patients — lead to a reversible loss of ability to eat and drink. Medical dehydration may (A) increase hunger that overcomes depression, apathy, or voluntarily waiting for caregivers' assistance with feeding as their last vestige of social interaction; (B) discontinue medications that had been causing nausea or other GI side effects; and (C) shrink a comorbid brain tumor by reducing excess cerebral fluid.

### Parenteral versus enteral fluids for infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis: the PREFER shared decision-making prospective observational study protocol [^114DSmkJ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Incorporating shared decision-making (SDM) with children and families in hospitals was a top priority identified by patients, caregivers, and clinicians. Bronchiolitis, a common and costly reason for hospitalization in children, is an exemplar condition to study SDM in hospitals. Internationally, clinical practice guidelines differ when recommending intravenous (IV or parenteral) or nasogastric (NG or enteral) fluids for hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis who are unsafe to be fed orally. While evidence indicates that either IV or NG fluids are safe and effective, parent involvement in SDM in selecting IV or NG fluids is unknown. Our aim is to generate knowledge of SDM with parents in choosing between IV or NG fluids and the benefits and harms of these two treatment options for hospitalized children with bronchiolitis.

Method

This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study, including children aged < 12 months admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis requiring supplemental IV or NG fluids. The primary outcome will evaluate the extent of SDM in choosing IV versus NG fluids using the validated CollaboRATE tool. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of parents provided a choice of IV versus NG fluids; parent knowledge of fluid therapy; rate of fluids; length of hospital stay; and complications.

Discussion

This study will evaluate the extent of SDM in hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis who require IV or NG fluids and will evaluate both patient-centered and clinical outcomes that are relevant to clinical practice.

### Patients' choice, consent, and ethics in patient blood management [^116hbTZm]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

The goal of patient blood management (PBM) is to optimize clinical outcomes for individual patients by managing their blood as a precious and unique resource to be safeguarded and managed judiciously. A corollary to successful PBM is the minimization or avoidance of blood transfusion and stewardship of donated blood. The first is achieved by a multidisciplinary approach with personalized management plans shared and decided on with the patient or their substitute. It follows that the physician-patient relationship is an integral component of medical practice and the fundamental link between patient and doctor based on trust and honest communication. Central to PBM is accurate and timely diagnosis based on sound physiology and pathophysiology as the bedrock on which scientifically based medicine is founded. PBM in all disease contexts starts with the questions, "What is the status of the patient's blood?" "If there are specific abnormalities in the blood, how should they be managed?" and "If allogeneic blood transfusion is considered, is there no reasonable alternative therapy?" There are compelling scientific reasons to implement a nontransfusion default position when there is clinical uncertainty and questionable evidence of clinical efficacy for allogeneic blood transfusion due to known potential hazards. Patients must be informed of their diagnosis, the nature, severity and prognosis of the disease, and treatment options along with risks and benefits. They should be involved in decision-making regarding their management. However, as part of this process, there are multifaceted medical, legal, ethical, and economic issues, encompassing shared decision-making, patient choice, and informed consent. Furthermore, variability in patient circumstances and preferences, the complexity of medical science, and the workings of health care systems in which consent takes place can be bewildering, not only for the patient but also for clinicians obtaining consent. Adding "patient" to the concept of blood management differentiates it from "donor" blood management to avoid confusion and the perception that PBM is a specific medical intervention. Personalized PBM is tailoring the PBM to the specific characteristics of each patient. With this approach, there should be no difficulty addressing the informed consent and ethical aspects of PBM. Patients can usually be reassured that there is nothing out of order with their blood, in which case the focus of PBM is to keep it that way. In some circumstances, a hematologist may be involved as a patient's blood advocate when abnormalities require expert involvement while the primary disease is being managed.

### Ebola virus as a sexually transmitted infection [^114ng6Tr]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The ongoing Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa is a major global health challenge. The main mode of transmission is through contact with bodily fluids and skin of those infected or who have died. This review was undertaken to consider the evidence for transmission by contact with bodily fluids occurring through sexual activity.

Recent Findings

No cases in the previous 20 outbreaks or the current outbreak in West Africa have been shown to be sexually transmitted, although other types of viral haemorrhagic fever have had sexual transmission implicated. Ebola virus is found in sites and fluids associated with sexual activity but this occurs at different stages of the disease. Persistence in the convalescent period occurs in rectum, vagina and semen, with persistence in semen being longest of up to at least 101 days. Recommendations based on this data are that those recovering from Ebola virus disease should abstain from all sexual intercourse, or if this is not possible, use condoms, for 3 months after the onset of symptoms.

Summary

There is theoretical plausibility for sexual transmission of Ebola virus but there has been no evidence of this occurring. Further research is needed to consider if sexual activity contributes to the epidemic in order to inform individuals with regard to avoiding acquisition or transmission by those recovering from Ebola virus disease.

### Antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after sexual, injection drug use, or other nonoccupational exposure to HIV recommendations, United States, 2025 [^115R4PFe]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). High credibility.

HIV nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) indications — HIV nPEP is indicated to reduce the risk for acquiring HIV from an exposure that presents a substantial risk for HIV acquisition. nPEP is recommended when an exposure has occurred within the past 72 hours that presents a substantial risk for HIV transmission and the source has HIV without sustained viral suppression or their viral suppression information is not known (good practice statement, existing recommendation). nPEP may be considered when an exposure has occurred within the past 72 hours that presents a substantial risk for HIV transmission, but it is not known whether the source has HIV (good practice statement, existing recommendation). nPEP is not recommended if the exposure presents no substantial risk for HIV transmission (good practice statement, existing recommendation). nPEP should be stopped if at any point during the course the source is found to not have HIV (good practice statement, existing recommendation). Assessing the likelihood of HIV acquisition associated with an exposure requires consideration of multiple factors, including whether the source has HIV, the source's level of viremia, the body fluid involved in the exposure, the exposure site, presence of barriers to body fluid exposure, and whether the exposed person is on PrEP.

### Human protein interaction networks of ancestral and variant SARS-CoV-2 in organ-specific cells and bodily fluids [^116JnKjg]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Among SARS-CoV-2 binding partners, we identified significant enrichment (FDR ≤ 5e −2) of shared bioprocesses across human cell lines derived from various organs and immune system (Fig. 1h; Supplementary Data 4). These include host processes such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi vesicle transport, mRNA translation, and the unfolded protein response, which SARS-CoV-2 exploits for infection –. Comparing SARS-CoV-2 host interaction partners with other pathogens revealed the greatest similarity with SARS-CoV-1 (SCoV1; Fig. 1i; Supplementary Data 5), reflecting their clinical and genetic similarities. SARS-CoV-2 also shared more PPIs with SCoV1 than with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV; Fig. 1j). Notably, human proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 NSP7/13 and ORF7A/9B/9 C are also targeted by SCoV1, similar to the shared interactors between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 NSP2/4/7/8 (Supplementary Fig. 1k), highlighting these PPIs as potential antiviral targets. Together, these findings confirm that our AP-MS network, derived from diverse organ and immune cell lines, significantly expands the number of reported PPIs, offering avenues for therapeutic development.

Percutaneous and contact exposure — risk factors and prevention: Exposure to bloodborne pathogens typically occurs from percutaneous exposure to contaminated sharps, including lancets, needles, scalpels, and broken glass from capillary or test tubes, and infection risk is increased after percutaneous exposures to larger blood volumes such as deeper injuries, hollow-bore needles, direct cannulation of an artery or vein, or visible blood on the injuring device. Needlestick injuries are a common mode of percutaneous exposure, and healthcare workers should avoid practices known to increase risk for needlestick injuries, including recapping or using needles to transfer a bodily fluid between containers; safety-engineered medical devices and biosafety equipment might not be available. Mucous membrane exposure can also result in risk of transmission, whereas skin exposures are only considered a risk if skin integrity is compromised; higher circulating viral load in the source patient is also thought to increase transmission risk, which can be of particular concern in resource-poor settings.

### Current knowledge of COVID-19 and infection prevention and control strategies in healthcare settings: a global analysis [^113mhqf5]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Exposures that may facilitate risk of infection

The incubation period of COVID-19 is 2–14 days. Backer et alestimated the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6–7.7). The available findings showed that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may occur before and after symptom onset. Zou et alfound modest viral loads on nasal and throat swabs early in the illness, with viral loads peaking ~5 days after symptom onset. The virus can be detected until 15 days from onset of illness and can be transmitted throughout the illness episode. Sharing a toilet in healthcare settings can also be a source of infection; the SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in toilet bowls and sinks. Inappropriate selection of PPE may also put HCPs at risk of infection. Exposure to AGPs was identified as a risk factor for acquiring COVID-19, but the others drivers of transmission and the exact mode of transmission remain uncertain. For example, blood, saliva, and stool, of COVID-19 patients have been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but the precise role these body fluids play in disease transmission in healthcare settings and the ways in which they may be transferred remain uncertain.

Occupational risk

As of April 8, 2020, > 22,000 HCPs have been infected with COVID-19 in 55 countries.HCPs comprise ~11% of all reported COVID-19 cases in Italy,13.6% in Spain,~14% in the United Kingdom, and 3.8% in China. One of the largest known outbreaks of hospital-acquired COVID-19 was reported in China among 17 (12.3%) of 138 patients and 40 (29%) of 138 HCPs in 1 hospital. Of the infected HCPs, 77.5% worked in general wards, 17.5% worked in the emergency department, and 5% worked in intensive care units. Li et alreported that no cases of COVID-19 occurred in HCPs before January 1, 2020. From January 1 to 11, 7 (3%) of 248 HCPs were infected, and from January 12 to 22, 7% (8/122) HCPs were infected, showing that healthcare-associated infections were increasing. A more recent study in a hospital in the United Kingdom showed ongoing transmission of COVID-19 among HCPs.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^114z5UWs]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Appendix B. Glossary — Definitions include HIV planning group (an official organization or committee that develops, advocates for, and implements a comprehensive plan for HIV prevention and care for a given jurisdiction) and HIV prevention counseling (an interactive process between client or patient and counselor aimed at reducing sexual, drug-use, and reproductive behaviors that pose a risk of HIV transmission or acquisition). HIV superinfection is the acquisition of another HIV strain that may reduce the effectiveness of HIV treatment if new, drug-resistant HIV strains are acquired. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that causes immune deficiency and may eventually lead to AIDS, especially if appropriate treatment is not used. Incidence is the number of new cases of a disease diagnosed in a defined population in a specified period, often a year. Index patient refers to a person with diagnosed HIV or STD and whose diagnosis prompts an investigation to identify other persons (known as partners) who may have become infected through sexual contact or exposure to blood or other body fluids of the index patient, and Indicator refers to a measure used to determine implementation over time of prevention or care services and the functions, processes, or outcomes of those services. Informed consent is communication between a person and a provider of prevention, testing, treatment or other health services, such as starting HIV treatment or referral to mental health services, and it includes an oral or written summary of 1) the risks and benefits of the service, 2) documentation of services rendered and their outcomes, 3) the opportunity to ask questions, and 4) reassurance that declining a service will not result in denial of other clinical or nonclinical services. Insertive anal sex, insertive fellatio, and insertive vaginal sex are defined as the practice of inserting one's penis into a partner's anus, mouth, or vagina, respectively. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection is an in vitro fertilization procedure in which specially prepared ("washed") sperm of a man with HIV is injected directly into an egg retrieved from an ovarian follicle to achieve fertilization while minimizing the risk of HIV transmission to the female partner. Linkage facilitator describes an individual who assists persons with HIV to access HIV medical care and other medical and social services through active methods, and Linkage to care is the process of helping persons with HIV to obtain HIV medical care and prevention or social services through active methods (e.g., appointment scheduling, reminders, transportation to appointments).

### Human protein interaction networks of ancestral and variant SARS-CoV-2 in organ-specific cells and bodily fluids [^116AjGQp]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Correlated profiles of stably associated components can predict functional links between proteins. We therefore calculated correlations among all SARS-CoV-2 viral protein pairs based on their interactions with human proteins in the merged network, identifying several pairs with positively correlated profiles. Notably, strong correlations (average r = 0.6) were observed, with high similarity in the host proteins shared between NSP5/11/12/15 and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, between NSP4/6 and ORF7A (average r = 0.7), and between NSP7/10, S and ORF9C (average r = 0.7; Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Data 21). These correlations align with intraviral PPIs of SARS-CoV-2 identified through compartmentalization-aided interaction screening in cellsand Y2Hmethods. Analysis of host proteins interacting with these correlated viral protein pairs revealed significant enrichment (FDR ≤ 5e −2) in bioprocesses like glycolysis, respiration, and ER-to-Golgi vesicle transport, among others (Fig. 4c). These findings highlight that many SARS-CoV-2 proteins target overlapping human proteins or those involved in shared bioprocesses.

### Updated US public health service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to human immunodeficiency virus and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis [^116AiG57]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Follow-up of exposed health care personnel (HCP) — importance and 72-hour evaluation are emphasized as follows: HCP who have experienced occupational exposure to HIV should receive follow-up counseling, postexposure testing, and medical evaluation regardless of whether they take PEP. Greater emphasis is placed upon the importance of follow-up of HCP on HIV PEP within 72 hours of exposure. Careful attention to follow-up evaluation within 72 hours of exposure can 1) provide another opportunity to ask questions and ensure understanding of risks for infection and the risks and benefits of PEP, 2) ensure that continued treatment with PEP is indicated, 3) increase adherence to HIV PEP regimens, 4) manage associated symptoms and side-effects more effectively, 5) provide an early opportunity for ancillary medications or regimen changes, 6) improve detection of serious adverse effects, and 7) improve the likelihood of follow-up serologic testing for a larger proportion of exposed personnel to detect infection. Closer follow-up should in turn reassure HCP who become anxious after these events, and the psychological impact of needlesticks or exposure to blood or body fluid should not be underestimated for HCP.

### Human protein interaction networks of ancestral and variant SARS-CoV-2 in organ-specific cells and bodily fluids [^113WWKuc]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Although human IFIT proteins share 40–56% sequence identity (Supplementary Fig. 5j), IFIT5 and its orthologs exhibit high similarity (72–99%; Supplementary Fig. 5k), indicating a shared ancestral gene. Molecular docking using AlphaFold structures of ISG15 and IFIT5 with the NSP3 crystal structure identified three conserved lysine residues (K160, K197, K206) on IFIT5 at the interaction interface with ISG15 and NSP3 (Fig. 6j). This supports the IFIT5-ISG15-NSP3 association and ISG15's ability to conjugate lysines through ISGylation. To confirm these lysines at IFIT5-ISG15 interface as ISGylation sites, we generated three single-site IFIT5 mutants by substituting lysine residues with arginine (K160R, K197R, K206R). Mutants VA-IFIT5 K197R and K206R showed reduced ISGylation with or without NSP3, while K160R exhibited wild-type IFIT5 ISGylation levels, but only in response to NSP3 (Fig. 6 k-1), indicating K197 and K206 as key ISGylation sites on IFIT5. Notably, these IFIT5 mutants impacted SARS-CoV-2 infection, affecting viral replication and titers in supernatants and lysates in CRISPR IFIT5 knockout and CRISPR-resistant IFIT5 single-site mutants (K197R, K206R) in IFIT5 knockouts at 4, 8, and 12 h post-infection in A549-AT cells. However, these effects were not seen in IFIT5 knockout cells complemented with wild-type CRISPR-resistant IFIT5 (Supplementary Fig. 5l, m).

### Disrupted breath, songlines of breathlessness: an interdisciplinary response [^112htEvs]. Medical Humanities (2019). Medium credibility.

Implications for science humanities

In their critical imagining of what medical humanities could look like, Fitzgerald and Callard (2016) ask the question, what if disease were not a bodily fact that needed finer interpretation, but a way of describing a relation between a body, a history and an environment? 47 In contrast to other interdisciplinary projects who may come together to share experiential understandings of working practice, for the Life of Breath project, it is the object of study itself, breathlessness, which embodies multiple disciplines and constructs, providing a "shared frame of reference" for the multiple disciplines which make up the Life of Breath team to coalesce. 48 From the perspective of 'science humanities', Willis (2017) is uneasy with the Life of Breath project's utilitarian approach to knowledge-making, one that is aimed ultimately at improving the treatment and management of breathlessness. Willis views the interests of medical sciences as a type of "disciplinary restriction (which) can often undermine attempts at new methodologies which would offer a richer ecology of knowledge". 49 Were the objective of the Life of Breath project to merely inform greater popular health literacy (eg, to educate and promote medical terminologies), 50 we may have been guilty of our work being in service to a clinical disciplinary restriction. However, our aim is more ambitious, to acknowledge variations in language and differences in cultures of breathlessness as well as the histories of testimonial injustice in lung health; and then with interdisciplinary insights from the medical humanities and health sciences increase societal awareness and visibility of what breathlessness means, the variability in how it is expressed and how better to provide effective care. 51

Social scientists share this investment in specificity with clinicians, who likewise take heed of the specificities of this singular patient in the here and now. But while clinicians in intensive care units prioritise such variables as oxygen saturation and blood levels of bradykinin, social scientists investigate such issues as overburdening due to double duties, suffering from loneliness, increases in domestic violence and deepening inequalities due to lack of schooling.

Hemodialysis hepatitis C virus (HCV) control — dedicated dialysis machines — internal transmission through modern single-pass machines "has not been demonstrated", and systematic reviews have "conclusively excluded transmission via the internal dialysis pathway", with environmental surfaces more likely contributors. Outbreak data show that "Receiving dialysis next, rather than sharing the same dialysis machine with, an HCV-infected patient has been found to be a risk factor for HCV acquisition", and phylogenetic investigations document transmission "independent of the machine used". Nosocomial spread occurred "despite the existence of a policy of dedicated machines", supporting that contamination of machine components "cannot be the sole contributor to transmission" and "may have little to no role in HCV spread", and that using dedicated machines may reduce staff attention to body fluid precautions.

### Human protein interaction networks of ancestral and variant SARS-CoV-2 in organ-specific cells and bodily fluids [^111kZAL1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

A small subset (7%, 48 of 668) of host proteins interacting with all five SARS-CoV-2 S strains was primarily found in HULEC-5a lung endothelial cells (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 2d). These proteins were enriched (FDR ≤ 5e −2) in functions related to the mitochondrial respiratory chain, cytokine production, and cytoskeleton organization (Supplementary Fig. 2e), suggesting they are critical host 'hub' proteins potentially exploited by the virus for replication, transmission, and immune evasion. A sizable portion (40%, 267 of 668) of PPIs was both variant- and cell type-specific, with variability observed in shared PPIs across variants (Supplementary Fig. 2f). Inactivated THP-1 M0 macrophages and HEK293 cells showed more shared interactions among variants, while HULEC-5a, Caco-2, and Huh-7 cells exhibited fewer (Supplementary Fig. 2g). Notably, over three-fourths (79%, 526 of 668) of interactions between ancestral or variant S proteins and host factors across various human cell lines (Fig. 2i; Supplementary Data 12) were previously unreported, suggesting cell type-specific PPIs may underlie these differences.

### Parental decision-making preferences in neonatal intensive care [^112Socxa]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore how characteristics of medical decisions influence parents' preferences for control over decisions for their seriously ill infants.

Study Design

In qualitative interviews, parents of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were asked to consider all medical decisions they could recall, and were prompted with decisions commonly encountered in the NICU. For each decision, parents were asked detailed questions about who made each decision, whom they would have preferred to make the decision, and why. Using standard qualitative methods, responses were coded and organized such that decision-level characteristics could be analyzed according to preferred decision-making role.

Results

Parents identified 2 factors that were associated with a preference to delegate decisions to the medical team (high degree of urgency, high level of required medical expertise) and 4 factors associated with a preference to retain parental control (high perceived risk, high personal experience with the decision, involvement of foreign bodily fluids, and similarity to decisions that they perceived as part of the normal parental role).

Conclusions

Characteristics of decisions influence preferences for control over medical decisions among parents of patients in the NICU. These insights may guide improvements in physician-parent communication and consent.

### Experiences and perspectives of dietary management among patients on hemodialysis: an interview study [^115bmi5b]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Diet and fluid management can reduce mortality, serious comorbidities, and debilitating symptoms in patients on hemodialysis, but restrictions may also be a major burden, and nonadherence remains high. We aimed to describe the perspectives and experiences of patients on hemodialysis regarding their dietary management to understand both facilitators and barriers to adherence and to identify strategies to improve care.

Design and Methods

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 35 people on maintenance hemodialysis from six dialysis units in New South Wales, Australia. Transcripts were thematically analyzed using principles of grounded theory.

Results

We identified 5 major themes. Two themes reflect barriers to dietary change: exacerbating disruption (adding to treatment burden, contradicting healthy eating, confused by fragmented advice, conflicting cultural norms, changing appetite and palate, isolation from family and friends) and losing control (crises derailing discipline, frustrated by failure, combating bodily need for hydration). Three themes represent enablers for dietary change: attaining health benefits (avoiding medical catastrophes, enhancing benefits of dialysis, alleviating and managing symptoms, improving health), achieving treatment goals (building familiarity and acceptance, flexibility and moderation, taking personal responsibility), and succeeding withsupport (leaning on family for strength, trusting expert guidance, empowered with flexible and practical advice, relying on reminders and cues, motivation through shared experience).

Conclusions

Patients on hemodialysis believe dietary control helps to reduce symptom burden and enhance general health and well-being, but competing medical and social issues coupled with contradictory and/or irrelevant dietary advice prevents them from implementing diet and fluid restrictions. Interventions involving collaborative multidisciplinary care including clinicians with dietetic expertise, and consistent information that addresses cultural and personal circumstances, may support adherence to dietary recommendations and improve outcomes.

### Approach to the febrile infant [^115aTAZK]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Evaluation and management of the febrile infant has long been an area of variability. Recent guidelines were released by the American Academy of Pediatrics in August 2021 to help provide evidence-based clinical guidelines to decrease variability and improve outcomes.1 These guidelines largely focus on management and treatment guidelines for 3 age groups: 8 to 21 days, 22 to 28 days, and 29 to 60 days. The inclusion criteria for these guidelines are previously healthy, term infants born at 37 weeks gestation or later, with a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher. The most significant changes to historical practice are in the 22- to 28-day and 29- to 60-day age groups. If initial laboratory work is reassuring, patients may not need cerebrospinal fluid studies, and patients may be monitored at home or at the hospital using shared decision-making with the family.

Conceptual challenges to data sharing in IO

Ethical considerations: patient privacy and 'big data' challenges

Even though most informed consent processes approved by ethics committees have embedded clauses allowing the future nonprofit use of deidentified data, patients' willingness to share their de-identified data does come with specific requirements in order to protect their privacy, choices, and needs for information regarding the use of their data. Efforts to balance patients' right to data protection/confidentiality against the need to promote medical science advances through clinical research has been a topic of significant debate in recent years. To ensure ethical and regulatory compliance and the sustainability and success of data sharing initiatives in cancer research, appropriate legislation and guidelines need to be implemented. Joint multi-stakeholder agreements and efforts need to be pursued to foster cultural (ie, conceptual) and technological (ie, practical) adaptation or discovery-led changes that will enable patients' preferences regarding sharing of their own health data to be respected.

In the US, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a federal law that governs the use and disclosure of personal health information by covered entities, defined as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers. The general rule is that personal health information cannot be disclosed without the patient's authorization. Three primary measures protect patient privacy and confidentiality: (1) informed consent, (2) study review and approval by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and Research Ethics Committees (RECs), and (3) data use limited to deidentified information.

The intent behind informed consent regulations is to ensure that, before providing their consent, participants are fully aware of the study they are volunteering for, and that they have been given a clear and accurate account of the potential risks and expected benefits of the study. In relation to data sharing, it is important that the informed consent form includes appropriate language explaining the information collected including data generated from integrative genetic/genomic assays on the patients' specimens and how this data will be stored and used, including the potential for being shared outside the boundaries of the specific study in which they were collected, such as for integrative meta-analyses.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^111Hkdt2]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Box 7-C — important topics when informing persons with HIV about how to prevent transmission of HIV to others include counseling on substance use and sharing drug-injection equipment, covering the health benefits of abstaining from or reducing substance use; the relation between use of some recreational drugs and higher risk sexual practices (e.g., methamphetamines); risk of transmitting HIV when sharing drug-injection equipment; and benefits of completing substance use treatment (that may include relapse prevention and opioid substitution programs). Methods to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV if drug injection continues include reducing the number of drug-injection partners, using new, sterile equipment from reliable sources (pharmacies, SSPs), using sterile needles, syringes, fluids, cookers, and cotton each time to prepare and inject drugs, using sterile water (preferable) or fresh tap water when preparing drugs, never sharing or reusing drug-injection or preparation equipment, cleaning injection sites with alcohol swabs before injection, and disposing needles and syringes in safe places after each use.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 8 travel for work and other reasons [^116MoUQf]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

International travel to deliver health care in resource-limited settings — healthcare worker risks include exposure to infectious disease threats through interactions with patients, contact with the healthcare environment, or handling clinical specimens, and any type of healthcare worker working in clinical areas or handling specimens can be at risk. Infectious agents can be spread through contact with blood, bodily fluids, respiratory secretions, or contaminated materials or surfaces, and exposures can occur via contact, percutaneous, or inhalation routes. Healthcare workers abroad can be at risk for exposure to patients with emerging, highly pathogenic, or uncommon infectious diseases including Ebola disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. Additional risks include challenging practice conditions that can prevent adherence to Standard Precautions, greater prevalence of transmissible infections such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, tuberculosis, and antimicrobial-resistant pathogens with potentially increased transmission risk from untreated source patients, less stringent safety regulations or infection prevention and control standards, and unfamiliar safety risks, practice conditions, equipment, or procedures.

nPEP Follow-Up and Counseling

Follow-up care is necessary for patients prescribed nPEP medications to monitor for adverse effects, follow up laboratory testing, support adherence, and optimize HIV prevention strategies (e.g. transitioning to PrEP when indicated). Before the person leaves the initial nPEP encounter, a plan for the recommended follow-up visits and testing should be in place, with appropriate referrals and resources provided. The health care professional who provided or prescribed the nPEP medications, or a support staff member, should follow up with the person within 24 hours to confirm access to the medications and assess tolerability and adherence. If the person does not tolerate the recommended regimen, the health care professional should consider switching to an alternative regimen to improve continuation of treatment, and consultation might be useful to troubleshoot issues with the initial regimen. Local resources are available in many places, and nationally the NCCC PEPline (888-448-4911 or) is available.

Health care professionals providing nPEP services should be aware that unusual or severe toxicities from ARV medications can be reported to the manufacturer or the FDA (or 1-800-FDA-1088 [1-800-332-1088]). If nPEP is prescribed to a woman who is pregnant at the time of exposure or becomes pregnant while taking nPEP, health care professionals can contribute clinical information into the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry.

Clinical considerations include providing counseling to persons staring nPEP (see Clinical Considerations when Starting nPEP). Topics to cover include ways to reduce the risk for transmitting HIV if acquired during the nPEP period (e.g. avoiding condomless sex, avoiding sharing drug injection equipment, and not donating blood or tissues until the guideline criteria for donation have been met).

Transitioning to PrEP After PEP

Persons who receive nPEP might have continuing exposures that put them at ongoing risk for acquiring HIV. These persons might benefit from HIV PrEP to reduce their risk for acquiring HIV infection. When taken as prescribed, PrEP can reduce the risk for acquiring HIV from sex by about 99% and from injection drug use by at least 74% (,–).

Recommendation for Transitioning to PrEP After PEP

An immediate transition from nPEP to PrEP, including HIV testing at the completion of the nPEP regimen with a prompt transition to a recommended PrEP regimen, might be beneficial for persons with anticipated repeat or ongoing potential HIV exposures (good practice statement, existing recommendation).

Obtaining informed consent

In order to obtain informed consent, investigators must present all pertinent information to patients then assess their understanding and allow time for questions. Information orally presented will also be available to patients on the written document. When reviewing this information with patients, it is important to explain the study in layman's terms and avoid confusing patients with complex medical or scientific jargon by using language aimed at an 8th grade reading level. In order to provide informed consent, the patient must have medical decision-making capacity, which means they can demonstrate understanding of the risks and benefits, appreciate consequences of decision, show clear reasoning behind decisions, and effectively communicate their wishes. A good method to assess understanding is to have patients explain the information using their own words and provide reasoning behind their decision, also known as teach back or say back method. The consent form must provide comprehensive study explanation, study approval, methods, techniques, procedures, possibility of sample use in future studies, time commitment, travel requirements, costs, number of appointments, number of tubes of blood required (listed in mL) and duration of the project.

All consent forms should include the ability to withdraw from the study at any time and without any consequences. If patients withdraw from the study, they should then be given the opportunity to also withdraw permission to use samples that were already collected. For some studies, researchers may have to obtain written consent on a yearly basis. Additionally, if there are new developments in risks, benefits, or alternative options then researchers are required to provide this additional information to participants. After assessing the new information, patients are then given the choice to continue onwards with the study or withdraw. A sample consent form can be viewed in online supplement section 3.

Obtaining informed consent for national or international collaborations

Biomarker research often includes working together with national and/or international groups to expand the data available. In these situations, participant consent forms should clearly request permission for use of biologic samples and data to be shared with the other organizations. Agreement to storing their samples in a biobank for any future research should also be included. Participant consent forms must be specific on the different types of specimens to be collected and shared with other institutions (ie, blood — red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), serum, plasma, or whole blood).

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) — prevalence, transmission, and facility guidance support entry with hygiene precautions: CMV is common, and "Most person-to-person transmission of CMV is thought to occur via exposure to infected secretions such as saliva or urine". Shedding from young children is frequent; "On average, 30%-40% of childcare attendees who are 1–3 years of age are excreting CMV. In some studies, as many as 70% of children excrete the virus". Accordingly, "Because CMV is so prevalent in the population and children shed the virus without symptoms, those with known CMV do not need to be excluded from entering the family-centered residential facility", and "Allow individuals with current or past CMV infection to enter the family-centered residential facility". Prevention focuses on hand and body-fluid precautions: "Measures to prevent CMV transmission include frequent handwashing or use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, avoiding contact with body fluids, and cleaning hands whenever exposed to body fluids", and education to "avoid sharing unwashed cups and utensils", to practice hygiene "especially after handling diapers and touching body fluids like saliva and nasal secretions", and to "Inform pregnant people about the risk of CMV infection and educate them about ways to prevent infection".

German S3 guidelines on volume therapy in adults

Recently the high-quality evidence-based S3 guidelines on volume therapy in adults have been published. The German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI) masterminded this interdisciplinary project in collaboration with 13 German scientific societies. Together, these guidelines represent the consensus among general and visceral surgeons, gynaecologists and obstetricians, urologists, internal medicine physicians and cardiologists, intensive care, neurointensive care and emergency physicians, orthopaedic and trauma surgeons, cardiothoracic and vascular surgeons, as well as nurse scientists. Eventual dissent is clearly marked in the guidelines. The S3 guidelines are currently only available in German but the translation into English is ongoing.

Statements are in line with the ESA guidelines. Patient's history assessment and repeated clinical inspection of the actual volume status are recommended (e.g. by assessing turgor of the skin, mucosa) (grade of recommendation (GoR): A). Adjunctive laboratory parameters such as ScvO 2, lactate, base excess and haematocrit should be considered (GoR: A). CVP is inadequate for detecting volume deficits in perioperative and critically ill patients (GoR: A). The German Sepsis Society disagreed with this recommendation and with a number of further recommendations which are not in line with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. The S3 guidelines propose the use of flow-based and/or dynamic preload parameters for guiding volume therapy. In high-risk patients — for example, older patients with hip-near fracture, major abdominal surgery or cardiovascular comorbidities compromising the capability for haemodynamic compensation — volume monitoring should be performed throughout major procedures (GoR: 0). Implementation of flow-based parameters into predefined management algorithms is recommended (GoR: B). Fluid challenges and/or the leg-raising test (autotransfusion) should be performed (GoR: B). If possible, volume status and responsiveness to the fluid challenge should be assessed by cardiac output monitoring or dynamic preload monitoring (GoR: B). Only initial fluid responsiveness could be roughly appreciated by changes in mean arterial pressure (GoR: 0). In intensive care patients, the S3 guidelines suggest monitoring means of intrathoracic blood volume, Doppler, B-mode and/or transthoracic echocardiography (GoR: 0). In haemodynamic instability (of suspected cardiac origin), monitoring using echocardiography is suggested (GoR: A). Echocardiography is also suggested for detecting interstitial oedema and extravasation (e.g. in the pleura, abdomen, intestine). These signs should be used as stop signals for further volume therapy.

### Revised recommendations for HIV testing of adults, adolescents, and pregnant women in health-care settings [^111YZKPn]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2006). Medium credibility.

Repeat screening — adults and adolescents: Health-care providers should subsequently test all persons likely to be at high risk for HIV at least annually, noting that persons likely to be at high risk include injection-drug users and their sex partners, persons who exchange sex for money or drugs, sex partners of HIV-infected persons, and MSM or heterosexual persons who themselves or whose sex partners have had more than one sex partner since their most recent HIV test. Health-care providers should encourage patients and their prospective sex partners to be tested before initiating a new sexual relationship, and repeat screening of persons not likely to be at high risk for HIV should be performed on the basis of clinical judgment. Unless recent HIV test results are immediately available, any person whose blood or body fluid is the source of an occupational exposure for a health-care provider should be informed of the incident and tested for HIV infection at the time the exposure occurs.

### Assessment of the risk of Ebola virus transmission from bodily fluids and fomites [^116Bc7Xj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Although Ebola virus (EBOV) is transmitted by unprotected physical contact with infected persons, few data exist on which specific bodily fluids are infected or on the risk of fomite transmission. Therefore, we tested various clinical specimens from 26 laboratory-confirmed cases of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, as well as environmental specimens collected from an isolation ward, for the presence of EBOV. Virus was detected by culture and/or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in 16 of 54 clinical specimens (including saliva, stool, semen, breast milk, tears, nasal blood, and a skin swab) and in 2 of 33 environmental specimens. We conclude that EBOV is shed in a wide variety of bodily fluids during the acute period of illness but that the risk of transmission from fomites in an isolation ward and from convalescent patients is low when currently recommended infection control guidelines for the viral hemorrhagic fevers are followed.

HIV nPEP Indications

HIV nPEP is indicated to reduce the risk for acquiring HIV from an exposure that presents a substantial risk for HIV acquisition. Assessing the likelihood of HIV acquisition associated with an exposure requires consideration of multiple factors, including whether the source has HIV, the source's level of viremia, the body fluid involved in the exposure, the exposure site, presence of barriers to body fluid exposure, and whether the exposed person is on PrEP.

Recommendations for HIV nPEP Indications

nPEP is recommended when an exposure has occurred within the past 72 hours that presents a substantial risk for HIV transmission and the source has HIV without sustained viral suppression or their viral suppression information is not known (good practice statement, existing recommendation).
A case-by-case determination is required when an exposure has occurred within the past 72 hours that presents a substantial risk for HIV transmission, but it is not known whether the source has HIV (good practice statement, existing recommendation).
nPEP is not recommended if the exposure presents no substantial risk for HIV transmission (good practice statement, existing recommendation).
nPEP should be stopped if at any point during the course the source is found to not have HIV (good practice statement, existing recommendation).

Rationale for HIV nPEP Indications

Additional information about specific exposure scenarios and resources to assist with individual determinations is available (Table 1) (Appendix A). Decision algorithms are available to provide context for the risk for HIV acquisition associated with various exposures (Table 2) (Figures 2, 3, and 4). Expert consultation is available to assist health care professionals with assessing the HIV acquisition risk associated with different types of HIV exposure or with other questions associated with providing nPEP. Health care professionals can consult the NCCC at 888-448-4911 or.

### Intravenous fluids: should we go with the flow? [^117XW65R]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Societal perspective

After the statement from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is less prescribed Europe-wide because of medico-legal considerations. The EMA supported us to think twice before infusing any fluid intravenously and to acknowledge that fluids are drugs. Interestingly, other colloids are also increasingly being avoided although the evidence for safety problems for albumin or gelatin is scarce. In the statement from the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures — Human (CMDh), healthcare professionals are informed to consider that 'HES solutions should only be used for the treatment of hypovolaemia due to blood loss when crystalloids alone are not considered sufficient'.

With this article the authorities reinforce applying individualized medicine and using, for example, preload monitoring to assess hypovolaemia. This is a step forward from conventional pressure-based management strategies. Interestingly, blood loss is defined as a prerequisite for colloidal HES infusion; replacement of extracellular water losses is clearly not listed as an indication for a colloidal infusion. The wording in this article leaves room for individual decision-making because the lack of efficacy of crystalloids does not need to be proven in the individual patient before choosing a more potent colloid, but only anticipated by the attending clinician.

'HES solutions should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time. Treatment should be guided by continuous haemodynamic monitoring so that the infusion is stopped as soon as appropriate haemodynamic goals have been achieved'.
The CMDh group requires clinicians to monitor the haemodynamic status continuously, however, without defining the appropriate methodology. From a practical viewpoint, and extrapolated from the ESA and S3 guidelines, appropriate haemodynamic monitoring will most probably not be restricted to conventional pressure-oriented monitoring but will comprise volumetric preload testing. The CMDh statement reminds us about a general principle in pharmacotherapy: repeatedly reconsider the indication and avoid overdosing. The therapeutic target is to achieve normovolaemia, not infusing beyond. The CMDh statement also suggests the use of protocols with predefined triggers for infusion and as stop signals for further infusion. Thereby, the authorities encourage a personalized low-HES volume resuscitation technique. Contraindications against the use of HES, such as in sepsis and burn, are clearly listed in the EMA resolution.

Legal and ethical considerations

For Mimic-IV, the collection of patient information and creation of the research was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who granted a waiver of informed consent and approved the data sharing initiative.

For AmsterdamUMCdb, an internal team carried out a data privacy impact assessment and an external team performed an audit. The external team was led by a member of the privacy expert group at the Netherlands Federation of UMCs. The Regional Medical Ethics Committee confirmed that the creation of AmsterdamUMCdb was not eligible for their assessment as no specific research question was involved. The Ethics in Intensive Care Medicine group provided external ethics review and appraisal.

Both datasets were shared by the data owners for research purposes upon request and under the supervision of a practicing intensive care physician (Dr. Ingobert Wenningmann) in AmsterdamUMCdb. No further ethical approval was required as no further data was used.

Definition of Sepsis

For SOFA-Score calculation and Sepsis-3 classification adhering to the latest Sepsis-3 criteria, we employed the OpenSep pipelinefor the MIMIC-IV dataset and the ricu R package for AmsterdamUMCdb. Patients with a SOFA-Score greater than or equal to 2 occurred within 48 h before or 24 h after a suspicion of infection (SOI) were classified as Sepsis patients. A suspicion of infection is defined as either the administration of antibiotics followed by sampling of bodily fluids for microbiological cultures within 24 h or sampling of bodily fluids for microbiological cultures followed by the administration of antibiotics within 72 h. The onset of Sepsis is the earlier event of sampling for microbiological cultures or the administration of antibiotics.

### A consolidated biovigilance system for blood, tissue and organs: one size does not fit all [^1144jmTY]. American Journal of Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Biovigilance systems to assess and analyze risks for disease transmission through the transfer of organs, tissue, cells and blood between people is part of administrative oversight and has impact upon clinical practice and policy. In 2009, a formal recommendation by the Public Health Service requested that Health and Human Services fund and support efforts to consolidate national biovigilance efforts. There are differences in the biovigilance issues involved in organ and tissue donation/transplantation. If disease avoidance is made the dominant principle guiding organ donor testing, an unintended consequence may be an increase in deaths on the waiting list. We propose that overall benefit for the organ transplant recipient, tempered by patient informed awareness of limited organ availability and assessment processes, should be the guiding principle of such a system.

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^117BNuBb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fluids are by far the most commonly administered intravenous treatment in patient care. During critical illness, fluids are widely administered to maintain or increase cardiac output, thereby relieving overt tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia.

Main Text

Until recently, because of their excellent safety profile, fluids were not considered "medications". However, it is now understood that intravenous fluid should be viewed as drugs. They affect the cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal and immune systems. Fluid administration should therefore always be accompanied by careful consideration of the risk/benefit ratio, not only of the additional volume being administered but also of the effect of its composition on the physiology of the patient. Apart from the need to constantly assess fluid responsiveness, it is also important to periodically reconsider the type of fluid being administered and the evidence regarding the relationship between specific disease states and different fluid solutions.

Conclusions

The current review presents the state of the art regarding fluid solutions and presents the existing evidence on routine fluid management of critically ill patients in specific clinical settings (sepsis, Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome, major abdominal surgery, acute kidney injury and trauma).

Testing of source patients and health care personnel potentially exposed to hepatitis C virus — CDC guidance, United States, 2020

If the source patient is known or suspected to have recent behavior risks for HCV acquisition (e.g. injection drug use within the previous 4 months) or if risk cannot be reliably assessed, initial testing should include a NAT for HCV RNA. Persons with recently acquired acute infection typically have detectable HCV RNA levels as early as 1–2 weeks after exposure. Source patients determined to be positive for anti-HCV or HCV RNA should be reported to the state or local health department and referred for clinical management, as recommended. False-positive anti-HCV results are known to occur among populations at low risk.

HCV RNA testing is preferred for source patient testing. However, if anti-HCV testing is performed, a sufficient blood sample should be obtained for simultaneous or reflex (if anti-HCV positive) HCV RNA testing. This can minimize the need to redraw blood and reduce delays in establishing the status of the source patient. Testing of the source patient and baseline testing of the HCP might be either concurrent or sequential; follow-up testing of the HCP should be determined by the source patient's status.

If the source patient is HCV RNA or anti-HCV positive with unavailable NAT or if the HCV infection status is unknown (e.g. when the HCP sustains a percutaneous injury from a needle in the trash), follow-up testing of the exposed HCP should be initiated. Follow-up testing for an HCP exposed to blood or body fluids from a source patient who tests anti-HCV positive but HCV RNA negative is not recommended because this status can indicate a previously cleared or cured infection. However, instances might occur when follow-up testing is warranted (e.g. when specimen integrity concerns exist, including handling and storage conditions, that might have compromised test results) or if the HCP exhibits any clinical signs of HCV infection.

Lessons and limitations

During this process we learnt a lot about the natural evolution of QI projects. 1) For any change, it is important to identify key measures that you want to employ. Without this it is difficult to make comparisons and to show real change. As a group we spent a long time deciding on indication, co-morbidities, and management plans. 2) It is vital to involve interested parties early on in the process. The more engaged relevant groups are in embryonic formulations of a change, the better the change ultimately grows to be. It also has a greater likelihood of being successful. 3) During the process it is extremely important to have regular group gatherings to ensure all team members are aware of targets for the week/month/cycle. By doing this, a unified approach is facilitated that strengthens the message being spread across the Trust, and changes made.
