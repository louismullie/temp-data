## Question

What are the key components of a multidimensional approach to managing frail patients with ACS?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the key components of a multidimensional approach to managing frail patients with acute coronary syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the clinical problem and why frailty changes the calculus. Then, I should verify the overarching principles that guide decision-making. Next, I will examine each core component: geriatric assessment, risk stratification, invasive versus conservative strategy, pharmacotherapy, procedural execution, rehabilitation and follow-up, and systems of care. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight evidence gaps, making sure I double-check conflicting data and cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its implications. Frailty is common in older adults with ACS, with prevalence around 20–30% and rising, and it independently predicts higher mortality, bleeding, complications, and functional decline, while also being associated with underuse of guideline-directed therapies and invasive strategies, creating a risk–treatment paradox that complicates care decisions [^113DLV36] [^115ppPfi] [^115ZJ6p1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to anchor the approach in principles that reflect the evidence. The multidimensional model emphasizes individualized, patient-centered care integrating geriatric syndromes alongside cardiovascular risk, shared decision-making that incorporates goals of care beyond mortality, and a heart-team approach spanning cardiology, geriatrics, primary care, nursing, and social work to align treatment with what matters most to patients [^115ppPfi] [^113Z1mWz] [^1179EGxU].

> Next, I should review the geriatric assessment component. Wait, let me verify the domains and tools. A structured assessment should cover frailty (Fried phenotype, Clinical Frailty Scale, FRAIL scale, or Hospital Frailty Risk Score), cognition (MMSE, MoCA, AD8), functional status (ADLs/IADLs, SPPB), nutrition (MNA-SF), mood (PHQ-2/9), and social determinants, recognizing that these factors predict procedural risk, recovery, and quality of life and should be integrated into pre-procedural planning and consent [^1125CH4J] [^112gSCyB] [^115ppPfi].

> I will now examine cardiovascular risk stratification. I should confirm that standard ACS risk scores (GRACE, TIMI) remain necessary but insufficient in frail older adults, and that frailty adds incremental prognostic value beyond age and comorbidity, necessitating a composite view that weighs ischemic benefit against bleeding, cognitive, and functional risks in shared decision-making [^112sX7z8] [^116AUxsM] [^115ppPfi].

> Now, the pivotal decision: invasive versus conservative strategy. Let me think about the balance of evidence. Meta-analyses in older adults show that an early invasive strategy reduces recurrent MI and repeat revascularization but does not consistently reduce mortality and increases bleeding risk, with MOSCA-FRAIL showing no advantage for an invasive approach in frail NSTEMI and even early harm in the most frail, whereas observational causal-inference data suggest survival benefits from revascularization across frailty strata, highlighting heterogeneity and the need for careful selection and timing [^1115XY6t] [^112eSAMD] [^112M5tbq] [^116nM7Lr]. But wait, what if the patient is STEMI or in shock? I should confirm that STEMI generally warrants reperfusion when feasible, and in cardiogenic shock, frail patients still derive mortality benefit from revascularization and mechanical support, albeit with high early risk, reinforcing the need for rapid, coordinated decision-making and geriatric input [^116ejveJ] [^114rVMDC].

> Let me consider pharmacotherapy next. I need to ensure dosing is adjusted for renal function, weight, and bleeding risk, and that frailty-informed choices are made: prefer radial access, avoid routine GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, consider PPI gastroprotection, and tailor antiplatelet intensity, for example using clopidogrel rather than prasugrel/ticagrelor when bleeding risk is high, while still delivering guideline-directed medical therapy including aspirin, statin, beta-blocker, and RAAS inhibition when tolerated, with vigilant monitoring for hypotension, bradycardia, renal injury, and drug interactions [^114iVTdU] [^112mApaS] [^113sRaeB] [^115ppPfi].

> I should double-check procedural execution details. Radial access reduces bleeding and vascular complications and is preferred in frail patients when feasible, intracoronary imaging can optimize stent sizing in complex calcified lesions, and in multivessel disease a physiology-guided complete revascularization strategy reduces death/MI compared with culprit-only PCI, though in the oldest or most frail, a staged, culprit-first approach may mitigate risk while preserving benefit [^114iVTdU] [^116vGT7R] [^113Z1mWz].

> Next, I should review rehabilitation and longitudinal care. Cardiac rehabilitation should be offered to all eligible patients, with home-based or hybrid models to improve access and adherence in frail adults, and programs should incorporate resistance training, balance, and nutrition to address sarcopenia and frailty, while secondary prevention emphasizes lipid management, blood pressure control, diabetes care, and medication reconciliation with deprescribing to reduce polypharmacy and falls risk [^1162CgGa] [^111dFtLc] [^113HCeX7] [^115ppPfi].

> Hold on, I should verify the systems-of-care elements that reduce harm during transitions. Frail patients are at high risk for readmission, delirium, and functional decline; multicomponent discharge planning, medication reconciliation, early follow-up, and telehealth-enabled monitoring can reduce 30-day readmissions and improve quality of life, and advance care planning conversations should begin early to align interventions with goals of care and life expectancy [^117HGRAQ] [^115FpMNL] [^115ppPfi].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework without oversimplifying. For frail NSTEMI, if the patient has high ischemic risk features and acceptable frailty burden, an early invasive strategy with radial access and tailored antithrombotic therapy is reasonable; if frailty is severe (for example, CFS > 4) or there is advanced cognitive impairment or limited life expectancy, a conservative strategy with optimized medical therapy and close follow-up may be preferred, with the option to reassess if clinical status changes; for STEMI, favor primary PCI when not contraindicated, recognizing higher early risk but potential long-term benefit even in frail patients; for cardiogenic shock, prioritize revascularization and consider mechanical support in selected patients after discussing goals of care [^113eUGrP] [^112eSAMD] [^116ejveJ] [^113Z1mWz].

> I need to ensure I flag evidence gaps and future directions. There is a pressing need for larger RCTs enriched for frailty and multimorbidity, standardized frailty instruments integrated into ACS pathways, and development of decision aids that quantify trade-offs between survival, function, and quality of life; biomarkers and geriatric-specific risk models may refine selection, and pragmatic trials of prehabilitation, nutrition, and tele-rehabilitation could mitigate frailty and improve resilience to procedures and recovery [^113QBnoi] [^115ppPfi] [^113HCeX7].

> In summary, I should confirm that the multidimensional approach hinges on four pillars: comprehensive geriatric assessment to expose vulnerability, individualized risk–benefit analysis that incorporates frailty and patient goals, a heart-team process for shared decision-making, and coordinated longitudinal care with rehabilitation and systems supports; this strategy moves beyond age and comorbidity counts to deliver care that is both evidence-informed and aligned with what matters most to frail older adults facing ACS [^115ppPfi] [^113Z1mWz] [^1179EGxU].

A multidimensional approach to managing frail patients with ACS integrates **geriatric assessment** (frailty, cognition, function, nutrition, falls) [^1125CH4J] with **cardiovascular risk stratification** (GRACE, TIMI, ischemic/bleeding risk) [^112sX7z8] to guide individualized decisions [^115ppPfi]. It emphasizes **shared decision-making** to align care with patient goals, preferring radial access and tailored antithrombotic therapy to reduce bleeding [^114iVTdU] [^113sRaeB], and selecting conservative or invasive strategies based on frailty severity and life expectancy [^112eSAMD] [^1157fqzC]. Post-discharge, it prioritizes **home-based cardiac rehabilitation**, comprehensive geriatric follow-up, and coordinated care to improve function, quality of life, and survival [^1162CgGa] [^115FpMNL].

---

## Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA)

- **Frailty assessment**: Use validated tools (Fried, FRAIL, Clinical Frailty Scale) to quantify vulnerability and guide intensity of care [^112gSCyB] [^1125CHD8].

- **Cognitive and functional status**: Screen for dementia, delirium, and ADL/IADL limitations to inform consent, safety, and discharge planning [^1125CHD8].

- **Nutritional assessment**: Identify malnutrition/sarcopenia and intervene with protein intake and supplementation to support recovery [^114iVTdU].

- **Fall risk and mobility**: Evaluate gait, balance, and strength to prevent injuries and tailor rehabilitation [^1125CHD8].

---

## Cardiovascular risk stratification

Use **established scores** (GRACE, TIMI) to gauge ischemic risk and guide therapy intensity [^112sX7z8]. Assess bleeding risk with HAS-BLED and frailty-informed clinical judgment to balance antithrombotic intensity [^114iVTdU]. Integrate geriatric syndromes into decisions, as frailty independently worsens outcomes and modifies treatment benefit [^116AUxsM].

---

## Individualized decision-making and shared decision-making

Engage patients/families in **shared decision-making** to align choices with goals, preferences, and life expectancy [^1179EGxU]. Incorporate patient-centered outcomes (function, independence, quality of life) alongside traditional MACE endpoints [^1179EGxU]. For severely frail or limited-life-expectancy patients, prioritize symptom control, comfort, and advance care planning [^117HuF8p].

---

## Tailored pharmacological management

- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Prefer lower-intensity regimens (e.g. clopidogrel) and shorter courses in high bleeding risk; use PPI gastroprotection [^113sRaeB] [^114iVTdU].

- **Anticoagulation**: Adjust doses for renal function, weight, and bleeding risk; avoid routine GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in frail patients [^114iVTdU].

- **Secondary prevention**: Individualize beta-blockers, ACEi/ARBs, and statins based on tolerance, blood pressure, and renal function [^notfound].

---

## Invasive versus conservative management

An **early invasive strategy** reduces recurrent MI and revascularization in older adults but may increase bleeding and not improve mortality; tailor to ischemic risk, frailty, and anatomy [^1115XY6t] [^1157fqzC]. In severe frailty (CFS > 4), consider a conservative approach given early harm signals and limited benefit [^112eSAMD] [^112M5tbq]. For STEMI, favor primary PCI when feasible, recognizing higher early risk but potential long-term benefit even in frail patients [^113Vo5PR].

---

## Procedural considerations

Prefer **radial access** to reduce bleeding and vascular complications [^114iVTdU]. Use drug-eluting stents to minimize restenosis and repeat procedures. Keep procedures short, avoid complex multivessel interventions in very frail patients, and ensure experienced operators [^notfound].

---

## Rehabilitation and post-discharge care

- **Cardiac rehabilitation**: Refer to home-based or hybrid programs to improve function, quality of life, and adherence; especially beneficial in older adults [^1162CgGa] [^111dFtLc].

- **Geriatric follow-up**: Address polypharmacy, falls, cognition, nutrition, and functional decline with multidisciplinary care [^114iAiMG].

- **Care coordination**: Use transitional care models, medication reconciliation, and telehealth to reduce readmissions and adverse events [^115FpMNL].

---

## Multidisciplinary team involvement

A **heart team** (cardiology, geriatrics, primary care, nursing, social work) integrates cardiovascular and geriatric risks into decisions [^114Rp37c]. Palliative care supports symptom control, advance directives, and goals-of-care discussions in high-risk frail patients [^117HuF8p]. Cardiac rehabilitation specialists adapt programs to frailty and comorbidities [^113HCeX7].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track functional status, quality of life, and independence at regular intervals [^1179EGxU]. Monitor for bleeding, falls, renal dysfunction, and cognitive decline with therapy adjustments as needed [^114iVTdU]. Maintain close follow-up early after discharge to prevent readmissions and detect deterioration [^115FpMNL].

---

A multidimensional approach to frail ACS patients integrates geriatric assessment, cardiovascular risk stratification, shared decision-making, and individualized therapy, with procedural and post-discharge strategies that prioritize function, quality of life, and survival. This **patient-centered model** is essential to navigate the complex trade-offs in this high-risk population.

### Prognostic value of frailty in elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111YEdo8]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study suggests that in elderly ACS patients, frailty assessment should be integrated into the current existing management to better appraise the comprehensive prognosis risk. The identification of frailty help doctors to applicate appropriate management strategies including invasive therapy and antithrombotic medication, and help patients make properly informed choices. Further, the value of frailty as a therapeutic target should be given full attention. Currently, there is little evidence that frailty management could improve outcomes of elderly ACS patients. It is necessary to conduct more studies related the effect of the frailty intervention on elderly ACS prognosis in the future.

### Management of acute coronary syndrome in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115ppPfi]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic and therapeutic advances during the past decades have substantially improved health outcomes for patients with acute coronary syndrome. Both age-related physiological changes and accumulated cardiovascular risk factors increase the susceptibility to acute coronary syndrome over a lifetime. Compared with younger patients, outcomes for acute coronary syndrome in the large and growing demographic of older adults are relatively worse. Increased atherosclerotic plaque burden and complexity of anatomic disease, compounded by age-related cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbid conditions, contribute to the worse prognosis observed in older individuals. Geriatric syndromes, including frailty, multimorbidity, impaired cognitive and physical function, polypharmacy, and other complexities of care, can undermine the therapeutic efficacy of guidelines-based treatments and the resiliency of older adults to survive and recover, as well. In this American Heart Association scientific statement, we (1) review age-related physiological changes that predispose to acute coronary syndrome and management complexity; (2) describe the influence of commonly encountered geriatric syndromes on cardiovascular disease outcomes; and (3) recommend age-appropriate and guideline-concordant revascularization and acute coronary syndrome management strategies, including transitions of care, the use of cardiac rehabilitation, palliative care services, and holistic approaches. The primacy of individualized risk assessment and patient-centered care decision-making is highlighted throughout.

### Management of acute coronary syndromes in older adults [^1148tPXS]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Older patients are underrepresented in prospective studies and randomized clinical trials of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Over the last decade, a few specific trials have been conducted in this population, allowing more evidence-based management. Older adults are a heterogeneous, complex, and high-risk group whose management requires a multidimensional clinical approach beyond coronary anatomic variables. This review focuses on available data informing evidence-based interventional and pharmacological approaches for older adults with ACS, including guideline-directed management. Overall, an invasive approach appears to demonstrate a better benefit-risk ratio compared to a conservative one across the ACS spectrum, even considering patients' clinical complexity and multiple comorbidities. Conversely, more powerful strategies of antithrombotic therapy for secondary prevention have been associated with increased bleeding events and no benefit in terms of mortality reduction. An interdisciplinary evaluation with geriatric assessment should always be considered to achieve a holistic approach and optimize any treatment on the basis of the underlying biological vulnerability.

### A delicate matter: the burden of frailty on AMI-CS [^114rVMDC]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

However, this study is not without limitations which are important to highlight. A notable gap is the absence of data on posthospitalization outcomes, particularly regarding the quality of life of the frail patients surviving to hospital discharge. This lack of data presents a significant challenge in fully comprehending the short-term aftermath of AMI-CS treatment in frail individuals. Understanding the recovery or potential decline following hospital discharge is paramount for crafting comprehensive care strategies that extend beyond the acute hospitalization phase. Additionally, it is unclear of the reliability of frailty assessment in the setting of AMI-CS which poses a significant challenge. Given that many patients presenting with AMI-CS are frail at baseline and further exacerbated in the acute setting, the timing of measurement and accuracy are unclear. Future work in this area should focus on identifying a uniform assessment criterion to best understand frailty within the AMI-CS population.

The profound complexity of frailty intersecting with AMI-CS highlights a need for personalized management strategies in shock care. Recognizing the distinct outcomes between frail and nonfrail patients, future work should focus on tailoring treatment approaches to ensure that frail patients receive interventions that are both safe and beneficial. Furthermore, incorporating comprehensive geriatric assessments into the care framework of shock teams could be a strategy implemented in this patient population. Given the prevalence, the expertise of geriatricians or geriatric cardiology specialists could be invaluable and provide opportunity for in-hospital and longitudinal care. These providers should be skilled in assessing the broader implications of geriatric syndromes, including frailty, and their insights could guide more informed, holistic treatment decisions. Future work should explore the impact of integrating geriatric assessments on patient outcomes, potentially setting new standards for managing frail patients with AMI-CS to provide opportunity to standardize care.

In conclusion, frailty and AMI-CS represent a profound challenge for cardiologists given the markedly elevated mortality rates despite contemporary management of coronary disease and shock. The insights gained from this study highlight some opportunity for future work to potentially improve clinical practice. Tailored management strategies are essential to create care pathways for this vulnerable patient population. Additionally, the integration of comprehensive geriatric assessments into the treatment of CS may offer clinicians deeper understanding to patient status. By incorporating a multidisciplinary approach that includes geriatric expertise, clinicians will be better equipped to provide the most beneficial treatment options. Future work must address the current gaps in knowledge, which include frailty assessments in shock and postdischarge outcomes, to improve care in our aging and/or frail population who present with AMI-CS.

### Prognostic value of frailty in elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116S1kt9]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The accomplishments of cardiovascular prevention have decreased the incidence of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and have delayed the onset age of ACS. The progresses in the treatment of ACS (dual antithrombotic therapy and invasive strategy, e.g. the drug eluting stent) significantly lowers the mortality of ACS and lead to a swift growth in the portion of elderly patients. With the fast population ageing, the mean onset age of ACS patients rises stably in the last decades. Advanced age is one of the forceful prognosticators of mortality and morbidity of ACS. Age as a crucial prognostic marker is presented in the majority of ACS risk scores, including the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score and the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score.

Frailty, one of the most important health problems in geriatrics, commonly exists in ACS patients, in part due to mutual risk factors. A frail phenotype representing decreased physiological reserve and increased vulnerability reflects better biological age, therefore, it may cause the heterogeneity in clinical consequences within the elderly patients. Frailty has become a substantial factor in assessment of several special medical situations and been embedded into clinical decision making, such as evaluation of surgical risk and cancer treatment. However, this has not yet become incorporated as part of routine management of ACS.

The well-defined pathways for the management of ACS, largely based on randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence, may not be generalizable to elderly frail patients. Indeed, to date, there is no international guidelines as to how frail ACS patients should be treated. Previous studies have reported frailty was connected with higher mortality or adverse events in ACS patients with some inconsistent information. We therefore undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the significance of frailty on ACS prognosis, including mortality, cardiovascular events, major bleeding and readmission.

### Invasive vs. conservative management of older patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome: individual patient data meta-analysis [^117Rcu4s]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This is the first meta-analysis using IPD comparing a routine invasive strategy with a conservative approach in older patients with NSTEACS. All trials provided data, reflecting contemporary interventional management and the heterogeneous older patient population encountered in clinical practice today, as well as overcoming challenges facing previous meta-analyses of aggregate data such as differing definitions of composite endpoints and inconsistent follow-up periods. Herein, we present a synthesis of evidence that comments on the quality of existing trials using metrics of heterogeneity and the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias 2 tool, and unifies diverse sources of data, increasing statistical power, and offering a more comprehensive perspective on the efficacy of invasive vs. conservative management of NSTEACS among older adults across a broader range of populations and settings.

There are limitations to this study. First, we were unable to quantitatively evaluate bleeding as an outcome due to differing definitions of this endpoint within the constituent trials. However, bleeding rates were low and comparable with other trials investigating bleeding-reduction strategies in this patient group. Second, the timing of angiography was not standardized across all six trials (missing in two studies), but this reflects the provision of PCI facilities across several regions of the developed world. Third, there was a lack of frailty assessment, with only the MOSCA-FRAIL trial providing such information. Frailty is prevalent in older patients with NSTEACS and may impact on any benefits derived from coronary angiography and revascularization. Also, no data on angiographic complexity of coronary artery disease was available. Further, the majority of our population was aged between 80 and 90 years old, making our conclusion most relevant to this age group. Censoring was limited to 1 year, which was selected as this was the minimum follow-up period across all studies included. In addition, given the advanced age and co-morbidity of the population studied, we feel that 1-year outcomes are the most relevant in assessing superiority of one management approach vs. the other, as these would have the most important impact on patient life expectancy, prognosis, and quality of life. Blinding to the intervention was also not possible due to the nature of the intervention. This was common to all trials but remains a limitation nonetheless. All outcomes presented in our main manuscript were analysed using random-effects models, which are often considered preferable to fixed-effect models as they account for inherent variability and heterogeneity among studies, providing a more realistic and generalizable estimation by allowing for the possibility that true treatment effects may vary across studies due to diverse populations, methodologies, or other underlying factors. However, the relative means of the two meta-analyses approaches remain controversial, and so we provide a balanced account by presenting fixed-effect models in the appendix. Finally, given the lack of data on the exact timings of procedures, we recognize a limitation in our PMI sensitivity analyses in identifying all possible PMIs. However, this is the best data mining attempt we can present without introducing bias or making undue assumptions.

### Acute coronary syndrome: current treatment [^111wJMV2]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Family physicians need to identify and mitigate risk factors early, as well as recognize and respond to acute coronary syndrome events quickly in any clinical setting. Diagnosis can be made based on patient history, symptoms, electrocardiography findings, and cardiac biomarkers, which delineate between ST elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome. Rapid reperfusion with primary percutaneous coronary intervention is the goal with either clinical presentation. Coupled with appropriate medical management, percutaneous coronary intervention can improve short- and long-term outcomes following myocardial infarction. If percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be performed rapidly, patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction can be treated with fibrinolytic therapy. Fibrinolysis is not recommended in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome; therefore, these patients should be treated with medical management if they are at low risk of coronary events or if percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be performed. Post-myocardial infarction care should be closely coordinated with the patient's cardiologist and based on a comprehensive secondary prevention strategy to prevent recurrence, morbidity, and mortality.

### Diagnosis and management of acute coronary syndrome: an evidence-based update [^112DEibv]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) describes the range of myocardial ischemic states that includes unstable angina, non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (MI), or ST-elevated MI. ACS is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and places a large financial burden on the health care system. The diagnosis of ACS begins with a thorough clinical assessment of a patient's presenting symptoms, electrocardiogram, and cardiac troponin levels as well as a review of past medical history. Early risk stratification can assist clinicians in determining whether an early invasive management strategy or an initial conservative strategy should be pursued and can help determine appropriate pharmacologic therapies. Key components in the management of ACS include coronary revascularization when indicated; prompt initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation; and consideration of adjuvant agents including β blockers, inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, and HmG-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. It is essential for clinicians to take an individualized approach to treatment and consider long-term safety and efficacy when managing patients with a history of ACS after hospital discharge.

### Early invasive or conservative strategies for older patients with acute coronary syndromes: a meta-analysis [^1115XY6t]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The optimal management strategy for older patients who present with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains unclear due to a paucity of randomized evidence. New large and longer-term randomized data are available.

Objective

To test the association of an early invasive strategy vs a conservative strategy with clinical outcomes for patients 70 years or older who present with ACS.

Data Sources

A literature search strategy was designed in collaboration with a medical librarian. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched, with no language restrictions from inception through October 2024. Bibliographies of previous reviews and conference abstracts from major cardiovascular scientific meetings were handsearched.

Study Selection

Studies were deemed eligible following review by 2 independent, masked investigators if they randomly allocated patients 70 years or older who presented with ACS to early invasive or conservative management and reported clinical end points. Observational analyses were excluded. No trials were excluded based on sample size or follow-up duration.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were extracted independently and in triplicate. Clinical end points were pooled in meta-analyses that applied fixed-effects and random-effects modeling to calculate summary estimates for relative risks (RRs) and hazard ratios, along with their corresponding 95% CIs.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The prespecified primary end point was all-cause death. Secondary end points included recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), repeated coronary revascularization, major bleeding, cardiovascular death, death or MI, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, major adverse cardiac events, major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, and length of hospital stay.

Results

The sample size-weighted mean age of participants across included trials was 82.6 years, and 46% were female. In the pooled analysis, there was no significant difference in all-cause death between the invasive and conservative strategies (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.98–1.11; P = 0.15; I² = 0%). An early invasive strategy was associated with a reduced risk of recurrent MI of 22% (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67–0.91; P = 0.001; I² = 0%) and repeated coronary revascularization during follow-up of 57% (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30–0.60; P < .001; I² = 33.3%). However, an invasive strategy was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding (RR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.01–2.53; P = 0.05; I² = 16.7). No differences were observed in secondary end points. Results in the non-ST-elevation ACS population were consistent with the overall findings.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that, in older patients with ACS, an early invasive strategy was not associated with reduced all-cause death compared with conservative management. An early invasive strategy was associated with reduced recurrent MI and repeated coronary revascularization during follow-up but increased risk of major bleeding. Competing risks associated with an early invasive strategy should be weighed in shared therapeutic decision-making for older patients with ACS.

### Updated evidence on selection and implementation of an invasive treatment strategy for older patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^111LmMbP]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is the most common acute coronary syndrome diagnosis in older patients. In the UK, there are ~20000 NSTEMI cases annually in patients aged ≥ 75 years. Despite therapeutic advances in pharmacological and invasive management, studies show that older patients with NSTEMI experience worse in-hospital and long-term outcomes than younger patients, suggesting a clear need for robust evidence in this cohort. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend that invasive management should be considered holistically with no specified age cut-offs. However, older patients are less likely to receive invasive management due to a paucity of evidence from trials that represent contemporary clinical characteristics of older adults. Recruiting older patients realistic of those encountered in clinical practice is hugely challenging. Chronological age alone does not reflect the heterogeneity of the older population; ~30% of older patients with NSTEMI are frail, ~65% are cognitively impaired and most live with at least two additional comorbidities that can influence risk. Weighing the risk of an NSTEMI in an older adult against competing risks attributable to underlying frailty, comorbidities and cognitive impairment poses a key challenge. Recently, the SENIOR-RITA trial showed that invasive management in older patients with NSTEMI is safe and reduces non-fatal myocardial infarction and subsequent revascularisation but does not improve mortality. Individualised risk assessment and shared decision-making is necessary to guide these nuanced decisions. This review discusses the latest evidence regarding invasive management in the older population with NSTEMI, including the impact of geriatric syndromes on clinical outcomes.

### Multimorbidity in acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111YJ8GP]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

As a result of population aging, an increasing proportion of patients that present with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have underlying multimorbidity — the coexistence of 2 or more pre-existing long-term conditions (LTCs). The management of ACS in patients with multimorbidity presents a significant challenge: patients with multimorbidity may be at greater risk of ACS-associated adverse outcomes (including recurrent ischemic events, mortality, and worse quality of life) but may also be at greater risk of treatment-related harms (eg, procedural complicationsand bleeding). There may exist a risk-treatment paradox, whereby those at the greatest risk (and who may stand to gain the most from interventions) may be less likely to receive them. Many of the landmark randomized controlled trials of interventions that make up current ACS treatment pathways routinely excluded patients with a significant multimorbidity, limiting evidence-based decision-making in this population. Although United States, European, and other international clinical guidelines, advocate that multimorbidity should inform clinical decision-making in the context of ACS, the optimal treatment strategy in patients with significant multimorbidity burdens remains unclear. Although instruments that quantify comorbidity burden have been developed for research use, tools that formalize multimorbidity assessment for the purpose of clinical risk assessment are not established in the context of ACS.

Establishing the current state of the literature regarding the prevalence and impact of multimorbidity in patients presenting with ACS is essential to inform future observational studies and clinical trials that aim to optimize clinical decision-making and management in this population. To date, a number of studies have reported the prevalence and effects of multimorbidity in the context of acute ACS, either directly (based on an a priori definition of multimorbidity) or implicitly (by providing data on comorbidity counts). This review aimed to establish the prevalence of multimorbidity in individuals diagnosed with ACS and the association of multimorbidity with guideline-directed ACS treatment strategies and post-ACS clinical outcomes.

A preliminary search identified a number or related reviews. However, these either did not have an ACS-specific focus, were undertaken to evaluate the relationship between specific comorbidity measures and outcomes in ACS (such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index), or lacked a systematic methodology. Therefore, this systematic review is the first to comprehensively evaluate the prevalence of multimorbidity and its effect on treatment utilization and clinical outcomes in the context of ACS.

### Role and relevance of risk stratification models in the modern-day management of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes [^112dy1jh]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

We summarise the international guidelines surrounding risk stratification as well as discuss new emerging data for future development of a new risk model in the management of patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). NSTE-ACS accounts for the bulk of acute coronary syndrome presentations in the UK, but management strategies in this group of patients have remained a subject of debate for decades. Patients with NSTE-ACS represent a heterogeneous population with a wide variation in short-term and long-term clinical outcomes, which makes a uniform, standardised treatment approach ineffective and inappropriate. Studies in the modern era have provided some guidance in treating this subset of patients: the provision of early, more potent therapies has been shown to improve outcomes in patients at a particularly elevated risk of adverse outcomes. International guidelines recommend adopting an individualised treatment approach through the use of validated risk prediction models to identify such patients at high risk of adverse outcomes. The present available evidence, however, is based on dated demographics, different diagnostic thresholds and outdated therapies. In particular, the evidence has limited applicability to female patients and older people with frailty. Moreover, the current risk models do not capture key prognostic variables, leading to an inaccurate estimation of patients' baseline risk and subsequent mistreatment. Therefore, the current risk models are no longer fit for purpose and there is a need for risk prediction scores that account for different population demographics, higher sensitivity troponin assays and contemporary treatment options.

### Invasive vs. conservative management of older patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome: individual patient data meta-analysis [^115JKz7U]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using IPD, this meta-analysis shows that the risk of MI and unplanned revascularization is lower in older patients with NSTEACS treated with a routine invasive strategy compared to a conservative medical approach. The risk of the primary composite endpoint showed only weaker evidence of a potentially lower risk for an invasive strategy and there was no evident difference for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and stroke (Structured Graphical Abstract).

Older patients presenting with ACS in clinical practice today are a heterogeneous group with characteristics such as frailty, multi-morbidity, and cognition influencing outcomes beyond just the remit of chronological age. They frequently have complex coronary artery lesions and present with competing risks of altered physiology, co-morbidities, and vulnerability to both ischaemic outcomes and bleeding events. International treatment guidelines recommend applying the same interventional strategies in older patients as for younger patients; that is to offer routine coronary angiography with revascularization if clinically indicated in patients identified as high risk of adverse outcomes based on risk scores. However, age over 75 years is the strongest negative predictor of receiving routine invasive care, with frail or co-morbid patients less likely to receive coronary angiography. Currently the risk-benefit ratio of routine invasive care in older patients is unclear given the paucity of evidence; due to the under-representation of this patient group in previous studies and recent trials being underpowered and producing inconsistent findings.

The current study is the first IPD meta-analysis including all available trials that specifically enrolled older patients with NSTEACS. We included 1479 patients with a mean age of 84 years. The last substantial collaborative meta-analysis was a pooled subgroup analysis of the FRISC-II, ICTUS, and RITA-3 (FIR) trials from over two decades ago. These studies did not meet our pre-specified inclusion criteria, as they did not specifically include patients over the age of 70. Consistent application of inclusion criteria helps maintain the homogeneity of the included studies, ensuring that the pooled results accurately reflect the targeted research question, minimizing the risk of post-hoc decisions that could introduce bias. In addition, the oldest age category in the FIR dataset included 839 participants over the age of 75 years with a mean age of 76 years and fewer co-morbidities than the cohort we studied.

### Prognostic value of frailty in elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Vo5PR]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Frailty could impose obvious influence on the management of elderly ACS patients, especially on revascularization. Since the risk of operational complication rises in frail patients, a less invasive strategy may be preferred. Observational study shows primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed less frequently in patients with frailty compared with their non-frail counterparts. For STEMI patients, timely reperfusion in all patients with ischemia symptoms and persistent ST-segment elevation within 12 h, is the cornerstone of treatment. Studies have demonstrated performing PCI reduced in-hospital mortality, even in patients ≥ 80 years with frailty. Since our meta-analysis found frailty increased the risk of major bleeding, primary PCI is safer than fibrinolytic therapy especially in high risk elderly STEMI patients with frailty. However, frailty greatly increases all-cause mortality by 6.51-fold in STEMI patients in our study, which may reduce the ability to benefit from interventions. In these extremely frail STEMI patients with a high mortality despite intervention, the death risk should be fully informed and requires a shared decision by doctors and families. The decision not to accept interventional therapy is understandable and reasonable.

The role of an invasive strategy in frail NSTEMI patients is still worth exploring. An early invasive strategy was found to have more benefit in the elderly than younger patients, unless there were extensive and complicated comorbidities. Nowadays, there are studies aimed to judge whether the prognostic impact of PCI in NSTEMI differs across frailty status. The LONGEVO-SCA registry included unselected NSTEMI patients aged ≥ 80 years. The incidence of cardiac events was more common in patients managed conservatively after adjusting for confounding factors. However, this association was not significant in patients with established frailty criteria. In recent Nuñez's study, a prospective observational study of 270 elderly patients hospitalized for NSTEMI, at a median follow-up of 4.4 years, in patients with Fried ≥ 3, PCI was associated with a significant reduction of risk of all-cause and cardiovascular-rehospitalizations without reducing all-cause mortality. In 2015 ESC guidelines for the management of NSTEMI, revascularization in elderly patients should be took into consideration after cautious weighing up benefits and risks, including comorbidities, frail state, predicted life expectancy, quality of life, and patient preferences.

### Revascularization in frail patients with acute coronary syndromes: a retrospective longitudinal study [^116H258v]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Improving the lives of people with frailty and cardiovascular disease is a priority for clinical research. With an ageing population, an increasing number of people presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are frail. Frailty is associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, evidence to guide treatment decisions in this high-risk group is limited as multiple comorbidities, dementia, or frailty are common exclusions for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions in ACS. The 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for managing ACSs highlight the increased risk in people with frailty, the need for individualised holistic treatments, and limited RCT evidence to inform management. Recruiting people with frailty to RCTs is challenging, and trial populations consistently include fewer elderly, frail, or people with multiple long-term conditions than the target population for the intervention.

While awaiting evidence from high-quality RCTs in this population, modern causal inference methods can be used to inform treatment decisions. These methods overcome many common biases in observational analyses that arise from unmeasured confounders, such as reverse causation and bias by indication. A common feature of low certainty evidence to guide clinical decisions is wide variation in treatment independent of the individual patient's characteristics and clinical outcomes. This random variation can be used as a statistical instrument to infer relationships between treatment choice and outcomes independently of measured and unmeasured confounders. The current study aims to use national inpatient healthcare records in England to determine the variation of coronary revascularization in people at low, intermediate, and high risk of frailty who present with ACS across geographical regions in England. Then, using causal inference analyses, we will determine the association between revascularization and important short- and long-term clinical outcomes. The results provide a rationale for future trials in ACS patients with a high risk for frailty and point towards other important unmeasured considerations in decision-making in these cohorts.

### Multimorbidity in acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114NLKB2]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Integration of findings with wider literature

Patients with pre-existing multimorbidity may be less likely to receive guideline-recommended treatment in the context of ACS for several reasons. Firstly, there may be a perception among clinicians that there is a lack of evidence to support the universal application of relevant clinical guidelines, or a lack of proven safety and efficacy for specific interventions for these patients. There are very few comorbidity-based absolute contraindications to guideline-directed post-ACS therapies. Secondly, there may be concern that those with multiple long-term conditions are more likely to experience a greater risk of complications and adverse reactions to established ACS treatments (due to physiological vulnerability or interactions with pre-existing medications). Unfortunately, many of the landmark trials that established the safety and efficacy of treatments that make up contemporary ACS management pathways excluded patients with multiple long-term conditions(with a few notable exceptions, including the recently reported SENIOR-RITA [Older Patients with Non–ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Randomized Interventional Treatment] trial). As a consequence, clinical guidelines often remain agnostic on how these treatments should be applied to those with multimorbidity and/or significant frailty. At present, a person-centered paradigm of shared decision-making (which embraces this inherent uncertainty) is advised.

### Management of acute coronary syndrome: achievements and goals still to pursue. novel developments in diagnosis and treatment [^113NSJ5K]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes contribute a substantial part of the global disease burden. To realize a reduction in mortality and morbidity, the management of patients with these conditions involves the integration of several different approaches. Timely delivery of appropriate care is a key factor, as the beneficial effect of reperfusion is greatest when performed as soon as possible. Innovations in antithrombotic therapy have also contributed significantly to improvements in the prevention of ischaemic complications. However, with the use of such treatment, an increase in the risk of bleeding is inevitable. Therefore, the greatest challenge is now to obtain an optimal balance between the prevention of ischaemic complications and the risk of bleeding. In this regard, identification of patients at highest risk of either one is essential.

Advancing age is a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease and is an important indicator of outcome after acute coronary syndrome. As the number of older adults increases, the burden of cardiovascular disease is set to grow particularly as older adults remain disadvantaged in the delivery of acute cardiac care. This article reviews the temporal changes in the provision of guideline recommended therapies for the management of acute coronary syndrome, discusses reasons for age-dependent inequalities in care and the challenges facing clinicians.

### Revascularization in frail patients with acute coronary syndromes: a retrospective longitudinal study [^117EeAnw]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Research into context

There is a knowledge gap in trials evaluating people with frailty presenting with ACS. Guidelines recommend revascularization decisions considering baseline status and procedural risk, while tools for assessing frailty and indications are not specified.

The best evidence available is from RCTs of revascularization in older people presenting with ACS. However, these have shown conflicting results. The Elderly ACS trialin people with ACS over 70 years old showed no difference in mortality, myocardial infarction, and repeat hospital stay between an initial invasive vs. an initial conservative strategy at 1 year. In contrast, the After Eighty trialshowed lower MACE at 1.5 years in people over 80 years old presenting with NSTEMI or unstable angina treated with an invasive vs. a conservative strategy. The proportions of frail patients in these trials were not specified, and they were highly selective, recruiting 48.5% and 10.9% of eligible patients, respectively. This was associated with lower rates of multimorbidity than those observed in the current analysis. The LONGEVO-SCA studydemonstrated that frail patients were more likely to undergo conservative than invasive treatment. However, an invasive strategy led to no significant difference in clinical outcomes at 6 months in frail patients, which may be related to the use of different frailty, assessment, a limited sample size, a small number of events, and the 6-month follow-up, which is not sufficient to detect the impact of treatment strategy on clinical outcomes fully. When comparing invasive and conservative strategies, the MOSCA-FRAILshowed no significant increase in DAOH at 1 year. This study was terminated early due to the COVID-19 pandemic, had a higher crossover rate, and had a higher mean age (86 years), potentially leading to more complications with an invasive strategy. The Senior PAMI trial in people over 70 years who presented with STEMI also showed that revascularization with PCI resulted in a lower rate of death, disabling stroke, or reinfarction when comparing PCI with intravenous thrombolytic therapy. However, the follow-up was only 30 days, this effect was absent in > 80-year-olds, and the trial was terminated early due to slow recruitment. Together, these results demonstrate the challenges of undertaking RCTs in this vulnerable group. Other factors usually not included in trials and routinely collected data are the type of vascular access, previous revascularization undertaken, patient decision-making, insurance, and health provision facilities, which may impact the outcomes of revascularization in high-risk frailty patients with ACS.

### Invasive versus conservative strategy in older adults ≥ 75 Years of age with non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115QYJS5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

In the United States, approximately 6.6% of the population is now > 75 years of age and the older adult population is expected to expand rapidly. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and the incidence is projected to double in the older population by 2040. Recent epidemiological studies demonstrate an increase in the prevalence of non–ST‐segment–elevation ACS (NSTE‐ACS) among patients aged ≥ 75 years (range = 32% to 40%). Further, older adults often are frail, have a more severe presentation, have more complex anatomic disease, and experience worse clinical outcomes compared with younger patients. This can be attributed to age‐related cardiovascular changes, preexisting geriatric conditions, higher age‐associated risks, and limited clinical trial evidence to guide therapy. Ongoing trials like the SENIOR‐RITA (British Heart Foundation Older Patients With Non‐ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Randomized Interventional Treatment Trial) will give a definitive answer when deciding on treatment approaches for these older patients.

Currently, there is gross underrepresentation of older adults in randomized controlled trials (RCT), especially in studies comparing invasive cardiovascular care for NSTE‐ACS. Additionally, the outcomes for trials that enrolled older adults vary significantly. The After Eighty study demonstrated reduced rates of mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), revascularization, and stroke among older adults who underwent invasive management without an additional increased risk of bleeding. However, smaller but more contemporary trials, such as 80+ and RINCAL (Revascularisation or Medical Therapy in Elderly Patients With Acute Anginal Syndromes), observed no differences in primary outcomes, including all‐cause death, MI, revascularization, stroke, or rehospitalization and the composite of mortality or MI between groups. The 2021 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions and the 2020 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of patients with NSTE‐ACS recommend a similar approach in the management of NSTE‐ACS across all age groups. However, the generalizability of these trials to older patients undergoing invasive care remains ambiguous. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta‐analysis using the current evidence for older adults ≥ 75 years of age comparing an early invasive versus conservative strategy for older adults presenting with NSTE‐ACS.

### Definition, classification, and pathophysiology of acute coronary ischemic syndromes [^113dfFuX]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is now used to describe a spectrum of clinical presentations that share an underlying pathophysiology, replacing the previous nomenclature of ischemic chest pain. The accurate diagnosis and proper management of patients with these entities require the emergency medicine physician to consider the entire spectrum of ACS, with emphasis placed on early diagnosis and rapid treatment. Each of these syndromes has its own prognosis, pathophysiology, and specific management strategy.

### Relation of frailty to outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^113DLV36]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

This study examines a national cohort of patients with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) for the prevalence of frailty, temporal changes over time, and its association with treatments and clinical outcomes. The National Inpatient Sample database was used to identify US adults with a diagnosis of ACS between 2004 and 2014. Frailty risk was determined using a validated Hospital Frailty Risk Score based on ICD-9 codes using the cutoffs < 5, 5 to 15, and > 15 for low- (LRS), intermediate- (IRS), and high-risk (HRS) frailty scores, respectively. Logistic regression assessed associations of frailty with clinical outcomes, adjusted for patient co-morbidities and hospital characteristics. From 7,398,572 hospital admissions with ACS between 2004 and 2014, 86.5% of patients had LRS, 13.4% had an IRS, and 0.1% had an HRS. From 2004 to 2014, the prevalence of IRS and HRS patients increased from 8.1% to 18.2% and 0.03% to 0.18%, respectively (p < 0.001 for both). The proportion of patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention was greatest among patients with lowest frailty risk scores (LRS 42.9%, IRS 21.0%, and HRS 14.6%). Comparing HRS to LRS, there was a significant increase in bleeding complications (odds ratio [OR] 2.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.03 to 2.69), vascular complications (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.41), in-hospital stroke (OR 7.84, 95% CI 6.93 to 8.86), and in-hospital death (OR 2.57, 95% CI 2.18 to 3.04). Risk of frailty is common among patients with ACS, is increasing in prevalence, and is associated with differential management strategies, and outcomes during hospitalization. Increased awareness could facilitate frailty-tailored care to minimize the risk of adverse outcomes.

### Challenges in the management of older patients with acute coronary syndromes in the COVID-19 pandemic [^117HuF8p]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Non-STEMI

During 15 years of follow-up of the FRagmin and Fast Revascularization during InStability in coronary artery disease (FRISC) II trial, an early invasive treatment strategy in patients with non ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) postponed the occurrence of death or MI by an average of 18 months. The difference was mainly driven by postponement of new MI, whereas the early difference in mortality alone was not sustained over time. Older patients are a rapidly increasing proportion of patients with NSTE-ACS. Patients with NSTEMI are more likely to be older than patients with STEMI. However, small-sized RCTs in older patients with NSTEMI have shown mixed results, as summarised in online supplementary table 2. Frailty and comorbidities play an important role in the care of older patients with ACS and should be taken into consideration in deciding the treatment strategies. In a previous study, frailty was associated with a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) (a composite of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, unplanned revascularisation and major bleeding) at 1 year following invasive procedure for older patients with NSTEACS (HR 2.79, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.08, p = 0.01) compared with robust patients. Frailty is a significant predictor for all-cause mortality after PCI (HR 2.97, 95% CI 1.56 to 5.66, p = 0.001). Cognitively impaired patients had a higher risk of MACE (a composite of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, unplanned revascularisation and major bleeding) during follow-up (p = 0.047). Ongoing studies aim to evaluate the outcomes between invasive and conservatively managed groups in older patients, taking into consideration frailty and other comorbidities. In the context of lack of robust evidence in the care of older patients with a definitive diagnosis of NSTEMI, during the COVID-19 pandemic, an initial conservative approach might not be an unreasonable strategy.

Palliative care and advanced care planning

For older patients who are frail and with multiple comorbidities, refraining from more active therapy may be the most humane and appropriate approach in many patients with provision of palliative care. Given the high mortality associated with older patients with ACS and its exacerbation with COVID-19 infection, it is important for the clinical care team to have high-quality discussions where feasible about advance care planning and about goals of care with patients or their families.

### Impact of frailty and other geriatric syndromes on clinical management and outcomes in elderly patients with non-ST-Segment elevation acute coronary syndromes: rationale and design of the LONGEVO-SCA registry [^116GBY3V]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is high in the elderly. Despite a high prevalence of frailty and other aging-related variables, little information exists about the optimal clinical management in patients with coexisting geriatric syndromes. The aim of the LONGEVO-SCA registry (Impacto de la Fragilidad y Otros Síndromes Geriátricos en el Manejo y Pronóstico Vital del Anciano con Síndrome Coronario Agudo sin Elevación de Segmento ST) is to assess the impact of aging-related variables on clinical management, prognosis, and functional status in elderly patients with ACS. A series of 500 consecutive octogenarian patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS from 57 centers in Spain will be included. A comprehensive geriatric assessment will be performed during the admission, assessing functional status (Barthel Index, Lawton-Brody Index), frailty (FRAIL scale, Short Physical Performance Battery), comorbidity (Charlson Index), nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form), and quality of life (Seattle Angina Questionnaire). Patients will be managed according to current recommendations. The primary outcome will be the description of mortality and its causes at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will be changes in functional status and quality of life. Results from this study might significantly improve the knowledge about the impact of aging-related variables on management and outcomes of elderly patients with ACS. Clinical management of these patients has become a major health care problem due to the growing incidence of ACS in the elderly and its particularities.

Non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes — translation of classes of evidence to recommendation levels states that Level A recommendations are generally accepted principles for patient care that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (eg, based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies); Level B recommendations may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty (eg, based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies); and Level C recommendations are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of adequate published literature, based on expert consensus, and when consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation. The recommendations and evidence synthesis were reviewed and revised by the Clinical Policies Committee, recommendations may be downgraded due to factors such as consistency of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude, and publication bias, and when possible clinically oriented statistics (eg, likelihood ratios [LRs], number needed to treat) are presented to help apply results to the individual patient.

### Current management of non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome: reconciling the results of randomized controlled trials [^1154gyd4]. European Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

Patients presenting with non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome represent a heterogeneous group with regard to the severity of coronary atherosclerosis and prognosis. The conventional approach to their treatment has involved admission to the hospital for pharmacologic stabilization, subsequent mobilization, and management by either a conservative or an invasive strategy. The choice of one approach over another is guided largely by local practice patterns and the availability of invasive facilities.

Methods and Results

However, recent randomized trials comparing the strategies have demonstrated a superiority of the invasive strategy, particularly in patients at higher risk. Furthermore, randomized trials have provided information on refining risk stratification. On the basis of these data, we outline criteria for assessing risk and recommend that stratification be conducted at presentation using clinical features, the electrocardiogram, and biomarkers.

Conclusion

Higher-risk patients should be admitted for pharmacologic stabilization and assessed by coronary angiography within 48h with the aim of early revascularization, provided the risk of periprocedural complications is not prohibitive. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors are indicated, particularly in patients requiring percutaneous coronary intervention. The conservative strategy remains appropriate for patients admitted to hospitals without invasive facilities. Patients not at highrisk may be observed in a facility with cardiac monitoring such as a chest pain unit and undergo subsequent stress testing. The adoption of such an early risk stratification and revascularization-based approach is likely to result in a reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction and ischaemia, duration of hospitalization, repeat hospitalization, and mortality.

### Managing acute coronary syndromes in older adults with chronic kidney disease: are we there yet? [^114Rp37c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

So, how would the current report influence the care of elderly ACS patients with CKD who present with NSTE‐ACS in our practice? On the basis of the current study and prior evidence, older age and presence of CKD alone should not preclude revascularization, as many of these appropriately selected patients tend to benefit from an invasive strategy. However, other important factors, like cognitive impairment, comorbidities, frailty, and patient wishes, should be factored in. A multifaceted heart team approach, similar to what has been adopted for patients considered for transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedures, is reasonable and should include not only a clinical and an interventional cardiologist but possibly the patient's primary care physician and a geriatrician.

Postdischarge follow-up and systems of care in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — transition from hospital to home is described as high risk because approximately 1 in 5 patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge; hospital-initiated support interventions are associated with reduced mortality rates at 3 months and 1 year as well as a reduction in 30-day readmission rates among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI); and multicomponent integrated care with ≥ 2 quality improvement strategies has been associated with reduction of all-cause death, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause hospitalization. Populations particularly at risk for readmission include women, individuals from traditionally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and patients who require ICU services, and transition care interventions and programs such as the Hospital to Home Initiative or the AMI Toolkit provide resources to decrease readmission rates and improve medication and cardiac rehabilitation (CR) adherence through increased provider communication and care coordination.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — patients should be referred to CR during hospitalization for ACS and prior to discharge. Exercise-based CR programs are associated with improved survival and reduced risk of reinfarction in patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and patients with ACS who participate in CR have significantly better outcomes compared with those who do not. In a meta-analysis of 85 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise-based CR in coronary heart disease, the intervention reduced risk of myocardial infarction (MI), reduced all-cause hospitalization, reduced health care costs, and improved health-related quality of life (QOL) outcomes over 12 months of follow-up, with longer follow-up suggesting reductions in cardiovascular mortality; CR is particularly beneficial in older patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). To improve access, home-based CR options should be considered; a review of 23 RCTs of home- and center-based CR found programs tend to implement the same core components, and comparison of studies indicated a similar improvement in QOL and no statistically significant difference in the all-cause mortality rate up to 12 months after the intervention. Center-based CR requires patients to be physically present at a hospital or outpatient facility, which limits access for many patients, especially women and some racial and ethnic groups, and hybrid models that combine elements of both center- and home-based programs may also offer benefits.

### Revascularization in frail patients with acute coronary syndromes: a retrospective longitudinal study [^116nM7Lr]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Frailty is increasingly prevalent in people presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This high-risk group is typically excluded from trials of interventions in ACS, and there is uncertainty about the risks and benefits of invasive management.

Methods

Patients with an ACS diagnosis between 2010 and 2015 in England were identified from Hospital Episode Statistics, with linked Office for National Statistics mortality data. Frailty was defined by the Hospital Frailty Risk Score. Causal inference analysis used regional variation in revascularization as an instrumental variable to estimate average treatment effects of revascularization on cardiovascular mortality up to 5 years in people presenting with ACS and low-, intermediate-, or high-risk frailty.

Results

The analysis included 565 378 ACS patients, of whom 11.6% (n = 65 522) were at intermediate risk and 4.7% (n = 26 504) were at high risk of frailty. Intermediate and high frailty risks were associated with reduced likelihood of echocardiography, invasive angiography, or revascularization and increased likelihood of mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events compared with low frailty risk. Cardiovascular death at 5 years was 78.6%, 77.3%, and 75.7% in people at low, intermediate, and high frailty risk, respectively. Instrumental variable analysis suggested that revascularization resulted in a higher absolute reduction in cardiovascular mortality in high and intermediate frail risk patients compared with low risk at 1-year post-ACS.

Conclusions

Frailty is common in people presenting with ACS, where cardiovascular causes are the principal mode of death. Revascularization is associated with short- and long-term survival benefits in people at intermediate and high risk of frailty after adjustment for measured and unmeasured confounders.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1157fqzC]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Non–ST-segment–elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) in adults ≥ 75 years — evidence synthesis indicates that a routine invasive strategy reduced reinfarction and urgent revascularization without significantly affecting all-cause mortality or the combined end point of death and MI at 1 year, and meta-analyses in patients ≥ 75 years found early invasive management reduced the composite of death or MI and reduced repeat revascularization and MI without increasing bleeding risk. Nonrandomized data suggested a survival benefit for patients > 80 years of age managed invasively. Given heterogeneity in older adults with NSTEMI, an early invasive strategy may be preferred in patients with recurrent angina, hemodynamic or electrical instability, elevated troponin, or high-risk anatomy, whereas a conservative approach may be appropriate in those with advanced frailty, cognitive impairment, or limited life expectancy, or when the likelihood of benefit is outweighed by procedural risk or patient preference.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114KCurJ]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion — individualized management and risk–benefit balance for older adults undergoing coronary revascularization states that these patients with age-related physiologic changes, complex coronary anatomy, and prevalent geriatric syndromes require a nuanced and individualized approach to management. Coronary revascularization can offer benefits, such as symptom relief and improved outcomes, but the risks associated with invasive procedures necessitate careful consideration of clinical status, frailty, and personal goals. Future research should aim to close knowledge gaps by including diverse older adults in clinical trials, using proteomic and genomic profiling for better risk stratification, and advancing decision-making frameworks that emphasize personalized care.

### Frailty assessment in the cardiovascular care of older adults [^112gSCyB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Due to the aging and increasingly complex nature of our patients, frailty has become a high-priority theme in cardiovascular medicine. Despite the recognition of frailty as a pivotal element in the evaluation of older adults with cardiovascular disease (CVD), there has yet to be a road map to facilitate its adoption in routine clinical practice. Thus, we sought to synthesize the existing body of evidence and offer a perspective on how to integrate frailty into clinical practice. Frailty is a biological syndrome that reflects a state of decreased physiological reserve and vulnerability to stressors. Upward of 20 frailty assessment tools have been developed, with most tools revolving around the core phenotypic domains of frailty-slow walking speed, weakness, inactivity, exhaustion, and shrinking-as measured by physical performance tests and questionnaires. The prevalence of frailty ranges from 10% to 60%, depending on the CVD burden, as well as the tool and cutoff chosen to define frailty. Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated that frailty carries a relative risk of > 2 for mortality and morbidity across a spectrum of stable CVD, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, and surgical and transcatheter interventions. Frailty contributes valuable prognostic insights incremental to existing risk models and assists clinicians in defining optimal care pathways for their patients. Interventions designed to improve outcomes in frail elders with CVD such as multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation are being actively tested. Ultimately, frailty should not be viewed as a reason to withhold care but rather as a means of delivering it in a more patient-centered fashion.

### Invasive treatment strategy in adults with frailty and non-ST-Segment elevation myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^112eSAMD]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) poses significant challenges in the geriatric population, particularly among patients with frailty. While invasive cardiac procedures can provide substantial benefits, they also carry inherent risks. Moreover, the prognosis of patients with frailty is influenced by multiple factors beyond the acute coronary event.

There are limited data on the optimal treatment (invasive or conservative) of older adults with acute coronary syndrome. In the absence of robust evidence, decisions regarding how to treat older patients should be individualized based on patient characteristics. It is acknowledged that comorbidities can attenuate the potential benefit of invasive treatment. Clinical guidelines recommend considering ischemic and bleeding risks, estimated life expectancy, comorbidities, the need for noncardiac surgery, quality of life, frailty, cognitive and functional impairment, patient values and preferences, and the risks and benefits of an invasive strategy.

To our knowledge, MOSCA-FRAIL was the first clinical trial to compare an initially invasive and a conservative treatment strategy in patients with frailty and NSTEMI. The results showed no significant differences in the number of days alive and out of the hospital at 1 year, and worse outcomes were observed among patients who underwent invasive treatment. Therefore, a conservative approach might be the best option for patients with frailty and NSTEMI. In the present study, we investigated whether these findings consolidate or change over time in the extended follow-up of the trial.

### Complete versus culprit lesion-only revascularisation for acute myocardial infarction (complete revascularisation trialists' collaboration): an individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised trials [^116vGT7R]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

In patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes and multivessel coronary artery disease, the question of whether to undertake a strategy of complete revascularisation in cases in which percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is performed routinely on non-culprit lesions (in addition to the culprit lesion) or whether to restrict PCI only to the culprit lesion is a common dilemma. The Complete Revascularisation Trialists' Collaboration aimed to determine, based on the totality of data from randomised trials, the effect of a complete revascularisation strategy on major cardiovascular events and whether it reduces cardiovascular death.

Methods

In this individual patient data meta-analysis, trials were included if they enrolled at least 250 patients, compared a complete revascularisation strategy (with PCI) to a culprit lesion-only PCI strategy, and enrolled patients presenting with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. To ensure that no trials were overlooked, we searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for randomised controlled trials published between 1996 and Sept 15, 2025. The primary outcomes were the composite of cardiovascular death or new myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death alone. Hierarchical testing of cardiovascular death alone was planned contingent on reduction in cardiovascular death or new myocardial infarction based on the prespecified alpha level of 0.04. A one-stage individual patient data meta-analysis was performed using a Cox frailty model. All-cause death was the secondary outcome; non-cardiovascular death and new myocardial infarction were additional outcomes. All analyses included all randomly assigned patients. The meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO, CRD420251124098.

Findings

Six randomised controlled trials involving 8836 individuals were included. The median age was 65.8 years (IQR 57.0–76.0), and 2088 (23.6%) patients were female and 6748 (76.4%) were male. Overall, 7768 (87.9%) patients presented with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and 1068 (12.1%) with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. At a median follow-up of 36.0 months (IQR 30.6–48.0), cardiovascular death or new myocardial infarction occurred in 382 (9.0%) of 4259 patients in the complete revascularisation group compared with 528 (11.5%) of 4577 patients in the culprit lesion-only group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76 [95% CI 0.67–0.87], p < 0.0001). There were 155 (3.6%) cardiovascular deaths in the complete revascularisation group compared with 209 (4.6%) in the culprit lesion-only group (HR 0.76 [95% CI 0.62–0.93], p = 0.0091). All-cause death occurred in 308 (7.2%) patients in the complete revascularisation group compared with 370 (8.1%) patients in the culprit lesion-only group (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.73–0.99], p = 0.039). Non-cardiovascular death was similar between the groups (153 [3.6%] in the complete revascularisation group vs 161 [3.5%] in the culprit lesion-only group; HR 0.98 [95% CI 0.78–1.22], p = 0.85). Complete revascularisation reduced new myocardial infarctions compared with culprit lesion-only PCI (255 [6.0%] vs 357 [7.8%]; HR 0.76 [95% CI 0.65–0.90], p = 0.0011).

Interpretation

In patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and multivessel disease, complete revascularisation reduced the composite of cardiovascular death or new myocardial infarction as well as cardiovascular death alone compared with a culprit lesion-only PCI strategy. In addition, all-cause death was lower with complete revascularisation. These data provide the strongest and most robust evidence to date that complete revascularisation improves important cardiovascular clinical outcomes.

### Acute coronary syndromes and acute heart failure: a diagnostic dilemma and high-risk combination. A statement from the acute heart failure committee of the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^117LKkra]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome is a precipitant of acute heart failure in a substantial proportion of cases, and the presence of both conditions is associated with a higher risk of short-term mortality compared to acute coronary syndrome alone. The diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome in the setting of acute heart failure can be challenging. Patients may present with atypical or absent chest pain, electrocardiograms can be confounded by pre-existing abnormalities, and cardiac biomarkers are frequently elevated in patients with chronic or acute heart failure, independently of acute coronary syndrome. It is important to distinguish transient or limited myocardial injury from primary myocardial infarction due to vascular events in patients presenting with acute heart failure. This paper outlines various clinical scenarios to help differentiate between these conditions and aims to provide clinicians with tools to aid in the recognition of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of acute heart failure. Interpretation of electrocardiogram and biomarker findings, and imaging techniques that may be helpful in the diagnostic work-up are described. Guidelines recommend an immediate invasive strategy for patients with acute heart failure and acute coronary syndrome, regardless of electrocardiographic or biomarker findings. Pharmacological management of patients with acute coronary syndrome and acute heart failure should follow guidelines for each of these syndromes, with priority given to time-sensitive therapies for both. Studies conducted specifically in patients with the combination of acute coronary syndrome and acute heart failure are needed to better define the management of these patients.

### Invasive versus conservative strategy in older adults ≥ 75 Years of age with non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115cyTzF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

In our meta‐analysis, we found a trend toward mortality reduction in patients undergoing an invasive strategy; however, it failed to reach statistical significance. This parallels and aligns with studies that have similarly indicated a nonsignificant decrease in all‐cause mortality with the invasive approach when compared with conservative strategy. Similar results were also found in studies that showed statistical significance between the invasive and conservative strategies in this patient population in terms of all‐cause mortality. Recently published long‐term outcomes (follow‐up 5.3 years) of the After Eighty study showed reduction in primary end point (composite of MI, need for urgent revascularization, stroke, and death) in the invasive arm. Further, the invasive strategy was associated with a significant gain in event‐free survival of 276 days at 5 years. In contrast, the MOSCA‐FRAIL trial compared conservative and invasive strategies in patients aged ≥ 70 years with NSTEMI. This trial failed to show any notable difference in days alive and out of the hospital in patients in the invasive versus conservative arms. Achieving measurable reductions in overall mortality among older adults continues to be challenging. Several factors may account for conflicting results. First, revascularization was performed in only 55% of our invasive strategy patient cohort; if the treatment benefit of an invasive approach is presumably from revascularization, the relatively low rate of revascularization in the invasive group would attenuate the results observed. Second, the lack of morbidity benefit can be related to the choice of not or inability to pursue a complete revascularization. Moreover, a proportion of the trials included in our analysis permitted a selective invasive strategy. This allowed revascularization "as required" in the conservative arm as well. This is in stark contrast to registry data, wherein mortality reduction in the invasive cohort was predominantly seen against patients receiving medical therapy only. Additionally, the management of NSTE‐ACS in older adults is nuanced and complex due to a multitude of competing risks often observed at advanced age. For example, the presence of geriatric syndromes like multimorbidity, polypharmacy, frailty, disability, cognitive impairment, and functional decline, influences the short‐ and long‐term outcomes of revascularization procedures. Frailty has been associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes and increased morbidity and mortality in the older adult population with stable ischemic heart disease and NSTE‐ACS. Observational studies have shown that frail patients still benefit from revascularization procedures. This is further compounded by multimorbidity, which reflects the simultaneous presence of 2 or more cardiovascular or noncardiovascular comorbidities. Cardiovascular comorbidities may include hypertension, heart failure, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and atrial fibrillation. Noncardiovascular comorbidities that influence outcomes may include obstructive lung disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes, all of which contribute to increased risk of adverse events and negative outcomes. A stepwise increase in mortality risk with an increase in frailty and comorbidity burden has been identified in older patients with ACS. These may confound or blunt the tangible benefits of invasive management in this patient population. However, these same patients have more complex anatomic disease and may derive more benefit from revascularization procedures than younger patients, albeit at a great risk for complications. For these reasons, clinical trials enrolling older adults with frailty and morbidity will fill these gaps in knowledge.

### Frailty and quality of life after invasive management for non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome [^111eY4FY]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Older patients presenting with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) require holistic assessment. We carried out a longitudinal cohort study to investigate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of older, frail adults with NSTEACS undergoing coronary angiography.

Methods

217 consecutive patients aged ≥ 65 years (mean age 80.9 ± 4.0 years, 60.8% male) with NSTEACS referred for coronary angiography were recruited from two tertiary cardiac centres between November 2012 and December 2015. Frailty was assessed with the Fried Frailty Index; a score of 0 was characterised as robust, 1–2 prefrail and ≥ 3 frail. The Short Form Survey 36 (SF-36), an HRQoL tool consisting of eight domains spanning physical and mental health, was performed at baseline and 1year.

Results

186 patients (85.7%) had invasive revascularisation. At baseline, 52 (23.9%) patients were frail and 121 (55.8%) were prefrail, with most SF-36 domains falling below the norm-population mean. Patients with frailty had lower mean scores in all physical SF-36 domains (p ≤ 0.05) compared with those without frailty. Robust patients had temporal improvement in two domains (role physical +5.80 (95% CI 1.31 to 10.3) and role emotional +6.46 (95% CI 1.02 to 11.9)) versus patients with frailty and prefrailty, who had a collective improvement in a greater number of physical and psychological domains at 1year (2 domains vs 11 domains), notably role physical (prefrail +6.53 (95% CI 3.85 to 9.20) and frail +10.4 (95% CI 6.7814.1)).

Conclusions

Frail older adults with NSTEACS have poor HRQoL. One year following invasive management, there are modest improvements in HRQoL, most marked in frail and prefrail patients, who received a proportionally larger benefit than robust patients.

Older adults undergoing coronary revascularization — population definition, risk, and decision-making include that most clinical trials have defined older patients as those ≥ 75 years of age; older patients form a vulnerable subset with more complex presentations, higher prevalence of comorbidities, and increased risk of bleeding complications and stroke after PCI; older patients constitute a growing, high-risk population with increased rates of adverse events; although older patients benefit from revascularization to the same, if not greater, extent as younger patients, the optimal strategy should be chosen according to patient-centered goals of care; subgroup analyses indicate relative outcomes after PCI and CABG are comparable in older patients, with CABG better at achieving complete revascularization and PCI preferred for frail patients at higher risk of periprocedural events; careful consideration of risks and benefits using a Heart Team, in accordance with patient preferences while accounting for frailty and cognitive status, is vital to decisions about the revascularization plan.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after ACS — patients "should be referred to CR during hospitalization for ACS and prior to discharge". Exercise-based CR benefits include that "Exercise-based CR programs are associated with improved survival and reduced risk of reinfarction in patients after AMI", and "Patients with ACS who participate in CR have significantly better outcomes compared with those who do not". Evidence cited notes, "In a meta-analysis of 85 RCTs of exercise-based CR in patients with coronary heart disease, the intervention reduced risk of MI, reduced all-cause hospitalization, reduced health care costs, and improved health-related QOL outcomes over 12 months of follow-up", and "Longer follow-up suggested reductions in cardiovascular mortality". Older adults are highlighted: "CR is particularly beneficial in older patients with CAD, a group that is at a higher risk of losing independence and functioning". For access and models of delivery, "To improve access for patients who live in rural locations and in areas with no center-based CR, home-based CR options should be considered", and "A review of 23 RCTs of home- and center-based CR found that these programs tend to implement the same core components", with "a similar improvement in QOL and no statistically significant difference in the all-cause mortality rate up to 12 months after the intervention". The page adds that "Hybrid models that combine elements of both center- and home-based programs may also offer benefits".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Evidence gaps — initial evaluation and management: Although the 2025 ACS guideline recognizes the value of risk scores in estimating the risk of death or recurrent MI, limited prospective randomized data are available as to whether risk scores should be used to determine treatment strategies. The highest risk patients are those who present after a cardiac arrest, and although the data support an invasive approach in resuscitated patients with ST-segment elevation on the postarrest ECG, any potential benefit of coronary angiography may be attenuated in those who are comatose. It is also less clear whether reperfusion with either fibrinolysis or primary PCI provides clinical benefit in ST-segment elevation patients who present late after symptom onset (12 to 48 hours) but who are no longer symptomatic.

Postdischarge follow-up and systems of care coordination — transition risk and supportive interventions: Transition from the hospital to home is a critical period for patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) because approximately 1 in 5 patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge, and women, individuals from traditionally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and patients who require ICU services during their index hospitalization are particularly at risk for readmission. Quality improvement programs such as the Hospital to Home Initiative or the AMI Toolkit provide resources to assist clinicians decrease readmission rates and improve medication and cardiac rehabilitation (CR) adherence through increased provider communication and care coordination. Hospital-initiated support interventions are associated with reduced mortality rates at 3 months and 1 year and with a reduction in 30-day readmission rates among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Multicomponent integrated care (≥ 2 quality improvement strategies targeting different domains of the health care system, health care professionals, or patients) as compared with usual care has been associated with reduction of all-cause death, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause hospitalization, and emerging digital health interventions hold promise to improve the transition from hospital to home.

### Prognostic value of frailty in elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114iVTdU]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

With regard to medical treatment, as bleeding risk increases with age, comorbidities, polypharmacy and declined renal function, elderly patients are at particular risk of bleeding. In addition to routine evaluation of bleeding risk (HAS-BLED bleeding score), based on our study, we also recommend that the frailty assessment be considered to tailor the individualized antithrombotic treatment for elderly patients. It is essential to reduce bleeding risk according to the degree of frailty; these include employing proper dosage of antithrombotic drugs, avoidance of a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa-inhibitor; adding a proton pump inhibitor; avoiding the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and using radial access whenever possible.

Our study found frailty increases both the risk of major bleeding and the risk of cardiovascular events. It is impossible to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events by increasing the intensity of antiplatelet therapy. Frail patients are also less likely to take angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers or β-blockers, since they are more likely to have adverse drug reactions from medical therapy. The frailty as a therapeutic goal intervened by non-pharmacological means is the future hotspot of research. The earlier stage of frailty is reversible and could be remedied. The non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. cardiac rehabilitation, physical exercise, and removing unnecessary medications may postpone and reduce the risk of CVD. A recent study showed patients with diabetes mellitus who have undergone PCI, cardiac rehabilitation participation was associated with significantly reduced all-cause mortality and composite end point of mortality, myocardial infarction, or revascularization. Meanwhile, nutritional supplement with 25–30 g of high-quality protein per meal have slowed or prevented sarcopenia, a manifestation of pre-frailty. In particular, physical activity interventions might play a pivotal role in the prevention of both CVD and frailty. More studies are required to confirm its function and establish standard exercise prescriptions.

Limitation

There are following limitations in our meta-analysis. First, even though we performed subgroup analysis according to type of ACS and follow-up time, there were not sufficient data to detect the statistical difference between subgroups. Second, the included criterion of our review was based on the age of 65 years or more. However, two studies just recruited participants older than 80 years and another study only included STEMI patients older than 85 years, which may result in the heterogeneity of our studies. Last, none of included studies in our meta-analysis reported results concerning quality of life. Future studies should use more patient-centered consequences such as activity of daily living (ADL) as primary outcome.

Cardiac rehabilitation recommendations — clinical directives and evidence class: For patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), patients with ACS should be referred to an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program prior to hospital discharge to reduce death, MI, hospital readmissions, and improve functional status and quality of life (QOL) (COR 1, LOE A). In patients with ACS, a home-based CR program is a reasonable alternative to a center-based CR program to improve functional status and QOL (COR 2a, LOE B-R).

### A geriatric approach to percutaneous coronary interventions in older adults, part II: AExpert panel [^1125CH4J]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The geriatric risk assessment

The assessment of geriatric syndromes in older adults is essential and complementary to cardiovascular risk assessment because these age-associated physiologic complexities are risk factors for short- and long-term adverse events. We acknowledge the difficulties inherent in measuring these geriatric conditions and incorporating them into busy clinical workflows, especially in those presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We present a comprehensive approach for cardiovascular and geriatric assessment prior to invasive treatments in Table 1, as well as a tiered approach to risk assessment in older adults being considered for PCI in Figure 1. While the collection of the complete array of these measures may not be feasible or practical in a busy clinical practice, and there may be collinearity across some measures, this list is meant to provide clinicians with a toolkit for a comprehensive geriatric assessment that may then be tailored to individual patient needs and time constraints. Notably, precedents have already been set in other busy clinical subspecialities for the routine collection of one or more of these geriatric measures.

### Differences in treatment and clinical outcomes in patients aged ≥ 75 years compared with those aged ≤ 74 years following acute coronary syndromes: a prospective multicentre study [^113mXGe1]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This large-scale cohort study showed that 39% of ACS patients were aged ≥ 75 years, significantly more comorbid and received differential management to younger patients. Furthermore, older patients were more likely to suffer in hospital complications and had higher in-hospital, 1-year and long-term mortality than younger patients. However, older age was not an independent factor of 1-year and long-term mortality. Currently, there is no definitive evidence from randomised clinical trials for the optimal management of ACS in older patients. Thus, clinical decision-making should be person-centred and considered on a case-by-case basis involving the multidisciplinary team, pharmacy, patient, family/caregiving staff in order to provide the best quality management for this vulnerable patient group.

### Invasive versus conservative strategies in older adults with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116JtxLB]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) is a common condition among older adults. However, due to frailty and comorbidities, older adults are often underrepresented in clinical trials, making the decision between an invasive or conservative approach for optimal management controversial. Our meta-analysis seeks to address this issue by focusing exclusively on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic database literature search was conducted via PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify RCTs comparing invasive and conservative management strategies in older adults with NSTE-ACS. Data on unplanned revascularization, myocardial infarction (MI), bleeding, all-cause mortality, composite of major adverse outcomes, and stroke were extracted and pooled. Random-effects models to calculate pooled risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were analyzed using the Review Manager software. A total of seven RCTs and a total of 2997 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The invasive approach demonstrated a lower risk of unplanned revascularization (RR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.55; p < 0.00001; I² = 28%) and MI (RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.94; p = 0.01; I² = 34%). No significant differences were found for major bleeding episodes (RR: 1.40; 95% CI: 0.93, 2.14; p = 0.11), all-cause mortality (RR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.12; p = 0.49), composite of major adverse events (RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.05; p = 0.14) and risk of stroke (RR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.59, 1.20; p = 0.34) between the two strategies. Our findings reveal that, in older adults with NSTE-ACS, an invasive strategy reduces the risk of subsequent MI and unplanned revascularization. However, no significant differences in mortality, bleeding, or stroke were observed between the two groups.

### Lipid management in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes: a review [^112C2ng3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite many improvements in its prevention and management, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Lipid management is an important part of secondary prevention after ACS, but many patients currently remain undertreated and do not attain guideline-recommended levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction. This review details the current state of evidence on lipid management in patients presenting with ACS, provides directions for identification of patients who may benefit from early escalation of lipid-lowering therapy, and discusses novel lipid-lowering medication that is currently under investigation in clinical trials. Moreover, a treatment algorithm aimed at attaining guideline-recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels is proposed. Despite important advances in the initial treatment and secondary prevention of ACS, ≈20% of ACS survivors experience a subsequent ischemic cardiovascular event within 24 months, and 5-year mortality ranges from 19% to 22%. Knowledge of the current state of evidence-based lipid management after ACS is of paramount importance to improve outcomes after ACS.

### Updates and current recommendations for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: what it means for clinical practice [^116b9UiC]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) have recently updated their joint guidelines for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS, including unstable angina [UA] and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]). These guidelines replace the 2007 guidelines and the focused updates from 2011 and 2012 and now combine UA and NSTEMI into a new classification, NSTE-ACS, and updating the terminology around noninvasive management to ischemia-guided strategy. The latest guidelines include updated recommendations for the use of the oral antiplatelet agents (P2Y12 inhibitors) prasugrel and ticagrelor as part of dual-antiplatelet therapy-the cornerstone of treatment for these patients. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the new and modified recommendations for the management of patients with NSTE-ACS and the evidence supporting them. Also, where appropriate, similarities and differences between the current recommendations of the AHA/ACC and those of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) are highlighted. For example, the AHA/ACC recommends the P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor over clopidogrel in all patients with NSTE-ACS and clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor for patients in whom percutaneous coronary intervention is planned, whereas the ESC guidelines specifically recommend individual P2Y12 inhibitors for particular patient subgroups.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113QBnoi]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Gaps in knowledge and future directions — research priorities and guideline integration emphasize that gaps persist due to limited trial representation and that future research should focus on RCTs including a broader spectrum of older adults (≥ 75 years of age). Comprehensive assessments of frailty, cognitive function, and life expectancy should be integrated into revascularization guidelines, and developing tools for individualized decision-making that incorporate patient preferences, geriatric risks, and holistic care outcomes is essential. Proteomic and genomic profiling could enhance patient stratification by identifying biomarkers associated with aging, frailty, and cardiovascular risk, and enhanced shared decision-making frameworks that incorporate patient preferences, life expectancy, and personalized risk profiles are essential to guide optimal revascularization strategies for older adults.

### Invasive versus conservative management among older adult Patients with non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114ydxQA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Including the SENIOR‐RITA trial doubled the sample size in the current meta‐analysis compared with the latest meta‐analysis, which may have improved the precision of CIs for all end pointsand affirmed the finding of no significant difference in major bleeding within a larger sample size. Our results also demonstrated a numerical trend towards fewer MACE among the invasive group. Furthermore, the SENIOR‐RITA trial included a more comprehensive group of older adult patients without excluding patients who were frail or had a high comorbidity burden. By including this trial, our analysis encompasses a broader group of patients, including those with cognitive impairment and frailty, a population that was excluded from many previous trials.

Overall, a selection bias for an invasive approach in patients with fewer geriatric syndromes is likely seen in the community and not matched in clinical trials. Only the SENIOR‐RITAand MOSCA‐FRAILtrials directly assessed geriatric syndromes and frailty. It is plausible that among frail patients, the overall value of coronary revascularization is offset by systemic deconditioning, poor recovery, and increased risk for complications. Our subgroup analysis could not identify an interaction in MACE according to frailty; however, this was only based on data from the aforementioned 2 trials, and larger data from further trials are needed to ascertain the interaction between frailty and management approaches for older adult patients with NSTEMI. Other exploratory analyses in our analysis could not identify subgroup‐significant differences in outcomes according to age groups ≥ 70 years, ≥ 75 years, and ≥ 80 years.

The current study results consolidate few concepts in our understanding of the role of an invasive approach in the management of older adult patients with NSTEMI. Our analysis demonstrated that an invasive approach among older adult patients with NSTEMI might help in improving quality of life and reducing hospitalizations by avoiding recurrent MI and urgent revascularization without an increase in complications. Expectedly in this age group, we were not able to demonstrate a survival benefit with invasive versus conservative approaches. Collectively, among older adult patients with NSTEMI, routine invasive therapy can be considered, but it should be tailored to the patient's clinical presentation, including angina burden, the complexity of their coronary anatomy, and higher‐risk features (such as ventricular arrhythmias or left ventricular systolic dysfunction), and should involve a "collaborative decision‐making process taking into account patients'" functional status and frailty.

### Hospitals with and without percutaneous coronary intervention capability: considerations for treating acute coronary syndromes [^116hmk6d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The crucial aim in the emergency management of patients presenting with chest pain is the identification of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and the initiation of appropriate treatment. Institution-specific triage to initial medical or interventional therapies is influenced by the availability of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) facilities. Although the use of invasive strategies has increased, most US hospitals do not have PCI facilities. Pharmacological management is an integral part of all treatment strategies, regardless of the availability of interventional capability. Given the growing importance of invasive management strategies, a therapy that is compatible with both medical and invasive therapy options is becoming increasingly important. Aspirin and clopidogrel are recommended for patients with ACS regardless of the conservative or invasive management strategy. With enoxaparin, patients with ACS can seamlessly transition from the medical management phase to the interventional management phase without the need for introducing a second anticoagulant in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Fondaparinux can be used for patients with ACS treated medically, but should not be used alone during PCI because of the risk of catheter thrombosis. Bivalirudin can be used in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients who are managed invasively.

### Differences in treatment and clinical outcomes in patients aged ≥ 75 years compared with those aged ≤ 74 years following acute coronary syndromes: a prospective multicentre study [^113U8qft]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A global ageing population makes cardiovascular disease an even greater challenge. Registry data suggest that older adults ≥ 75 years of age represent approximately 30% of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) cases and 40% of non-STEMI (NSTEMI) cases in European hospitals. Despite this large burden of older adults presenting with ACS to cardiac units, most of the knowledge gaps in the current literature exist in older adults age group ≥ 75 yearsand the majority of clinical trials recruit patients aged < 75 years. Thus, data to generate quality standards of healthcare for older adults with coronary disease are insufficient. Therefore, it is not surprising that a considerable number of older patients do not receive guideline-directed medical therapy following ACS.

ACS in older adults may be complicated by the increased likelihood of concomitant comorbidities. It is well established that ACS in older patients frequently occurs in those with a greater comorbidity burden. Older patients are at risk of being affected by geriatric syndromes, which encompasses frailty, multimorbidity, cognitive impairment, functional decline, nutritional deficiencies and polypharmacy, which are in turn directly associated with cardiovascular disease and influence the multidisciplinary team decision for management of these patients.

Medical therapy of ACS frequently imposes a tablet burden on patients of all ages. Older adults are at particularly greater risk of bleeding from antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy, falls and syncope secondary to antihypertensive therapy, as well as bradycardia and chronotropic incompetence secondary to beta-blockade. Moreover, there is limited evidence to the short-term and long-term clinical outcomes for ACS patients aged ≥ 75 years. This study describes the differences in treatment and clinical outcomes in patients aged ≥ 75 years compared with those aged ≤ 74 years presenting with ACS and undergoing invasive management.

### Frailty and cardiovascular health [^116AUxsM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Not surprisingly, the inclusion of frailty in the risk assessment of older adults undergoing cardiovascular procedures improves the predictive performance of existing risk stratification tools. The most recent version of the CathPCI Registry model for predicting in‐hospital mortality risk following PCI included frailty as one of the strongest predictors of risk in the final full model. Similarly, functional mobility as a proxy for frailty status was the strongest predictor in models predicting 30‐day readmission risk and 6‐month mortality among older adults (75 years and older) admitted with AMI. In response to the predictive value of frailty status and other geriatric syndromes, a recent expert panel proposed their inclusion as a key pillar of risk in older adults being considered for cardiovascular intervention. The authors propose a comprehensive geriatric risk assessment in patients being considered for invasive cardiovascular procedures that includes an assessment of frailty using one of the many validated measurement tools before synthesizing the information gleaned from that assessment with the Geriatric Heart Team to arrive at a shared person‐centered decision. A key future area of investigation will center around the impact of routine implementation of frailty assessments and interventions to modify frailty in patients with ischemic heart disease.

Finally, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In this context, there is a need to study patients with prefrailty in midlife to see whether interventions that can improve physical function and reduce frailty can delay or prevent the development of frailty in later life when the risk of CVD is highest(Figure 3).

### A geriatric approach to percutaneous coronary interventions in older adults, part II: AExpert panel [^115ZQJ34]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The assessment of geriatric syndromes in older adults is essential and complementary to more traditional cardiovascular risk assessment approaches given the strong association of these risk factors with both short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. In part 1 of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in older adults, we reviewed the 4 pillars of risk in patients presenting for possible PCI, proposing geriatric syndromes as the fourth pillar of risk to consider in older adults. In Part 2, we will review the components of a comprehensive geriatric assessment in older adults being considered for PCI and consider how this information can be used to inform person-centered decisions in collaboration with the "geriatric" heart team. We also review critical periprocedural pharmacotherapeutic considerations in older adults, as well as gaps in current knowledge to guide future areas of investigation.

Evidence gaps — initial evaluation and management of ACS highlight limited prospective randomized data on using risk scores to determine treatment strategies, note that the highest risk patients are those who present after a cardiac arrest, indicate potential benefit of coronary angiography may be attenuated in those who are comatose, and state it is less clear whether reperfusion with either fibrinolysis or primary PCI provides clinical benefit in ST-segment elevation patients who present late after symptom onset (12 to 48 hours) but are no longer symptomatic, with further research needed to define the role of coronary angiography and revascularization in these subgroups.

### Invasive treatment strategy in adults with frailty and non-ST-Segment elevation myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^112M5tbq]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this extended follow-up of a randomized clinical trial of patients with frailty and NSTEMI who were clinically stable on admission, an initial invasive strategy did not yield conclusive midterm improvements compared with a conservative approach with watchful observation. However, there was a time-dependent pattern in the distribution of deaths between the treatment strategies. Specifically, the initial invasive treatment was associated with early harm during the first year, followed by a late benefit. This pattern suggests a phenomenon in which a susceptible population is depleted of the most vulnerable cases who experience an event at an early phase, which is particularly evident in patients with higher levels of frailty (CFS score > 4). Therefore, an initial conservative strategy may be more appropriate for patients with NSTEMI and high levels of frailty. These findings provide valuable insights for clinical decision-making in this vulnerable patient population.

### Refining the role of antiplatelet therapy in medically managed patients with acute coronary syndrome [^116gAKsD]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor is recommended for use as first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) who undergo high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention. However, revascularization may not be a beneficial option for some subgroups of patients with ACS. This includes a broad spectrum of lower risk patients as well as high-risk patients with numerous previous revascularizations and those who are at high risk for complications, such as those with complex coronary anatomy and co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or advanced age and frailty. For such patients, there remains an unmet need for evaluation of alternatives to the currently recommended treatment options. Notably, there is a paucity of prospective data regarding management approaches to medically managed patients with ACS. Thus, this group of medically managed patients with ACS would benefit from inclusion in clinical trials investigating therapeutic options for patients not scheduled to undergo invasive procedures, such as those who are targeted for pharmacologic management only. In conclusion, in this review, the investigators revisit data from clinical studies of dual-antiplatelet therapy in ACS to highlight areas of unmet need in antiplatelet therapy in patients with ACS and to examine the use of newer agents in subgroups, such as medically managed patients with ACS, that would potentially benefit from more potent platelet inhibition after ACS.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — aspirin: In patients with ACS, an initial oral loading dose of aspirin, followed by daily low-dose aspirin, is recommended to reduce death and MACE (COR I, LOE A). Aspirin should be initiated with a loading dose (162–325 mg) in patients with ACS without an absolute contraindication as soon as possible on presentation irrespective of final management strategy (invasive or noninvasive), followed by a daily maintenance dose; current evidence supports the use of uncoated low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg) for daily maintenance therapy; among patients with ACS referred for an invasive strategy, continued use of full-dose aspirin (300–325 mg daily) for 30 days (following an initial loading dose) was not superior to low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg daily) for reduction of MACE but was associated with increased minor and gastrointestinal bleeding; in patients who cannot take oral medication, rectal or intravenous (where available) administration are options for administration.

### Timing and completeness of revascularisation in acute coronary syndromes [^113PVei7]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Against this background, a routine invasive strategy is recommended in patients with an established diagnosis of NSTEACS with a timing based on individual risk stratification, as summarised in figure 2 and table 1. Whereas, a selective invasive strategy or non-invasive imaging to guide invasive coronary angiography should be limited to low-risk patients (ie, patients with low-to-intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease, normal or inconclusive cardiac troponin and/or ECG) (figure 2).

Figure 2
Timing and revascularisation strategy in patients presenting with NSTEACS. *It is reasonable to consider a physiology-guided strategy to complete revascularisation in patients with NSTEACS with multivessel disease. NSTEACS, non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome; NSTEMI, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.

Table 1
Risk stratification of patients presenting with NSTEACS

The recently published European Guidelines for the management of patients with NSTEACS have established a class I level A indication to undergo coronary angiography within 24 hours of hospital admission to high-risk patients presenting with NSTEACS. Despite the 24-hour benchmark might seem arbitrary (as different studies have included a different interval time to define early invasive strategy), when assessing the relationship between median difference in time to angiography and clinical outcomes, a significant association in post hoc metaregression with regard to non-fatal myocardial infarction was found in the individual patient data meta-analysis performed by Jobs et al. This might imply that an early-as-possible rather than a < 24-hour approach could represent the best strategy, easing the pressure on the infrastructure. However, baseline risk assessment remains the key, as benefit with an early invasive strategy is strongly associated with patient′s risk profile.

### A delicate matter: the burden of frailty on AMI-CS [^1136AXjF]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Frailty, a term frequently encountered in the realm of geriatric medicine, has become a critical determinant in the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular diseases, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and heart failure (HF). This concept, while simple in its essence, is a complex interplay of decreased physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes across multiple organ systems. The frailty piece of the geriatric syndrome, often characterized by a constellation of physical, cognitive, and functional impairments, is a key marker of vulnerability that significantly influences not only outcomes but also clinical decision-making. The definitions of frailty, though varied, commonly converge on the presence of reduced strength, endurance, and physiological function. Frailty is assessed through several validated scales and indices, each aiming to quantify the severity and its potential impact on health outcomes. Among these, the Frailty Index, Hospital Frailty Risk Score, and Physical Frailty Phenotype are widely recognized for their predictive value in clinical settings. These assessment tools have been validated in prior studies examining the influence frailty exerts on the outcomes of cardiovascular disease. The negative impact of frailty on outcomes could be related to medication intolerance, procedural complications, and notably, a heightened risk of in-hospital mortality.

As the global demographic shifts toward an aging population, the prevalence of frailty and its implications in the context of acute cardiovascular events have become prominent. Older adults, who represent a growing proportion of patients presenting with AMI and HF, are particularly susceptible to the deleterious effects of frailty. Prior work has shown that adherence to guideline recommendations for the management of AMI in both older people and those with multiple comorbidities lower compared to younger patients. This is coupled with evidence showing that people with frailty are less likely to receive invasive coronary angiography or revascularization and had longer hospitalizations, contributing to poorer outcomes. The impact of frailty has also been examined in HF studies, such as the prospective registry FRAGILE-HF (Prevalence and Prognostic Value of Physical and Social Frailty in Geriatric Patients Hospitalized for HF), found there were multiple frailty domains prevalent in hospitalized elderly patients with HF which negatively impacted outcomes. These effects were even more exaggerated in frail patients presenting decompensated HF.

Cardiac rehabilitation recommendations — patients with ACS should be referred to an outpatient CR program prior to hospital discharge to reduce death, MI, hospital readmissions, and improve functional status and QOL (COR 1, LOE A), and in patients with ACS, a home-based CR program is a reasonable alternative to a center-based CR program to improve functional status and QOL (COR 2a, LOE B-R).

Post-discharge secondary prevention after acute coronary syndromes (ACS): After discharge, focus on secondary prevention is fundamental, with a fasting lipid panel recommended 4 to 8 weeks after initiating or adjusting the dose of lipid-lowering therapy, and referral to cardiac rehabilitation is also recommended, with the option for home-based programs for patients unable or unwilling to attend in person.

Non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) — routine invasive or selective invasive initial approach is summarized as follows: In patients with NSTE-ACS who are at intermediate or high risk of ischemic events and are appropriate candidates for revascularization, an invasive approach with the intent to proceed with revascularization is recommended during hospitalization to reduce MACE. In patients with NSTE-ACS who are at low risk of ischemic events, either a routine invasive or selective invasive approach is recommended to help identify those who may require revascularization and to reduce MACE. In patients with NSTE-ACS who have refractory angina or hemodynamic or electrical instability, an immediate invasive strategy with intent to perform revascularization is indicated to reduce MACE. In patients with NSTE-ACS who are at high risk of ischemic events, it is reasonable to choose an early invasive strategy (within 24 hours) to reduce MACE. In patients with NSTE-ACS who are not at high risk and are intended for an invasive strategy, it is reasonable to perform angiography before hospital discharge to reduce MACE.

### Acute coronary care in the elderly, part II: ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association council on clinical cardiology: in collaboration with the society of geriatric cardiology [^114pHY1B]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Age is an important determinant of outcomes for patients with acute coronary syndromes. However, community practice reveals a disproportionately lower use of cardiovascular medications and invasive treatment even among elderly patients who would stand to benefit. Limited trial data are available to guide care of older adults, which results in uncertainty about benefits and risks, particularly with newer medications or invasive treatments and in the setting of advanced age and complex health status.

Methods and Results

Part II of this American Heart Association scientific statement summarizes evidence on presentation and treatment of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction in relation to age (< 65, 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and ≥ 85 years). The purpose of this statement is to identify areas in which the evidence is sufficient to guide practice in the elderly and to highlight areas that warrant further study. Treatment-related benefits should rise in an elderly population, yet data to confirm these benefits are limited, and the heterogeneity of older populations increases treatment-associated risks. Elderly patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction more often have relative and absolute contraindications to reperfusion, so eligibility for reperfusion declines with age, and yet elderly patients are less likely to receive reperfusion even if eligible. Data support a benefit from reperfusion in elderly subgroups up to age 85 years. The selection of reperfusion strategy is determined more by availability, time from presentation, shock, and comorbidity than by age. Additional data are needed on selection and dosing of adjunctive therapies and on complications in the elderly. A "one-size-fits-all" approach to care in the oldest old is not feasible, and ethical issues will remain even in the presence of adequate evidence. Nevertheless, if the contributors to treatment benefits and risks are understood, guideline-recommended care may be applied in a patient-centered manner in the oldest subset of patients.

Conclusions

Few trials have adequately described treatment effects in older patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. In the future, absolute and relative risks for efficacy and safety in age subgroups should be reported, and trials should make efforts to enroll the elderly in proportion to their prevalence among the treated population. Outcomes of particular relevance to the older adult, such as quality of life, physical function, and independence, should also be evaluated, and geriatric conditions unique to this age group, such as frailty and cognitive impairment, should be considered for their influence on care and outcomes. With these efforts, treatment risks can be minimized, and benefits can be placed within the health context of the elderly patient.

### Invasive versus conservative strategy in older adults ≥ 75 Years of age with non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113tWbmR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Although providing pivotal insights on the benefit of revascularization in older adults, this meta‐analysis has limitations. Although we included 9 trials, our sample size was limited to 2429 patients. This reemphasizes the underrepresentation of older adults in RCTs and the dearth of evidence that limits generalizability to those with high burden of frailty, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and other geriatric conditions. Additionally, we used trial‐level data instead of patient‐level data, which would be useful in further baseline characteristics‐adjusted analysis. Another limitation to highlight includes the heterogeneity among the trials and associated data. There was moderate heterogeneity (I² = 37%) among the included studies. This can be partially attributable to the inclusion of the MOSCA study, which had numerically higher MI in the invasive arm. The exclusion of this trial from the analysis improved the heterogeneity among the studies (I² = 0%). Moreover, there was significant heterogeneity noted for the bleeding end point (I² = 73%), which might compromise our ability to render conclusions. The inclusion of selective invasive strategies in the control arm could have introduced bias that may favor conservative management. Only 3 trials had "only optimal medical therapy" as their conservative arm, which limits the comparator group. Despite this limitation, an invasive strategy was still associated with improved outcomes including the composite of death and MI, as well as MI alone and subsequent revascularization — all important outcomes for older adults. Outcomes beyond major adverse cardiovascular events were not included in trials. This emphasizes the need to study health‐related quality of life, disability, time at home, and other important noncardiovascular outcomes in future trials enrolling the older adult populations. Furthermore, the use of revascularization with either PCI or CABG was approximately 55% in the invasive strategy. This precludes the identification of the true benefit of revascularization in the older adult population. Moreover, 4 of the included trials are subanalysis of the original trials, and 2 of the recent trials were terminated early and were individually underpowered due to small sample size. Another limitation is that the included studies did not identify the type of MI. Type II MI is known to have worse prognosis than type I. It is possible that the lack of statistically significant mortality reduction is due to a proportion of the included patients having type II MI and hence less than anticipated mortality benefit from the invasive strategy. Finally, some trials included in this analysis are almost 2 decades old. With improvement in PCI techniques, newer generation stents, and potent P2Y12 inhibitors, outcomes with revascularization are likely to continue to improve.

### The management of multi-morbidity in elderly patients: ready yet for precision medicine in intensive care? [^111ujkGw]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multi-morbidity is defined as the co-occurrence of multiple, usually two or more, chronic conditions in an individual. There have been several attempts to establish criteria for the conditions which qualify for this count. These initiatives range from refining the set of eligible conditions and including the number of affected body systems to considering patterns of recurrences and deterioration. Pearson-Stuttard et al. have suggested multi-morbidity metrics based on the onset and sequence of diseases and the clustering of conditions. However, none of these new approaches have been universally accepted so far.

The combination of certain diseases can trigger super-additive interactions resulting in an enhanced effect on functional abilities, quality of life as well as life expectancy and, eventually, may create complex health needs. This especially affects old individuals with an age-related decline in organ function and increase of vulnerability to stress even in the absence of multi-morbidity. Since advanced age is the most important risk factor for multi-morbidity, the prevalence of multi-morbidity is close to 90% in patients aged 85 years or older. Previously devastating and often-fatal diseases have been transformed by modern medicine into chronic conditions. Since the longevity of the population is also increasing, these developments are turning multi-morbidity into a major challenge in the world of critical care. Even in intensive care units (ICUs) designed to manage single-organ conditions, such as cardiac/coronary ICU's, multi-morbidity has become highly prevalent and an important contributor to outcome prediction.

After many years of research and innovation, mainly in primary and geriatric care, the concept of multi-morbidity now requires fine-tuning to support decision-making for patients along their whole trajectory in healthcare. Critical care medicine has a particular need for rapid improvement and development since it is mostly organ/system-centred, with survival being the main outcome measure. The holistic view needed for multi-morbid elderly patients, and their individual requirements, still remains a work in progress. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK had to recommend a more holistic approach beyond single scores for organ failure or frailty for deciding about admission to critical care. In particular, it advised that comorbidities and underlying health conditions should be considered when assessing the potential benefit of critical care for the individual patient. This article will discuss challenges and present approaches to integrate multi-morbidity into the decision-making processes in critical care.

### Contemporary revascularization dilemmas in older adults [^115seSZS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

There remains a need for randomized clinical trials and international guidelines for the management of ACS in frail elderly patients. The IFFANIAM (Impact of Frailty and Functional Status on Outcomes in Elderly Patients With ST‐Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Undergoing Primary Angioplasty): Rationale and Design is studying patients aged > 75 years with STEMI at admission, specifically assessing baseline functional status (Barthel index and Lawton‐Brody index), frailty (Fried criteria and FRAIL scale [fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight]), comorbidities (Charlson index), nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment–Short Form), and quality of life (Seattle Angina Questionnaire). The primary outcome the authors plan to assess includes 1‐year mortality and its cause. 17 The MOSCA‐FRAIL (Invasive Versus Conservative Strategy in Frail Patients with NSTEMI) trial is currently comparing invasive and conservative strategies in elderly frail patients with NSTEMI. 18

Major take‐home points:
Frailty has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of mortality, longer hospital stay, increased use of resources, and higher risk of delirium.
In the United States, frailty is common in patients hospitalized with acute MI, conferring a higher mortality risk that increases with age. PCI in this more frail, older group still confers a strong survival benefit.
Frailty risk stratification scores, such as the Clinical Frailty Scale, have been shown to be independent predictors of mortality after STEMI; thus, their use to risk stratify such patients may improve clinical outcomes.
Recent studies have not shown a difference in the rate of procedural and in‐hospital complications to be significantly different between frail and nonfrail older patients, indicating that frail patients can safely undergo PCI with similar complication rates to nonfrail patients.
Cardiologists should think about frailty when assessing elderly patients with ACS; timing before revascularization or valvular procedures is particularly important.
There is an unmet need for randomized clinical trials to guide the application of frailty assessment in older adults with cardiac disease.

### A geriatric approach to percutaneous coronary interventions in older adults, part II: AExpert panel [^1179EGxU]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Person-centered goals of care

While the implementation of the comprehensive geriatric risk assessment into a heart team approach for complex decisions around PCI is a priority, the incorporation of that information into the broader context of individual patient priorities, preferences, and risk tolerance in older individuals is another challenge. Clinicians are faced with the task of eliciting individual health goals of the patient and advising the patient and caregivers on the best course of action to meet those goals. As noted above, an added layer of complexity is the fact that some of the geriatric syndromes that increase the risk of PCI are also associated with the greatest potential cardiovascular benefit gained from the procedure.

While major adverse cardiovascular events remain the standard reported outcomes for patients admitted with ACS, many of these traditional metrics become less important to individual patients as they reach an advanced age. Parallel to improvement in survival and reduction in cardiovascular outcomes during follow-up, older people may be more likely to prioritize health status and wellbeing compared with younger people. Recent randomized clinical trials in cardiology have recognized the importance of outcomes beyond major adverse cardiovascular events, with more person-centered outcomes such as days alive and out of hospital and disability-free survival being highlighted in multiple recent large randomized trials.,

Assessing what matters most to patients is foundational in shared decision-making. Aspects that are particularly important to older patients may include: 1) improvement in ischemic symptom burden; 2) functional independence; 3) remaining at home; 4) improvement in quality-of-life and wellbeing; 5) avoidance of rehospitalization; 6) avoidance of loneliness, isolation, and malnutrition; 7) avoidance of falls, physical disability, and frailty; 8) access to health care and social services; and 9) establishment of end of life goals of care.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) efficacy and default duration — The double-blind placebo-controlled CURE trial (n = 12562) demonstrated that DAPT with clopidogrel yields a consistent reduction in composite ischemic events versus aspirin alone in NSTE-ACS managed medically, and subsequent studies showed that DAPT with prasugrel or ticagrelor administered for 1 year provides incremental reductions in ischemic events albeit with excess bleeding as compared with clopidogrel; importantly, patients at elevated bleeding risk were typically excluded in early studies, and therefore the default strategy for a minimum DAPT duration of 1 year is most applicable to patients without high bleeding risk presenting with ACS, while in select patients who have tolerated DAPT it may be reasonable to extend treatment beyond 1 year after considering risks for long-term bleeding and thrombosis.

### Impact of an invasive strategy in the elderly hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome with emphasis on the nonagenarians [^111ddaM9]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Published data about nonagenarians with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were mainly descriptive and limited by small sample sizes and unadjusted outcomes. We aim to describe the characteristics, management, and the impact of an invasive strategy on major adverse events in elderly patients hospitalized with ACS with focus on the nonagerians.

Methods and Results

We analyzed data collected as part of the AMI-OPTIMA study, a cluster-randomized study of knowledge translation intervention versus usual care on optimal discharge medications in patients admitted with ACS at 24 Canadian hospitals. To determine whether an invasive strategy improved outcomes in the elderly, we used inverse probability weighting to adjust for confounders between patients who underwent invasive versus conservative strategies. Of 4,569 consecutive patients: 2,395 (52%) were < 70years old, 1,031 (23%) were septuagenarians, 941 (21%) were octogenarians, and 202 (4.4%) were nonagenarians. An invasive strategy was associated with reduced in-hospital all-cause mortality in all age groups: 1.1% versus 3.8% in patients < 70years old (P < 0.001), 2.9% versus 7.4% in septuagenarians (P < 0.001), 5.1% versus 14.7% in octogenarians (P < 0.001), and 12.0% versus 25.1% in nonagenarians (P = 0.001). An invasive strategy was also associated with higher thrombolysis in myocardial infarction major bleeds in the nonagenarians (9.0% vs. 2.0%; P = 0.003).

Conclusions

The reduction in in-hospital mortality associated with an invasive strategy in elderly and nonagenarians presented with ACS is generating hypothesis and merits further studies to confirm these benefits and to guide clinicians in the management of these high-risk patients.

Impact of Frailty in Elderly Patients With ACS

Age plays a major role in the morbidity and mortality of patients with ACS and is an important factor in contemporary risk assessment scores, such as the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score and the GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) score. Frailty, representing decreased physiological reserve leading to increased vulnerability, increases the risk of ACS and its consequences in the elderly population. Frailty has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of mortality, longer hospital stay, increased use of resources, and higher risk of delirium. Frail elderly women are a particularly high‐risk group, as female sex has been shown to be an independent predictor of frailty in elderly patients with ACS and has been shown to be associated with higher mortality. In a study investigating the relationship between age of frailty and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing PCI in 2080 young‐old patients (aged 60–75 years) and 1104 frail old patients (aged > 75 years) presenting with non–ST‐segment–elevation ACS, older patients with frailty were more likely to be women and to have extensive comorbidities, including a history of heart failure, than other patients. They were also less likely to be given guideline‐directed therapy, such as aspirin, statin, and clopidogrel, and were less likely to be offered PCI compared with the younger group (18.8% versus 37.1%). Patients in this group were also 3 times more likely to die compared with young‐old patients at 30 days (8.2% versus 3.6%; P < 0.001). An early invasive strategy with PCI was found to be associated with lower mortality in both the young‐old (odds ratio [OR], 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31–0.98) and in the frail old patients (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.19–0.99). Thus, although frail old patients had a higher 30‐day mortality than young‐old patients, invasive management was found to significantly reduce 30‐day mortality. 10 In another study of patients aged > 75 years being evaluated during admission for acute myocardial infarction (MI), the median age was found to be 82 years, 53% were women, and 75% were white, with prevalence of frailty being 19%. The frail patients were more likely to be older and more likely to be women and ethnic minority members, with more extensive comorbidities. Frail patients were much less likely to undergo PCI compared with nonfrail patients (15% versus 33%; P < 0.001). Although the use of PCI was much less likely in frail older patients, they were still likely to derive a survival benefit from PCI (OR, 0.59; P < 0.001). The results of these studies demonstrate that in the United States, frailty is common in patients hospitalized with acute MI, conferring a higher mortality risk that increases with age. PCI in this more frail, older group still confers a strong survival benefit. 11 In a study that evaluated the timing of invasive treatment, duration of hospitalization, and rate of in‐hospital complications in patients aged > 75 years with non–ST‐segment–elevation MI (NSTEMI), the rate of procedural complications between the 2 groups was 3.3% in frail versus 5.7% in nonfrail patients (P = 0.377) and 8.2% versus 3.3% (P = 0.136) for in‐hospital complications. Thus, the rate of procedural and in‐hospital complications has not been shown to be significantly different between frail and nonfrail older patients, indicating that frail patients can safely undergo PCI with similar complication rates to nonfrail patients. 12

### Invasive versus conservative management among older adult Patients with non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116CeRBv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has limitations. First, it was a study‐level meta‐analysis without individual patient data. This precluded further granular analyses. Second, geriatric syndromes were only explicit in the MOSCA‐FRAIL and SENIOR‐RITA trials, so we performed a subgroup analysis that showed possible interaction in outcomes based on frailty status. Geriatric syndromes are a pragmatic reason for pursuing a conservative approach in older adult patients; therefore, future research should focus on assessing outcomes in patients with geriatric syndromes that are commonly prevalent in the community to further understand this relationship. Third, there was heterogeneity in the percutaneous coronary intervention technique utilized in each individual trial, as not all patients who underwent coronary angiography received percutaneous coronary intervention. Last, the definition of MACE varied between the included studies.

European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

There remains uncertainty over optimal antithrombotic management strategy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) presenting with an acute coronary syndrome and/or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention/stenting. Clinicians need to balance the risk of stroke and thromboembolism against the risk of recurrent cardiac ischaemia and/or stent thrombosis and the risk of bleeding. The full consensus document comprehensively reviews the published evidence and presents a consensus statement on a 'best practice' antithrombotic therapy guideline for the management of antithrombotic therapy in such AF patients. This executive summary highlights the main recommendations from the consensus document.

### Association between frailty and management and outcomes of acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock [^116ejveJ]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This nationally representative study assessed the association between frailty, clinical management, and clinical outcomes in AMI-CS hospitalizations. First, the prevalence of frailty in AMI-CS hospitalization is high, with nearly three-quarters being frail. Second, frailty during AMI-CS hospitalization was associated with higher rates of mortality and in-hospital complications such as bleeding, delirium, and longer LOS than those with nonfrail status. Third, frailty in AMI-CS was associated with a lower likelihood of coronary artery revascularization and temporary MCS devices. Lastly, among the frail group, those who underwent coronary revascularization experienced lower in-hospital mortality. However, mortality benefit from MCS was observed specifically in the frail group and not the nonfrail.

Our findings suggest that frailty is more prevalent in adults hospitalized with AMI-CS than in other cardiovascular conditions. Up to 70% of AMI-CS hospitalizations had frailty, which could be attributed to the combined burden of 2 acute CVD diagnoses (AMI and CS). Furthermore, on the opposite end, the reduced overall reserve in frail individuals makes them more susceptible to CS following AMI. Previous studies reported varying rates of frailty in CVD. For example, frailty prevalence in patients with acute CVD has been reported to range from 24 to 86%, varying according to the underlying CVD process. The variability in the reported rates can be attributed to multiple factors, such as the lack of standardized diagnosis, assessment tools for frailty, and the differences in underlying CVD severity. Furthermore, our study revealed that hospitalizations for AMI-CS with concomitant frailty were associated with a 40% in-hospital mortality rate. Similar to the current study, previous registries, such as the LONGEVO-SCA (Impact of Frailty and Other Geriatric Syndromes on the Management and Vital Prognosis of the Elderly with Acute Coronary Syndrome without ST Segment Elevation) registry and TRILOGY ACS (Targeted Platelet Inhibition to Clarify the Optimal Strategy to Medically Manage Acute Coronary Syndromes) trial, demonstrated up to 40% in-hospital mortality rates in patients with ACS who were considered frail. The high mortality rates among frail adults may be attributed to a higher number of comorbidities and higher rates of sarcopenia, reduced physiological reserve, and diminished rehabilitation potential. However, it remains unknown if interventions that directly target frailty can improve outcomes in AMI-CS complicated by frailty.

The spectrum of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) including unstable angina, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and ST-elevation myocardial infarction accounts for increasing numbers of deaths among persons age ≥ 65 years in the US. This is important given demographic changes involving falling birth rates and increasing life expectancy. Elderly patients are likely to benefit the most from treatment of ACS, even though community practice still demonstrates less use of cardiac medications as an early-invasive approach among this population.

Initial evaluation — synopsis and comprehensive history elements in the emergency department (ED): Patients presenting to the ED with nontraumatic chest pain are a frequent diagnostic challenge. The priorities are rapid initiation of optimal management for life-threatening conditions such as acute coronary syndromes (ACS), aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as nonvascular syndromes (eg, esophageal rupture, tension pneumothorax), and deliberate therapy for those with less critical illness. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is important to the evaluation, but history, examination, biomarkers, and other aids remain essential, and there is frequently a lack of correlation between intensity of symptoms and seriousness of disease. A comprehensive history that captures chest pain characteristics — nature, onset and duration, location and radiation, precipitating factors, relieving factors, and associated symptoms — can help better identify potential cardiac causes and should be obtained from all patients.

### Invasive treatment strategy in adults with frailty and non-ST-Segment elevation myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^111XxBp7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This extended follow-up of a randomized clinical trial compared the midterm outcomes of invasive and conservative strategies in patients with frailty and NSTEMI. The main finding shows no differences in the number of days alive at the end of a median 1113-day follow-up. However, a distinctive course was observed with a change in direction, pointing to a reduced survival during the first year for patients who underwent invasive treatment, followed by a shift toward the opposite effect later.

The choice between invasive and conservative management strategies in patients with frailty and NSTEMI represents a clinical dilemma. Randomized clinical trials in older adults, suggest that the benefit of invasive treatment is similar to that observed in younger individuals. However, patients with frailty or comorbidities are underrepresented in clinical trials. The burden of comorbidities may offset the potential benefit of an invasive strategy. The MOSCA-FRAIL randomized clinical trial explicitly focused on patients with frailty and found no differences between the invasive and conservative approaches at 1-year follow-up. In the present analysis, we confirm the lack of differences irrespective of treatment approach in the number of days alive or readmissions, for cardiac or noncardiac causes, in a median follow-up of 1113 days.

A notable finding is that invasive treatment reduced survival during the first year, particularly in patients with the most severe frailty. However, this outcome progressively decreased beyond the first year and shifted to a late benefit. Given their reduced life expectancy, the initial harm matters in patients with frailty. This survival time course may be attributed to a phenomenon in which a population exposed to an intervention is depleted of the most vulnerable cases who experience the event at an early phase. Once the susceptible individuals are removed from the population, the risk of the intervention decreases. The critical point is identifying susceptible patients to avoid early mortality risk. Patients with the highest levels of frailty (CFS > 4) seem to be most susceptible in this case. The actual reasons for their susceptibility remain unknown, although we observed a higher rate of bleeding-related deaths and readmissions associated with the invasive strategy during the first year. On the other hand, the invasive strategy seemed to improve survival in patients with lower levels of frailty (CFS = 4); however, caution in interpreting this finding is warranted given the small number of patients in this subgroup.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115Ki7wc]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Noninterventional considerations and care coordination for older adults undergoing coronary revascularization — Multidisciplinary team-based care, patient education, and shared decision-making are particularly important for a strategy that is patient-centered, with patient-centered care integrating clinical expertise and the latest evidence with the patient's health priorities, life goals, preferences, values, and beliefs; assessing what matters most to patients is foundational, and older adults are more likely than younger adults to prioritize independence, mobility, functional status, and QoL rather than longevity. CR, a Class 1 recommendation for secondary prevention of adults undergoing coronary revascularization, provides an opportunity to deliver personalized approaches to cardiovascular and psychologic health, and continuity in care during transitions to home or rehabilitation is important given the greater prevalence of frailty, multimorbidity, depression, cognitive decline, diminished functional status, and higher symptom burden.

Coronary Artery Bypass Graft

Patients with frailty undergoing CABG will have a longer hospital stay, leading to a higher risk of developing disability, subsequent hospitalization, and mortality. In a registry of 500 older individuals (mean age, 71 years) undergoing urgent CABG for AMI, 60% qualified as having prefrailty and 14% as having frailty based on the Essential Frailty Toolset (EFT), and those who had frailty had a 3‐fold increase in all‐cause mortality. In a study of 13 554 US veterans who underwent CABG from 2016 to 2020, frailty identified an increased risk of mortality even among those younger than 60 years. This study raises the issue of what age should trigger a frailty assessment, as frailty, while more common in older adults, is independent of age. Finally, while frailty is frequently cited as an exclusion criterion for CABG surgery, it remains unknown whether opting for a less‐invasive treatment strategy in populations with frailty, such as PCI, improves the poor short‐ and long‐term outcomes observed in those undergoing surgery.

Heart Failure

Clinical guidelines for the management of HF do not provide specific recommendations for the use of medical therapy in the frail. This is due to the lack of RCTs designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacological therapies in individuals with frailty. However, post hoc and prespecified subgroup analyses from key clinical trials of HF have provided data on the effects of pharmacological interventions in these individuals. However, the data must be interpreted in the context of the inclusion and exclusion criteria applied in the trials (ie, patients with HF enrolled in clinical trials are typically younger and healthier than individuals with HF in the general population). These findings collectively challenge the common reluctance of clinicians to introduce new pharmacological therapies to patients who are perceived to have frailty because of doubts about the benefit of treatments and concerns about treatment intolerance and adverse events.

### Predictors of treatment in acute coronary syndromes in the elderly: impact on decision making and clinical outcome after interventional versus conservative treatment [^113rjQa2]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Management of elderly patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is not standardized and physicians discretion for invasive versus conservative strategies lacks sufficient evidence. The purpose of this analysis was, therefore, to evaluate treatment strategies and outcomes of elderly patients with ACS and to highlight reasons for the treatment decision in a consecutive series of elderly patients.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of 1,001 elderly patients (> 75 years) presenting with ACS. Patients were identified on the basis of their final discharge diagnosis. Baseline data, past medical history, cardiac and noncardiac concomitant diseases, treatment strategy, and adverse outcomes were evaluated, using patient's charts. Various co-variates were used to determine the association or predictive value of these co-variates to the invasive versus conservative management of the subjects. Thirty-day mortality and long-term survival were assessed either directly or in discharged patients via telephone interview with the patients, the patients' relatives or the primary care physicians.

Results

A total of 776 (77.5%) patients were treated invasively and 225 (22.5%) conservatively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with advanced age, Killip class > II, pre-existing coronary artery disease, prior stroke, pre-existing renal failure, obesity, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, prior ACS, and the presence of supraventricular arrhythmias were significantly more likely to undergo conservative treatment. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in conservatively treated patients (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

In this retrospective analysis, we identified age as the main predictor for a conservative treatment strategy in elderly patients, albeit an invasive strategy was associated with a significantly better outcome.

Conclusions

Given the importance of geriatric syndromes in the preprocedural assessment of older adults undergoing cardiac procedures, we propose the components of a comprehensive geriatric risk assessment, including periprocedural pharmacotherapy considerations, to provide a toolkit that can be implemented to help guide care decisions. We highlight key areas for ongoing investigation that will improve the decision-making process around invasive cardiovascular procedures for older adults in the near future.

### Acute coronary care in the elderly, part I: non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndromes: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association council on clinical cardiology: in collaboration with the society of geriatric cardiology [^112b6Gea]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Age is an important determinant of outcomes for patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS); however, community practice reveals a disproportionately lower use of cardiovascular medications and invasive treatment even among elderly patients with ACS who would stand to benefit. Reasons include limited trial data to guide the care of older adults and uncertainty about benefits and risks, particularly with newer medications or invasive treatments and in the setting of advanced age or complex health status.

Methods and Results

This 2-part American Heart Association scientific statement summarizes evidence on patient heterogeneity, clinical presentation, and treatment of non-ST-elevation ACS in relation to age (< 65, 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and ≥ 85 years). In addition, we review methodological issues that influence the acquisition and application of evidence to the elderly patients treated in community practice. A writing group combining international cardiovascular and geriatric perspectives convened to summarize available data from trials (5 combined Virtual Coordinating Center for Global Collaborative Cardiovascular Research [VIGOUR] trials) and 3 registries (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events, National Registry of Myocardial Infarction, and the Can Rapid risk stratification of Unstable angina patients Suppress ADverse outcomes with Early implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines national quality improvement initiative [CRUSADE]) to provide a conceptual framework for future work in the care of the elderly with acute cardiac disease. Treatment for non-ST-segment-elevation ACS (Part I) and ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (Part II) are reviewed. In addition, ethical considerations pertaining to acute care and secondary prevention are considered (Part II). The primary goal is to identify the areas in which sufficient evidence is available to guide practice, as well as to determine areas that warrant further study. Although treatment-related benefits should rise in an elderly population with high disease risk, data to assess these benefits are limited, outcomes of importance vary, and heterogeneity among the elderly increases treatment-related risks. Although a uniform approach to care in the oldest of the old is unlikely, understanding the major contributors to benefits and risks from treatment will advance the ability to apply guideline-based care in this subset of patients.

Conclusions

Although a few recent trials have described treatment effects in older patients, others continue to exclude patients on the basis of age. Going forward, prospective trials should enroll elderly subjects proportionate to their prevalence among the treated population to define risk and benefit. Findings from age subgroup analyses should be reported in a consistent manner across trials, including absolute and relative risks for efficacy and safety. Outcomes of particular relevance to the elderly, such as quality of life, physical function, and independence, should also be considered. Creatinine clearance should be calculated for every elderly patient to enable appropriate dosing. In addition, physicians need an understanding of conditions unique to older patients (eg, frailty, cognitive impairment) that influence treatment goals and outcomes. With these efforts, treatment risks can be minimized, and benefits can be placed in the health context of the elderly patient with ACS.

### The need for long-term personalized management of frail CVD patients by rehabilitation and telemonitoring: a framework [^113HCeX7]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Due to advances in cardiovascular medicine and preventive cardiology, patients benefit from a better prognosis, even in case of significant disease burden such as acute and chronic coronary syndromes, advanced valvular heart disease and chronic heart failure. These advances have allowed CVD patients to increase their life expectancy, but on the other hand also experience aging-related syndromes such as frailty. Despite being underrecognized, frailty is a critical, common, and co-existent condition among older CVD patients, leading to exercise intolerance and compromised adherence to cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR). Moreover, frail patients need a different approach for CR and are at very high risk for adverse events, but yet are underrepresented in conventional CR. Fortunately, recent advances have been made in technology, allowing remote monitoring, coaching and supervision of CVD patients in secondary prevention programs with promising benefits. Similarly, we hypothesized that such programs should also be implemented to treat frailty in CVD patients. However, considering frail patients' particular needs and challenges, telerehabilitation interventions should thus be appropriately adapted. Our purpose is to provide, for the first time and based on expert opinions, a framework of how such a cardiac telerehabilitation program could be developed and implemented to manage a prevention and rehabilitation program for CVD patients with frailty.

Acute coronary syndromes — supportive triage and prognostic factors for cardiac arrest with STEMI note that transfer to a PCI-capable center was associated with improved survival in patients with cardiac arrest and STEMI on electrocardiogram (ECG), and EMS should preferentially transfer patients who are comatose after cardiac arrest, have achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and have STEMI on the ECG to a PPCI center; nearly one-third of patients with cardiac arrest and STEMI on ECG have normal neurologic status on presentation to the emergency department, and being alert or with partial/minimal neurologic response on presentation with STEMI after cardiac arrest is an independent predictor of survival; patients with STEMI who have achieved ROSC and are awake should undergo PPCI, whereas in patients who are comatose after cardiac arrest and have achieved ROSC but have STEMI on the ECG, an individualized patient assessment for survival and futility is essential before proceeding with PCI; poor prognostic features used in risk scores include unwitnessed arrest, no bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, nonshockable rhythm, cardiopulmonary resuscitation > 30 minutes, time to ROSC > 30 minutes, arterial pH < 7.2, lactate > 7 mmol/L, and age > 85 years.

### Coronary revascularisation in older patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes [^111eP8MG]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

With an ageing population, older patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome are at higher risk of adverse outcomes but are far less likely to receive invasive revascularisation, contemporary antiplatelet therapy or drug-eluting stents than their younger counterparts. Accurate risk stratification in the older age groups may aid individualised decision-making with respect to identifying which patients will benefit most from invasive revascularisation, but more research is needed in this field. Based on current knowledge in this field, it would be appropriate following risk stratification to offer optimal medical therapy plus invasive care to older patients at high risk of future cardiovascular events but at low risk of complications and to offer optimal medical therapy alone to those who are deemed low risk of future events with high risk of developing procedural complications and severely frail patients.

### Invasive versus conservative management among older adult Patients with non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116noReg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The management of acute coronary syndromes has evolved over the past decade with the use of newer‐generation drug‐eluting stents, radial artery access, intracoronary imaging, and safer antiplatelet regimens. Approximately 30% to 40% of patients admitted with non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are older adults and have higher inpatient mortality, ischemic events, and bleeding compared with younger patients. This has been attributed to the complex vascular anatomy, age‐related renal changes, atypical clinical presentations, geriatric syndromes, and reduced pharmacokinetics in these patients. The 2021 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association revascularization guidelines recommend an invasive approach to NSTEMI, especially in patients with high‐risk factors, such as recurrent angina, ischemia with low levels of activity despite antianginal therapy, systolic dysfunction, and prior coronary revascularization. However, older adult patients were underpresented in most clinical trials. The After Eighty study and the Italian Elderly ACS trial have attempted to investigate the efficacy of an invasive compared with a conservative medical approach in the older adult population with inconsistent results. Further comparisons between community‐based registries, such as NRMI (National Registry of Myocardial Infarction), GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events), and CRUSADE (Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes with Early Implementation of the ACC/AHA Guidelines), and landmark trials have found that geriatric syndromes, such as multicomorbidities, frailty, and renal dysfunction, are more prevalent in the community than in these trials. This exclusion of key social and geriatric factors was further explored in more recent trials, such as the MOSCA‐FRAIL (Invasive and Conservative Strategies in Elderly Frail Patients With Non‐STEMI) and SENIOR‐RITA (Older Patients With Non–ST‐Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Randomized Interventional Treatment) trials. However, these trials were underpowered to detect statistically significant findings. Given the lack of robust data on the management of NSTEMI in the geriatric population, we performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of all current randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to investigate the efficacy of an invasive versus a conservative medical approach in older adult patients with NSTEMI.
