## Question

Has had total hysterectomy due to fibroid tumors

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of uterine fibroids, with emphasis on hysterectomy as definitive therapy, alternatives, outcomes, and counseling points. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem definition and epidemiology. Then, I should verify the role of hysterectomy as definitive treatment and guideline positions. Next, I will examine comparative effectiveness versus alternatives like myomectomy and uterine artery embolization, including reintervention and quality-of-life data. After that, I need to review preoperative strategies, surgical routes, and morcellation considerations. Finally, I should synthesize patient-centered counseling and a practical decision framework, ensuring I double-check areas where evidence is mixed or evolving.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its burden. Uterine fibroids are the most common benign pelvic tumors in reproductive-age women, with lifetime prevalence estimates ranging from about 20% to 80% depending on ascertainment method, and they are the leading benign indication for hysterectomy in the United States and globally, accounting for roughly one-third to one-half of hysterectomies, which underscores their substantial morbidity and economic impact [^114uZPjf] [^117NRG8V] [^1178JKKK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment hierarchy without anchoring to guidelines. I should confirm the definitive role of hysterectomy. Contemporary guidelines consistently position hysterectomy as the definitive therapy for symptomatic fibroids, particularly for those who have completed childbearing, with SOGC 2025 explicitly recommending hysterectomy as the definitive treatment and ACOG recognizing hysterectomy as effective and definitive while emphasizing shared decision-making for alternatives [^117PcFxm] [^1178JKKK].

> Next, I should review comparative effectiveness versus uterine-sparing options. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of symptom relief differences. Prospective registry data show that hysterectomy yields the largest improvements in symptom severity and health-related quality of life at one year, with laparoscopic hysterectomy demonstrating a mean UFS-QoL improvement of about 49 points and symptom severity reduction of about 51 points, while myomectomy and uterine artery embolization also improve symptoms but to a lesser degree, and uterine-sparing options show a gradual decline in symptom improvement by year three, suggesting durability differences over time [^1116QNzj]. I should double-check corroborating cohort data; indeed, at one year, hysterectomy patients report higher HRQOL than myomectomy patients, with minimally invasive hysterectomy outperforming minimally invasive myomectomy on several subscales, reinforcing the superiority of hysterectomy for symptom resolution in appropriately selected patients [^114ex2Pn].

> I will now examine reintervention risk, since that often drives patient preference. Let me consider the long-term randomized data. The EMMY trial's 10-year outcomes show that approximately one-third of women treated with uterine artery embolization ultimately undergo secondary hysterectomy for persistent symptoms, whereas hysterectomy eliminates fibroid-related symptoms and recurrence risk, albeit at the cost of uterine loss, which is a critical trade-off in counseling [^115HhtPB]. But wait, what if fibroid burden is large; does UAE still perform well? Observational series suggest UAE remains effective even with large fibroid burden, though careful selection and counseling about reintervention remain essential [^111nYdRJ].

> Let me think about preoperative optimization, because it can meaningfully alter operative risk. I should confirm the role of GnRH agonists. Cochrane reviews and contemporary guidance indicate that 3 to 6 months of GnRH agonists reduce uterine and fibroid volume by about 30–50%, improve preoperative hemoglobin, reduce intraoperative blood loss, and increase the likelihood of a vaginal approach to hysterectomy, though hot flushes and bone loss limit duration without add-back therapy [^113PaEms] [^112ShTKa]. Hold on, I should verify whether SPRMs like ulipristal acetate can substitute here; evidence suggests ulipristal can shrink fibroids and control bleeding preoperatively, but regulatory and hepatic safety concerns have constrained its routine use, so it is not a universal substitute for GnRH analogs in this context [^113PaEms] [^113jS3tH].

> Next, I should review surgical route selection and short-term outcomes. Initially, I thought vaginal hysterectomy was the most common route historically, but wait, I need to check that assumption; older utilization data actually show abdominal hysterectomy dominated, with vaginal and laparoscopic routes increasing over time, and contemporary practice increasingly favors minimally invasive approaches when feasible due to faster recovery and less pain, with guideline support for preferring laparoscopic over abdominal approaches when appropriate [^11617m48] [^116F2YXF]. I should confirm comparative safety between total and supracervical laparoscopic hysterectomy; recent NSQIP analyses suggest laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy has lower odds of any and major 30-day complications than total laparoscopic hysterectomy, which can inform shared decision-making when cervical pathology is absent and sexual function considerations are prioritized [^111Hjyz7].

> I need to ensure I address morcellation risk and tissue extraction strategy. The FDA's 2014 advisory highlighted the risk of disseminating occult leiomyosarcoma with power morcellation, prompting widespread practice changes and the adoption of contained morcellation or alternative extraction methods when morcellation is necessary, which should be explicitly discussed during consent and planned proactively to mitigate risk [^115p3Lt3] [^112JvX2S]. Hold on, I should verify whether decision models still support minimally invasive hysterectomy despite this risk; modeling suggests that the aggregate mortality and morbidity may still favor laparoscopic approaches when morcellation risks are managed, but patient values and risk tolerance must guide the final choice [^113QkMPt].

> Let me consider alternatives for those prioritizing uterine preservation. Myomectomy is appropriate for patients desiring future fertility or uterine conservation, but I should confirm recurrence and reintervention risks. Evidence shows meaningful recurrence and cumulative reintervention over time, and guidelines caution that abdominal and laparoscopic myomectomy generally carry more surgical risk than hysterectomy, which must be weighed against fertility goals and symptom burden in shared decision-making [^113S4LfR] [^116dP1Ri]. For patients declining surgery, uterine artery embolization achieves high initial symptom control with faster recovery but carries a nontrivial long-term hysterectomy rate, which should be framed transparently during counseling [^115HhtPB] [^115JhYPF].

> I should confirm the role of emerging and procedural uterine-sparing therapies. Radiofrequency ablation and MR-guided focused ultrasound can reduce symptoms with uterine preservation, but long-term durability and reintervention data remain limited, and patient selection is key; guidelines increasingly include these options in the armamentarium, yet they are best viewed as alternatives for carefully selected patients after thorough counseling about uncertainties and follow-up needs [^112wnYeV] [^113DMLrF]. Hold on, I should verify whether these modalities are appropriate for large or numerous fibroids; response appears better with smaller fibroid burdens, reinforcing the need for imaging-based selection and realistic expectations [^113DMLrF].

> Next, I should review patient-centered outcomes and counseling. Both hysterectomy and myomectomy yield substantial improvements in quality of life, with hysterectomy providing larger and more durable symptom relief but at the cost of fertility and potential long-term health implications of early ovarian dysfunction or menopause, especially if oophorectomy is performed, which should be individualized and discussed in depth [^1116QNzj] [^115C1Kby]. I need to ensure I address disparities and access issues as well, since Black women experience higher prevalence and severity of fibroids and may face delays or limited access to minimally invasive options, which can influence outcomes and should be acknowledged in equitable counseling [^114QGaQX].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and double-check it aligns with guidelines. For patients with significant symptoms after medical therapy, completed childbearing, and a desire for definitive treatment, hysterectomy is the most effective and durable option, with route selection tailored to uterine size, mobility, prior surgery, and surgeon expertise, and with preoperative GnRH analogs considered to optimize hemoglobin and facilitate a minimally invasive approach [^117PcFxm] [^113PaEms]. For those desiring fertility or uterine preservation, myomectomy is appropriate but requires counseling on recurrence and the possibility of repeat surgery, while UAE or ablative techniques can be considered for selected patients who accept reintervention risk and prioritize uterine preservation or faster recovery [^1178JKKK] [^115HhtPB]. Throughout, shared decision-making should incorporate symptom priorities, fertility goals, tolerance for reintervention, recovery preferences, and a transparent discussion of morcellation risks and mitigation strategies [^1178JKKK] [^112JvX2S].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and long-term considerations. After hysterectomy, routine gynecologic follow-up focuses on recovery, sexual function, and menopausal symptoms if ovaries were removed, whereas after uterine-sparing procedures, surveillance for symptom recurrence and reintervention is prudent, ideally using standardized patient-reported outcomes to track quality of life and detect recurrence early [^112HTLmZ]. Hold on, I should verify whether structured imaging and procedural data elements are recommended; consensus statements endorse standardized capture of imaging, procedural details, and adverse events to improve real-world evidence and guide care pathways over time [^114uZPjf].

A total hysterectomy for fibroid tumors is a **definitive, curative treatment** [^1178JKKK] that eliminates fibroid-related symptoms and recurrence, with the trade-off of permanent infertility and potential menopausal symptoms if the ovaries are removed [^116dP1Ri]. It is typically reserved for women who have **completed childbearing** or have severe, refractory symptoms [^1178JKKK]. Minimally invasive approaches (vaginal, laparoscopic, or robotic) are preferred when feasible [^116F2YXF] due to faster recovery, less pain, and fewer complications than open surgery [^116F2YXF]. Patients should be counseled on risks (bleeding, infection, organ injury, early menopause) and benefits (symptom relief, no recurrence) [^116dP1Ri], and preoperative GnRH analogs may be used to reduce fibroid size and bleeding [^113PaEms]. Long-term outcomes are excellent, with sustained symptom relief and high satisfaction, though chronic pain or pelvic floor symptoms may occur in a minority [^113MS6w1] [^116N3opX].

---

## Indications for total hysterectomy in fibroid tumors

Total hysterectomy is indicated for fibroid tumors in the following scenarios:

- **Severe symptoms**: Heavy menstrual bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain, pressure, or urinary symptoms unresponsive to medical or less invasive therapies [^116Qmaq4].

- **Large or multiple fibroids**: Uterine size > 12 weeks gestational age or numerous fibroids causing significant symptoms [^notfound].

- **Failure of conservative treatments**: Persistent symptoms despite medical therapy, myomectomy, or uterine artery embolization (UAE) [^116Qmaq4].

- **Patient preference**: Desire for definitive treatment and avoidance of recurrence [^116dP1Ri].

- **Completed childbearing**: Women who have completed their families or do not desire future fertility [^113YYs69].

---

## Surgical techniques for total hysterectomy

Several surgical approaches are available for total hysterectomy, each with distinct advantages and limitations:

| **Technique** | **Description** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Abdominal hysterectomy | Open surgery through a transverse or vertical incision | - Wide exposure <br/> - Suitable for large uteri or complex cases | - Longer recovery <br/> - Higher blood loss <br/> - Larger incision |
| Vaginal hysterectomy | Removal of the uterus through the vagina | - Minimally invasive <br/> - Faster recovery <br/> - No abdominal incision | - Limited access <br/> - Not suitable for large uteri or extensive adhesions |
| Laparoscopic hysterectomy | Minimally invasive surgery using small abdominal incisions | - Shorter hospital stay <br/> - Less pain <br/> - Faster recovery | - Technical complexity <br/> - Longer operative time |
| Robotic-assisted hysterectomy | Laparoscopic surgery with robotic assistance | - Enhanced precision <br/> - 3D visualization <br/> - Improved dexterity | - High cost <br/> - Limited availability |

---

Minimally invasive approaches (vaginal, laparoscopic, robotic) are **preferred when feasible** due to shorter hospital stays, less postoperative pain, and faster recovery [^116s4vux] [^116F2YXF].

---

## Preoperative preparation and considerations

Preoperative preparation includes:

- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Detailed history, physical examination, and imaging (ultrasound, MRI) to assess fibroid size, location, and uterine anatomy [^116mbmTn].

- **Medical optimization**: Correction of anemia, optimization of comorbidities, and preoperative counseling [^116Qmaq4].

- **GnRH analogs**: May be administered preoperatively to reduce fibroid size, control bleeding, and facilitate surgery [^113PaEms].

---

## Intraoperative and postoperative complications

Potential **intraoperative complications** include bleeding, organ injury (bladder, bowel, ureter), and anesthesia-related risks. Postoperative complications may include infection, wound complications, venous thromboembolism, and chronic pain [^113QkMPt].

---

## Long-term outcomes and quality of life

Total hysterectomy provides **definitive symptom relief**, with sustained improvement in quality of life and high patient satisfaction [^1116QNzj]. Potential long-term issues include early menopause (if ovaries are removed), pelvic floor dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction in a minority of patients [^116dP1Ri] [^116dZTPy].

---

## Alternative treatments to total hysterectomy

Alternative treatments include:

- **Myomectomy**: Uterine-sparing surgery suitable for women desiring future fertility or uterine preservation [^112PfvTj].

- **Uterine artery embolization (UAE)**: Minimally invasive procedure with high patient satisfaction but higher reintervention rates compared to hysterectomy [^115HhtPB].

- **Medical therapy**: GnRH analogs, selective progesterone receptor modulators, and hormonal therapies for symptom control, though not curative [^113jS3tH].

---

## Patient counseling and shared decision-making

Shared decision-making should include a **discussion of symptoms, fertility goals, and preferences**; a review of risks, benefits, and alternatives; and provision of educational materials and support resources [^116Qmaq4].

---

Total hysterectomy is a **definitive treatment** for fibroid tumors, providing lasting symptom relief and high satisfaction, but it entails permanent infertility and potential menopausal symptoms. Minimally invasive approaches are preferred when feasible, and thorough counseling is essential to align treatment with patient goals.

### Alternatives to hysterectomy: management of uterine fibroids [^116czfdS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are a common condition that can be debilitating and are the leading benign cause of hysterectomy. Women often live with the symptoms rather than choose hysterectomy, but survey studies have shown that work, social life, and physical activities are hindered by fibroid symptoms. Offering alternative therapies tailored to a woman's symptoms will allow her to choose a treatment that fits her needs and to preserve her uterus and fertility. The minimally invasive treatment options have a faster recovery and lower surgical risk than hysterectomy, but may require reintervention. One pharmacologic treatment offers short-term, intermittent therapy with lasting effects.

Introduction

Between 5–77% of women may have fibroids, depending on the method of diagnosis used. Fibroids may be asymptomatic, or may present with menorrhagia, pain, infertility, or recurrent pregnancy loss. Risk factors for fibroids include obesity, having no children, and no long-term use of the oral contraceptive pill. Fibroids tend to shrink or fibrose after the menopause.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of: medical treatment alone; preoperative medical treatments for women scheduled for surgery; and surgical treatments in women with fibroids? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 41 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: gonadorelin analogues (with progestogen, raloxifene, tibolone, or combined oestrogen-progestogen); hysterectomy (plus oophorectomy); hysteroscopic resonance-focused ultrasound; laparoscopic myomectomy; laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy; rollerball endometrial ablation; thermal balloon ablation; thermal myolysis with laser; total abdominal hysterectomy; total abdominal myomectomy; total laparoscopic hysterectomy; total vaginal hysterectomy.

Background

Few studies have directly compared different surgical procedures for uterine fibroids with respect to long-term health-related quality of life outcomes and symptom improvement.

Objective

We examined differences in change from baseline to 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up in health-related quality of life and symptom severity among patients who underwent abdominal myomectomy, laparoscopic or robotic myomectomy, abdominal hysterectomy, laparoscopic or robotic hysterectomy, or uterine artery embolization.

Study Design

The COMPARE-UF registry is a multiinstitutional prospective observational cohort study of women undergoing treatment for uterine fibroids. A subset of 1384 women aged 31 to 45 years who underwent either abdominal myomectomy (n = 237), laparoscopic myomectomy (n = 272), abdominal hysterectomy (n = 177), laparoscopic hysterectomy (n = 522), or uterine artery embolization (n = 176) were included in this analysis. We obtained demographics, fibroid history, and symptoms by questionnaires at enrollment and at 1, 2, and 3 years posttreatment. We used the UFS-QoL (Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life) questionnaire to ascertain symptom severity and health-related quality of life scores among participants. To account for potential baseline differences across treatment groups, a propensity score model was used to derive overlap weights and compare total health-related quality of life and symptom severity scores after enrollment with a repeated measures model. For this health-related quality of life tool, a specific minimal clinically important difference has not been determined, but on the basis of previous research, a difference of 10 points was considered as a reasonable estimate. Use of this difference was agreed upon by the Steering Committee at the time when the analysis was planned.

Results

At baseline, women undergoing hysterectomy and uterine artery embolization reported the lowest health-related quality of life scores and highest symptom severity scores compared with those undergoing abdominal myomectomy or laparoscopic myomectomy (P < .001). Those undergoing hysterectomy and uterine artery embolization reported the longest duration of fibroid symptoms with a mean of 6.3 years (standard deviation, 6.7; P < .001). The most common fibroid symptoms were menorrhagia (75.3%), bulk symptoms (74.2%), and bloating (73.2%). More than half (54.9%) of participants reported anemia, and 9.4% women reported a history of blood transfusion. Across all modalities, total health-related quality of life and symptom severity score markedly improved from baseline to 1-year with the largest improvement in the laparoscopic hysterectomy group (Uterine Fibroids Symptom and Quality of Life: delta = 49.2; symptom severity: delta = 51.3). Those undergoing abdominal myomectomy, laparoscopic myomectomy, and uterine artery embolization also demonstrated significant improvement in health-related quality of life (delta = 43.9, 32.9, 40.7, respectively) and symptom severity (delta = 41.4, 31.5, 38.5, respectively) at 1 year, and the improvement persisted from baseline for uterine-sparing procedures during second (Uterine Fibroids Symptom and Quality of Life: delta = 40.7, 37.4, 39.3 SS: delta = 38.5, 32.0, 37.7 and third year (Uterine Fibroids Symptom and Quality of Life: delta = 40.9, 39.9, 41.1 and SS: delta = 33.9, 36.5, 33.0, respectively), posttreatment intervals, however with a trend toward decline in degree of improvement from years 1 and 2. Differences from baseline were greatest for hysterectomy; however, this may reflect the relative importance of bleeding in the Uterine Fibroids Symptom and Quality of Life, rather than clinically meaningful symptom recurrence among women undergoing uterus-sparing treatments.

Conclusion

All treatment modalities were associated with significant improvements in health-related quality of life and symptom severity reduction 1-year posttreatment. However, abdominal myomectomy, laparoscopic myomectomy and uterine artery embolization indicated a gradual decline in symptom improvement and health-related quality of life by third year after the procedure.

### New uterine-preserving therapies raise questions about interdisciplinary management and the role of surgery for symptomatic fibroids [^116jwTpb]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Mounting evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of new uterine-preserving fibroid therapies is raising questions not only about changing indications for surgery but also about gynecologists' role in therapies offered by other specialists. New collaborative relationships are needed to provide the best possible treatment; without them, those lag times of 10–15 years often cited as the time it takes for advances in clinical research to diffuse into clinical practice will be even longer for women with symptomatic fibroids.

### Uterine fibroids [^113mHfya]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids or myomas), benign tumours of the human uterus, are the single most common indication for hysterectomy. They are clinically apparent in up to 25% of women and cause significant morbidity, including prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure or pain, and, in rare cases, reproductive dysfunction. Thus, both the economic cost and the effect on quality of life are substantial. Surgery has been the mainstay of fibroid treatment, and various minimally invasive procedures have been developed in addition to hysterectomy and abdominal myomectomy. Formation of new leiomyomas after these conservative therapies remains a substantial problem. Although medications that manipulate concentrations of steroid hormones are effective, side-effects limit long-term use. A better approach may be manipulation of the steroid-hormone environment with specific hormone antagonists. There has been little evidence-based evaluation of therapy. New research into the basic biology of these neoplasms may add new treatment options for the future as the role of growth factors and genetic mutations in these tumours are better understood.

### Uterine fibroids: assessing unmet needs from bench to bedside [^1138R1Qa]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The impact of uterine fibroids on health and quality of life can be severe. The research community has made important advances identifying risk factors of the disease and genetic mutations to characterize these tumors. However, there are significant gaps in our knowledge and understanding of how these factors influence symptomatic fibroids and the increased incidence in women of color. Elucidating these areas of disease pathology could unlock novel therapeutic targets and treatments for patients, which could serve as more curative solutions short of hysterectomy. In addition, the call to action surrounding uterine fibroids should not be limited to the academic and clinical communities. Fibroids are a public health issue that will benefit from general awareness and policy intervention. Concerted efforts to increase awareness, reduce bias, and promote provider and patient education are fundamental to empower patients throughout their life-course journey as they live with and manage symptomatic uterine fibroid disease.

Surgical or interventional therapy

If medical management proves insufficient, surgical or interventional procedures are the next approach to treating symptomatic fibroids. A myomectomy (laparoscopic, hysteroscopic, or abdominal) removes fibroids to address symptomatic disease, but has a high rate of recurrence, requiring sequential treatment or a second line of therapy to manage the disease. While myomectomy preserves fertility, the cumulative risk of multiple surgeries must be considered when pursuing this course of action. Hysterectomy is the only definitive cure for fibroids, but eliminates the option of pregnancy and may have long-term health impacts. In fact, fibroids account for one-third of all hysterectomies.

The short- and long-term trade-offs of these procedures vary. Hysterectomy, even with ovarian conservation, affects ovarian function and leads to early menopause, but it shows better outcomes for fibroids within 3–5 years post-surgery, compared to other medical treatments. However, in the longer term, hysterectomy (particularly when conducted with oophorectomy) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, fracture risk, pelvic floor dysfunction, and neurologic issues. These complications are not fully understood and often are not adequately discussed with patients.

Endometrial ablation and uterine artery embolization are not only less invasive procedures but they also inhibit fertility. Alternatively, magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRg-FUS) is an emerging noninvasive treatment recommended for patients who have fewer and larger fibroids. Patients report symptom improvement within the first 2 years, but one-third of women will need another procedure to treat recurrent disease. Because this is a new treatment, many providers do not know enough about it to offer this option, and MRg-FUS is not always covered by health insurance. The FDA has also cleared a laparoscopic, ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation therapy, an outpatient procedure that spares the uterus and allows for more rapid recovery. Pregnancy data concerning these emerging technologies are still limited.

Although conservative methods of treatment to preserve the uterus and fertility are often preferred, the likelihood of re-intervention increases with these approaches. With this comes the added burdens of cost, risk, and compromised emotional wellness of the patient. To help guide clinical decision-making, there is a need for additional comparative data on treatment options and their outcomes, as well as evidence-based algorithms to help predict patient responses to treatments. More research is also needed to identify less invasive treatment options without fertility-related drawbacks.

### Non-surgical management of myomas [^113EeLKM]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Uterine myomas are a common condition and the leading cause of hysterectomy. Clinically, myomas can be challenging because they range from asymptomatic to causing severe, debilitating symptoms and occur in many women before childbearing is complete. Thus, women often seek uterine-conserving and nonsurgical management of their myomas. In this review the available uterine-conserving treatment options from medical management through minimally invasive procedures are discussed. To the extent of research available, the sustainability of symptom improvement and the effects on future fertility are reviewed. Future research may lead to therapies that reduce the risks of major surgery, decrease side effects, and offer primary or secondary prevention options.

### Development of a core minimum data set to advance real-world evidence generation for uterine fibroids treatment technologies [^112HTLmZ]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2022). High credibility.

Imaging data

There was consensus on including specific data elements from any imaging studies obtained prior to the procedure, including date, type of modality, and fibroid characteristics — location, size, number visualized, and number measured, as well as uterine dimensions if recorded. As with menstrual history, there was a recognition that there is considerable variability in how fibroid imaging is reported and recorded and that further work on developing standards was needed. There was also consensus that any radiologic suspicion of adenomyosis, endometriosis, or a potentially malignant uterine lesion should also be recorded.

Procedure data

The participants reached consensus on minimal data elements for all procedures, including whether the originally planned procedure was performed, procedure and discharge date, an identifier for the primary surgeon, occurrence of any intraoperative adverse events and an assessment about the relationship between the event and any devices used, other relevant intraoperative findings (eg, presence of adhesions), and other procedures performed (eg, oophorectomy). Relevant pathology findings, depending on the procedure, include uterine and ovarian pathology, uterine weight (for hysterectomy), number and cumulative weight of excised fibroids (for myomectomy), and use of morcellation (including device and containment status). For procedures that do not specifically remove tissues, such as uterine artery embolization, MRI-guided focused ultrasound, and radiofrequency ablation, stakeholders agreed to include details on the embolized arteries or the number of fibroids that were treated.

Post-procedure (short-term and long-term) data

At every follow-up interval, there was consensus on collecting data on post-procedure adverse events, whether cancer was diagnosed during follow-up, and treatment failure or recurrence of symptoms. Treatment failure and recurrence of symptoms was defined as the need for another fibroid procedure. If a cancer diagnosis was indicated, working group members agreed that it should be further specified if the cancer was leiomyosarcoma. There was also agreement that other measures of symptom recurrence, such as changes in a validated patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) or the need for new medical therapy, would be helpful. However, because of the lack of current standards for the use of PROMs in clinical practice, it was agreed that the chosen outcome measures were more reproducible and would capture the most important safety outcomes. As noted above, there was also recognition that pregnancy outcomes are important for many patients undergoing treatment for uterine fibroids, but that the data elements collected as part of the medical and gynecologic history would capture the most relevant outcomes at visits after the index procedure.

### Endometriosis and uterine fibroids and risk of premature mortality: prospective cohort study [^112o9dGW]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

Few studies to date have explored the long term influence of endometriosis or uterine fibroids on mortality. In contrast to our findings, Saavalainen and colleagues reported a lower risk of mortality from all causes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, accidents and violence, and respiratory diseases among 49 956 women with surgically verified endometriosis compared with a reference cohort of 98 824 age and municipality matched women; and Shen and colleagues reported a lower risk of mortality from breast cancer in 22 001 women with a diagnosis of uterine fibroids compared with 85 356 women who were fibroid free matched by age and date of diagnosis. These previous studies did not determine gynecological diseases during follow-up or throughout the reproductive lifespan for participants in the reference group. Considering that women who did not report endometriosis or uterine fibroids at recruitment might develop these disorders during follow-up or in later life, misclassification should be taken into account if women with undiagnosed endometriosis or uterine fibroids are included among the population matched controls. Additionally, these retrospective case-control studies used register based data, which did not collect data on relevant confounders (eg, oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and infertility) and behavior factors (eg, body mass index, diet quality, physical activity, and smoking status), which might have resulted in biased associations. In support of this notion, strengthened hazard ratios were observed when we adjusted for these important covariates. Finally, the differences in population characteristics (eg, parity and professions) and their access to medical care and treatment resources might also lead to inconsistent findings between studies. In our present study, uterine fibroids were associated with a lower risk of total and cancer premature mortality among women with hysterectomy. We hypothesize that hysterectomy might have eliminated the potential for later life fibroid diagnosis and the development of certain malignancies, consequently reducing the risk of cancer mortality. Furthermore, we observed a stronger association between uterine fibroids and cancer mortality among women who were nulliparous, which is also plausible given the extensive evidence showing that nulliparity is associated with an increased risk of gynecological malignancies, such as ovarian and endometrial cancer. However, the associations between endometriosis and uterine fibroids and total and cancer mortality did not vary by any behavior factors, indicating that these associations were independent of body mass index, diet quality, physical activity, and smoking status.

### Comparative effectiveness of hysterectomy versus myomectomy on one-year health-related quality of life in women with uterine fibroids [^114ex2Pn]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare long-term health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 1 year after hysterectomy or myomectomy for treatment of uterine fibroids (UFs) and to determine whether route of procedure, race, or age affected improvements in HRQOL.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Eight clinical sites throughout the United States.

Patient(S)

A total of 1,113 premenopausal women with UFs who underwent hysterectomy or myomectomy as part of Comparing Options for Management: Patient-Centered Results for Uterine Fibroids.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure (S)

Self-reported HRQOL measures including Uterine Fibroid Symptom Quality of Life, the European QOL 5 Dimension Health Questionnaire, and the visual analog scale at baseline and 1-year after hysterectomy or myomectomy.

Result (S)

Hysterectomy patients were older with a longer history of symptomatic UF compared with myomectomy patients. There were no differences in baseline HRQOL. After adjustment for baseline differences between groups, compared with myomectomy, patients' HRQOL (95% confidence interval, 5.4, 17.2) and symptom severity (95% CI, -16.3, -8.8) were significantly improved with hysterectomy. When stratified across race/ethnicity and age, hysterectomy had higher HRQOL scores compared with myomectomy. There was little difference in HRQOL (95% CI, 0.1 [-9.5, 9.6]) or symptom severity (95% CI, -3.4 [-10, 3.2]) between abdominal hysterectomy and abdominal myomectomy.

Conclusion (S)

HRQOL improved in all women 1 year after hysterectomy or myomectomy. Hysterectomy patients reported higher HRQOL summary scores compared with myomectomy patients. When stratified by route, minimally invasive hysterectomy had better HRQOL scores than minimally invasive myomectomy. There was little difference in scores with abdominal approaches.

### Pre-operative GnRH analogue therapy before hysterectomy or myomectomy for uterine fibroids [^115SPQu7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids, smooth muscle tumours of the uterus, are found in at least 25 to 35% of women over the age of 35 years. Although some of these tumours are asymptomatic, up to 50% cause symptoms severe enough to warrant therapy and surgery is the standard treatment. Fibroid growth is stimulated by oestrogen and gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) which induce a state of hypoestrogenism have been investigated as a potential treatment. GnRHa treatment causes fibroids to shrink but cannot be used long term because of unacceptable symptoms and bone loss. Therefore, GnRHa may be useful pre-operatively both to reduce fibroid and uterine volume and control bleeding.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to evaluate the role of pre-treatment with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues prior to a major surgical procedure, either hysterectomy or myomectomy, for uterine fibroids.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches for relevant randomised controlled trials of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Register of Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the National Research Register, the National Library of Medicine's Clinical Trials Register and Current Contents were performed. Attempts were also made to identify published trials from citation lists of review articles and direct contact with drug companies for unpublished trials. In most cases, the first author of each included trial was contacted for additional information. The search was updated in October 2000.

Selection Criteria

The inclusion criteria were randomised comparisons of GnRH analogue treatment versus placebo, no treatment, or other medical therapy prior to surgery, either myomectomy or hysterectomy, for uterine fibroids.

Data Collection and Analysis

Twenty-six RCTs were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review. The reviewers extracted the data independently and odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes were estimated from the data of fourteen trials where GnRH analogue treatment was compared with no pre-treatment and six trials where GnRH analogue treatment was compared with placebo. Three trials are awaiting assessment because the data were not in a suitable form for extraction or they are awaiting translation. Two trials have been excluded because the data were not in a suitable form for extraction and the authors were not able to provide additional information. One RCT compared GnRHa pre-treatment with lynestrenol pre-treatment. Results from pre-operative outcomes were combined for both types of surgery but results from intra- and post-operative outcomes were reported separately for myomectomy and hysterectomy. Subgroup analysis was performed according to type of control group, no pre-treatment or placebo, and for some outcomes there were additional subgroup analyses according to size of the uterus in gestational weeks.

Main Results

Pre- and post-operative haemoglobin (Hb) and haematocrit (HCT) were significantly improved by GnRH analogue therapy prior to surgery, and uterine volume, uterine gestational size and fibroid volume were all reduced. Pelvic symptoms were also reduced but some adverse events were more likely during GnRH analogue therapy. Hysterectomy appeared to be easier after pre-treatment with GnRH analogue therapy; there was reduced operating time and a greater proportion of hysterectomy patients were able to have a vaginal rather than an abdominal procedure. Duration of hospital stay was also reduced. Blood loss and rate of vertical incisions were reduced for both myomectomy and hysterectomy. Evidence of increased risk of fibroid recurrence after GnRH analogue pre-treatment in myomectomy patients was equivocal and few data were available to assess change in post-operative fertility. Lynestrenol did not offer any advantage over GnRH analogue therapy before fibroid surgery. The increased costs associated with GnRH analogue therapy were not assessed.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The use of GnRH analogues for 3 to 4 months prior to fibroid surgery reduce both uterine volume and fibroid size. They are beneficial in the correction of pre-operative iron deficiency anaemia, if present, and reduce intra-operative blood loss. If uterine size is such that a mid-line incision is planned, this can be avoided in many women with the use of GnRH analogues. For patients undergoing hysterectomy, a vaginal procedure is more likely following the use of these agents.

### Moving toward individualized medicine for uterine leiomyomas [^116UKigp]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas are common and life-altering for many women. Despite a wide range of symptoms, varying characteristics of the uterus and the leiomyomas themselves, and many alternatives, hysterectomy accounts for almost three fourths of all surgical therapy, yet there is increasing evidence for a variety of procedural therapies for symptomatic leiomyomas and a new generation of medical therapies under development. With increasing evidence of long-term risk from hysterectomy and new data regarding leiomyoma biology, individualized medical approaches to leiomyomas are likely in the near future. Key biological attributes that influence this disease process are common driver mutations and the new appreciation of the interaction of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Additionally, the interaction between cell types and steroid hormone responsiveness likely plays a role in pathogenesis that can be leveraged in individualized therapy. However, given the independent clonal nature of leiomyomas within the same uterus, moving in the direction of biopsies for individual leiomyomas to understand the biology is unlikely to be fruitful. Use of advanced imaging will likely continue to evolve not only to accurately predict malignant disease, including sarcomas, but to predict leiomyoma subtypes, response to therapy, or both. We predict the continued evolution of therapy from excisional or interventional therapies to medical therapies and ultimately prediction of at-risk individuals. Ideally, individualized therapies will offer primary prevention for women at high risk of leiomyomas and secondary prevention after initial treatment.

### Contributions of hysterectomy and uterus-preserving surgery to health-related quality of life [^113MS6w1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To document the long-term effect of surgical interventions for noncancerous uterine conditions on health-related quality of life.

Methods

The Study of Pelvic Problems, Hysterectomy and Intervention Alternatives, conducted between 1998 and 2008, was a longitudinal study of 1,503 women with intact uteri experiencing abnormal uterine bleeding with or without leiomyomas, chronic pelvic pain, or pressure resulting from leiomyomas. Baseline and follow-up questionnaires included three condition-specific measures (Pelvic Problem Resolution, Pelvic Problem Impact Overall, and Pelvic Problem Impact on Sex) and five generic measures (Short Form-12 Mental and Physical Component Summaries, Current Health Utility, Feelings about Heath, and Satisfaction with Sex). We modeled changes over time in these patient-reported outcomes stratified by the most invasive treatment undergone (hysterectomy [13.7%], uterus-preserving surgery [9.0%], or nonsurgical therapy [77.3%]).

Results

Participants in all three groups reported significant improvement on all condition-specific measures and two of the five generic measures (Current Health Utility and Feelings about Health) from enrollment to final interview (all P values < .01). In general, greater improvements were experienced by women who had surgery. Trajectories modeled around the dates of surgery showed dramatic improvements after hysterectomy and, to a lesser degree, after uterus-preserving surgery. Although women who underwent uterus-preserving surgery tended to show immediate improvement, women who underwent hysterectomy experienced a 6-month delay in improvement in some outcomes with trajectories converging by 4 years postsurgery.

Conclusion

Women seeking care for noncancerous uterine conditions can expect to experience improvement over time. Those who opt for surgery may experience most improvement. Understanding health-related quality-of-life trajectories may enhance counseling for women deciding between hysterectomy and alternative interventions.

### Preoperative medical therapy before surgery for uterine fibroids [^113PaEms]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids occur in up to 40% of women aged over 35 years. Some are asymptomatic, but up to 50% cause symptoms that warrant therapy. Symptoms include anaemia caused by heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, infertility and low quality of life. Surgery is the first choice of treatment. In recent years, medical therapies have been used before surgery to improve intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. However, such therapies tend to be expensive. Fibroid growth is stimulated by oestrogen. Gonadotropin-hormone releasing analogues (GnRHa) induce a state of hypo-oestrogenism that shrinks fibroids, but has unacceptable side effects if used long-term. Other potential hormonal treatments, include progestins and selective progesterone-receptor modulators (SPRMs). This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2000 and 2001; the scope has been broadened to include all preoperative medical treatments.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of medical treatments prior to surgery for uterine fibroids.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL in June 2017. We also searched trials registers (ClinicalTrials.com; WHO ICTRP), theses and dissertations and the grey literature, handsearched reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted pharmaceutical companies for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised comparisons of medical therapy versus placebo, no treatment, or other medical therapy before surgery, myomectomy, hysterectomy or endometrial resection, for uterine fibroids.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included a total of 38 RCTs (3623 women); 19 studies compared GnRHa to no pretreatment (n = 19), placebo (n = 8), other medical pretreatments (progestin, SPRMs, selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), dopamine agonists, oestrogen receptor antagonists) (n = 7), and four compared SPRMs with placebo. Most results provided low-quality evidence due to limitations in study design (poor reporting of randomisation procedures, lack of blinding), imprecision and inconsistency. GnRHa versus no treatment or placebo GnRHa treatments were associated with reductions in both uterine (MD -175 mL, 95% CI -219.0 to -131.7; 13 studies; 858 participants; I² = 67%; low-quality evidence) and fibroid volume (heterogeneous studies, MD 5.7 mL to 155.4 mL), and increased preoperative haemoglobin (MD 0.88 g/dL, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.1; 10 studies; 834 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), at the expense of a greater likelihood of adverse events, particularly hot flushes (OR 7.68, 95% CI 4.6 to 13.0; 6 studies; 877 participants; I² = 46%; moderate-quality evidence). Duration of hysterectomy surgery was reduced among women who received GnRHa treatment (-9.59 minutes, 95% CI 15.9 to -3.28; 6 studies; 617 participants; I² = 57%; low-quality evidence) and there was less blood loss (heterogeneous studies, MD 25 mL to 148 mL), fewer blood transfusions (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.0; 6 studies; 601 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), and fewer postoperative complications (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9; 7 studies; 772 participants; I² = 28%; low-quality evidence). GnRHa appeared to reduce intraoperative blood loss during myomectomy (MD 22 mL to 157 mL). There was no clear evidence of a difference among groups for other primary outcomes after myomectomy: duration of surgery (studies too heterogeneous for pooling), blood transfusions (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.3 to 2.8; 4 studies; 121 participants; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence) or postoperative complications (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.64; I² = 0%; 5 studies; 190 participants; low-quality evidence). No suitable data were available for analysis of preoperative bleeding. GnRHa versus other medical therapies GnRHa was associated with a greater reduction in uterine volume (-47% with GnRHa compared to -20% and -22% with 5 mg and 10 mg ulipristal acetate) but was more likely to cause hot flushes (OR 12.3, 95% CI 4.04 to 37.48; 5 studies; 183 participants; I² = 61%; low-quality evidence) compared with ulipristal acetate. There was no clear evidence of a difference in bleeding reduction (ulipristal acetate 5 mg: OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.7; 1 study; 199 participants; moderate-quality evidence; ulipristal acetate 10 mg: OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.1; 1 study; 203 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or haemoglobin levels (MD -0.2, 95% CI -0.6 to 0.2; 188 participants; moderate-quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of a difference in fibroid volume between GnRHa and cabergoline (MD 12.71 mL, 95% CI -5.9 to 31.3; 2 studies; 110 participants; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). The included studies did not report usable data for any other primary outcomes. SPRMs versus placebo SPRMs (mifepristone, CDB-2914, ulipristal acetate and asoprisnil) were associated with greater reductions in uterine or fibroid volume than placebo (studies too heterogeneous to pool) and increased preoperative haemoglobin levels (MD 0.93 g/dL, 0.5 to 1.4; 2 studies; 173 participants; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence). Ulipristal acetate and asoprisnil were also associated with greater reductions in bleeding before surgery (ulipristal acetate 5 mg: OR 41.41, 95% CI 15.3 to 112.4; 1 study; 143 participants; low-quality evidence; ulipristal acetate 10 mg: OR 78.83, 95% CI 24.0 to 258.7; 1 study; 146 participants; low-quality evidence; asoprisnil: MD -166.9 mL; 95% CI -277.6 to -56.2; 1 study; 22 participants; low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of differences in preoperative complications. No other primary outcomes were measured.

Authors' Conclusions

A rationale for the use of preoperative medical therapy before surgery for fibroids is to make surgery easier. There is clear evidence that preoperative GnRHa reduces uterine and fibroid volume, and increases preoperative haemoglobin levels, although GnRHa increases the incidence of hot flushes. During hysterectomy, blood loss, operation time and complication rates were also reduced. Evidence suggests that ulipristal acetate may offer similar advantages (reduced fibroid volume and fibroid-related bleeding and increased haemoglobin levels) although replication of these studies is advised before firm conclusions can be made. Future research should focus on cost-effectiveness and distinguish between groups of women with fibroids who would most benefit.

### Reintervention rates after myomectomy, endometrial ablation, and uterine artery embolization for patients with uterine fibroids [^111QPCV4]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

U(uterine fibroids [UF]) are benign hormonally responsive tumors that form in the wall of the uterus and are common in women aged 30–50 years.UF are usually asymptomatic but can cause pelvic pain, reproductive problems, and heavy menstrual bleeding that may lead to anemia. For those with severe symptoms, treatment interventions include hysterectomy and other less invasive procedures. Hysterectomy involves removing the uterus, which typically requires hospitalization and can be associated with a lengthy recovery period, and eliminates the ability to carry a pregnancy.

Many women elect to undergo potentially less invasive procedures than hysterectomy, including myomectomy, endometrial ablation (EA), and uterine artery embolization (UAE), in order to conserve their uterus, avoid prolonged recovery times, or potentially retain fertility with myomectomy. These procedures are considered reasonable alternatives to hysterectomy, given their safety profile, patient satisfaction, and quality-of-life scores. Numerous factors affect which intervention a patient undergoes, including symptom profile, patient preferences regarding recovery period and fertility, insurance, fibroid characteristics (location, number, and size), presence or absence of coexisting pathology, and experience of the physician. Specific comorbidities such as menstrual disorders and pelvic pain may also influence the treatment decision.

Patients who undergo a more conservative approach than hysterectomy would prefer to avoid additional procedures, but there is limited recent evidence describing long-term reintervention rates with direct comparisons between myomectomy, EA, and UAE, especially in large samples with > 1-year of follow-up observation. Existing evidence primarily comes from clinical trials with only two comparison arms or surveys of patients with variable follow-up periods that often do not adjust for patient characteristics potentially relevant to the treatment decision.

Long-term comparative analysis of patients undergoing procedures for symptoms of UF is an identified research priority; the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concluded in 2011 that "currently available literature is insufficient to draw conclusions about the relative benefits, harms, or costs of the available choices, making it difficult for patients, providers, payers, and others to select appropriate treatments".

### Long-term risk of reintervention after surgical leiomyoma treatment in an integrated health care system [^1146FYdU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas (leiomyoma) are benign tumors of the uterus. In 2012, leiomyomas were estimated to cost up to $9.4 billion annually (in 2010 dollars) to treat with surgeries, medications, and procedures. However, a 2017 comparative-effectiveness review from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reported that the evidence on leiomyoma treatments was insufficient to guide clinical care, and few well-conducted trials of leiomyoma treatment have directly compared different treatment options. Clinicians and patients therefore currently rely mostly on small studies with short follow-up, high losses to follow-up, or nongeneralizable participants as the basis for clinical decision making. – The sparse evidence on long-term outcomes specifically in Black patients constitutes a major gap; preliminary data suggest that Black patients may have higher posttreatment rates of leiomyoma recurrence than White patients.

In a large integrated health care delivery system with excellent retentionserving a racially diverse patient population, we compared long-term reintervention risk among four uterus-preserving leiomyoma treatments (myomectomy, hysteroscopic myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, and endometrial ablation) and evaluated the extent to which reintervention risk varied by race and ethnicity, age, body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), parity, and Neighborhood Deprivation Index.

### Uterine artery embolization versus surgery in the treatment of symptomatic fibroids: a systematic review and metaanalysis [^115JhYPF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize the evidence on short-, mid-, and long-term results up to 5 years of uterine artery embolization in comparison to surgery.

Study Design

We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for randomized clinical trials comparing uterine artery embolization with hysterectomy/myomectomy in premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding caused by symptomatic uterine fibroids, written from September 1995 to November 2010. Two reviewers independently assessed methodologic quality and extracted data from included trials.

Results

Four randomized controlled trials with a total of 515 patients were included. On the short-term, uterine artery embolization showed fewer blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and quicker resumption of work. Mid- and long-term results showed comparable health-related quality of life results and a higher reintervention rate in the uterine artery embolization group, whereas both groups were equally satisfied.

Conclusion

Uterine artery embolization has short-term advantages over surgery. On the mid- and long-term the benefits were similar, except for a higher reintervention rate after uterine artery embolization.

Uterine leiomyoma, benign monoclonal tumors, afflict an estimated 60% of reproductive-aged women, with higher rates among African American women. Leiomyoma are associated with significant medical costs, impaired fertility potential, obstetric complications, and gynecologic morbidity. Currently, the effective clinical management of leiomyoma is limited by the fact that hysterectomy is the only cure. The purpose of this article is to provide the practitioner with a practical overview of the clinical management of this disease.

### With the advent of selective progesterone receptor modulators, what is the place of myoma surgery in current practice? [^113YYs69]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are the most common benign uterine tumors. This review examines the different management strategies, involving mainly surgery, and evaluates them in the light of new developments with selective progesterone receptor modulators. On the one hand, hysteroscopic and laparoscopic (or minilaparotomic) myomectomy is the treatment of choice in women who wish to preserve their uterus, and hysterectomy has long been considered the standard surgical approach in symptomatic women who no longer wish to conceive. On the other hand, recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of ulipristal acetate in the medical management of myomas. Analyzing the respective advantages of both medical and surgical therapy, we propose new guidelines for the management of fibroids that take into account the most important symptoms (bleeding, infertility) and the age of the patients.

### IV. uterine fibroid embolization: follow-up [^113q2yaY]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Patients generally notice some relief of both menorrhagia and mass-effect symptoms during the first few weeks after uterine fibroid embolization (UFE). Shrinkage of the fibroids continues to take place over several months, peaking somewhere between 3 and 6 months, with measurable shrinkage sometimes noted for up to 1 year. The timing of follow-up visits is intended to coincide with the time course of improvement so that diagnostic imaging and intervention can be performed if symptoms worsen or relief does not appear to be on schedule. The amount of shrinkage of fibroids correlates neither with the intensity of immediate postprocedure symptoms or the degree of symptom relief. Affected fibroids undergo hyaline degeneration, a process in which the hard, cellular tumor is replaced by softer, acellular material. A nationwide registry has been constructed for the accumulation of procedural and follow-up data so that success and complication rates can be accurately determined and long-term issues about the durability of UFE and possible side effects can be addressed.

### Fibroid embolization [^113K1J2D]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

The most common surgical treatment for fibroids is hysterectomy and approximately 30,000 are carried out annually in the UK for this condition. The operation, however, carries a significant complication rate. Since the first case was carried out in 1989 there has been increasing interest in the interventional radiological procedure called fibroid embolization where angiographic techniques are used to occlude the vascular supply of fibroids. This article is a review of the world experience of fibroid embolization, its development, techniques, indications, results and complications. So far evidence indicates very promising mid-term results but more long-term comprehensive data is needed from large trials.

### Endometriosis and uterine fibroids and risk of premature mortality: prospective cohort study [^115keiRP]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To prospectively assess the effect of endometriosis and uterine fibroids on the long term risk of premature mortality (younger than 70 years).

Design

Prospective cohort study

Setting

The Nurses' Health Study II, United States (1989–2019).

Participants

110 091 women aged 25–42 years in 1989 without a history of hysterectomy before endometriosis or fibroids diagnosis, cardiovascular diseases, or cancer.

Main outcome measures

Hazard ratios (estimated by Cox proportional hazards models) for total and cause specific premature mortality according to laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis or ultrasound or hysterectomy confirmed uterine fibroids reported in biennial questionnaires.

Results

4356 premature deaths were recorded during 2 994 354 person years of follow-up (27.2 years per person), including 1459 from cancer, 304 from cardiovascular diseases, and 90 from respiratory diseases. The crude incidence of all cause premature mortality for women with and without laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis was 2.01 and 1.40 per 1000 person years, respectively. In age adjusted models, laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.19 (95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.30) for premature death; these models were strengthened after also adjusting for potential confounders including behavioral factors (1.31, 1.20 to 1.44). Cause specific mortality analyses showed that the association was largely driven by mortality from senility and ill-defined diseases (1.80, 1.19 to 2.73), non-malignant respiratory diseases (1.95, 1.11 to 3.41), diseases of the nervous system and sense organs (2.50, 1.40 to 4.44), and malignant neoplasm of gynecological organs (2.76, 1.79 to 4.26). Ultrasound or hysterectomy confirmed uterine fibroids were not associated with all cause premature mortality (1.03, 0.95 to 1.11), but were associated with a greater risk of mortality from malignant neoplasm of gynecological organs (2.32, 1.59 to 3.40) in cause specific mortality analyses. The risk of mortality caused by cardiovascular and respiratory diseases varied according to joint categories of endometriosis and uterine fibroids, with an increased risk of all cause premature mortality among women reporting both endometriosis and uterine fibroids.

Conclusion

Women with a history of endometriosis and uterine fibroids might have an increased long term risk of premature mortality extending beyond their reproductive lifespan. These conditions were also associated with an increased risk of death due to gynecological cancers. Endometriosis was associated with a greater risk of non-cancer mortality. These findings highlight the importance for primary care providers to consider these gynecological disorders in their assessment of women's health.

### Conservative surgical management of uterine myomas [^117SJCqB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroids are a major gynecologic problem in American women, and several alternatives have been developed. Conservative treatment, with the goal of treating the fibroid but retaining the uterus, is a frequent choice among women who require therapy during their early to middle reproductive years. A variety of conservative surgical approaches exist; each has advantages and disadvantages for the clinician and the patient. Some are well-established techniques, whereas others are still in the investigational stage. None has been evaluated adequately for its effects on future fertility. To this end, it is imperative that investigators continue to evaluate these surgical procedures so that the clinician can provide accurate and comprehensive information when faced with a patient who desires one or more of these approaches. Furthermore, it is critical for the practitioner to stay informed about these procedures so that patients can be given a full complement of options.

### Laparoscopic hysterectomy with morcellation vs abdominal hysterectomy for presumed fibroid tumors in premenopausal women: a decision analysis [^113QkMPt]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to model outcomes in laparoscopic hysterectomy with morcellation compared with abdominal hysterectomy for the presumed fibroid uterus and to examine short- and long-term complications and death.

Study Design

A decision tree was constructed to compare outcomes for a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 premenopausal women who underwent hysterectomy for presumed fibroid tumors over a 5-year time horizon. Parameter and quality-of-life utility estimates were determined from published literature for postoperative complications, leiomyosarcoma incidence, death related to leiomyosarcoma, and procedure-related death.

Results

The decision-tree analysis predicted fewer overall deaths with laparoscopic hysterectomy compared with abdominal hysterectomy (98 vs 103 per 100,000). Although there were more deaths from leiomyosarcoma after laparoscopic hysterectomy (86 vs 71 per 100,000), there were more hysterectomy-related deaths with abdominal hysterectomy (32 vs 12 per 100,000). The laparoscopic group had lower rates of transfusion (2400 vs 4700 per 100,000), wound infection (1500 vs 6300 per 100,000), venous thromboembolism (690 vs 840 per 100,000) and incisional hernia (710 vs 8800 per 100,000), but a higher rate of vaginal cuff dehiscence (640 vs 290 per 100,000). Laparoscopic hysterectomy resulted in more quality-adjusted life years (499,171 vs 490,711 over 5 years).

Conclusion

The risk of leiomyosarcoma morcellation is balanced by procedure-related complications that are associated with laparotomy, including death. This analysis provides patients and surgeons with estimates of risk and benefit on which patient-centered decisions can be made.

### SOGC clinical practice guidelines. uterine fibroid embolization (UFE). Number 150, October 2004 [^116bZvmE]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To help direct the organized and effective implementation of uterine fibroid embolization into clinical practice in Canada.

Options

This document is restricted to the management of uterine fibroid embolization as performed by the radiologists utilizing a transfemoral artery approach with arteriography followed by vessel embolization.

Outcomes

Uterine fibroid embolization has been evaluated in terms of patient satisfaction, risks of complications, risks in subsequent pregnancy and rate of hysterectomy within a few months of the procedure. As the procedure is relatively new, data on long-term outcomes are not available.

Evidence

Published opinions of experts, supplemented by evidence from clinical trials where appropriate.

Values

The quality of the evidence is rated using the criteria described by the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination.

Benefits, Harms, and Costs

For women presenting with symptomatic uterine fibroids who are candidates for UFE, there is often a benefit to avoiding an abdominal surgery. The risks of theUFE procedure, possible complications, and short- and long-term prognosis must be measured on an individual basis against the well studied surgical alternatives. Patient preference is an important component of this evaluation. The non-material costs of on going symptoms from the fibroids are difficult to measure and use comparatively against the cost of hospitalization and treatment. In evaluating costs of UFE, the calculations should take into consideration the cost of managing occasional complications including subsequent hysterectomy. The cost of myomectomy or hysterectomy will vary largely depending on technique used and length of hospital stay.

Recommendations

1. Women considering treatment of fibroids should be counselled that while the early results of uterine artery embolization are encouraging, no long-term data exist. (II-2-B). 2.UFE should only be considered for women with symptomatic or problematic fibroids who might otherwise be advised to have surgical treatment. (III-A). 3. UFE as a treatment for fibroids inpatients wishing to preserve their fertility should be undertaken with full disclosure to the patient about the limitations of such a procedure and the lack of existing data regarding future fertility and pregnancy outcomes. (III-C). 4. UFE is contraindicated in women who have evidence of current genitourinary infection and/or malignancy. (II-2-B). 5. Women who choose UFE as an alternative to hysterectomy should be counselled regarding the risk of major complications of UFE where hysterectomy may be urgently required and potentially lifesaving. In view of this small but important risk, UFE is relatively contraindicated in women who are unwilling to have a hysterectomy under any circumstances. (III-C). 6. Genitourinary infection is the predominant cause of serious morbidity and mortality. Further research on the utility of prophylactic antibiotic therapy and the value of pretreatment screening for infection is needed. (II-2-B). 7. A gynaecologist who is familiar with UFE should evaluate all patients considered for UFE before the procedure is booked and a consensus on the suitability of the procedure achieved between the gynaecologist and radiologist. (III-C). 8. Only radiologists with specialized embolization experience and techniques should perform UFE. (III-C). 9. The particular responsibilities of both gynaecologist and radiologist should be established prior to treatment and be set out in a relevant hospital protocol. A particular physician must be responsible for the patient at all times. (III-C). 10. A Canadian national registry of numbers, indications, outcomes, complications, and successful pregnancies associated with UFE should be created and jointly administered and funded by the SOGC, CAR, and CIRA. (III-C).

### Short-term outcomes of minimally invasive total vs supracervical hysterectomy for uterine fibroids: a national surgical quality improvement program study [^111Hjyz7]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Uterine fibroids are the most common indication for benign hysterectomy in the United States, but data regarding the association between hysterectomy type and outcomes for this indication are lacking.

Objective

This study aimed to describe the rate and odds of short-term (30 days) postoperative complications between patients who underwent minimally invasive total laparoscopic hysterectomy and those who underwent laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy for uterine fibroids.

Study Design

This was a cohort study of prospectively collected data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2012 to 2020. The characteristics of women who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy and those who underwent laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy for uterine fibroids were identified. In addition, the risk factors associated with the occurrence of 30-day postoperative complications, defined according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, were identified. Multivariate regression analysis, including age, body mass index, race, comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, uterine weight, and concomitant procedures, was performed to identify the adjusted odds of postoperative complications. The co-primary outcomes were (1) the risk of a composite of any postoperative complications and (2) the risk of major postoperative complications according to surgical type.

Results

Overall, 44,413 patients underwent minimally invasive total laparoscopic hysterectomy, and 6383 patients underwent laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy. The operative time was shorter in the total laparoscopic hysterectomy group than in the laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy group (143.0 vs 150.6 minutes, respectively; P < .001). In addition, the proportion of uterine weight of > 250 g was lower in the total laparoscopic hysterectomy group than in the laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy group (39.4% vs 45.1%, respectively; P < .001). The rates of any and major complications were higher in the total laparoscopic hysterectomy group than in the laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy group (any complications: 6.6% vs 5.3%, respectively; P < .001; major complications: 2.7% vs 1.6%, respectively; P < .001), whereas the rates of minor complications were comparable in both groups (4.4% vs 4.1%, respectively; p = 0.309). In multivariate regression analysis, laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy was independently associated with a lower risk of any (adjusted odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.88) and major (adjusted odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.44–0.69) complications than total laparoscopic hysterectomy.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy was associated with a lower risk of short-term postoperative complications in patients with uterine fibroids than total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Our findings can aid in shared decision-making before minimally invasive hysterectomy for uterine fibroids.

### Factors influencing chronic pain after hysterectomy for uterine fibroids: development and validation of a nomogram prediction model [^116N3opX]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors in women of reproductive age, and they are associated with heavy bleeding, reduced fertility, and decreased quality of life. Surgery is the preferred treatment for patients with clinically symptomatic uterine fibroids, with the most common traditional surgical options being myomectomy to remove the fibroids or total hysterectomy, with the latter being more frequently performed. Chronic postsurgical pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as persistent or recurrent pain that arises after a surgical procedure, located in or around the surgical site, and lasting for at least three months. Postoperative chronic pain is a common complication after hysterectomy, typically related to changes in damaged neurons, inflammation, and the release of pain-inducing substances following tissue injury, which excite nociceptors and contribute to the development of chronic pain. Persistent pain hinders recovery and negatively affects patient well-being. Early identification of high-risk patients can provide a critical window for reducing the risk of postoperative chronic pain and improving patients' quality of life. Studies have shown that the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is a validated and simple tool for assessing postoperative chronic pain and is now widely used in clinical practice. However, using the NRS alone to assess postoperative pain has relatively low efficiency and makes it difficult to predict pain early. Therefore, to assess the risk of developing chronic pain after uterine fibroid hysterectomy, this study analyzed several identified risk factors and combined them with new risk factors to develop a nomogram prediction model.

### Short-and long-term evaluation of disease-specific symptoms and quality of life following uterine artery embolization of fibroids [^116r81J1]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Uterine leiomyomas, also known as fibroids, are the most common benign tumors of the female genital tract in women of reproductive age. Their incidence increases with age and they usually regress after menopause. Although most women are asymptomatic, fibroids can cause numerous severe conditions such as dysmenorrhea with or without abnormal uterine bleeding, disruption of surrounding pelvic structures and fertility problems. Besides physical impairment, the impact of symptomatic fibroids on mental health and quality of life of affected women must not be underestimated. The standard treatment approach for symptomatic women consists of surgical myomectomy and hysterectomy associated with good symptom control and high patient satisfaction. However, the management of symptomatic fibroids is challenging and interdisciplinary concepts are needed to offer individual therapy options. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) has proven to be an effective minimally invasive treatment alternative for patients with symptomatic fibroids. In comparison with surgery, UAE has several advantages including preservation of the uterus, the use of conscious sedation rather than general anesthesia, low risk of blood loss and a shorter recovery time.

Several short- and long-term studies have highlighted the effectiveness and safety of UAE in the reduction of clinical symptoms and improvement of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). Nevertheless, only few studies incorporated validated outcome measures for assessing short- and long-term changes in symptoms and HRQoL.

The use of the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) questionnaires, presented by Spies et al. in 2002, allows the uniform and objective assessment of disease-specific symptom severity and impairment of patient's HRQoL before and after treatment. Standardized questionnaires facilitate the comparison with the results of similar studies incorporating validated outcome measures.

This study assessed effects of UAE on quality of life in a large patient cohort by analyzing results from standardized UFS-QoL questionnaires. The comprehensive analysis focuses on short- and long-term continuous clinical effectiveness of UAE, re-intervention rates, as well as response to treatment depending on lesion size.

### The impact of fertility goals on long-term quality of life in reproductive-aged women who underwent myomectomy versus hysterectomy for uterine fibroids [^112Q3Bpp]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

The objective of this study is to compare quality of life (QOL) for myomectomy with hysterectomy 1 to 5 years after surgical management for fibroids. This study evaluated the difference in QOL in a population of women of reproductive age, including those who desire fertility.

Design

A retrospective cohort study.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Setting

A large academic hospital.

Patients

A total of 142 women who underwent hysterectomy or myomectomy in 2015 to 2020. Included patients were women aged 18 years or older who underwent surgical intervention owing to uterine fibroids.

Measurements and Main Results

The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) provides a total score as a single measure of health-related QOL. The Uterine Fibroid Symptom Quality of Life Questionnaire for Hysterectomy and Myomectomy (UFS-QOL) is a patient-reported outcome measure of fibroid symptoms and health-related QOL after hysterectomy and myomectomy. There was no significant difference in SF-36 QOL scores in women after myomectomy who desired fertility compared with those who did not desire fertility, except in the social functioning domain (p = .025). UFS-QOL scores in women after myomectomy who desired fertility were not significantly different compared with women after myomectomy who did not desire fertility (p = .37). There were no significant differences between women who underwent myomectomy and hysterectomy in overall QOL scores on the SF-36 (p = .13) and UFS-QOL scores (p = .16).

Conclusion

Myomectomy is not associated with significant differences in measures of general health and QOL compared with hysterectomy, making it a viable fibroid management option for women who desire fertility. Our study highlights the importance of discussing fertility goals and QOL when counseling patients for surgical fibroid treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® on treatment of uterine leiomyomas [^113By9fo]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) are the most common tumors in women of reproductive age and a cause of significant morbidity in this patient population. Depending on the fibroid location, they can be the cause of a variety of symptoms, such as abnormal uterine bleeding, constipation, urinary frequency, and pain. Historically, hysterectomy has been the primary treatment option, and uterine fibroids remain the leading cause for hysterectomy in the United States. However, women who do not wish to undergo hysterectomy now have a variety of less invasive options available, including uterine artery embolization. This article discusses uterine artery embolization as well as some of the other treatment strategies for symptomatic uterine fibroids. In many situations, there may be no single best treatment option but several viable alternatives. Each option is discussed with consideration of outcomes, complications, and, when possible, cost-effectiveness. The recommendations in this article are the result of evidence-based consensus of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Expert Panel on Interventional Radiology.

### Uterine fibroid tumors: diagnosis and treatment [^111FDtJ8]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The incidence of uterine fibroid tumors increases as women grow older, and they may occur in more than 30 percent of women 40 to 60 years of age. Risk factors include nulliparity, obesity, family history, black race, and hypertension. Many tumors are asymptomatic and may be diagnosed incidentally. Although a causal relationship has not been established, fibroid tumors are associated with menorrhagia, pelvic pain, pelvic or urinary obstructive symptoms, infertility, and pregnancy loss. Transvaginal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, sonohysterography, and hysteroscopy are available to evaluate the size and position of tumors. Ultrasonography should be used initially because it is the least invasive and most cost-effective investigation. Treatment options include hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, myolysis, and medical therapy. Treatment must be individualized based on such considerations as the presence and severity of symptoms, the patient's desire for definitive treatment, the desire to preserve childbearing capacity, the importance of uterine preservation, infertility related to uterine cavity distortions, and previous pregnancy complications related to fibroid tumors.

### Emerging treatment options for fibroids [^113cGrqi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Leiomyomas (fibroids) are common, usually benign, monoclonal tumors that arise from the uterine myometrium. Clinical presentation is variable; some patients are asymptomatic, whereas others experience heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, bulk symptoms, and/or alterations in fertility. Previously, treatment options for fibroids were largely surgical. However, over the last decade, options have grown to include many medical and procedural options that allow for uterine and fertility preservation. Clinicians must become familiar with these options to adequately counsel patients desiring treatment of fibroids.

### Fibroid growth and medical options for treatment [^113D54Bi]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Although fibroids are common benign tumors, their impact on women's quality of life can be considerable. The most frequent symptoms are uterine bleeding, resulting in anemia, and pelvic pain. Fibroids can be of genetic or hormonal origin or arise from intrauterine events. Current options for medical treatment include control of estradiol and progesterone production or action and are discussed in this review. Although curative treatment of fibroids relies on surgical strategies, the current trend is for uterine-sparing treatment to preserve fertility and avoid unnecessary surgery. Currently approved medical treatments include intrauterine progestin delivery to reduce uterine bleeding, GnRH analogues, and, more recently, selective progesterone receptor modulators to control uterine bleeding and reduce fibroid volume.

### Uterine fibroids [^117NRG8V]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids (also known as leiomyomas or myomas) are common clonal neoplasms of the uterus. Fibroids have both smooth muscle and fibroblast components, in addition to a substantial amount of fibrous extracellular matrix, which all contribute to the pathogenetic process. Fibroids are extremely heterogeneous in their pathophysiology, size, location and clinical symptomatology. They are also a part of a range of disease in which some variants have facets of malignant behaviour but overall are benign. Risk for fibroids is associated with race; black women have a higher risk of developing fibroids earlier in life than their white counterparts and also develop more-severe forms of the disease. Clinically, fibroids account for one-third to half of all hysterectomies and are associated with substantial morbidity and health care costs for women of reproductive age. Indeed, current treatments are primarily surgical and interventional; approximately three-quarters of all fibroid treatments are hysterectomies. However, clinical innovations are emerging in the use of progesterone receptor modulators as a medical therapy. New information is rapidly accumulating about the genetic subgroups that lead to fibroid formation, which might aid further understanding of the clinical heterogeneity of this disease and lead to individualized treatments. This information is a crucial development given the current lack of high-quality evidence on which to base therapeutic decisions.

### Short-and long-term evaluation of disease-specific symptoms and quality of life following uterine artery embolization of fibroids [^114LY39g]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations. One limitation of this study is the chosen study design without randomization to a control group or another treatment method. All patients presented to us after having made the decision to undergo UAE and randomization was, consequently, not possible due to the lack of a control group. Moreover, UAE was performed by a group of board-certified radiologists, which might have resulted in differences in the therapeutic outcome because the end point of embolization is somewhat subjective and thus may vary between different interventionalists. Another limitation is the number of patients for subgroup analysis. Although the patient cohort is comparatively large, the number of patients was reduced due to lack of compliance regarding completion of the questionnaire. In addition, many patients were not reached in the long-term follow-up for questionnaire completion ('lost to follow-up'). Finally, potential recall bias might exist as the timeframe of the long-term follow-up period was very heterogeneous with a span reaching from ten months to ten years.

Objective

The purpose of this study was assessment of the long-term outcome of fibroid-associated quality of life among patients treated with uterine fibroid embolization.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective follow-up cohort study included all patients described in a 2006 publication. Analysis was performed with a questionnaire consisting of 49 questions about six topics. Assessment was focused on comparing symptoms and quality of life in long-term follow-up.

Results

The analysis was based on questionnaires completed by 39 patients. The median follow-up period was 7 years (interquartile range, 1.5 years). Uterine fibroid embolization led to a reduction of bleeding symptoms in 89.7% of the patients, pain in 78.9%, bulk-related symptoms in 89.5%, fatigue in 76.9%, limitations of social life in 92.9%, and depression in 78.6%. The median impairment scores for bleeding and pain decreased significantly from 7 to 0 and from 5 to 0 (both p < 0.001). The general quality-of-life index increased significantly from 4.5 to 9 (p < 0.001). In the long term, there was no significant difference in parameters assessed compared with the midterm follow-up findings. Six patients (15.4%) underwent hysterectomy an average of 32.1 months after intervention. Thirty-two patients (82.1%) continued to be satisfied with the intervention, and 30 patients (76.9%) answered that they would recommend uterine fibroid embolization to other patients.

Conclusion

Uterine fibroid embolization seems to lead to notable long-term relief of fibroid-associated symptoms. In comparison with the midterm results, long-term outcome shows a clear continuance of improvement in general quality of life.

### Short-term health-related quality of life after hysterectomy compared with myomectomy for symptomatic leiomyomas [^116mj7PK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare short-term health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 6–12 weeks after hysterectomy or myomectomy for the treatment of symptomatic leiomyomas.

Methods

We conducted a prospective comparative effectiveness analysis of data. In an existing multisite registry, we compared 6–12-week postsurgical HRQOL using the disease-specific Uterine Fibroid Symptom Quality of Life and the generic EuroQoL 5-Dimension Health Questionnaire, in women from the ages of 18–54 years with documented leiomyomas undergoing hysterectomy or myomectomy. Propensity score weighting was used to adjust for confounding, and analyses were also stratified by route of surgery.

Results

A total of 1,295 patients (727 with hysterectomy and 568 with myomectomy) enrolled from registry initiation in November 2015 until June 2018 met inclusion criteria. At baseline, leiomyoma-specific HRQOL (44.0 ± 25.4 and 50.2 ± 25.3, P < .01), symptom severity (60.7 ± 23.6 and 51.7 ± 24.6, P < .01), and generic HRQOL (69.3 ± 20.4 and. 73.4 ± 18.9, P < .01) were significantly different between the hysterectomy compared with myomectomy groups, respectively. Differences were eliminated by propensity adjustment. Substantial improvement in HRQOL measures were seen in both groups at 6–12 weeks, with the mean propensity-adjusted symptom severity score 4 points lower in hysterectomy patients (mean difference -4.6; 95% CI -7.0 to -2.3), compared with myomectomy patients. Hysterectomy patients had better scores on the concern and self-consciousness subscales compared with myomectomy patients. When stratified by surgical route, these two subscale findings were similar between minimally invasive hysterectomy and minimally invasive myomectomy. Symptom severity scores did not differ after abdominal myomectomy compared with abdominal hysterectomy, but subscale scores on activity and energy/mood were higher with myomectomy.

Conclusion

Both hysterectomy and myomectomy were associated with substantial improvement in HRQOL at short-term follow-up, with small but statistically significant differences in symptom severity and certain subscales.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® management of uterine fibroids: 2023 Update [^113DMLrF]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumor in women of reproductive age and can present with symptoms including bleeding, bulk related symptoms, and infertility. Several treatment options are available for the management of uterine fibroids, including medical management, minimally invasive therapies such as uterine artery embolization and MR-guided focused ultrasound ablation, and surgical interventions ranging from laparoscopic myomectomy to open hysterectomy. Given this wide range of therapeutic interventions, it is important to understand the data supporting these interventions and to be able to apply it in different clinical settings. This document provides a summary of recent trials supporting various therapies for uterine fibroids, including recent evidence for MR-guided focused ultrasound ablation and a detailed discussion of fertility outcomes in myomectomy and uterine fibroid embolization. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Uterine artery embolization in patients with a large fibroid burden: long-term clinical and MR follow-up [^111nYdRJ]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

UAE is, at present, gaining acceptance as an alternative to hysterectomy or myomectomy in symptomatic women with uterine fibroids. Many women appreciate the results that can be obtained with UAE: improvement or elimination of symptoms and reduction of uterine size, with maintenance of the uterus and preservation of fertility. In many studies the good long-term results and low complication rates of this treatment have been reported. Despite these overall satisfying results, in the subgroup of patients with a large fibroid burden, a higher rate of serious ischemic, necrotic, and infectious complications is ascribed, based on several anecdotal reports.

Our results show that a large fibroid burden does not decrease the efficacy of UAE and there is no higher complication rate. Our results in patients with a large fibroid burden are comparable and in the same range as in large studies reporting on results of UAE in unselected patients. In the vast majority of our patients there is a significant volume reduction of the fibroids in combination with good clinical results.

The rate of adverse events after UAE in patients with a large fibroid burden was very low, and emergent surgery was never necessary. These results are valid for patients with a very large dominant fibroid, as well as for patients with a large uterine volume from many smaller fibroids or the combination. During long-term follow-up, the frequency of additional embolization and hysterectomy in our selected patients was in the same range as in previous studies on unselected patients. Our findings suggest that, in women with a large fibroid burden who are reluctant to undergo hysterectomy, UAE is a valuable alternative with a high rate of success in preserving the uterus.

Our study has several limitations. Long-term clinical follow-up was not available for all patients. The UFS-QOL was assessed only at long-term follow-up, and not at baseline. However, strong points of our study were the follow-up duration of more than 5 years in the majority of patients and the complete clinical follow-up in terms of additional treatments.

### Uterine fibroids: rapid evidence review [^111JQbkU]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumor in women. Most fibroids are asymptomatic, but presenting symptoms include those associated with increased uterine size (eg, abdominal distension, urinary frequency or urgency, constipation), abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain, and infertility. The initial evaluation of fibroids should include a full gynecologic history with abdominal, speculum, and bimanual pelvic examinations. Initial imaging of choice is the combination of transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasonography. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging with contrast may further characterize the extent of disease and guide treatment. Treatment choices are determined by fibroid size and location with preferences for uterine and fertility preservation. Pharmacotherapy is used to control heavy or abnormal uterine bleeding and includes combined and progestin-only oral contraceptives; 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; tranexamic acid; and hormonal therapies, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. Surgical and interventional options reduce bulk symptoms, reduce bleeding, and may preserve or improve fertility. Surgical and interventional radiologic options include hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, radiofrequency ablation, and high-intensity focused ultrasonography. Treating vitamin D deficiency may reduce fibroid tumor size or halt progression.

### Epidemiology and management of uterine fibroids [^111ju2Zk]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas are one of the most common and yet understudied diseases in women. These tumors, commonly known as fibroids, affect women mainly during their reproductive years and are diagnosed in up to 70% of white women and more than 80% of women of African ancestry during their lifetime. This disease has a profound impact on health care delivery and costs worldwide. Though most women with fibroids are asymptomatic, approximately 30% of them will present with severe symptoms which can include abnormal uterine bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain and pressure, back pain, urinary frequency, constipation, or infertility, and will require intervention. Furthermore, fibroids have been associated with poor obstetrical outcomes. The current options for symptomatic fibroid treatment include expectant, medical, and surgical management, and interventional radiology procedures. This article reviews the recent progress and available management strategies for uterine fibroids and highlights areas where further research is needed to find new therapeutic targets and better personalize treatments.

### Uterine fibroid embolisation for symptomatic uterine fibroids: a survey of clinical practice in Europe [^116KfATA]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Since the publications of Ravina et al. in the early 1990s on premyomectomy transcatheter embolisation to minimize blood loss during surgery, the surprising effects on decreased fibroid size and symptoms became evident and led to the first reports on UFE as a single treatment for symptomatic fibroids. After a worldwide introduction as a possible alternative to hysterectomy and many additional studies on this treatment, UFE now seems to fit into the treatment options available to women suffering from uterine fibroids.

The Cochrane review from 2006 cited that UFE resulted in the same patient satisfaction rate as surgery (myomectomy or hysterectomy). The length of hospital stay was decreased after UFE, and the return to daily activities was faster. Because UFE seemed to result in a higher minor complication rate and more unscheduled visits and readmission rates, the statement was made that additional focus on long-term follow-up was necessary to determine the real impact of UFE.

As a result, retrospective cohort studies examined and compared the results of UFE and hysterectomy, which lead to satisfying conclusions concerning safety, expectations, and cost-effectiveness over a longer follow-up period. Furthermore, randomized studies comparing UFE and surgery (hysterectomy or myomectomy) have been completed in the meantime, resulting in publications in major scientific journals. However, in gynaecological papers, the experimental character of UFE was only recently abandoned. Short, medium, and long-term follow-up data are currently available, leading to a more positive attitude from our gynaecological colleagues.

Guidelines from different medical specialities currently consent that UFE is a valuable alternative to surgical management of symptomatic fibroids in carefully selected and informed patients. Bratby et al. quoted that level 1 evidence has established the role of UFE as a proper alternative treatment. Last but not least, Bradley et al. stated that UFE is effective, safe, and durable and should be considered a true alternative to hysterectomy. Apparently, the Cochrane review from 2006 is considerably outdated and must be revised as soon as possible.

### Short-and long-term evaluation of disease-specific symptoms and quality of life following uterine artery embolization of fibroids [^111GbhEn]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This comprehensive study has three main findings: (1) UAE is an effective treatment of symptomatic fibroids. Treated women show a significant improvement of HRQoL, as measured by the standardized UFS-QoL questionnaire, and re-intervention rates are low, even years after treatment. (2) HRQoL of treated women improves significantly early after treatment and keeps improving after time with the best results in long-term follow-up. (3) Patients with small symptomatic fibroids respond significantly better to UAE when compared to women with larger fibroids. UFS-QoL scores were significantly higher and the risk of re-intervention half as low as in the large-fibroids group.

UAE plays an important role in the treatment of symptomatic fibroids in today's clinical routine with numerous studies reporting the effectiveness and safety of this minimal-invasive approach. Many of these studies have focused on the rate of hysterectomies, myomectomies, or re-embolization following UAE, as the need for re-intervention is considered an objective treatment failure. Multiple studies have shown that UAE is associated with a low rate of re-interventions of approximately 15–25% in the long-term after a median of five to nine years post-intervention. These results are in line with the low re-intervention rate in this study cohort (11%; n = 245).

### Effect on surgical decisions: ulipristal acetate as key player in Belgian phase IV registration trial [^1113UZrE]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To observe alterations in surgical planning that were due to the use of ulipristal acetate (UPA) 5 mg daily for symptomatic uterine fibroids.

Methods

A prospective cohort trial involving women with symptomatic fibroids was undertaken in 23 clinical practice sites within Belgium between October 1, 2014, and March 31, 2016, to compare initial surgical planning to performed surgical procedures following the use of UPA 5 mg daily for 3 months. Secondary outcomes were surgical complications, reduction in fibroids, bleeding control, and adverse effects.

Results

Two hundred and twenty-two women were recruited for the trial. The requirement for surgery decreased with the use of UPA, with 54% of women undergoing surgery after treatment. The reduction in surgery performed was lower for women willing to conceive (40%) compared to women who were not (49%). The volume of the fibroids decreased significantly, with the largest measured fibroid decreasing by 50%. Bleeding and pain were significantly decreased with the use of UPA. No major complications were recorded, and no liver function abnormalities were reported during the treatment and in follow-up.

Conclusion

By administering UPA, the required rate of surgery was significantly decreased. Also, the resulting reduction in size of the fibroids could have the potential benefit of reducing surgery-related complications, and long-term use may be warranted to avoid surgery completely.

2.4.1 Gonadotropin‐releasing hormone agonists

Gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are peptides similar in structure to GnRH with amino acid substitutions that enhance their affinity for binding to the receptor. This causes continuous stimulation, initially producing an increase in the release of gonadotropins (flare effect) that can last 1–2 weeks, after which gonadal sex steroids decrease until reaching medical castration levels.

GnRH agonists are effective for shrinking fibroid size (about 50% of their initial volume). Several randomized, placebo‐controlled studies showed that leuprolide acetate significantly reduces uterine and fibroid volume. This results in improvement of fibroid‐related symptoms. Unfortunately, this highly effective therapy is limited in duration because of its adverse effects. It is restricted to a 3‐ to 6‐month interval, and when treatment is stopped, the fibroids come back to their pretreatment size. Consequently, therapy with GnRH analogs is not suitable as a long‐term treatment — although it can offer significant benefits in the preoperative setting — unless given with "add‐back" hormones, which at low doses do not affect the success of the treatment with regard to symptoms but do minimize long‐term adverse effects.

In reference to the use of GNRH analogs before surgery, the preoperative use of GnRH agonists is associated with an increase in preoperative hemoglobin, and a reduction in both uterine and fibroid volume. These effects come at the expense of a greater likelihood (odds) of adverse events, in particular hot flushes, headache, dizziness, vaginitis, change in breast size, and sweating. A Cochrane systematic review published in 2017 showed these principal outcomes during and after the hysterectomy. Other benefits included: a significant reduction in blood loss and the need for blood transfusions, smaller odds of requiring vertical incision, lower likelihood (odds) of difficult surgery and improved postoperative hemoglobin levels. In women undergoing myomectomy, most trials found that GnRH agonists reduced intraoperative blood loss, there was no evidence that pretreatment influenced duration of surgery, odds of intraoperative blood transfusions, duration of hospital stay, and recurrence of fibroids or postoperative hemoglobin levels.

Hysterectomy is one of the most common gynecologic surgeries. Early adoption of surgical advancements in hysterectomies has raised concerns over safety, quality, and costs. The risk of potential leiomyosarcoma in women undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy led the US Food and Drug Administration to discourage the use of electronic power morcellator. Minimally invasive hysterectomies have increased substantially despite lack of data supporting its use over other forms of hysterectomy and increased costs. Health care reform is incentivizing providers to improve quality, improve safety, and decrease costs through standardized outcomes and process measures.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® fibroids [^114SoWox]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas or myomas) are the most common neoplasm of the uterus. Though incompletely understood, fibroid etiology is multifactorial, a combination of genetic alterations and endocrine, autocrine, environmental, and other factors such as race, age, parity, and body mass index. Black women have greater than an 80% incidence of fibroids by age 50, whereas White women have an incidence approaching 70%. Fibroid symptoms are protean, and menorrhagia is most frequent. The societal economic burden of symptomatic fibroids is large, 5.9 to 34.3 billion dollars annually. There are a variety of treatment options for women with symptomatic fibroids ranging from medical therapy to hysterectomy. Myomectomy and uterine fibroid embolization are the most common uterine sparing therapies. Pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal and transvaginal) with Doppler and MRI with and without intravenous contrast are the best imaging modalities for the initial diagnosis of fibroids, the initial treatment of known fibroids, and for surveillance or posttreatment imaging. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### The fibroid registry for outcomes data (FIBROID) for uterine embolization: short-term outcomes [^1111Zf8s]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the short-term safety of uterine embolization for leiomyomata in a large cohort of patients treated in a variety of clinical settings.

Methods

Examining the FIBROID Registry, a multicenter prospective voluntary registry of patients undergoing uterine embolization for leiomyomata, we studied the frequency of adverse events and predictors of adverse events within 30 days of the procedure. We also report on the technical aspects of the procedure, including details of periprocedural care, technique, and short-term recovery. All adverse events were recorded and classified using standard definitions, both in terms of type and severity. Summary statistics were used to describe the data set, and univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine which factors might influence the incidence of adverse events.

Results

Of the 3,160 patients enrolled at 72 contributing sites, major in-hospital complications occurred in 0.66%, and postdischarge major events occurred in 4.8% within the first 30 days. The most common adverse event after discharge was inadequate pain relief requiring additional hospital treatment (2.4%). Thirty-one patients required additional surgical intervention within 30 days after treatment, 3 of whom required hysterectomy (0.1%). There were no deaths. Multivariate analysis showed modest increased odds for an adverse event for African Americans, smokers, and those with prior leiomyoma procedures. There were no differences in outcome based on the practice site experience, practice type, or any procedure-related factors.

Conclusion

Uterine embolization for leiomyomata is a low-risk procedure with little variability in short-term outcome based on either patient demographics or practice setting.

### Radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of uterine fibroids: a systematic review and meta-analysis by the AAGL practice committee [^114StfTm]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Robotic-assisted versus conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy — randomized trial data show longer operative times for robotic-assisted surgery without differences in major perioperative outcomes: A randomized trial included 95 patients and found operating times longer for the robotic-assisted group (106 vs 75 minutes) with no differences in blood loss or surgical complications, and although postoperative quality of life at 6 weeks improved more after robotic-assisted hysterectomy, there was no difference in postoperative analgesic use or return to normal activities. A preliminary randomized report in 53 women (n = 27 conventional; n = 26 robotic-assisted) showed robotic-assisted surgery had significantly longer skin-to-skin operative time by 77 minutes and longer total surgical time by 72 minutes, with no significant differences in estimated blood loss, hematocrit change, length of stay, complications, or postoperative pain on visual analog scales.

### Uterine artery embolization as a treatment option for uterine myomas [^112mDuv5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Information is still being collected on the long-term clinical responses and appropriate patient selection for UAE. Prospective RCTs have not been performed to compare the clinical results from UAE with more conventional therapies for symptomatic uterine leiomyomata. At least three attempts at conducting such RCTs have been unsuccessful because of poor patient accrual that related to differing patient expectation and desires, clinical bias, insurance coverage, and the tendency that patients who have exhausted other treatment options may be disposed more favorably to less invasive treatments. Other comparative studies have serious limitations. For example, the retrospective study that compared outcomes after abdominal myomectomy with UAE suggested that patients who received UAE were more likely to require further invasive treatment by 3 years than were recipients of myomectomy. Lack of randomization introduced a selection bias because women in the group that underwent UAEwere older and were more likely to have had previous surgeries. A prospective study of "contemporaneous cohorts", which excluded patients who had sub-mucosal and pedunculated subserosal myomas, sought to compare quality of life measures and adverse events in patients who underwent UAE or hysterectomy. The investigators concluded that both treatments resulted in marked improvement in symptoms and quality of life scores, but complications were higher in the group that underwent hysterectomy over 1 year. In this study, however, a greater proportion of patients who underwent hysterectomy had improved pelvic pain scores. Furthermore, hysterectomy eliminates uterine bleeding and the risk for recurrence of myomas. Despite the lack of controlled studies that compared UAE with conventional surgery, and despite limited extended outcome data, UAE has gained rapid acceptance, primarily because the procedure preserves the uterus, is less invasive, and has less short-term morbidity than do most surgical options. The cost of UAE varies by region, but is comparable to the charges for hysterectomy and is less expensive than abdominal myomectomy. The evaluation before UAE may entail additional fees for diagnostic testing, such as MRI, to assess the uterine size and screen for adenomyosis. Other centers have recommended pretreatment ultrasonography, laparoscopy, hysteroscopy, endometrial biopsy, and biopsy of large fibroids to evaluate sarcoma. Generally, after UAE the recovery time and time lost from work are less; however, the potential need for subsequent surgery may be greater when compared with abdominal myomectomy. Any center that offers UAE should adhere to published clinical guidelines, maintain ongoing assessment of quality improvements measures, and observe strict criteria for obtaining procedural privileges. After McLucas advocated that gynecologists learn the skill to perform UAE for managing symptomatic myomas, the Society of Interventional Radiology responded with a precautionary commentary on the level of technical proficiency that is necessary to maintain optimum results from UAE. The complexity of pelvic arterial anatomy, the skill that is required to master modern coaxial microcatheters, and the hazards of significant patient radiation exposure were cited as reasons why sound training and demonstration of expertise be obtained before clinicians are credentialed to perform UAE. A collaboration between the gynecologist and the interventional radiologist is necessary to optimize the safety and efficacy of UAE. The primary candidates for this procedure include women who have symptomatic uterine fibroids who no longer desire fertility, but wish to avoid surgery or are poor surgical risks. The gynecologist is likely to be the primary initial consultant to patients who present with complaints of symptomatic myomas. Therefore, they must be familiar with the indications, exclusions, outcome expectations, and complications of UAE in their particular center. When hysterectomy is the only option, UAE should be considered. Appropriate diagnostic testing should aid in the exclusion of most, but not all, gynecologic cancers and pregnancy. Other contraindications include severe contrast medium allergy, renal insufficiency, and coagulopathy. MRI may be used to screen women before treatment in an attempt to detect those who have adenomyosis; patients should be aware that UAE is less effective in the presence of solitary or coexistent adenomyosis. Because some women may experience ovarian failure after UAE, additional studies to determine basal follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol before and after the procedure may provide insight into UAE-induced follicle depletion.UAE is a unique new treatment for uterine myomas, and is no longer considered investigational for symptomatic uterine fibroids. There is international recognition that data are needed from RCTs that compare UAE with surgical alternatives. Current efforts to provide prospective objective assessment of treatment outcomes and complications after UAE will help to optimize patient selection and clinical guidelines. FIBROID should provide critical data for the assessment of safety and outcomes measures for women who receive UAE for symptomatic uterine myomas.

### Comprehensive review of uterine fibroids: developmental origin, pathogenesis, and treatment [^111cngnc]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Uterine fibroids are benign monoclonal neoplasms of the myometrium, representing the most common tumors in women worldwide. To date, no long-term or noninvasive treatment option exists for hormone-dependent uterine fibroids, due to the limited knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation and development of uterine fibroids. This paper comprehensively summarizes the recent research advances on uterine fibroids, focusing on risk factors, development origin, pathogenetic mechanisms, and treatment options. Additionally, we describe the current treatment interventions for uterine fibroids. Finally, future perspectives on uterine fibroids studies are summarized. Deeper mechanistic insights into tumor etiology and the complexity of uterine fibroids can contribute to the progress of newer targeted therapies.

### The modern management of uterine fibroids-related abnormal uterine bleeding [^116Qmaq4]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids (UFs) are the most common female benign pelvic tumors, affecting > 60% of patients aged 30–44 years. Uterine fibroids are asymptomatic in a large percentage of cases and may be identified incidentally using a transvaginal ultrasound or a magnetic resonance imaging scan. However, in approximately 30% of cases, UFs affect the quality of life and women's health, with abnormal uterine bleeding and heavy menstrual bleeding being the most common complaints, along with iron deficiency (ID) and ID anemia. Medical treatments used for UFs-related abnormal uterine bleeding include symptomatic agents, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and tranexamic acid, and hormonal therapies, including combined oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists, levonorgestrel intrauterine systems, selective progesterone receptor modulators, and aromatase inhibitors. Nevertheless, few drugs are approved specifically for UF treatment, and most of them manage the symptoms. Surgical options include fertility-sparing treatments, such as myomectomy, or nonconservative options, such as hysterectomy, especially in perimenopausal women who are not responding to any treatment. Radiologic interventions are also available: uterine artery embolization, high-intensity focused ultrasound or magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound, and radiofrequency ablation. Furthermore, the management of ID and ID anemia, as a consequence of acute and chronic bleeding, should be taken into account with the use of iron replacement therapy both during medical treatment and before and after a surgical procedure. In the case of symptomatic UFs, the location, size, multiple UFs, or coexistent adenomyosis should guide the choice with a shared decision-making process, considering long- and short-term treatment goals expected by the patient, including pregnancy desire or wish to preserve the uterus independently of reproductive goals.

### The health disparities of uterine fibroid tumors for African American women: a public health issue [^114QGaQX]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Uterine fibroid tumors (leiomyomas) are the most common benign pelvic tumors in women and are the major indication for hysterectomy. Fibroid tumors are more common and more severe among African American women. Although this disease disproportionately affects the African American population, we understand little about what causes the disparity. Fibroid tumors should be considered a public health issue, given the magnitude of the problem and the costs of health care for this disease. In this review, we examine the burden of disease from fibroid tumors in the African American population and review the natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of uterine fibroid tumors, with emphasis on how these can differ, depending on race. We also focus on the socioeconomic burden caused by the disease and describe the anticipated influence of new health care reforms and funding mechanisms for fibroid tumor research.

Hysterectomy is the most common major gynecologic procedure. Although alternatives to hysterectomy result in fewer procedures performed annually, and the use of endoscopic techniques and vaginal hysterectomy have resulted in a lower percentage performed by the open abdominal route, certain pelvic disorders require abdominal hysterectomy. Preoperative evaluation with informed consent and surgical planning are essential to select appropriate candidates. Prophylactic antibiotics, thromboprophylaxis, attention to surgical technique, and enhanced recovery protocols should be used to provide optimal outcomes.

### Management of symptomatic uterine leiomyomas: ACOG practice bulletin, number 228 [^1178JKKK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) are the most common solid and symptomatic neoplasm in women. They are the leading indication for hysterectomy (1, 2), which is a definitive and effective surgical treatment for leiomyoma. However, many patients benefit from and seek out management options other than hysterectomy because they desire future childbearing or wish to retain their uterus. The purpose of this Practice Bulletin is to provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the medical, procedural, and surgical management of symptomatic leiomyomas. Discussion of the use of morcellation in the surgical management of leiomyomas is beyond the scope of this document and is addressed in a separate American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) publication (3).

### Hemostatic techniques for myomectomy: an evidence-based approach [^111YucDC]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Uterine leiomyomas are the most common benign gynecologic tumor. They are also a significant cause of morbidity, necessitating treatments ranging from hormonal suppression to surgical intervention. Myomectomy, the removal of these highly vascular tumors, offers significant quality of life and fertility-sparing benefit for patients affected by uterine leiomyomas but with a risk of substantial intraoperative blood loss. This risk of hemorrhage leads not only an increased transfusion rate but also he need for hysterectomy and other potential operative complications. Numerous medical and surgical techniques have been developed to minimize potentially significant blood loss during abdominal, laparoscopic, and robotic-assisted myomectomies. Combined with judicious preoperative assessment, these techniques substantially enhance patient safety during a myomectomy and outcomes during recovery.

### Medical treatment of fibroids: FIGO best practice guidance [^113jS3tH]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Even though uterine fibroids are a widespread condition, the range of approved medical treatment options remains limited. In fact, only a few drugs are officially approved for the therapy of fibroids. In both the United States and the European Medicines Agency region, selected gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists have been approved for this indication. GnRH analogs are primarily indicated for the preoperative management of uterine fibroids, largely because of their unfavorable long-term adverse effect profile. The previously approved therapy with ulipristal acetate had to undergo extensive restrictions because of safety concerns. Nevertheless, there are additional medications that may be used in clinical practice. These include combined oral contraceptives, oral progestins, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), and tranexamic acid. Although not specifically approved for the treatment of fibroids, these agents can reduce the intensity of bleeding in cases of heavy menstrual bleeding and thereby improve symptoms and lead to an improved quality of life for the patients.

### Uterine artery embolization vs hysterectomy in the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids: 10-year outcomes from the randomized EMMY trial [^115HhtPB]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Since 1995 uterine artery embolization has been described as an alternative for hysterectomy in patients with symptomatic fibroids. Many studies including several randomized controlled trials established uterine artery embolization as a valuable treatment. These randomized controlled trials reported outcomes in terms of health-related quality of life, clinical outcomes, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness after 1, 2, and 5 years of follow-up.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcome and health-related quality of life 10 years after uterine artery embolization or hysterectomy in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding caused by uterine fibroids in a randomized controlled trial.

Study Design

In all, 28 Dutch hospitals recruited patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids who were eligible for hysterectomy. Patients were 1:1 randomly assigned to uterine artery embolization or hysterectomy. The outcomes assessed at 10 years postintervention were reintervention rates, health-related quality of life, and patient satisfaction, which were obtained through validated questionnaires. Study outcomes were analyzed according to original treatment assignment (intention to treat).

Results

A total of 177 patients were randomized from 2002 through 2004. Eventually 81 uterine artery embolization and 75 hysterectomy patients underwent the allocated treatment shortly after randomization. The remaining patients withdrew from the trial. The 10-year questionnaire was mailed when the last included patient had been treated 10 years earlier. The mean duration of follow-up was 133 months (SD 8.58) accompanied by a mean age of 57 years (SD 4.53). Questionnaires were received from 131 of 156 patients (84%). Ten years after treatment, 5 patients underwent secondary hysterectomy resulting in a total of 28 of 81 (35%) (24/77 [31%] after successful uterine artery embolization). Secondary hysterectomies were performed for persisting symptoms in all cases but 1 (for prolapse). After the initial treatment health-related quality of life improved significantly. After 10 years, generic health-related quality of life remained stable, without differences between both groups. The urogenital distress inventory and the defecation distress inventory showed a decrease in both groups, probably related to increasing age, without significant differences between study arms. Satisfaction in both groups remained comparable. The majority of patients declared being (very) satisfied about the received treatment: 78% of the uterine artery embolization group vs 87% in the hysterectomy group.

Conclusion

In about two thirds of uterine artery embolization-treated patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids a hysterectomy can be avoided. Health-related quality of life 10 years after uterine artery embolization or hysterectomy remained comparably stable. Uterine artery embolization is a well-documented and less invasive alternative to hysterectomy for symptomatic uterine fibroids on which eligible patients should be counseled.

### Development of a core minimum data set to advance real-world evidence generation for uterine fibroids treatment technologies [^114uZPjf]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Uterine fibroids (also known as leiomyoma) are growths that develop in the uterus. These benign growths can vary in size, number, and symptomatology. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, between 20% and 80% of women develop fibroids by age 50. In addition to existing pharmaceutical treatments, there are several interventions that are used to treat fibroids or their symptoms, including hysterectomy, myomectomy, radiofrequency ablation, uterine artery embolization, endometrial ablation, and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound. Treatment decisions consider many factors, including experienced symptoms, size and location of the fibroids, patient's age, patient preferences regarding uterine sparing procedures, and the provider's clinical expertise and experience. Treatment decisions also consider the risk of an occult uterine sarcoma in a woman undergoing surgical intervention for presumed fibroids.

Despite the large burden of disease, evidence on the relative safety and effectiveness of available uterine fibroid interventions remains sparse. Given the paucity of comparative studies, there is a clear need for the systematic collection of post-market real-world data for women undergoing treatments using medical devices, with careful consideration of which patient characteristics, procedural data, and health outcomes are most important to capture from a clinical perspective. Pre-market studies for uterine fibroid treatment technologies include a relatively small number of patients compared with the large number of women affected by fibroids. Systematic post-marketing collection of data provides an opportunity to understand device performance in the broader use population and to identify potentially rare but serious complications, such as undiagnosed leiomyosarcoma. Additionally, because many women affected by fibroids have an interest in maintaining their fertility, systematic methods for capturing reproductive outcomes data in future pregnancies may be possible with large numbers of subjects providing post-market data.

To enable this type of post-market surveillance, we identified the need to create a Coordinated Registry Network (CRN)that would be capable of generating real-world data to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of technologies used for uterine fibroids. Foreseeing the potential evolution of technologies used to treat uterine fibroids, stakeholders acknowledged the importance of creating a core minimum data set that would be applicable to multiple technologies for uterine fibroids, including new devices that enter the market in the future. As a first task within this CRN, we used the Delphi method to reach consensus on a core minimum data set for the study of current and future devices and surgical interventions for uterine fibroids.

### Nationwide analysis of surgical and interventional uterine fibroid treatments over the past decades in Germany [^115KmeDE]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

The slight increase observed in all three treatments in 2023 is most likely a catch-up effect after the end of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and probably not a reversal of the observed long-term trend.

The massive underutilization of UAE, although being a proven cost-effective minimally invasive therapy with similar results to HE and ME, has been described in other countries as well. The 2020 online article on Internationalnews.com about the unequal distribution of UAE and HE reported that on average 2000 UAE are being performed in France per year, while 40,000 patients are being treated by uterine surgeries annually. Even worse, in Spain, only 125–150 UAE per year are in opposition to 50,000 HE. Furthermore, non-European countries show the same trend: in Australia 145 annual UAE are pitted against 30,332 uterine surgeries and El Salvador only had one hospital in 2020 that offered UAE and only 6 UAE are performed on average per year. De Bruijn et al. investigated the development of numbers of UAE after the Dutch national guideline on treatment of uterine fibroids was adjusted to specifically include UAE in 2013. There was no increase in numbers after the explicit inclusion of UAE in the guidelines. Furthermore, the paper analyzed the recommendation preferences of the gynecologists in all Dutch hospitals and was able to show a grave misconception of risks and effectiveness of UAE. Of all gynecologists in the 69% non-UAE performing hospitals 87% confirmed the false statement, that "after successful UAE, there is a 50% chance of secondary hysterectomy". If one believes this to be true, it is not surprising that UAE is not being recommended to patients. Frighteningly, at the same time 53% of these gynecologists believe to have sufficient knowledge whereas the rest (47%) claims that there is not enough information available. Furthermore, 54% do not want interventional radiologists to be routinely involved in the counseling process of their patients.

### Diagnosis and classification of uterine fibroids [^116mbmTn]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids, or leiomyomas, are benign uterine tumors with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 75%. While only a minority become symptomatic, their impact on quality of life remains profound owing to heavy menstrual bleeding, bulk symptoms, and reproductive dysfunction. Interestingly, fibroids are not reliably diagnosed on physical examination, nor can their impact be predicted through palpation. Consequently, the diagnosis and phenotypic categorization of uterine fibroids relies primarily on imaging to guide subsequent clinical management. Ultrasound should be the first-line diagnostic modality, and magnetic resonance imaging should be reserved for complex cases and/or surgical planning. Adherence to standardized structured reporting across imaging modalities is critical to improve diagnostic accuracy, differentiate fibroids from conditions such as adenomyosis or malignancies, predict therapeutic responses, and plan surgical interventions. Imaging reports should follow the FIGO classification system for uterine fibroids, to enable a standardized description of their relationship to the endometrium, myometrium, and uterine serosa.

### Management options for uterine fibroid tumors… [^112gBZow]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

2 Size and location of the tumor are important factors to consider when choosing a treatment. Submucosal fibroid tumors have a higher likelihood of necrosing and passing into the uterine cavity, which requires further surgical intervention, thus defeating the purpose of embolization. Fibroids larger than the equivalent of 20 weeks' gestational age, adenomyosis, and pedunculated subserosal fibroid tumors confer a higher chance of treatment failure and, if symptomatic, are best treated with other surgical options. 3 Localizing submucosal fibroid tumors is best accomplished with magnetic resonance imaging; however, sonohysterography is more cost-effective. Fibroid tumors can then be classified as type 1, 2, or 3, depending on the extent of intracavitary involvement. This classification is useful in counseling about the likelihood of successful hysteroscopic resection.

Patients with type 2 or 3 tumors are more likely to have incomplete resection or require a staged removal. If this risk is unacceptable to the patient, she may choose another treatment option. Definitive surgery with hysterectomy improves most patients' symptoms with minimal effects on sexual function. Although supracervical hysterectomy has been suggested as a preferred option to total hysterectomy, removal of the cervix has been advocated because of purported benefits to sexual function, fewer operative complications, lower risk of future prolapse, and lower rates of postoperative morbidity and urinary dysfunction. However, a recent large randomized trial comparing the two types of hysterectomies did not show any benefit with either procedure in regards to these outcomes. 4 Although limited conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study, it remains an ongoing debate whether to remove the cervix in hysterectomies for benign disease.

Options for hysterectomy include vaginal, abdominal, laparoscopy-assisted vaginal, laparoscopy-assisted supracervical, and complete laparoscopic hysterectomy. The approach recommended depends on many factors, such as size, concurrent ovarian pathology, prior surgeries, descent of uterus, and, most importantly, the expertise of the surgeon. Studies comparing all three approaches suggest that the safest and most cost-effective approach is vaginal hysterectomy.

### Is hysterectomy obsolete? [^115S6Hx5]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

The first premise to be questioned is whether an asymptomatic woman with leiomyomata should undergo a hysterectomy under any circumstance. Leiomyomata are common tumors in which malignancy is rare. Although generations of gynecologists have been taught the "gospel" that a uterine size greater than that of a 12-week pregnancy requires intervention, there appears to be no scientific basis for this recommendation. The tenet "no symptoms, no surgery" is coming into ascendancy, and adherence to it should help reduce the number of hysterectomies performed on healthy women. Leiomyomata can produce symptoms, however, and symptomatic women deserve to be offered treatment options. The question then arises, should hysterectomy be one of these options. The answer depends on how the physician and the patient view alternatives to hysterectomy. In this issue of American Family Physician, Dr.

Steven Janney Smith reviews uterine fibroid embolization, one of the more recently introduced alternatives to hysterectomy.

1. For many years, patients with hypervascular tumors in various parts of the body have been treated with arterial embolization when surgery was not practical or desired. The safety and efficacy of this procedure in treating many types of tumors and arteriovenous malformations have been amply demonstrated, with misembolization being the most significant adverse outcome. Because of the larger caliber of the uterine fibroid tumor vessels and the size of the particles injected during UFE, misembolization has been a highly unusual consequence of this procedure. As safe and effective as it appears to be, UFE is only one of the alternatives to hysterectomy for women with symptomatic leiomyomata.

Oral contraceptives or progestin-only regimens can be an effective option for control of abnormal uterine bleeding associated with leiomyomata uteri, despite the fable that women with uterine fibroids cannot take hormones. With the wide array of effective and less morbid alternatives to hysterectomy, should the latter procedure continue to be offered to women with symptomatic leiomyomata. At present, the answer is yes, in part because even the most progressive gynecologists do not feel right withholding a time-honored and clearly effective choice from their patients.
