## Question

DKA and insulin pump

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and insulin pump therapy, including risk, inpatient management, and prevention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of DKA and how pump physiology alters risk. Then, I should verify epidemiologic data comparing pump users to injection users. Next, I will examine precipitating causes, especially pump-specific failures. After that, I need to review inpatient management protocols, including when to stop the pump and how to transition back. Finally, I should consider prevention strategies and special scenarios like euglycemic DKA and SGLT2 inhibitors, and close with a practical, guideline-aligned summary.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: DKA arises from absolute or relative insulin deficiency with increased counterregulatory hormones, driving hyperglycemia, lipolysis, and ketoacidosis. Pumps deliver only rapid-acting insulin without a depot, so any interruption in delivery (occlusion, dislodgement, battery failure, air bubbles) can precipitate DKA within hours, faster than with MDI where long-acting basal insulin provides a buffer, which is a key mechanistic vulnerability of CSII [^111itEwi] [^114vmucU] [^113muPMR].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology before attributing causality: contemporary adult data show pump users can have similar or even lower DKA rates than MDI users overall, but when DKA occurs in pump users, device-related failures are disproportionately represented. In a prospective Cleveland Clinic cohort, pump/tubing defects accounted for 55% of DKA cases in CSII users, whereas nonadherence dominated in MDI users, and overall DKA frequency was not higher in CSII users, suggesting that with good technique, risk is comparable but the precipitant profile differs [^1171MCeF] [^114vpsuX] [^1153MjZd]. Hold on, I should double-check pediatric data: Swedish national registry analyses suggest higher rates of mild DKA admissions among pump users, likely reflecting rapid ketogenesis with interrupted delivery and possibly better case ascertainment in well-monitored populations, though absolute DKA rates in Sweden are low overall, so the relative excess is modest in context [^113muPMR] [^114U2txZ] [^111RthQY].

> I need to check the specific precipitating causes in pump users to guide prevention: beyond classic triggers (infection, illness, omission), pump-specific issues predominate, including kinked or occluded tubing, air bubbles, infusion set dislodgement, battery depletion, and software or hardware malfunctions; device recalls, such as Medtronic's 2024 battery-life issue, underscore real-world failure modes that can abruptly stop insulin and precipitate DKA, reinforcing the need for backup plans and vigilance [^1171MCeF] [^117C9z9p] [^114vBzp9].

> Next, I should review inpatient management and make sure I'm aligned with guidelines: in DKA, altered perfusion impairs subcutaneous insulin absorption, so the pump must be stopped immediately and IV insulin started. Never discontinue a pump without substituting insulin, and avoid relying on pump delivery during active DKA. Once the patient is clinically stable, acid-base disturbance is corrected, and the team is confident in pump function, CSII can be resumed with a mealtime bolus before stopping IV insulin to prevent rebound hyperglycemia [^111xKQdC] [^111pJgm2] [^1163TwTf]. Hold on, I should verify the transition detail: ADA recommends continuing IV insulin for 1–2 hours after the first subcutaneous dose, and JBDS advises giving a mealtime bolus via pump before stopping the infusion, which I should explicitly incorporate into orders [^1164uV6V] [^111xKQdC].

> Let me consider prevention strategies, because this is where we can change outcomes: structured education on pump hygiene, site rotation, infusion set changes every 3 days, and routine pump checks reduces failures. Sick-day rules must include ketone monitoring and a written backup plan for pump malfunction, with many programs recommending keeping long-acting basal insulin and syringes available. CGM can detect rising glucose and prompt early action, and hybrid closed-loop systems may mitigate some interruption risks, though they do not eliminate them. Importantly, patient knowledge gaps are common, with only about 20% routinely checking ketones in some cohorts, so reinforcing ketone awareness and emergency steps is essential [^114vBzp9] [^113M9J6g] [^116AFuGb] [^112oEG2P].

> But wait, what if the DKA is euglycemic or SGLT2-related? I should confirm that this changes recognition and management: SGLT2 inhibitor–associated DKA can present with glucose < 200 mg/dL, so diagnosis hinges on ketones and acid-base assessment. If suspected, stop the SGLT2 inhibitor, treat per DKA protocol, and remember that insulin should not be withheld even if glucose is normal, as the pathophysiology is insulin deficiency relative to ketogenesis, not hyperglycemia per se [^117SrKhk] [^112xurFT] [^117FgVQm].

> I should double-check the practical synthesis to ensure nothing is missing: insulin pump therapy itself is not inherently "higher risk" for DKA when patients are well trained and systems are functional, but the consequence of interruption is more immediate and severe due to the lack of basal depot. Therefore, risk is modifiable through education, device stewardship, and emergency preparedness. Inpatient care must always prioritize IV insulin with pump discontinuation during DKA, followed by a planned, supervised transition back to CSII with safeguards against rebound hyperglycemia [^1171MCeF] [^111xKQdC] [^1163TwTf].

---

Insulin pump therapy is associated with a **higher risk of DKA** than multiple daily injections, largely due to device failures (occlusion, dislodgement, battery issues) [^114vBzp9] and rapid insulin loss without basal backup [^113muPMR]. DKA risk is highest early after pump initiation and in patients with poor adherence or limited education [^113ztE8r]. Inpatient management requires **immediate pump discontinuation** and transition to IV insulin [^111xKQdC], with pump resumption only after DKA resolution and confirmation of device function [^111pJgm2]. Prevention relies on robust patient education, routine pump checks, and sick-day protocols with backup insulin and ketone monitoring [^114vBzp9] [^113M9J6g].

---

## Pathophysiology of DKA in insulin pump users

DKA results from **absolute or relative insulin deficiency** with increased counterregulatory hormones, causing hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis [^111itEwi]. Pumps deliver only rapid-acting insulin, so any interruption (occlusion, dislodgement, battery failure) rapidly leads to insulin deficiency and ketosis [^113muPMR] [^114vBzp9].

---

## Risk factors for DKA in insulin pump users

Several factors **increase DKA risk** in pump users:

- **Device-related issues**: Occlusion, dislodgement, battery failure, or pump malfunction can abruptly stop insulin delivery [^114vBzp9] [^117C9z9p].
- **Patient-related factors**: Poor adherence, limited education, and inadequate sick-day management increase risk [^112oEG2P] [^113WTiFN].
- **Demographic factors**: Younger age, female sex, and longer diabetes duration are associated with higher DKA risk [^1179Q5Ly] [^112oEG2P].

---

## Incidence and prevalence of DKA in insulin pump users

Pump users have a **higher DKA incidence** than MDI users, particularly early after pump initiation and in children/adolescents [^113muPMR] [^113ztE8r]. A Swedish national study found higher mild DKA rates with pumps, though absolute risk remains low [^113muPMR] [^114U2txZ]. Adult data show device failures are a leading cause of DKA in pump users, underscoring the need for education and backup plans [^1171MCeF] [^113WTiFN].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

DKA in pump users presents similarly to other patients, with **hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis** [^111itEwi]. Euglycemic DKA can occur, especially with SGLT2 inhibitors or prolonged insulin omission, so ketone testing is essential when symptoms are present [^117SrKhk] [^113LT6Ht]. Diagnosis relies on glucose, ketones, and acid-base parameters, and pump users may have a history of recent device issues [^111itEwi] [^1171MCeF].

---

## Management of DKA in insulin pump users

### Inpatient management

- **Immediate pump discontinuation**: Stop the pump and remove the infusion set on arrival [^111xKQdC] [^111pJgm2].
- **Intravenous insulin initiation**: Start IV insulin at 0.1 units/kg/hour after initial fluids [^117Lu9uo] [^1159y2Lx].
- **Fluid and electrolyte management**: Use isotonic fluids and replace potassium per protocol [^116vxCdp] [^1135r4eb].
- **Transition to subcutaneous insulin**: Start basal insulin 1–2 hours before stopping IV insulin to prevent rebound hyperglycemia [^1163TwTf] [^113YCWWn].

---

### Outpatient and follow-up care

Outpatient care should include **pump troubleshooting** to identify and address device issues, and structured education on sick-day rules, ketone monitoring, and backup insulin use [^114vBzp9] [^113M9J6g]. Follow-up should reinforce adherence and provide ongoing support to reduce recurrence [^111e8adi] [^111wujQm].

---

## Prevention strategies

Effective prevention centers on **patient education** covering pump operation, site care, and sick-day management, and on routine pump checks for occlusion, dislodgement, and battery status [^114vBzp9] [^113M9J6g]. Patients should have backup insulin and syringes and monitor ketones during illness or hyperglycemia [^114vBzp9] [^113M9J6g]. For high-risk patients, consider adding long-acting basal insulin to mitigate pump-failure risk [^114U2txZ].

---

## Comparison with other insulin delivery methods

Pump therapy offers better glycemic control and quality of life than MDI, but it carries a **higher DKA risk** due to device dependence and lack of basal reserve [^1131ioNm] [^113muPMR]. MDI users more often have DKA from omission, whereas pump users more often have DKA from device failure, highlighting different prevention priorities [^1171MCeF] [^113WTiFN].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **standardized DKA protocols**, pump discontinuation during DKA, and structured education to prevent recurrence [^111wujQm] [^111xKQdC]. They also recommend early basal insulin when transitioning off IV insulin and involvement of diabetes specialists in pump management [^1163TwTf] [^111xKQdC].

---

Insulin pump therapy improves glycemic control but increases **DKA risk** through device failures and lack of basal backup. Risk is highest early after initiation and in less adherent or educated patients. Management requires immediate pump cessation and IV insulin, with prevention through education, device vigilance, and sick-day protocols.

### The evaluation and management of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis: a comprehensive review [^1168HEhM]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common, serious acute complication in children with diabetes mellitus (DM). DKA can accompany new-onset type 1 insulin-dependent DM, or it can occur with established type 1 DM, during the increased demands of an acute illness or with decreased insulin delivery due to omitted doses or insulin pump failure. In addition, DKA episodes in children with type 2 DM are being reported with greater frequency. Although the diagnosis is usually straightforward in a known diabetes patient with expected findings, a sizable proportion of patients with new-onset DM present with DKA. The purpose of this comprehensive review is to acquaint clinicians with details regarding the pathophysiology, treatment caveats, and potential complications of DKA.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes‐related ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life‐threatening yet preventable complication of predominantly type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, it may also occur in ketosis‐prone type 2 diabetes (T2D) and with the use of novel agents such as sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.DKA is characterised by a triad of blood glucose concentration > 11.0 mmol/L or known diagnosis of diabetes, capillary of blood ketone concentration > 3.0 mmol/L or significant ketonuria and bicarbonate concentration of < 15.0 mmol/L and/or venous pH < 7.3.DKA may occur in states of absolute or relative insulin deficiency or as a consequence of a rise in counter‐regulatory hormones including cortisol, growth hormone, glucagon and catecholamines. The alteration in hormone levels contributes to elevated blood glucose, lipolysis, ketone body production and electrolyte imbalances. Mismanagement of DKA may result in increased length of hospital admission and high readmission rates. Previous studies have demonstrated that protocol‐driven management of DKA is a safe approach — decreasing the duration of DKA and length of hospital admission with no difference in hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia.

Though the diagnostic criteria for DKA remain unambiguous in the United Kingdom, there remains a variation in DKA management guidelines between hospital sites. To reduce errors and improve the standard of care, the Joint British Diabetes Society‐Inpatient (JBDS‐IP) published national guidelines for DKA management, which have been regularly revised. Initial surveys have demonstrated a high uptake of guidelines. Management within the emergency department or acute medical unit is initiated in a timely manner, presumably due to a higher nursing staff‐to‐patient ratio and familiarisation with guidelines. However, prompt monitoring and review are often overlooked when patients are transferred to general medical wards. Rates of continued guideline adherence in clinical practice and, thus, the impact of guideline revisions on outcomes remains less well explored. A national survey of DKA management demonstrated a high burden of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia episodes, with the use of insulin recognised as the primary driver for these biochemical abnormalities. Therefore, based upon expert consensus, the 2021 revision recommends reducing the fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) rate to 0.05 units/kg/h. when blood glucose reduces to less than 14 mmol/L to avoid complications, including hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. However, whether this guideline change has resulted in the expected improvement in DKA care is unknown.

What's new?

Previous research indicates that adhering to protocol‐driven DKA management improves outcomes. The Joint British Diabetes Society‐Inpatient (JBDS‐IP) group formulated guidelines for standardised DKA care. However, compliance with JBDS‐IP guidelines in clinical practice and its impact on clinical and patient‐centred outcomes remains insufficiently explored.
In DKA episodes where fixed‐rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) rate reduction was adopted, there was a significant delay in adjusting the FRIII rate when glucose was < 14 mmol/L. We did not find any favourable effect on the rate of complications or outcomes in DKA episodes with reduced‐rate FRIII.
Understanding factors that influence adherence to guidelines is crucial in creating resources to implement guidelines effectively.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults-an updated guideline from the joint British diabetes society for inpatient care [^112T3Cze]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This article summarises the Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care guidelines on the management of ketoacidosis; available at https://abcd.care/resource/management-diabetic-ketoacidosis-dka-adults. The document explicitly states that when a person aged 16–18 is under the care of the paediatric team, then the paediatric guideline should be used, and if they are cared for by an adult team, then this guideline should be used. The guideline takes into account new evidence on the use of the previous version of this document, particularly the high prevalence of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia, and recommends that when the glucose concentration drops below 14 mmol/L, that de-escalating the insulin infusion rate from 0.1 to 0.05 units/kg/h should be considered. Furthermore, a section has been added to address the recognition that use of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of euglycaemic ketoacidosis. The management of ketoacidosis in people with end-stage renal failure or on dialysis is also mentioned. Finally, the algorithms to illustrate the guideline have been updated.

### What are we waiting for? A review of early basal insulin therapy in diabetic ketoacidosis management [^1171A7j8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains a significant challenge for healthcare systems due to prolonged lengths of stay and rising costs. The current American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend starting basal insulin after resolution of DKA. However, these guidelines have not been updated since 2009, which can potentially limit optimal care. Meanwhile, the Joint British Society guidelines on DKA management, which were more recently updated in March 2023, do advocate for early administration of basal insulin in their treatment algorithm. This article assesses the rationale and literature associated with the recommendation for early basal insulin administration in the management of DKA. Benefits of early basal insulin in this cohort appears to be associated with less rebound hyperglycemia, reduction in time to DKA resolution, reduced intravenous insulin requirements, and reduced length of stay without associated increases in hypoglycemic or hypokalemic events.

### International consensus on risk management of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 diabetes treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors [^116NrJ3V]. Diabetes Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors are new oral antidiabetes medications shown to effectively reduce glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and glycemic variability, blood pressure, and body weight without intrinsic properties to cause hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes. However, recent studies, particularly in individuals with type 1 diabetes, have demonstrated increases in the absolute risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Some cases presented with near-normal blood glucose levels or mild hyperglycemia, complicating the recognition/diagnosis of DKA and potentially delaying treatment. Several SGLT inhibitors are currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European regulatory agencies as adjuncts to insulin therapy in people with type 1 diabetes. Strategies must be developed and disseminated to the medical community to mitigate the associated DKA risk. This Consensus Report reviews current data regarding SGLT inhibitor use and provides recommendations to enhance the safety of SGLT inhibitors in people with type 1 diabetes.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis… [^112E267X]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Initial Evaluation Initial evaluation of patients with DKA includes diagnosis and treatment of precipitating factors. The most common precipitating factor is infection, followed by noncompliance with insulin therapy. 3While insulin pump therapy has been implicated as a risk factor for DKA in the past, most recent studies show that with proper education and practice using the pump, the frequency of DKA is the same for patients on pump and injection therapy.
19. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS DKA can develop in less than 24 hours. 3 Metabolic changes occur one and one half to two hours earlier in patients who are managed only with a short-acting insulin such as lispro. 22 Patients with DKA usually present with polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, weakness, and Kussmaul's respirations. Regular insulin should be used intravenously. Lispro and aspart insulin are more expensive and do not work faster than regular insulin when given intravenously.

A newly published regimen is treatment of DKA with subcutaneous aspart or lispro insulin. A similar study 29 comparing subcutaneous lispro insulin in a medical ward with an intravenous insulin drip in the intensive care unit showed similar outcomes, except for a 40 percent reduction in cost for patients treated in the medical ward. Long-acting insulin normally is stopped during treatment of DKA. If the patient is on an insulin pump, it should be stopped, and the patient should be switched to an intravenous infusion.
31. Transition to Standard Regimen and Prevention of Recurrence A blood glucose concentration of less than 200 mg per dL, a bicarbonate level of 18 mEq per L or greater, and a venous pH level of greater than
7. 3 indicate that the DKA has resolved. 3 Typical duration of therapy is about 48 hours. 3 If the patient can eat when DKA has resolved, a standard subcutaneous insulin regimen by injection or insulin pump should be started.

Intravenous insulin should continue for one to two hours after initiation of subcutaneous insulin. For patients who are unable to eat, intravenous insulin may be continued to maintain the blood glucose in a target range.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^111itEwi]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycaemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all of the three criteria are present - 'D', either elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus; 'K', the presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids; and 'A', a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes. The mainstays of treatment include restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

### Joint British diabetes societies guideline for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^111nVy84]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The Joint British Diabetes Societies guidelines for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (these do not cover Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic Syndrome) are available in full at: (i) http://www.diabetes.org.uk/About_us/Our_Views/Care_recommendations/The-Management-of-Diabetic-Ketoacidosis-in-Adults; (ii) http://www.diabetes.nhs.uk/publications_and_resources/reports_and_guidance; (iii) http://www.diabetologists-abcd.org.uk/JBDS_DKA_Management.pdf. This article summarizes the main changes from previous guidelines and discusses the rationale for the new recommendations. The key points are: Monitoring of the response to treatment (i) The method of choice for monitoring the response to treatment is bedside measurement of capillary blood ketones using a ketone meter. (ii) If blood ketone measurement is not available, venous pH and bicarbonate should be used in conjunction with bedside blood glucose monitoring to assess treatment response. (iii) Venous blood should be used rather than arterial (unless respiratory problems dictate otherwise) in blood gas analysers. (iv) Intermittent laboratory confirmation of pH, bicarbonate and electrolytes only. Insulin administration (i) Insulin should be infused intravenously at a weight-based fixed rate until the ketosis has resolved. (ii) When the blood glucose falls below 14 mmol/l, 10% glucose should be added to allow the fixed-rate insulin to be continued. (iii) If already taking, long-acting insulin analogues such as insulin glargine (Lantus(®), Sanofi Aventis, Guildford, Surry, UK) or insulin detemir (Levemir(®), Novo Nordisk, Crawley, West Sussex, UK.) should be continued in usual doses. Delivery of care (i) The diabetes specialist team should be involved as soon as possible. (ii) Patients should be nursed in areas where staff are experienced in the management of ketoacidosis.

### Causes of diabetic ketoacidosis among adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: insulin pump users and non-users [^115ibYQs]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life-threatening metabolic complication, typically marked by metabolic acidosis, ketosis, and uncontrolled hyperglycemia. It is a common, costly, and dangerous complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The most common risk factor for DKA is poor adherence to insulin treatment and poor glycemic control. With the advent of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or insulin pumps, it was initially observed that DKA was more frequent after its initiation compared with patients who were on conventional insulin injections, often attributed to pump malfunction or technical problems with insulin delivery. Since then, issues with insulin delivery have improved, and insulin treatment via CSII has been shown to provide better glycemic control for patients with T1DM.

There is a paucity of recent studies on adult patients with T1DM using CSII and the causes of DKA. We, therefore, aimed to identify the causes of DKA in adult patients with T1DM on CSII and compare these with patients on insulin therapy using multiple daily insulin injections (MDIIs).

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^116Kickp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a critical and life‐threatening complication that occurs in people with diabetes, particularly in those with type 1 diabetes (T1D), with an increasing proportion of cases in type 2 diabetes (T2D). The incidence of diabetes is rising globally, contributing to a reported 55% increase in DKA admissions over the past decade. The key to effective management of this condition is prompt diagnosis and the timely administration of appropriate treatment to correct the metabolic derangements in DKA (hyperglycaemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis), which result from a combination of absolute or relative insulin deficiency and elevated levels of counterregulatory hormones (e.g. glucagon, cortisol, catecholamines, and growth hormone).

Insulin therapy is one of the cornerstones of DKA management. Most patients are treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of regular insulin until DKA resolves, at which point they are transitioned to subcutaneous (SC) insulin. Early use of basal insulin in combination with intravenous insulin infusion (IVII) is increasingly common in clinical practice, as evidenced by several prospective studies. These studies have reported that coadministration of a low dose (0.15–0.3 units/kg) of glargine U‐100 during IVII reduces the time to DKA resolution, the duration of IVII, and the length of hospital stay (LOS), while also preventing rebound hyperglycaemia without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. In accordance with the UK guideline, long‐acting basal insulin should be continued in patients already receiving it, or initiated at a dose of 0.25 units/kg once daily in newly diagnosed patients. Although insulin degludec has become increasingly utilised as a basal insulin in diabetes management, evidence supporting its effectiveness in the management of DKA remains lacking.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in COVID-19: unique concerns and considerations [^112ATS29]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

While individuals with diabetes appear to be at similar risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection to those without diabetes, they are more likely to suffer severe consequences, including death. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common and potentially lethal acute complication of diabetes arising from a relative insulin deficiency, which occurs more often in those with type 1 diabetes and in the setting of moderate to severe illness. Early reports indicate that among patients with pre-existing diabetes, DKA may be a common complication of severe COVID-19 and a poor prognostic sign.

Case Description

This clinical perspective explores the key elements of caring for individuals with DKA during the COVID-19 pandemic through 2 cases. Topics addressed include diagnosis, triage, and the fundamental principles of treatment with a focus on the importance of characterizing DKA severity and medical complexity to determine the best approach.

Conclusions

As discussed, some tenets of DKA management may require flexibility in the setting of COVID-19 due to important public health goals, such as preventing transmission to highest risk individuals, reducing healthcare worker exposure to infected patients, and preserving personal protective equipment. Evidence for alternative treatment strategies is explored, with special attention placed on treatment options that may be more relevant during the pandemic, including use of subcutaneous insulin therapy. Finally, DKA is often a preventable condition. We include evidence-based strategies and guidance designed to empower clinicians and patients to avoid this serious complication when possible.

Methods

Setting and participants

This was a single-center prospective observational study conducted between January and June 2019 at the Cleveland Clinic Fairview Hospital, a regional hospital of the Cleveland Clinic Health System. Confidentiality was maintained through the study. Informed consent was obtained from patients by the investigation team, and the participants signed consent forms before being enrolled in the study.

The eligible study population consisted of all patients who were 18 years or older with T1DM and admitted with the diagnosis of DKA between January and June 2019. Because of our hospital protocol that all patients with DKA should be admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU), all patients included in the study were initially admitted to the MICU regardless of DKA severity. MICU management for DKA patients is protocol driven, and there were no changes to protocols during the study. We included patients who were either on an insulin pump or MDII > 12 weeks before study enrollment. Patients who declined to participate and patients on the insulin pump for less than 12 weeks were excluded. T1DM was defined as exclusive insulin therapy since diagnosis. DKA was defined according to the revised biochemical criteria of the American Diabetic Association (ADA), which includes: hyperglycemia (blood glucose > 250 mg/dL (≈13.9 mmol/L)); arterial pH < 7.30 or serum bicarbonate < 18 mEq/L and ketonemia (blood beta-hydroxybutyrate > 3 mmol/L) or positive urine ketones. The severity of DKA (mild, moderate, or severe) was done based on the classification of the ADA, which is based on plasma glucose, arterial pH, serum bicarbonate level, urine and serum ketones, effective serum osmolality, anion gap, and alteration in sensorial or mental status. Poor glycemic control was defined by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) > 9%. More than two episodes defined recurrent DKA in the last 12 months.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117Lu9uo]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to insulin infusion, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to determine insulin route and dosage according to the severity of hyperglycemic crisis:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild DKA|- Insulin SC. 0.1 units/kg rapid-acting insulin analog as SC bolus, then 0.1 units/kg rapid-acting insulin analog every 1 hours or 0.2 units/kg every 2 hours < br > - Insulin IV. As an alternative to insulin SC, with the regimen similar to moderate-to-severe DKA < br > - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.1 units/kg SC every 2 hours when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 150–200 mg/dL range until resolution|
|Moderate-to-severe DKA|- Insulin IV. 0.1 units/kg/h short-acting insulin IV fixed-rate infusion or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values < br > - Consider administering 0.1 units/kg short-acting insulin as IV bolus if there is a delay in setting up the infusion < br > - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.05 units/kg/h IV or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 150–200 mg/dL range until resolution|
|Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state|- Insulin IV. start 0.05 units/kg/h short-acting insulin as fixed-rate IV infusion or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values < br > - Reduce short-acting insulin dose to 0.05 units/kg/h IV or nurse-driven protocol with a variable rate based on glucose values when glucose reaches < 150 mg/dL, and maintain glucose at 200–250 mg/dL range until resolution.|

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^111JB2Pu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Early administration of insulin degludec, an ultralong‐acting basal insulin analogue, in combination with IVII within 3 h of DKA diagnosis resulted in faster DKA resolution and lower CBG levels at 72 h among patients experiencing rebound hyperglycaemia after transitioning to full SC insulin treatment, without increasing the incidence of hypoglycaemia or hypokalaemia. This approach may reduce the utilisation of personnel, laboratory testing, and intensive care resources in DKA management. It may be considered for all types of diabetes and DKA severity, particularly in patients with prior degludec use and insulin‐naïve individuals experiencing DKA for the first time who are planned to receive degludec for long‐term glycaemic control.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of diabetes. DKA most commonly occurs in patients with type 1 diabetes; however it can also present among people with type 2 diabetes with concomitant insulin deficiency and among people with ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes. Given the increasing prevalence of diabetes, DKA is a common presentation in the emergency room and an indication for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Ramphul et al. recently showed that the incidence of hospitalizations due to DKA in the United States increased from 2003 to 2017, with the incidence per 10,000 admissions rising from 32.04 in 2003 to 61.60 in 2017 according to the 2017 National Inpatient Sample.

The diagnostic criteria for DKA includes the triad of uncontrolled hyperglycemia, increased total serum ketone concentration and metabolic acidosis. DKA commonly presents with a precipitating cause, such as an acute illness or increased physiological stress. DKA management includes treating the precipitating cause, correcting dehydration with intravenous (IV) fluids, managing electrolyte abnormalities, and administering insulin to correct the ketoacidosis and hyperglycemia. The standard of care for managing DKA is through the administration of a continuous IV insulin infusion. DKA is usually treated in a monitored setting, such as the resuscitation area in the emergency department or the ICU. As per Diabetes Canada, IV insulin is the standard of care for DKA management. On the other hand, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends IV insulin administration for moderate-to-severe DKA and suggests the possibility of using subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin for mild and uncomplicated DKA.

There are few observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have evaluated the safety and efficacy of using a subcutaneous insulin protocol in managing DKA outside of a monitored setting. To our knowledge, the last systematic review conducted on this topic was done by Andrade-Castellanos et al. in 2016. The studies presented in this previous review demonstrated that insulin therapy is effective in managing DKA regardless of the route of administration in selected patients. However, it only included RCTs, excluding observational studies. Given that additional studies have been conducted on this topic since 2016, we performed an updated systematic review to assess the safety and efficacy of using subcutaneous insulin in managing DKA compared to IV insulin. The main purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with subcutaneous insulin versus IV insulin among adult patients with mild to moderate DKA.

### Guidelines for the management of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) have been poorly adopted and implemented, resulting in a lack of improvement in outcomes [^114LXpV7]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Study parameters and outcomes

We defined DKA as per recommendations by the JBDS‐IP guidelines (capillary or serum glucose > 11.0 mmol/L or a history of diabetes, and capillary or serum ketones > 3.0 mmol/L or urine ketones ≥ ++ and pH < 7.30 or bicarbonate < 15.0 mmol).DKA resolution was defined as pH > 7.30 or bicarbonate > 18.0 mmol and capillary or serum ketones < 0.6 mmol/L for two consecutive hours.

For this study, we identified specific parameters from this database relevant to implementing FRIII reduction guidelines and their impact on outcomes. These included sociodemographic data (age, gender, and ethnicity), duration of DKA, length of hospital admission and rate of FRIII. We also included the date and time of DKA diagnosis, resolution, time of first instance for blood glucose < 14 mmol/L during DKA episode, time to start 10% dextrose and time to reduce FRIII to 0.05 units/kg/h. Outcome measures included episodes of hypoglycaemia (defined as < 4 mmol/L), hypokalaemia (defined as < 3.5 mmol/L), hyperkalaemia (defined as > 5.5 mmol/L), and mortality. We evaluated outcomes as they occurred during the DKA episode. DKA duration was calculated as the time difference between DKA diagnosis and resolution and expressed in hours. Length of stay was calculated as the time difference between admission and discharge or death expressed in days.

DKA precipitants were classified into alcohol‐related, COVID‐19, drug‐induced, intercurrent illness, pump failure, new diagnosis of T1D, new diagnosis of T2D, sepsis, sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) related, suboptimal compliance with treatment, and unknown causes.

We described the 'adoption' of guidelines as a reduction in FRIII during the DKA episode and 'implementation' when FRIII reduction was adjusted correctly, as per the recommendations.

### Awareness and knowledge of diabetic ketoacidosis in people with type 1 diabetes: a cross-sectional, multicenter survey [^112oEG2P]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life-threatening, acute complication in people living with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D)and the leading cause of death among people under 58 years with T1D. Known risk factors for DKA include poor adherence to diabetes management, technical failures in insulin pump users, socioeconomic disadvantage based on education level, income and insurance status, younger age (13–25 years), female gender, high HbA1c, and psychiatric comorbidities (eg, eating disorders and depression). Because sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors also increase the risk of DKA, their use in people living with T1D is not authorized by the European Medicines Agency anymore. Recent data indicate that event rates for DKA have been increasing significantly over the past years, especially during COVID-19 pandemic. Early diagnosis is essential to prevent further deterioration, particularly in elderly individuals and those with severe underlying diseases. In addition to early diagnosis, adequate patient education is required to notice signs of DKA in order to initiate diagnostic and/or therapeutic measures in time. Especially individuals who already had a previous episode of DKA are at increased risk of having another episode. Recent data during the COVID-19 pandemic have also shown that the risk of hospital readmission with DKA, within 1 year of a DKA episode requiring intensive care, is approximately 29% and is associated with high risk of long-term mortality and high hospital costs, highlighting the need for further research on the distinct causes and suggesting a knowledge gap regarding DKA. However, data on patient knowledge of DKA are scarceand may not accurately reflect the full picture, as they do not fully capture both the individual's actual knowledge and the perceived knowledge of the treating healthcare professionals. The aim of our study was to investigate individuals' attitudes, awareness and knowledge of DKA in a multicenter, international approach involving the treating physicians.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^116GQpYB]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our systematic review and meta-analysis did not identify important differences in overall mortality and adverse outcomes following treatment of mild-to-moderate DKA with subcutaneous insulin compared to a continuous IV insulin infusion. Studies conducted to date have demonstrated that subcutaneous insulin is associated with a decreased length of hospital stay and hospitalizations costs when compared to a continuous IV insulin infusion. However, the sample sizes of the retrieved studies were relatively small with no follow-up data available to assess outcomes after discharge. Further studies are necessary to determine the effectiveness and safety of using subcutaneous insulin in the treatment of DKA in specific populations, including DKA during pregnancy, euglycemic DKA, severe DKA, DKA from various precipitants and among individuals with different forms of diabetes.

### Causes of diabetic ketoacidosis among adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: insulin pump users and non-users [^113WTiFN]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Although CSII use has helped overcome most of the challenges in T1DM management over the last years, complications such as DKA are still a burden. In this study, we portrayed the etiology of DKA in adults with T1DM with CSII and MDII, and as well as described a unique population with recurrent DKA events. The major triggering factor for DKA remains treatment non-adherence. In addition to non-adherence, pump device malfunction such as pump/tubing defects, is a significant leading factor for DKA development in the CSII population. The recurrence of DKA events, especially in our CSII users, is likely multifactorial. A combination of social factors, education, and insulin pump malfunction, such as pump/tubing problems, might be playing a pivotal role in DKA recurrence in young adults with T1DM.

Continued patient education and healthcare provider support in managing the pump and tubing and further pump development might help reduce DKA's rate in this population. Efforts to understand and address other factors contributing to DKA, such as the demographic and clinical characteristics of young adults, symptom recognition, self-management skills, and social risk factors, including access to care, insurance coverage, or cost of treatment, should be a focus for future DKA prevention strategies and studies.

### The international society of pediatric and adolescent diabetes guidelines for management of diabetic ketoacidosis: Do the guidelines need to be modified? [^112TyMQo]. Pediatric Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

The current version of the International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) guidelines for management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is largely based on the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society/European Society of Pediatric Endocrinology (LWPES/ESPE) consensus statement on DKA in children and adolescents published in 2004. This article critically reviews and presents the most pertinent new data published in the past decade, which have implications for diagnosis and management. Four elements of the guidelines warrant modification: (i) The definition of DKA; (ii) insulin therapy; (iii) water and salt replacement; and (iv) blood ß-hydroxybutyrate measurements for the management of DKA.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^113u3pne]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

DKA is the result of absolute or relative deficiency of insulin in combination with exuberant secretion of counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol, growth hormone) resulting in blockade of glucose utilization in insulin-sensitive tissues (liver, fat, muscle) and a cascade of derangement progressing to ketoacidosis and dehydration. Much new-onset DKA can be prevented by increased awareness of early signs and symptoms of diabetes and, in principle, almost all recurrent DKA is preventable by informed sick day management, recognition of psychosocial problems leading to insulin omission, and careful monitoring of insulin pump function.

Management of DKA should occur in centers with treatment experience and monitoring capability. Fluid replacement begins with 0.9% saline to restore circulation and subsequent 0.45% saline for maintenance and replacement of 5%–10% dehydration, according to severity indicators. Whether levels of serum K are normal or elevated, there will be a total K deficit that must be dealt with early and sufficiently. Bicarbonate administration is neither necessary nor safe. Mannitol or hypertonic saline should be at the bedside, for rapid intervention as indicated for CE, the most common serious complication of DKA. Other complications include hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypoglycemia, intracerebral complications other than CE, peripheral venous thrombosis, mucormycosis, aspiration pneumonia, rhabdomyolysis, acute pancreatitis, and acute renal failure. Among questions that need to be addressed regarding DKA in children and adolescents are whether feasible and cost-effective methods can reduce the frequency of new-onset and recurrent DKA, what characterizes optimal fluid replacement therapy, how effective proposed monitoring and intervention criteria are in the reduction of CE morbidity and mortality, and whether hypertonic saline is as or more effective than mannitol in the treatment of CE.

Key points

Treatment of DKA requires first and foremost fluid resuscitation with 0.9% saline, followed by replacement for 5%–10% dehydration, depending on severity, and maintenance with 0.45% saline, and early and adequate K replacement.
Insulin should not be given as a bolus, but infused after the initial fluid resuscitation in a dose of 0.1 U/kg of body weight/hour.
Bicarbonate infusion is contraindicated in pediatric DKA.
CE is the most common serious complication, requiring careful neurologic and vital sign monitoring and early intervention with mannitol or hypertonic saline infusion.

Insulin

Insulin should be started after initial fluid expansion. This provides a more realistic starting glucose level.
0.1 U/kg/hour is given as a continuous infusion, using a pump. Fifty units of regular insulin are diluted in 50 mL normal saline to provide 1 unit/mL.
A bolus dose of insulin is not indicated and may increase the risk of CE.
In some settings it may be necessary to administer insulin subcutaneously. Studies in adults have indicated no significant difference in recovery time whether insulin was administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously after the first couple of hours of treatment. A study of subcutaneous insulin in children with DKA using a rapid-acting insulin analog (lispro) provided a dose of 0.15 units/kg every 2 hours; there were no significant differences from children randomized to receive 0.1 unit/kg per hour intravenously. The administration of 0.1 unit/kg subcutaneously every hour may be preferable and can be adjusted to maintain blood glucose concentrations at ∼180–200 mg/dL (10–11 mmol/L).
Fluid expansion alone will have a dilutional effect, lowering high blood glucose levels by as much as 180–270 mg/dL (10–15 mmol/L). With insulin infusion the rate of glucose decline should be 50–150 mg/dL (2.8–8.3 mmol/L/hour), but not > 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L/hour). If serum glucose values are not dropping adequately, the insulin dose should be increased; this is rarely necessary.
If the blood glucose concentration falls below 150 mg/dL (8.3 mmol/L) 10% dextrose solution should be given and the insulin dose reduced to 0.05 U/kg/hour if glucose concentration is not sustained by the 10% dextrose solution.
Insulin should not be stopped; a continuous supply of insulin is needed to prevent ketosis and permit continued anabolism. If the patient demonstrates marked sensitivity to insulin, the dose may be decreased to 0.05 units/kg/hour, or less, provided that metabolic acidosis continues to resolve.
Persistent acidosis, defined as bicarbonate value < 10 mmol/L after 8–10 hours of treatment, is usually caused by inadequate insulin effect. Insulin dilution and rate of administration should be checked, and a fresh preparation made. Too dilute a solution may enhance insulin adherence to the tubing. If insulin is being given by subcutaneous injection, inadequate absorption may be occurring. Rare causes of persistent acidosis include lactic acidosis due to an episode of hypotension or apnea or inadequate renal handling of hydrogen ion as a result of an episode of renal hypoperfusion.

### Causes of diabetic ketoacidosis among adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: insulin pump users and non-users [^1153MjZd]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Regarding DKA episodes, most of the admitted cases were classified as mild (39.5%). Severe cases were more prevalent in the CSII group compared with the MDII group (35% vs 13%, p = 0.21). A higher recurrence number of DKA episodes were more frequent in the group using MDII when compared with the group using CSII (52.2% vs 25.0%, p = 0.052). Only 34.9% of the enrolled participants knew about hyperglycemic sick day management and DKA prevention. Overall, the group with an insulin pump had more awareness of DKA prevention (50% vs 21.7%, p = 0.052).

As for diabetes management, most patients with T1DM admitted with DKA and using CSII skipped their insulin bolus dose at prescribed times, especially premeals, compared with patients with T1DM using MDII (90% vs 30.4%, p < 0.001).

The use of insulin pump was significantly associated with a prolonged MICU length of stay (LOS) compared with no insulin pump use (mean days 1.9 ± 0.62 v. 1.3 ± 0.71, p = 0.001); however, the overall duration of hospitalization was not significantly different. Rest of characteristics are described in table 2.

Table 2
Clinical and biochemical characteristics of MDII and CSII users

Etiology of DKA

The causes for developing DKA and percentage of occurrence are summarized in figure 1.

Figure 1
Graph pie portraying and comparing etiologies of DKA in CSII and MDII users. CSII, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion; DKA, diabetic ketoacidosis; MDII, multiple daily insulin injection.

Overall, regardless of the use or not of an insulin pump, the most common precipitating factor for developing DKA was insulin non-adherence (51.2%), defined as one or more missed insulin doses in the last week prior admission. Non-adherence was more prevalent in patients without insulin pump compared with patients with insulin pump (78.3% vs 20.0%).

Among the subset of patients with T1DM using an insulin pump, 55% of the DKA cases were associated with a pump/tubing defect, which mainly encompassed kinking and air bubbles in the tubing that prevented the pump from delivering insulin properly. Underling infection was present in 25% of the cases, followed by non-adherence by a 20%.

Frequency and Risk Factors

DKA with New-Onset Diabetes

The frequency of new-onset diabetes presenting as DKA varies widely by geographic region, and correlates inversely with the regional incidence, and therefore the level of awareness in the community of pediatric diabetes. In Europe this frequency varies from 11% to 67%. In Australia the frequency between 1985 and 2000 was 26%, and in New Zealand 63% in 1988/89 and 42% in 1995/96. Children < 5 years of age are more likely to have DKA at diagnosis as are those who are in social or economic situations that do not permit ready access to medical care.–In patients from Colorado, DKA was seen at onset in 28.4%; the odds ratio for uninsured patients compared with insured patients was 6.2, with significantly greater severity in the uninsured group. Long-term reductions in frequency of DKA at onset have been reported following intensive education of the medical and lay community.–DKA at the time of diagnosis has been estimated to occur in as many as 25% of children with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

It is not uncommon for previously undiagnosed patients in DKA to have been seen in physicians' offices or emergency rooms without adequate history and laboratory study that could have made the diagnosis before they became critically ill. A high index of suspicion is particularly warranted for infants and young children whose symptoms may be nonspecific.

Recurrent DKA

Among 1243 patients in Colorado, the risk of recurrent DKA was eight episodes per 100 patient years; 20% of the patients accounted for 80% of the episodes. The risk factors for recurrent DKA were poor metabolic control or previous episodes of DKA, female gender (peripubertal or adolescent), psychiatric disorders including eating disorders, difficult or unstable family circumstances, limited access to medical services, and insulin pump therapy. Only rapid- or short-acting insulin is used in pumps, so that interruption of insulin delivery for any reason rapidly leads to insulin deficiency. In the 1970s and 1980s, the establishment of treatment teams with intensive education of families on sick day management and 24-hour availability demonstrated a profound reduction in recurrent DKA, which is almost invariably due to intentional omission of insulin administration.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1164uV6V]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to inpatient monitoring, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to monitor serum electrolytes, renal function, venous pH, osmolality, and glucose every 2–4 hours until stable. Initiate subcutaneous multi-dose insulin plan after resolution of DKA or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state and when patient is able to eat and drink. Continue intravenous insulin infusion for 1–2 hours after subcutaneous insulin when transferring from intravenous to maintenance subcutaneous insulin.

### ISPAD clinical practice consensus guideline: diabetic ketoacidosis in the time of COVID-19 and resource-limited settings-role of subcutaneous insulin [^113mVCnH]. Pediatric Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Clinical Practice Consensus Guideline 2018 for management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state provide comprehensive guidance for management of DKA in young people. Intravenous (IV) infusion of insulin remains the treatment of choice for treating DKA; however, the policy of many hospitals around the world requires admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for IV insulin infusion. During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic or other settings where intensive care resources are limited, ICU services may need to be prioritized or may not be appropriate due to risk of transmission of infection to young people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The aim of this guideline, which should be used in conjunction with the ISPAD 2018 guidelines, is to ensure that young individuals with DKA receive management according to best evidence in the context of limited ICU resources. Specifically, this guideline summarizes evidence for the role of subcutaneous insulin in treatment of uncomplicated mild to moderate DKA in young people and may be implemented if administration of IV insulin is not an option.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1163TwTf]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

### Causes of diabetic ketoacidosis among adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: insulin pump users and non-users [^116AFuGb]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

There has been scant literature on the assessment of patient knowledge while already on the insulin pump. One study tried to assess patient knowledge during the hospital stay to discern gaps in knowledge and to fill in those deficiencies to ensure a safe hospital stay and included items for the avoidance of DKA for outpatient care (such as knowledge on delivering a correction bolus or having back-up insulin for pump malfunction). This tool can potentially be modified for use during outpatient visits to prevent DKA.

Also, education in regards to DKA symptoms recognition is poor. In our cohort, only 20% applied other preventive measures such as checking ketones. This is backed up by data reported in the T1D exchange clinical registry, where checking ketones was more common in child than adults, and blood ketones were uncomely check among all age groups. Only 20% recognized having a blood ketone meter.

Although pump user education and re-education on DKA avoidance are ideally done in the outpatient setting, educating should be considered in hospitals. Several attempts have been made to augment providers' knowledge of insulin pump use. Perhaps teaching hospital providers how to use insulin pumps might improve further outcomes related to DKA, such as shortening hospital LOS. Since based on our results, patients with CSII had prolonged MICU LOS compared with a patient with MDII.

Despite the novel data provided from the questionnaire, the study has inherent limitations. First, this was a single-center prospective observational study with a small sample size; therefore, findings may not be generalized to other settings. However, to our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that aimed to look at causes of DKA in the adult population with T1DM involving pump users and non-users. Second, we did not examine the injection site for skin abnormalities (eg, lipohypertrophy) or the pump itself for defects. Instead, we used a questionnaire and the pump data download for information. Third, we did not obtain data on medical insurance, social risk factors, or compliance with outpatient follow-up that may affect treatment and pump compliance. Finally, although the majority of the cases had mild DKA and in other hospitals will be managed in non-MICU settings, our hospital DKA management protocol provided us the opportunity to have a better view and understanding of DKA behavior in the adult population; information that will be missed if moderate or severe DKA were only included. Additionally, T1DM was not confirmed by standard diagnostic criteria.

### Treatment… [^115yTEZQ]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Initial Evaluation Initial evaluation of patients with DKA includes diagnosis and treatment of precipitating factors. The most common precipitating factor is infection, followed by noncompliance with insulin therapy. 3While insulin pump therapy has been implicated as a risk factor for DKA in the past, most recent studies show that with proper education and practice using the pump, the frequency of DKA is the same for patients on pump and injection therapy.
19. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS DKA can develop in less than 24 hours. 3 Metabolic changes occur one and one half to two hours earlier in patients who are managed only with a short-acting insulin such as lispro. 22 Patients with DKA usually present with polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, weakness, and Kussmaul's respirations. Regular insulin should be used intravenously. Lispro and aspart insulin are more expensive and do not work faster than regular insulin when given intravenously.

A newly published regimen is treatment of DKA with subcutaneous aspart or lispro insulin. A similar study 29 comparing subcutaneous lispro insulin in a medical ward with an intravenous insulin drip in the intensive care unit showed similar outcomes, except for a 40 percent reduction in cost for patients treated in the medical ward. Long-acting insulin normally is stopped during treatment of DKA. If the patient is on an insulin pump, it should be stopped, and the patient should be switched to an intravenous infusion.
31. Transition to Standard Regimen and Prevention of Recurrence A blood glucose concentration of less than 200 mg per dL, a bicarbonate level of 18 mEq per L or greater, and a venous pH level of greater than
7. 3 indicate that the DKA has resolved. 3 Typical duration of therapy is about 48 hours. 3 If the patient can eat when DKA has resolved, a standard subcutaneous insulin regimen by injection or insulin pump should be started.

Intravenous insulin should continue for one to two hours after initiation of subcutaneous insulin. For patients who are unable to eat, intravenous insulin may be continued to maintain the blood glucose in a target range.

Discussion

DKA is a life threatening but preventable complication of diabetes that occurs most frequently in persons with T1DM. It is associated with an overall mortality of < 1% in adults with T1DM. After a slight decline from 2000 to 2009, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's US Diabetes Surveillance System indicated an increase in hospitalization rates for DKA during 2009–2014, most notably in persons aged < 45 years. This epidemiology trend is reflected in our results, where most of the patients of the study cohort who developed DKA were young (median 32.0 years; IQR 23.0–43.0), white females, with an overall poor glycemic control (HbA1c > 9%), and recurrent DKA episodes (> 2 in last 12 months). The recurrence of DKA episodes was seen more in the MDII group compared with CSII. These findings go along with the systematic literature review done by Farsani et al, which reported a higher prevalence of DKA in women and patients treated with insulin injections compared with men and patients using CSII pumps. The above was as well supported by a cross-sectional study of adult patients with DKA admitted in a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, where recurrent DKA episodes were frequently seen in young women with T1DM and was caused mostly by the omission of insulin treatment.

### Update and harmonisation of guidance for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and young people in the UK [^111ZKTEb]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Careful and timely intervention is required to optimise glycaemic control and reduce the risk of mortality and devastating complications. Of these, cerebral oedema is the leading cause of death, with a mortality rate of approximately 25%. This article highlights the recent updates to UK fluid therapy guidelines for DKA and provides clinical context for the benefit of paediatricians and junior doctors in light of this new guidance.

### Closing the gap: evaluating the safety and effectiveness of diabetic ketoacidosis nomograms [^116BRJkr]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a severe complication of diabetes mellitus requiring insulin. However, there is no consensus on insulin infusion titration strategies, resulting in varied nomograms and potentially suboptimal management. Limited comparative data on insulin nomograms underscore the need for a standardized, evidence-based approach.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 3 DKA nomograms.

Methods

This multicenter, retrospective observational study included adult patients with confirmed DKA treated with IV insulin for ≥ 3 hours. Each site used a different variable-rate nomogram: variable rate weight-adjusted IV insulin infusion with no bolus (VR-W-NB), variable-rate IV insulin infusion with bolus (VR-B) or variable-rate IV insulin infusion with no bolus (VR-NB). The primary endpoint was the incidence of hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL). Secondary outcomes included time to DKA resolution and recurrence.

Results

A total of 350 patients were included. Hypoglycemia occurred in 36.2% of patients in the VR-W-NB cohort, 23.9% of patients in the VR-B cohort and 6.8% of patients in the VR-NB cohort (P < 0.01). After controlling for confounding factors, hypoglycemia remained the highest in the VR-W-NB (odds ratio [OR] = 6.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.5–15.3, P < 0.01) and VR-B (OR = 5, 95% CI = 2.1–12.1, P < 0.01) cohorts compared with the VR-NB cohort. Diabetic ketoacidosis resolution was significantly shorter in patients receiving VR-W-NB (median of 9.7 hours, interquartile range [IQR] = 5.6–16.9) compared with those receiving VR-B (12.7 hours, IQR = 9.2–25) and VR-NB (16.1 hours, IQR = 10–24.5). DKA recurrence was higher in those treated with VR-B (19.7%) compared with those treated with VR-W-NB (7%) and VR-NB (15.5%) (P = 0.02).

Conclusion and Relevance

The VR-W-NB was associated with a higher incidence of hypoglycemia and faster DKA resolution compared with VR-B and VR-NB. These findings support the need for prospective studies to define optimal insulin strategies that improve safety, effectiveness, and resource utilization.

2 AIMS AND HYPOTHESES

The primary aim was to assess rates of hypoglycaemia with use of a FRIII compared to a VRIII for management of DKA. The secondary aims were to compare time to resolution of ketosis (defined as ketones < 0.6 mmol/L) and hospital length of stay with FRIII and VRIII. We hypothesised that the hypoglycaemia incidence would be higher in the FRIII protocol, which administers considerably higher rates of insulin due to the weight‐based nature of the protocol.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111wujQm]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — recommendations: 16.14 directs clinicians to manage diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) with a standardized hospital DKA/HHS management protocol by a knowledgeable interprofessional care team, including continuous insulin infusion, fluids, insulin, and electrolytes, with close monitoring, timely and graded transition to subcutaneous insulin, and identification and treatment of the precipitating cause (A). 16.15 states that the discharge planning process should include education on the recognition, prevention, and management of DKA and/or HHS for all individuals affected by or at high risk for these events to prevent recurrence and readmission (B).

### Evaluation of an alternative approach to managing diabetic ketoacidosis: combination rapid-acting and basal subcutaneous insulin (CRABI-DKA) [^1117pEGW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although guidelines recognize the utility of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin regimens in the management of mild to moderate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the need to administer SQ insulin every 1–2 hours may discourage their use due to frequent lab testing and admission to higher level of care units.

Objective

The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to compare the proportion of patients whose mild to moderate DKA resolved within 12 hours after receiving the new SQ insulin order set and the institution's intravenous (IV) insulin infusion order set.

Methods

The SQ order set included single doses of glargine (0.2 units/kg) and lispro (0.2 units/kg) upon therapy initiation, followed by lispro (0.1–0.2 units/kg) given every 3 hours until DKA resolution. The IV order set included a nurse-managed titratable infusion. Glucose and labs were checked every 3 hours in the SQ group, whereas glucose was checked hourly and labs were checked every 2 hours in the IV group. Patients were managed on units with a RN to patient ratio of 1:4–5 and 1:2–3 in the SQ and IV groups, respectively.

Results

The percentage of patients whose DKA resolved within 12 hours was 78% in the IV group and 90% in the SQ group (P = 0.1). The time to DKA resolution and rates of hypoglycemia and hypokalemia were comparable between the groups.

Conclusion and Relevance

Our study highlights the utility of combining rapid-acting and basal SQ insulin in the management of DKA and adds to the limited literature evaluating this approach.

### Management of a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis in the emergency department [^114TD7yk]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common problem among known and newly diagnosed diabetic children and adolescents for which they will often seek care in the emergency department (ED). Technological advances are leading to changes in outpatient management of diabetes. The ED physician needs to be aware of the new technologies in the care of diabetic children and comfortable managing patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions. This article reviews the ED management of diabetic ketoacidosis and its associated complications, as well as the specific recommendations in caring for patients using the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, serum ketone monitoring, and continuous glucose monitoring.

### Guidelines for the management of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) have been poorly adopted and implemented, resulting in a lack of improvement in outcomes [^116wofgQ]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

The Joint British Diabetes Society-Inpatient (JBDS-IP) group recommends reducing fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) from 0.1 to 0.05units/kg/h when blood glucose falls < 14mmol/L to reduce the risk of complications associated with acute management of diabetes-related ketoacidosis. However, whether this change results in real-world improvements is not known.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of DKA admissions between October 2021 and March 2023 across five hospitals in the United Kingdom. We collated data on demographics, biochemical profiles, management interventions, complications, and outcomes.

Results

We identified 753 DKA admissions. There was a slow uptake of reduced-rate FRIII, reaching 49.7% over 18months. In DKA episodes where FRIII rate reduction guidelines were adopted, there was a significant lag (median [IQR] hours) between starting 10% Dextrose and FRIII rate reduction when blood glucose became < 14mmol/L (0.5 (0.1–1.8) vs. 3.2 (0.7–6.5), p = 0.00001). There was no significant reduction in hypoglycaemia (16.5% vs. 13.8%, p = 0.344) in episodes that adopted FRIII reduction. There were no significant differences in the frequency of hypokalaemia, hyperkalaemia, DKA duration, and length of stay between episodes with FRIII rate reduction versus those without FRIII.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates suboptimal adoption of guidelines. Therefore, it was perhaps unsurprising that no favourable effect on the rate of complications or outcomes in DKA episodes with reduced-rate FRIII was demonstrated. In DKA episodes where FRIII rate reduction was adopted, there was a significant delay in adjusting the FRIII when glucose levels were < 14mmol/L. Understanding the barriers and facilitators is vital in creating resources to safely implement guidelines.

### Insulin pump therapy is associated with higher rates of mild diabetic ketoacidosis compared to injection therapy: a 2-year Swedish national survey of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes [^113muPMR]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Insulin pump therapy (Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion, CSII) or insulin injection therapy (Multiple Daily Injections, MDI) are the standard options for comprehensive treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in children. Both options share the principle of basal‐bolus insulin regimes, with a continuous basal rate (CSII) or a basal dose given once or twice daily (MDI), and bolus doses administered during meals or if blood glucose levels are too high. However, regardless of insulin delivery mode, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can develop in children with T1D in case of absolute or relative insulin deficiency.

The use of CSII is increasing internationally and has become the predominant type of treatment for children with T1D in many countries. In Sweden, all children with new‐onset T1D start treatment with MDI at onset of diabetes. Sooner or later, the majority move on to CSII therapy, and in Sweden more than 70% of the children with T1D used CSII in 2020. It is recommended to start with CSII at onset of diabetes for preschool children. Although considerably more expensive, CSII offers several potential advantages over MDI. Bolus doses can be given in low doses, and adjustments are possible in small increments, while only adjustments to half units can be made with MDI. CSII thus allows for a more flexible administration of insulin and enables fine‐tuning of daily basal insulin requirements, which can be important on many occasions, such as before or during physical activity or increased insulin resistance associated with sick days. CSII may also increase comfort by eliminating the need for subcutaneous injections several times daily. In Sweden, no difference is found between CSII and MDI regarding HbA1c levels on a national level, while studies from other countries have found lower HbA1c levels associated with CSII.CSII could hypothetically be associated with increased risk of DKA, since this treatment mode only uses rapid‐ or short‐acting insulins with short half‐lives, leading to rapid depletion of insulin depots in case of interruption of insulin delivery. However, studies have shown mixed results regarding DKA incidence rates when comparing CSII with MDI. CSII has been associated with higher, lower, or practically equal, DKA incidence rates compared with MDI in various populations.

### Causes of diabetic ketoacidosis among adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: insulin pump users and non-users [^116YTCQ2]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Characteristics of insulin pump users

In our cohort, most of our participants used Medtronic pumps (70%), 15% Tandem Diabetes, 10% Animas, and 5% Omnipod. More than half of our patients (55%) had an insulin pump for more than 5 years and were trained mostly at their physician's office (55%).

When evaluating if further action was done with hyperglycemic events or when presenting DKA symptoms, most of the patients (90%) will correct hyperglycemia with the insulin pump. Other preventive measures such as hydrating and checking ketones will be done by 30% and 20% of the participants, respectively (table 3).

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^112afjcy]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has evaluated the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous insulin in people with euglycemic DKA. Only one study in this systematic review included patients with severe DKA. The majority of studies conducted so far on this topic have mainly focused on the use of subcutaneous insulin in managing mild to moderate DKA.

Limitations

Our study has some potential limitations. First, the present data is only applicable to patients with mild-to-moderate DKA without severe illness given that most of the studies excluded patients who were critically ill with multiple co-morbidities. Second, there were no documented cases of euglycemic DKA in the included studies. However, in one retrospective study, the authors included a protocol to treat euglycemic DKA. Thus, further studies are required to clarify the safety of using subcutaneous insulin for the management of DKA in this specific patient population. Third, the studies included individuals with DKA and did not perform sub-analyses for causes of DKA or underlying type of diabetes. It is unclear whether the efficacy and safety of using subcutaneous insulin compared to a continuous IV insulin varies among individuals with different precipitants of DKA and varying forms of diabetes. Fourth, even though Rao et al. had a relatively large sample size with noteworthy reductions in direct ICU and hospital readmissions by using subcutaneous insulin, the number of DKA cases in the subcutaneous insulin group is significantly smaller than that of the IV insulin treatment group (subcutaneous insulin group: 420 DKA cases versus IV insulin group: 7569 DKA cases). There remains a need for larger-scale studies to better understand the effectiveness and feasibility of using subcutaneous insulin in managing DKA. Finally, this systematic review only included a total of ten studies, most of which had a relatively small sample size and no documented close follow-up. Hence, larger RCTs with established protocols and regular follow-up are needed to confirm the clinical significance of using subcutaneous insulin compared to IV insulin and to explore optimal dosing and administration strategies for subcutaneous insulin in the management of DKA.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^112fAa9r]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

To determine the effectiveness and safety of early combination therapy with insulin degludec and intravenous insulin infusion (IVII) compared with IVII alone in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) management.

Materials and methods

This prospective, open‐label, randomised controlled trial included 80 adults (≥ 18 years) with DKA. Participants were randomised to either the intervention group, which received early subcutaneous (SC) insulin degludec (0.3 units/kg SC within 3 h of diagnosis) plus standard IVII, or the control group, which received standard IVII alone. The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution. Secondary outcomes included rebound hyperglycaemia, rebound DKA, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, length of hospital stay (LOS), and in‐hospital mortality.

Results

Eighty patients were enrolled; 67.5% of participants had type 2 diabetes. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. DKA resolution was significantly faster in the early degludec group by 3.25 h (7.75 h, IQR 6.00–9.00 h vs. 11.00 h, IQR 6.25–15.00; p = 0.039). At 72 h after transition to SC insulin, mean capillary blood glucose (CBG) was significantly lower with early degludec (213.9 ± 25.8 mg/dL vs. 240.1 ± 42.0 mg/dL; p = 0.012). Rates of rebound hyperglycaemia at 12 h after bridging, mean CBG levels at 12, 24, and 48 h among those with rebound hyperglycaemia, as well as rates of rebound DKA, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, LOS, and in‐hospital mortality, were not significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Early administration of SC insulin degludec in combination with IVII accelerated DKA resolution and improved blood glucose levels at 72 h in patients with rebound hyperglycaemia after discontinuation of IVII, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia or hypokalaemia.

### Relationship between bedside ketone levels and time to resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis: a retrospective cohort study [^117HEm7Y]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is caused by relative or absolute insulin deficiency and is characterized clinically by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia. DKA is frequently encountered in daily clinical practice, in both newly diagnosed cases (up to 70%) and patients with established type 1 diabetes (T1D) (rate, 1–10% per case per year). The common risk factors for DKA include new diagnosis of T1D, young children, adolescent female patients, delayed T1D diagnosis, insulin omission, poor treatment on a sick day, accessibility to hospitals, and insulin pump injection errors.

DKA is one of the most severe and sometimes life-threatening acute complications; therefore, establishing a standard treatment protocol is needed to prevent further complications. There are currently only a few established treatment regimens for DKA treatment. For example, the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes released recently consensus guidelines for DKA; however, the guidelines cited only a few solid evidence-based treatment protocols for pediatric patients. Surprisingly, the time to DKA resolution (time between the start of treatment and resolution of DKA) remains ill-defined. DKA resolution is generally judged comprehensively on the basis of clinical signs, such as the ability to eat/drink and/or a few non-specific biomarkers, such as the blood pH value. Of these biomarkers, the Joint British Diabetes Societies recommended using bedside measurement of serum 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) to monitor the response to DKA treatment. In this regard, bedside 3HB has been reported to correlate well with blood pH levels, as well as with plasma ketone. On the basis of this, a number of studies investigated the usefulness of bedside ketone body monitoring to the response to treatment of DKA.

We have experienced numerous cases of acute DKA that were managed clinically at our hospital, including bedside ketone body measurement. To our knowledge, there is little or no information on the usefulness of bedside ketone body monitoring in relation to the time to DKA resolution. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the clinical value of bedside ketone body monitoring and the factors that affect the time to DKA resolution in patients with T1D.

### Longitudinal determination of diabetes complications and other clinical variables as risk factors for diabetic ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetes [^1179Q5Ly]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to determine whether diabetes complications, such as kidney disease that may impair acid-base buffering capacity, independently predict the risk of subsequent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Research Design and Methods

We accessed previously collected 34-year data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study through public data access. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying exposures and covariates were used to examine the associations of macrovascular disease and early and late stages of neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy, with subsequent DKA occurrence as the outcome.

Results

Of 1,441 participants, 297 experienced 488 DKA events over follow-up. Major adverse cardiovascular events [hazard ratio (HR) 3.16, 95% CI 1.57–6.35, P = 0.001] and late-stage neuropathy, which comprised serious foot ulcer or amputation (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.04–2.45, P = 0.03) were independently associated with higher DKA risk. Higher risk was also associated with shorter diabetes duration (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64–0.91, P = 0.002), female sex (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.56–2.67, P < 0.001), current insulin pump use (HR 3.04, 95% CI 2.29–4.02, P < 0.001), higher time-updated HbA1c (per additional 1%: HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.29–1.50, P < 0.001), and higher current insulin dose (per 1 additional unit/kg/day: HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.62–3.33, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

A major cardiovascular event, foot ulcer, or amputation confers the greatest risk of future DKA independent of previously recognized risk factors, implying a need to target patients with these events for DKA prevention interventions, such as self-management skills for metabolic control, management of depression, and DKA education.

### Update and harmonisation of guidance for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and young people in the UK [^117V2pjs]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Both BSPED and NICE recommend the following fluid maintenance requirements, using 0.9% sodium chloride without added glucose, and the Holliday-Segar formula:

100 mL/kg for the first 10 kg (0–10 kg body weight).
50 mL/kg for the second 10 kg (10–20 kg body weight).
20 mL/kg for each subsequent kilogramme (> 20 kg body weight).
When calculating the total fluid replacement, subtract any initial bolus volumes from the total fluid deficit (unless the child or young person is in shock).

For insulin and electrolyte replacement requirements, both recommend:

The addition of 40 mmol/L potassium chloride to all fluids (apart from the initial intravenous bolus) unless the patient is anuric or hyperkalaemic. Include this before starting the insulin infusion if hypokalaemia is observed at presentation.
0.9% sodium chloride should be used without added glucose unless the plasma glucose is < 14 mmol/L.
Initially assess for the presence of hyponatraemia, continue to monitor throughout treatment and treat as soon as blood glucose falls. Monitor sodium levels throughout treatment and calculate sodium initially to identify if hyponatraemia is present. This should be treated as soon as blood glucose falls. It is important to monitor as hyponatraemia and rapidly increasing sodium levels can both be signs of CO.
Do not give intravenous sodium bicarbonate to CYP with DKA unless they have compromised cardiac contractility caused by life-threatening hyperkalaemia or severe acidosis, and you have discussed with paediatric intensivist.
A soluble insulin infusion of between 0.05 units/kg/hour and 0.1 units/kg/hour, 1–2 hours after intravenous fluids have been commenced. BSPED stated that the 0.05 units/kg/hour should be sufficient unless the patient is suffering from severe DKA or is an adolescent. If they are attached to a 'continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion', disconnect when starting intravenous insulin therapy. For patients already on long-acting insulin, it may be continued, and in new patients consider commencing long-acting subcutaneous insulin alongside intravenous. Similarly, the NICE guidelines state that continuing subcutaneous basal insulin in a child or young person who was using a basal insulin before DKA may be continued in discussion with a diabetes specialist.

### Hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis with insulin pump therapy in children and adolescents [^113ztE8r]. Pediatric Diabetes (2006). Low credibility.

This review deals with the two most serious side effects encountered with insulin pump therapy, severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Although clinical follow-up studies reported decreased rates of severe hypoglycemia, randomized studies have not confirmed this, showing no difference between the pump and injection groups. Less-severe hypoglycemia (mild/moderate/symptomatic hypoglycemia) was found to be more common with pump use. Some patients have inadvertently dosed or overdosed while awake or during sleep, causing fatal outcome in rare cases. Population-based or retrospective clinical studies reported a low rate of DKA in pump users that was still a higher rate than those using injection therapy, at least in some countries. In research settings and for patients with good compliance and adequate family support, the risk of DKA seems lower; many short-term studies report no DKA at all, possibly due to the increased attention given to participants. The use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) seems to decrease the risk in patients who had recurrent DKA before pump start. Most episodes of DKA occur early after pump start, suggesting a learning curve occurs in all new forms of treatment. Increased teaching and awareness programs are vital to prevent severe hypoglycemia and DKA in children and adolescents using insulin pumps.

### Subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues for diabetic ketoacidosis [^115GLxpD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute, life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes that mainly occurs in individuals with autoimmune type 1 diabetes, but it is not uncommon in some people with type 2 diabetes. The treatment of DKA is traditionally accomplished by the administration of intravenous infusion of regular insulin that is initiated in the emergency department and continued in an intensive care unit or a high-dependency unit environment. It is unclear whether people with DKA should be treated with other treatment modalities such as subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues.

Objectives

To assess the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Search Methods

We identified eligible trials by searching MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. We searched the trials registers WHO ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of last search for all databases was 27 October 2015. We also examined reference lists of included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews, and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

We included trials if they were RCTs comparing subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus standard intravenous infusion in participants with DKA of any age or sex with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and in pregnant women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias, and evaluated overall study quality utilising the GRADE instrument. We assessed the statistical heterogeneity of included studies by visually inspecting forest plots and quantifying the diversity using the I² statistic. We synthesised data using random-effects model meta-analysis or descriptive analysis, as appropriate.

Main Results

Five trials randomised 201 participants (110 participants to subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues and 91 to intravenous regular insulin). The criteria for DKA were consistent with the American Diabetes Association criteria for mild or moderate DKA. The underlying cause of DKA was mostly poor compliance with diabetes therapy. Most trials did not report on type of diabetes. Younger diabetic participants and children were underrepresented in our included trials (one trial only). Four trials evaluated the effects of the rapid-acting insulin analogue lispro, and one the effects of the rapid-acting insulin analogue aspart. The mean follow-up period as measured by mean hospital stay ranged between two and seven days. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated trials was unclear in many domains and high for performance bias for the outcome measure time to resolution of DKA. No deaths were reported in the included trials (186 participants; 3 trials; moderate- (insulin lispro) to low-quality evidence (insulin aspart)). There was very low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous insulin lispro versus intravenous regular insulin on the time to resolution of DKA: mean difference (MD) 0.2 h (95% CI -1.7 to 2.1); P = 0.81; 90 participants; 2 trials. In one trial involving children with DKA, the time to reach a glucose level of 250 mg/dL was similar between insulin lispro and intravenous regular insulin. There was very low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous insulin aspart versus intravenous regular insulin on the time to resolution of DKA: MD -1 h (95% CI -3.2 to 1.2); P = 0.36; 30 participants; 1 trial. There was low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus intravenous regular insulin on hypoglycaemic episodes: 6 of 80 insulin lispro-treated participants compared with 9 of 76 regular insulin-treated participants reported hypoglycaemic events; risk ratio (RR) 0.59 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.52); P = 0.28; 156 participants; 4 trials. For insulin aspart compared with regular insulin, RR for hypoglycaemic episodes was 1.00 (95% CI 0.07 to 14.55); P = 1.0; 30 participants; 1 trial; low-quality evidence. Socioeconomic effects as measured by length of mean hospital stay for insulin lispro compared with regular insulin showed a MD of -0.4 days (95% CI -1 to 0.2); P = 0.22; 90 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence and for insulin aspart compared with regular insulin 1.1 days (95% CI -3.3 to 1.1); P = 0.32; low-quality evidence. Data on morbidity were limited, but no specific events were reported for the comparison of insulin lispro with regular insulin. No trial reported on adverse events other than hypoglycaemic episodes, and no trial investigated patient satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review, which provided mainly data on adults, suggests on the basis of mostly low- to very low-quality evidence that there are neither advantages nor disadvantages when comparing the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus intravenous regular insulin for treating mild or moderate DKA.

### Insulin pump therapy is associated with higher rates of mild diabetic ketoacidosis compared to injection therapy: a 2-year Swedish national survey of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes [^114U2txZ]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

This study should be interpreted in relation to international rates of DKA in children with T1D, which are higher than in Sweden. A lower DKA incidence in Sweden might reflect increased awareness among patients and caregivers. The significant overrepresentation of CSII among hospital admissions for mild DKA could reflect a management problem in this group. Interruption of insulin administration via CSII results in quicker ketogenesis than missed doses with MDI, where a long‐acting insulin provides an insulin depot. It is also possible that some children with mild DKA, with either MDI or CSII, were self‐treated at home and never admitted to hospital. For mild DKA, the ISPAD 2018 guidelines state that subcutaneous insulin and oral rehydration can be used initially, which should apply to most mild DKA episodes in this study. This simplified management could reduce the burden of hospital admission for both the individual and the health care system. For children with insulin pumps without automatic suspension and repeated DKA episodes, addition of long‐acting basal insulin may be beneficial in selected cases.

Regarding DKA in the group of children with MDI, this study shows significantly higher HbA1c levels compared to children with CSII. Children with MDI also had low access to ketone meters at home. This emphasizes the importance of exploring the total situation of this group of children, including a social and psychological investigation and thorough follow‐up, in the same manner as is recommended for recurrent DKA in ISPAD Guidelines.

A limitation in this study is that the total treatment time since the start of CSII treatment until DKA admission was impossible to obtain from SWEDIABKIDS. Such data would have permitted a more precise estimation of the relative risk of DKA comparing CSII and MDI. However, risk estimation of DKA in the pediatric population with T1D is difficult due to the inherent practical and ethical problems in designing blinded, randomized controlled trials. Another limitation is the lack of socioeconomic or ethnic data in statistical analyses. Specific demographic data, such as socioeconomic factors and ethnicity, is not part of SWEDIABKIDS and was beyond the scope of this study.

### SGLT2 inhibitor-associated diabetic ketoacidosis: clinical review and recommendations for prevention and diagnosis [^112xurFT]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are the newest class of antihyperglycemic agents available on the market. Regulator warnings and concerns regarding the risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), however, have dampened enthusiasm for the class despite the combined glycemic, blood pressure, and occasional weight benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors. With the goal of improving patient safety, a cross-Canada expert panel and writing group were convened to review the evidence to-date on reported SGLT2 inhibitor-related DKA incidents and to offer recommendations for preventing and recognizing patients with SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA.

Methods

Reports covering DKA events in subjects taking SGLT2 inhibitors that were published in PubMed, presented at professional conferences, or in the public domain from January 2013 to mid-August 2016 were reviewed by the group independently and collectively. Practical recommendations for diagnosis and prevention were established by the panel.

Findings

DKA is rarely associated with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. Patients with SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA may be euglycemic (plasma glucose level < 14 mmol/L). DKA is more likely in patients with insulin-deficient diabetes, including those with type 2 diabetes, and is typically precipitated by insulin omission or dose reduction, severe acute illness, dehydration, extensive exercise, surgery, low-carbohydrate diets, or excessive alcohol intake. SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA may be prevented by withholding SGLT2 inhibitors when precipitants develop, avoiding insulin omission or inappropriate insulin dose reduction, and by following sick day protocols as recommended.

Implications

Preventive strategies should help avoid SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA. All SGLT2 inhibitor-treated patients presenting with signs or symptoms of DKA should be suspected to have DKA and be investigated for DKA, especially euglycemic patients. If DKA is diagnosed, SGLT2 inhibitor treatment should be stopped, and the DKA should be treated with a traditional treatment protocol.

### Review of subcutaneous insulin regimens in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults and pediatrics [^117BGft5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Summarize the studies evaluating the use of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in adults and pediatrics.

Data Sources

A PubMed literature search was conducted for articles published between 2000 and the end of May 2024 which contained the following terms in their title: (1) subcutaneous, glargine, or basal and (2) ketoa*.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Review articles, guidelines, meta-analysis, commentaries, studies not related to the acute management of DKA, studies evaluating continuous SQ insulin, animal studies, if the time to DKA resolution was not clearly defined, and studies where basal insulin was administered greater than 6 hours after the insulin infusion was started were excluded.

Data Synthesis

The electronic search identified 58 articles. Following the initial screening 38 articles were excluded and 3 were added after bibliography review. Of the 23 articles assessed for eligibility, 7 were excluded. Sixteen articles were included. Five studies compared SQ rapid/short-acting insulin and intravenous (IV) insulin infusions in adults, 4 compared SQ rapid/short-acting insulin and IV insulin infusions in pediatrics, 4 evaluated IV insulin infusions with or without SQ basal insulin in adults, and 3 evaluated IV insulin infusions with or without SQ basal insulin in pediatrics.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

In comparison with IV insulin infusions, rapid/short-acting SQ insulin regimens were associated with reduced ICU admission rates, hospital length of stay, and hospitalization costs. IV insulin infusion regimens that included a single SQ basal insulin dose upon therapy initiation were associated with reduced concurrent IV insulin infusion durations.

Conclusion

Studies reviewed suggest that SQ insulin regimens may be as effective and safe as IV insulin infusions in the management of DKA and are associated with the conservation of resources. Providers may refer to this review when establishing or modifying their DKA management protocols.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117FgVQm]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

SGLT inhibition and risk of ketosis — individuals with type 1 diabetes and insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with SGLT inhibitor therapy; SGLT inhibitor–associated DKA occurs in approximately 4% of people with type 1 diabetes, the risk can be 5–17 times higher than in untreated type 1 diabetes, and SGLT2 inhibitors are not approved for use in people with type 1 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes, DKA is uncommon with an estimated incidence of 0.6–4.9 events per 1,000 person-years; up to a third of SGLT2-associated DKA cases present with glucose < 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) and in one small study 71% presented with glucose ≤ 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L); risk factors include low-carbohydrate diets, decreased caloric intake, alcohol intake, and other common precipitating factors, and it is important to educate individuals about the signs and symptoms of DKA and DKA mitigation and management and to provide accurate tools for ketone measurement.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^116yT14n]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To determine the effectiveness and safety of early combination therapy with insulin degludec and intravenous insulin infusion (IVII) compared with IVII alone in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) management.

Materials and Methods

This prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trial included 80 adults (≥ 18years) with DKA. Participants were randomised to either the intervention group, which received early subcutaneous (SC) insulin degludec (0.3units/kg SC within 3h of diagnosis) plus standard IVII, or the control group, which received standard IVII alone. The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution. Secondary outcomes included rebound hyperglycaemia, rebound DKA, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, length of hospital stay (LOS), and in-hospital mortality.

Results

Eighty patients were enrolled; 67.5% of participants had type 2 diabetes. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. DKA resolution was significantly faster in the early degludec group by 3.25h (7.75h, IQR 6.00–9.00h vs. 11.00h, IQR 6.25–15.00; p = 0.039). At 72h after transition to SC insulin, mean capillary blood glucose (CBG) was significantly lower with early degludec (213.9 ± 25.8mg/dL vs. 240.1 ± 42.0mg/dL; p = 0.012). Rates of rebound hyperglycaemia at 12h after bridging, mean CBG levels at 12, 24, and 48h among those with rebound hyperglycaemia, as well as rates of rebound DKA, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, LOS, and in-hospital mortality, were not significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Early administration of SC insulin degludec in combination with IVII accelerated DKA resolution and improved blood glucose levels at 72h in patients with rebound hyperglycaemia after discontinuation of IVII, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia or hypokalaemia.

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^111Xg7Co]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Although positive therapeutic responses to low-dose insulin therapy have been established in adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), none of these studies and guidelines for the treatment of DKA, including the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Consensus and Position Statements, has ever assessed or addressed the use of a continuous insulin infusion without a loading dose of insulin. In the current study, we used a dose of 0.14 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without a loading dose instead of the recommended 0.1 unit · kg −1 · h −1 with a loading dose. This insulin regimen was chosen because one study in a pediatric population used a dosing regimen of 0.1 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without a loading dose that resulted in a total plasma insulin level of 50–60 μU/ml. This level proved to be too low for optimal suppression of hepatic glucose output and optimal glucose uptake. In addition, bolus doses of insulin may result in hypokalemia as well as other undesirable effects, especially when used in a routine hospital setting.

The efficacy of low-dose insulin without a priming dose has not been established in a prospective randomized study. Thus, the following questions have remained unanswered in the treatment of DKA: 1) Is an insulin bolus needed before a continuous insulin infusion? 2) What is the optimal insulin infusion rate if a bolus dose is not used? and 3) What is the dose response of continuous insulin infusion used alone in regard to decremental changes in glucose, metabolic parameters, cortisol, and free fatty acids (FFAs)? Therefore, we evaluated responses to three low-dose insulin regimens in 37 consecutive patients with DKA in a prospective randomized fashion to address these issues. Changes in plasma free insulin, serum potassium levels, and outcome recovery measures were assessed using a higher infusion dose (0.14 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without a bolus dose) compared with a lower infusion dose (0.07 unit · kg −1 · h −1) with and without a loading dose (0.07 unit/kg) of insulin.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^114RX1Yx]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious condition that warrants immediate and aggressive intervention. Even with appropriate intervention, DKA is associated with significant morbidity and possible mortality in diabetic patients in the pediatric age group. With appreciation of its severity, proper understanding of the pathophysiology, and careful attention to the details of management and close monitoring, most cases will have a satisfactory outcome. Because treatment is costly and because the risk for morbidity remains even under the best of circumstances, prevention of DKA must be a major goal in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Involvement and close follow-up by a multidisciplinary team of health care professionals with experience in dealing with diabetes in children and adolescents is the best way to avoid DKA.

### Is subcutaneous administration of rapid-acting insulin as effective as intravenous insulin for treating diabetic ketoacidosis? [^116VssMi]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

To determine whether intermittent subcutaneous administration of rapid-acting insulin is as effective as intravenous infusion of regular insulin for treating uncomplicated diabetic ketoacidosis, we performed a MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library search, using the key words "subcutaneous insulin AND intravenous insulin AND diabetic ketoacidosis; LIMIT humans and English". We also searched the references in these articles for additional studies. This search yielded a total of 35 articles, 4 of which directly addressed the question at hand. According to this review of the available evidence; subcutaneous administration of rapid-acting insulin analogs such as lispro is as effective and safe as intravenous infusion of regular insulin for the management of uncomplicated diabetic ketoacidosis. In addition, use of insulin analogs may confer an overall cost savings, obviating the need for infusion pumps and ICU admissions in certain institutions. Therefore, it would be safe and effective to use subcutaneously administered rapid-acting insulin analogues instead of intravenous regular insulin infusions for patients with uncomplicated diabetic ketoacidosis.

Table 1
Biochemical criteria for DKA definition and categorization

Hypertonicity provokes an osmotic flux of water from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment and nearly all body cells (except for neurones) go through an intracellular dehydration process. This water transcellular shift also generates an extracellular efflux of potassium, further aggravated by metabolic acidosis, causing a high intracellular potassium deficit. The total-body potassium deficit occurs mainly due to vomiting and osmotic diuresis; however, despite the total depletion, serum potassium levels at diagnosis may be increased, normal or decreased.

Hyperglycemia is the determining factor of serum hyperosmolality, responsible for the osmotic flux of water to extracellular space, which may cause dilutional hyponatremia; it is estimated that for each 100 mg/dl blood glucose concentration above the limit of 100 mg/dl, there is a 1.6 mEq/L reduction in serum sodium. In general, there is also a depletion of total-body phosphate related to osmotic diuresis too, and an accentuated fall in its serum levels is observed after starting insulin replacement, which provokes a rapid intracellular shift of phosphate.

Dehydration, hyperosmolality, acidosis and electrolytic disorders lead to the release of counterregulatory hormones, perpetuating the decompensation cycle (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Pathophysiology of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) (modified from).

In severe cases of DKA, hyperpnea may cause a very low pCO2 and, consequently, there will be a decreased CO2 diffusion through the hematoencephalic barrier determining a low pCO2 in the smooth muscles of cerebral vessels and an increased extracellular fluid pH, which can provoke cerebral vasoconstriction. The biochemical criteria for DKA definition and categorization can be found in Table 1.

Intercurrent illnesses in addition to intense physical or emotional stress are risk factors for DKA; however, difficulties in coping with insulin and diet therapies, peripubertal emotional instability, poor metabolic control, lack of family support, psychiatry disorders, limited access to medical services, insulin pump failure, use of drugs with hyperglycemiant effect may increase the risk for DKA.

### SGLT2 inhibitor-associated ketoacidosis vs type 1 diabetes-associated ketoacidosis [^113LT6Ht]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The pathophysiology of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i)–associated ketoacidosis (DKA) differs from type 1 diabetes (T1D) DKA. T1D DKA is driven by absolute insulin deficiency, leading to ketosis and hyperglycemia. In contrast, SGLT2i DKA occurs due to reduction in plasma glucose (PG) from urinary glucose losses, which reduces insulin secretion and stimulates glucagon secretion, leading to ketosis. Accordingly, PG levels in SGLT2i DKA are often normal or mildly elevated. The implication is that glycemia and ketosis are less closely linked than in T1D DKA. Despite these differences, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology recommends treatment with the same protocols as T1D. This may result in hypoglycemia when patients receive fixed-dose insulin infusion or inadequate insulin dosing and reduced ketone clearance when patients receive dynamic insulin infusions.

DKA prevention and treatment

Diabetes teams should incorporate intensive education on ketones, ketone measurements, and prevention of ketosis in their patient education, and provide educational materials as well as emergency contact points to people with T1DM on SGLTi.

When patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus on SGLTi present with symptoms compatible with DKA, diagnosis and initiation of treatment should be ketone-centered and no longer glycemic-based. This is because glycemic levels are not as high as clinicians and patients are used to when not taking SGLT inhibitors, because of glucosuria. Glycemic levels in DKA cases in SGLT inhibitor-treated individuals are often below the 250 mg/dl/13.9 mmol/l threshold used by the American Diabetes Association in its definition of DKA, thus called euglycemic DKA (eu-DKA). The cornerstone of ketosis treatment is to inject insulin, consume carbohydrates, and maintain adequate hydration. Insulin should never be stopped. Insulin is best provided by injection even for patients who have an insulin pump. For patients on pump insulin, injections should be continued until pump/infusion set malfunction has been ruled out or has been resolved. SGLTi should be discontinued until clinical reevaluation by the patient his or her diabetic team/prescriber. If, despite these measures, symptoms and/or ketone measurements worsen/persist, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If patients present themselves to the emergency department or an urgent care center, an evaluation is necessary that includes measurements of capillary/venous pH, blood bicarbonate, anion gap, and blood ketones (β-hydroxybutyrate). It is important that emergency departments are made aware that DKA can, and will, present without overtly elevated glucose levels in patients treated with SGLT inhibitors. –

### Insulin pump therapy is associated with higher rates of mild diabetic ketoacidosis compared to injection therapy: a 2-year Swedish national survey of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes [^113M9J6g]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Monitoring glucose levels is central in diabetes management. All families should have access to capillary glucose tests. In addition, access to blood ketone tests at home is recommended by many authors since these tests may reduce hospitalizations for DKA.DKA prevention measures using blood ketone meters are taught at diabetes onset and at CSII initiation. It is also included for both MDI and CSII users when refreshing sick day knowledge. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) is available for many patients with T1D in economically privileged countries. CGM utilizes subcutaneous sensors for continuous monitoring of glucose levels with a high degree of accuracy. The use of CGM has increased quickly, and is used by more than 95% of children in Sweden (2020). Besides advantages in increasing comfort, for example by enabling uninterrupted physical activity and minimizing the need for capillary glucose tests, better glycemic control has been shown in several studies. Through alert functions, CGM could also help avoid hyper/hypoglycemic events by alerting the child/caregiver if subcutaneous glucose levels are too high or too low. Integration of CSII and CGM allows for automatic suspension of the basal rate when the glucose level is low. Hybrid closed‐loop CSII systems can adjust the basal rate automatically and give small automatic corrections. The main intentions of these advanced systems are maintenance good of metabolic control and avoidance of hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events, including DKA.,

DKA incidence rates in children with established T1D are relatively low in Sweden from an international perspective, with annual incidences of hospital admission for DKA below 1% in the total national T1D pediatric population. Since DKA is associated with significant risk of acute morbidity and mortality, may cause long‐term morbidity, and entails a substantial healthcare cost, it is nonetheless imperative to keep the incidence rate of DKA as low as possible.

The primary objective was to compare the distributions of CSII and MDI in the national pediatric T1D population with the population admitted to hospital for DKA.

Secondary objectives were to analyze the effect of CSII and MDI on the level of acidosis at hospital admission for DKA and to compare HbA1c levels between CSII and MDI in DKA.

### Insulin pump therapy is associated with higher rates of mild diabetic ketoacidosis compared to injection therapy: a 2-year Swedish national survey of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes [^111RthQY]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

A strength with this study is that it is a national population‐based design that included all children 0–17.99 years with T1D admitted to hospital for DKA during 2 years. Furthermore, a high‐quality national register (SWEDIABKIDS) was used to compare the background pediatric population with T1D.

Hybrid Closed Loop systems that might decrease the risk of DKA were not standard features of CSII treatment at the time of study inclusion. However, an interrupted insulin delivery will cause ketosis and risk of progression to DKA regardless of which insulin delivery mode is used.

### Is diabetic ketoacidosis a good predictor of 5-year metabolic control in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes? [^112PAs68]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study population included people treated in the Department of Pediatric Diabetology and Pediatrics, Pediatric Teaching Clinical Hospital of the Medical University of Warsaw due to newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes complicated by DKA between 2010 and 2014. The inclusion criteria were: newly recognized diabetes type 1 with DKA at the onset of the disease and a complete follow-up for 5 consecutive years. No restrictions on participation were imposed as regards the type of insulin therapy. Participants treated both with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and multiple daily injections (MDI) were recruited. Treatment with insulin pumps providing continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion has been available to children with diabetes mellitus in Poland since 2008. The service is covered by the National Health Fund (Narodowy Fundusz Zdrowia, NFZ) from the catalogue of public-funded services under separately commissioned healthcare services. The patients had the access to two types of insulin pump brands: Medtronic (MiniMed) and Roche - Accu Check. A tender for insulin pumps is conducted annually by the hospital and the access to the devices depends on its results. Most participants had CSII implemented at diabetes diagnosis. Personal continuous glucose monitoring devices have been widely available in Poland since 2018 (70% of the price of the devices was paid by the national health insurance system covered by public funds). Closed loop pumps were not available for any study participants.

We excluded participants diagnosed and initially treated in another Pediatric Department who were finally transferred to our Department and those with an incomplete follow-up. Subsequently, individual 1:1 matching was performed: every participant with DKA was matched with a newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes person without DKA. The participants were matched for age, gender and Body Mass Index (BMI) to minimize the influence of residual confounding. Moreover, no differences were revealed in health insurance status. Polish citizens have equal and unpaid access to healthcare services provided by the national health insurance system covered by public funds and managed by NFZ. DKA was defined as pH below 7.3 with concomitant hyperglycemia exceeding 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L) and ketonemia or ketonuria. The autoimmune origin of diabetes was confirmed with typical autoantibody testing and C-peptide level measurement. The onset was defined as the first 2 weeks after T1D manifestation. The obligatory part of the first hospitalization was a 2-week intensive educational course with a diabetic educator.

### Addressing pitfalls in management of diabetic ketoacidosis with a standardized protocol [^113YCWWn]. Endocrine Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of a diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)-Power Plan (PP) for guiding intravenous (IV) insulin infusions prior to anion gap (AG) closure and administering subcutaneous (SC) insulin ≥ 1 hour before discontinuing IV insulin. Methods: Retrospective chart review of patients with DKA before (pre-PP) (n = 60) and following (post-PP) (n = 60) implementation of a DKA-PP. Groups were compared for percentage of patients for whom IV insulin therapy was continued until AG closure, the percentage of patients receiving SC insulin ≥ 1 hour before discontinuation of IV insulin, and percentage of patients with rebound DKA during the index hospitalization. Results: Admission plasma glucose (514 mg/dL vs. 500 mg/dL; P = 0.36) and venous pH (7.2 vs. 7.2; P = 0.57) were similar in pre- and post-PP groups. Inappropriate discontinuation of IV insulin occurred less frequently in post-PP patients (28% vs. 7%; P = 0.007), with a lower frequency of rebound DKA (40% vs. 8%; P = 0.001) following acute management. More post-PP patients received SC insulin ≥ 1 hour before discontinuation of IV insulin (65% vs. 78%; P = 0.05). Conclusion: Implementation of a DKA-PP was associated with appropriate discontinuation of IV insulin in more patients, more frequent administration of SC insulin ≥ 1 hour prior to discontinuation of IV insulin, and fewer episodes of rebound DKA.

6.2 Principles of self‐management of insulin pumps by inpatients

Inpatients using insulin pumps should self‐manage if well enough to do so.
If the person with diabetes is not well enough to self‐manage the pump or is unconscious/incapacitated, the pump should be discontinued and a variable rate intravenous insulin infusion should be commenced immediately.
An insulin pump should NEVER be discontinued without immediate substitution of rapid‐acting insulin via an alternative administration route. The person using insulin pump therapy should already have an alternative basal/bolus insulin regimen in the event of pump failure.
Insulin pumps should only be adjusted by the patient or a member of the diabetes team.
If an insulin pump is discontinued it should be stored safely until the person with diabetes is ready to recommence the pump. The place of storage should be documented.
If the person with diabetes is not able to self‐manage but continued intravenous insulin is not necessary, the diabetes specialist team should be asked to advise on a subcutaneous insulin injection regimen.
The altered tissue perfusion in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) affects insulin absorption, making insulin pump therapy unreliable. The insulin pump should be temporarily discontinued in people with diabetes presenting in DKA: remove the cannula and detach the pump. For further management, follow standard DKA protocol.
When an insulin pump is recommenced the intravenous insulin infusion should not be discontinued until a mealtime bolus dose of has been given via the pump.
All people with diabetes admitted to hospital using an insulin pump should be referred to the diabetes specialist team.

6.3 Pump management for procedures requiring a period of starvation

Continuous infusion of subcutaneous insulin via a pump is designed to maintain stable blood glucose during the fasting state.
Procedures requiring the individual to be nil by mouth for a limited period (no more than one missed meal) may be manageable with a pump.
Plans for continued use of the pump during an elective procedure should be discussed and agreed with the patient before admission.
People with an insulin pump should not require overnight admission prior to the procedure.

### Diabetes technology: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114vBzp9]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Insulin pump therapy — adults and older adults — can be initiated at diagnosis and offers ongoing benefits for older individuals with type 1 diabetes; Access to insulin pump therapy, including AID systems, should be allowed or continued in older adults as it is in younger people. Complications from infusion set dislodgement or occlusion put individuals at risk for ketosis and DKA and must be recognized and managed early. Discontinuation of pump therapy is relatively uncommon today; the frequency has decreased over the past few decades, and current attrition is linked to cost or wearability problems, loss of insurance, dislike of the pump, suboptimal glycemic outcomes, or mood disorders. There are no data to suggest that measurement of C-peptide levels or antibodies predicts success with insulin pump therapy, and the frequency of follow-up does not influence outcomes.

### Current practice in the perioperative management of patients with diabetes mellitus: a narrative review [^112h4xn9]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Insulin

There are several ways to manage a patient's insulin in the preoperative period (Table 2). The most common are (1) continuation of the patient's normal multiple daily injections of insulin but at a reduced dose before surgery; (2) commencement of a VRIII; (3) continuation of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) – usually via a pump; or (4) fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) – the latter only used for management of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic non-ketotic (HHONK) state.

The VRIII was advocated as a replacement for Alberti's 'glucose–insulin–potassium' (GIK) in the 1990s. Although Alberti's regimen was a significant improvement in the perioperative management of the patient with diabetes, it had inherent limitations, including high risk of error owing to the number of additives to the fluid bag, and was also wasteful. However, all guidelines caution on the inherent risks of VRIII unless used in a highly monitored environment, such as intraoperatively or in a critical care environment, because of the risk of hypoglycaemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) if inappropriately managed. Of note, patients with T1DM always need insulin to avoid the development of DKA.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the past three decades, management of type 1 diabetes (T1D) has increasingly benefited from innovations in diabetes technology, such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pumps, also termed continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).CSII has become standard care for children and adolescents with T1D in many parts of the world. In Western countries, pump users represent 40%–60% of the T1D population.

The increasing uptake of CSII over the past 20 years has resulted from improvements in pump technology and documented health benefits: on the whole, data from meta‐analyses and systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including pediatric populations suggest that in T1D, the use of an insulin pump compared with the use of multiple daily injections (MDI) is associated with a modest reduction in glycated hemoglobin A1c levels (HbA1c), with lower rates of severe hypoglycemia (SH), and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), better quality of life and treatment satisfaction, lower insulin requirements and in some studies lower body weight. This is supported by data from more recent observational studies and registries documenting sustained benefit over long periods of pump use across different populations.

### Evaluation and management of the critically ill adult with diabetic ketoacidosis [^113gT6Kk]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a hyperglycemic emergency that presents commonly to the emergency department. Severe DKA has the potential for significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized early and treated appropriately. It is incumbent on the emergency clinician to be vigilant in the management of these critically ill patients.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the emergency medicine management of the adult patient with severe DKA.

Discussion

DKA is a condition found most commonly in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, often due to nonadherence with diabetic medications or an inciting event, such as infection or ischemia. The severity of DKA is classified based on the level of acidosis present rather than absolute glucose level. The management of severe DKA involves assessing and treating the inciting event, fluid hydration, insulin, and potassium repletion. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent the complications that can occur.

Conclusions

DKA is a medical condition that has the potential for significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized and managed appropriately.

### Diabetes management in the new millennium using insulin pump therapy [^1114V3XW]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Current goals of therapy of type 1 and 2 diabetes are to achieve near normal glycemia, minimize the risk of severe hypoglycemia, limit excessive weight gain, improve quality of life and delay or prevent late vascular complications. As discussed in this review, insulin pump or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy provides a treatment option that can dramatically aid in achieving all of these goals. In comparison to multiple daily injections (MDI), CSII uses only rapid-acting insulin, provides greater flexibility in timing of meals and snacks, has programmable basal rates to optimize overnight glycemic control, can reduce the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia, and enhances patients' ability to control their own diabetes. Most important, in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, CSII has been shown to lower HbA(1c) levels, reduce the frequency of severe hypoglycemia and limit excessive weight gain versus MDI without increasing the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. Similarly positive results are being seen with CSII in adults with type 2 diabetes. The effectiveness of CSII and improvements in pump technology have fueled a dramatic increase in the use of this therapy. Practical guidelines are presented for selection of patients, initiation of treatment, patient education, follow-up assessments and troubleshooting. The recent introduction of methods for continuous glucose monitoring provides a new means to optimize the basal and bolus capabilities of CSII and offers the hope of the development of a feedback-controlled artificial pancreas.

### Voluntary recall notifying medtronic insulin pump users of potential risks of shortened pump battery life… [^117C9z9p]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

- **Product Type**: Medical Devices
- **Reason for Announcement**: Recall
- **Company Name**: Medtronic plc
- **Product Description**: Product DescriptionMiniMed™ 600 series or 700 series insulin pumps. GALWAY, Ireland

Medtronic plc, a global leader in healthcare technology, voluntarily issued a field action starting on July 31, 2024, notifying global customers of its MiniMed™ 600 series or 700 series insulin pumps to follow their pump's built-in alerts and alarms for battery status and to contact Medtronic if they observe changes in the battery life of their pump. This may result in the pump stopping insulin delivery significantly sooner than usually expected and could lead to health risks like hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis, potentially requiring medical intervention.

Most recently, Medtronic has received 170 reports of hyperglycemia > 400mg/dL and 11 reports of diabetic ketoacidosis from January 2023 to September 2024 in the US potentially related to this issue. The FDA has classified this action as a class I recall. Medtronic issued an updated notification to customers stating the following:

- Even a single drop of the pump could result in reduced battery life, either immediately after the drop, or over time, and the issue will continue even after replacing the battery.
- The pump will still generate battery alerts and alarms, but these alerts and alarms may not be delivered with the usual amount of battery life remaining before the battery must be replaced to avoid the pump stopping insulin delivery. Be prepared to replace the battery as soon as the "Low Battery Pump" alarm sounds.

"Medtronic began proactively notifying impacted pump users in July because of the high priority we place on patient safety and understand the important role of pumps in the care and management of diabetes, " said Robert Vigersky, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Medtronic Diabetes. "Our team is here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to help if you experience battery depletion or any other issue with your pump. Patient safety is our priority, as is continuity of therapy, which is why we made the decision to voluntarily notify patients and will replace pumps when needed".

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to evaluation of patients on SGLT-2 inhibitors, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to assess urine and/or serum ketones to diagnose euglycemic DKA in symptomatic patients taking SGLT-2 inhibitors inhibitors when glucose values are normal.

### Approach to the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^114nZHFC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a common cause of severe metabolic acidosis, remains a life-threatening condition due to complications of both the disease and its treatment. This Acid-Base and Electrolyte Teaching Case discusses DKA management, emphasizing complications of treatment. Because cerebral edema is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity, especially in children with DKA, we emphasize its pathophysiology and implications for therapy. The risk for cerebral edema may be minimized by avoiding a bolus of insulin, excessive saline resuscitation, and a decrease in effective plasma osmolality early in treatment. A goal of fluid therapy is to lower muscle venous Pco 2 to ensure effective removal of hydrogen ions by bicarbonate buffer in muscle and diminish the binding of hydrogen ions to intracellular proteins in vital organs (such as the brain). In patients with DKA and a relatively low plasma potassium level, insulin administration may cause hypokalemia and cardiac arrhythmias. It is suggested in these cases to temporarily delay insulin administration and first administer potassium chloride intravenously to bring the plasma potassium level close to 4mmol/L. Sodium bicarbonate administration in adult patients should be individualized. We suggest it be considered in a subset of patients with moderately severe acidemia (pH < 7.20 and plasma bicarbonate level < 12mmol/L) who are at risk for worsening acidemia, particularly if hemodynamically unstable. Sodium bicarbonate should not be administered to children with DKA, except if acidemia is very severe and hemodynamic instability is refractory to saline administration.

### Gaps in our knowledge of managing inpatient dysglycaemia and diabetes in non-critically ill adults: a call for further research [^115ApD4n]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

2 TYPE 1 VS TYPE 2 DIABETES

Much of the data on harm in people with diabetes makes no differentiation between those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Part of the reason for this is the difficulty with coding, and how many people are unable to differentiate between those with type 1 or insulin‐treated type 2 diabetes. An exception to this is the data from the UK National Inpatient Diabetes Audit. This is because these data were collected by members of the diabetes team, often at the bedside of the person with diabetes. There are several trials based around critical illness or peri‐operative care that have been funded by the American Diabetes Association or the UK National Institute for Health Research looking at interventions in those with or expected to have, critical illness. To our knowledge, however, there are no interventional trials funded for non‐critical illness.

Type 1 diabetes often requires a different approach to treatment to type 2 diabetes. In particular, the requirement is to ensure that insulin treatment is always given, regardless of the clinical state of the individual. The risk of hypoglycaemia or the development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) must be regularly assessed. There are very few data to show differences in outcomes between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but there are no randomised controlled trial data looking exclusively at those with type 1 diabetes — a major deficiency in our opinion. One study from 2012 of over 8725 people with type 1 diabetes compared outcomes with over 57,000 people with type 2 diabetes. They showed that all forms of harm were worse in those with type 1 diabetes, leading to increased length of stay and subsequent costs. To date, there have also been no prospective randomised controlled trials to determine the best treatment protocols, e.g. the use of insulin pumps, or closed loops. Thus, there remain many uncertainties on how best to manage people with type 1 who are in the hospital.

DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS RISK IN T1D MECHANISMS: PREVALENCE AND IMPLICATIONS

SGLT2 and dual SGLT1 and 2 inhibitors are associated with several side effects. Most of the adverse reactions relate to their mode of action and are seen across the class. SGLT2 inhibitors induce glucosuria that makes the urine an attractive culture medium for bacteria, resulting in a slight increase in genitourinary infections. Most commonly observed infections are fungal infections of the genital skin (5–10% of treated women). However, for people with T1D, the most critical potential adverse effect concerns euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). SGLT2 inhibitors increase ketonaemia, also in people with T2D. This is caused by reductions in plasma insulin concentrations or a reduction in insulin dosage and concomitant increments in glucagon concentrations. While ketone bodies have been hypothesized to explain beneficial cardiorenal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, in people with T1D they increase the risk for acidosis. Due to apparent normoglycaemia secondary to increased glucosuria, misdiagnosis of euglycaemic DKA continues to be a concern that could lead to delayed management. Risk factors for DKA in people with T1D have been identified and include large reductions in basal insulin therapy, insulin pump failure, reduced carbohydrate intake, use of alcohol, acute illness, vomiting and volume depletion/dehydration. The percentage of DKA in the conducted trials in people with T1D was reported as 3.5% (4076 individuals treated with dual SGLT1 and 2 inhibitors) versus 0.6% (among 2362 placebo-treated individuals), which yields a 5.8-fold relative risk increase. As these numbers are derived from trials with motivated patients and expert physicians using careful surveillance and monitoring of ketonaemia (illustrated by very low DKA events in the placebo groups), it is plausible that the relative risk may be higher in clinical practice. An exception to these data concerns the novel low dose of EMPA (2.5 mg; currently not available), which demonstrated no increase in DKA rates, albeit at the expense of attenuated glucose-lowering actions. It should be mentioned that this low dose of EMPA is not yet available for clinical use.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1135r4eb]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to potassium replacement, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to establish adequate renal function (urine output ~0.5 mL/kg/h) and monitor serum potassium levels for potassium replacement:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L|- 10–20 mmol/L/h until serum potassium > 3.5 mmol/L (faster potassium replacement will require central venous access)|
|Serum potassium 3.5–5.0 mmol/L|- Administer 10–20 mmol/L potassium in each liter of IV fluid as needed to keep serum potassium at 4–5 mmol/L|
|Serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L|- Start insulin, but do not administer potassium < br > - Assess serum potassium every 2 hours.|

Special Situations

Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Diabetic ketoacidosis

One study reported that a large number of patients with COVID-19 developed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) or a combination of both. It has also been found that COVID-19 may mask the symptoms of DKA. In a study of 64 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who tested positive for COVID-19 or COVID-19-like disease, a significant proportion had hyperglycaemia (n = 32, 50%) or DKA (n = 19, 30%). These results strongly suggest that all patients with COVID-19 should be screened for hyperglycaemia and that blood or urine ketone testing should be considered in patients with a blood glucose value > 250 mg/dl (13.9 mmol/L).

For patients with T1DM who are already on a basal-bolus insulin regimen, the same regimen can be continued, with dose titration performed according to the results of blood glucose monitoring. However, in cases where ketosis or ketoacidosis is present, intravenous insulin infusion should be the initial preferred strategy. On the other hand, in the current scenario of COVID-19, switching patients on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or insulin pump to the basal-bolus insulin regimen should be strongly considered — unless expert guidance is available to manage the former.

Use of Glucocorticoids

Selected patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 may require glucocorticoids, usually administered as intravenous methylprednisolone 0.5–1.0 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. The use of glucocorticoids may worsen hyperglycaemia and necessitate adjustments in insulin therapy. A detailed discussion of the management of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia is beyond the scope of this article and the reader is directed to excellent reviews on this topic.

Acute Kidney Injury

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported as a complication of severe COVID-19. In a multi-hospital study involving > 5400 patients admitted with COVID-19, AKI developed in 36.6% patients, of whom 14.3% required dialysis. The development of renal dysfunction is associated with a reduced clearance of insulin and hence necessitates a reduction in the dose of exogenous insulin to prevent hypoglycaemia. In addition, the requirement of insulin may vary on pre- and post-dialysis days. Initiation of dialysis is associated with an improvement in peripheral insulin resistance and hence the dose requirement may decrease further following dialysis.

CSII During Hyperglycemic Emergencies

In people with diabetic ketoacidosis, the altered tissue perfusion may affect insulin absorption, making CSII unreliable, thus, CSII should be temporarily discontinued and switched to an IV insulin infusion as per local protocol. The person may be transitioned back to CSII after resolution of DKA, when they are clinically stable and when the acid-base disorder is corrected.

It is essential that all people on CSII admitted with DKA should have their equipment checked and in particular their infusion sets changed as well as their pump skills reviewed by the diabetes teams as failure of the former and/or issues with the latter may have precipitated the DKA episode. CSII should not be restarted until reasons for the hyperglycemic emergency have been determined and it is clear the individual knows what they are doing.

It is critical that hospital staff are familiar with departmental guidelines pertaining to CSII use. People using CSII do NOT usually take any long-acting insulin, so if there is any interruption to insulin delivery (eg, if the cannula is blocked or dislodged), hyperglycemia and then ketoacidosis can develop very quickly (see the "Discontinuing/Restarting CSII" section).

CSII and Radiology Investigations

The pump should be suspended and removed prior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, and not be taken into the scanning room. Pump manufacturers also advise removing the pump prior to computed tomography (CT) scan, however, some guidelines suggest that the pump may be covered by a lead apron. For positron emission tomography (PET) scans, the pump needs to be off for at least 1 hour prior to the study (no bolus insulin < 4 hours prior).

For plain X-rays, there is no need to remove the pump, unless its position obscures the area of interest. The pump should be reconnected immediately after any radiological investigation.

Pumps can be safely suspended/removed for up to an hour at a time without needing alternative insulin. A correction bolus may be needed on reconnecting the pump.

Diabetes management changes as a result of hospitalization with DKA

All participants were reviewed by the multidisciplinary diabetes team during hospitalization. When there was both a clear precipitating factor (infection in many cases, but a faulty insulin pump in one and accidental omission of insulin treatment by nursing home staff in another) and the admission HbA1c indicated acceptable prior glycemic control, diabetes treatment regimens were not altered, but relevant information including that relating to sick day management was provided before discharge. Adherence was emphasized in those in which this was considered to be a contributing factor, and insulin regimens were intensified in those whose HbA1c was above an appropriate target. This included participants with type 2 diabetes, all of whom were insulin-treated at the time of their first and subsequent DKA episodes.

Figure 14.1 — Management of new-onset diabetes in youth with overweight or obesity with clinical suspicion of type 2 diabetes begins by "initiate lifestyle management and diabetes education", then branches by A1C and acidosis/ketosis status. For A1C < 8.5% with no acidosis or ketosis, metformin is used and titrated up to 2,000 mg per day as tolerated. For A1C ≥ 8.5% with no acidosis with or without ketosis, metformin is used and long-acting insulin is started at 0.5 units/kg/day and titrated every 2–3 days based on blood glucose monitoring (BGM). For acidosis and/or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and/or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), manage DKA or HHS and give intravenous insulin until acidosis resolves, then subcutaneous, as for type 1 diabetes until results of antibody testing are known. After pancreatic autoantibody testing, if negative continue or start metformin and, if on insulin, titrate guided by glucose values; if positive continue or initiate multiple daily injections (MDI) insulin or pump therapy, as for type 1 diabetes, and discontinue metformin. If A1C goals are not met, continue metformin and consider adding a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor approved for youth with type 2 diabetes; if on insulin therapy, consider prioritizing and maximizing noninsulin medications to minimize weight gain before escalating insulin doses, and titrate or split insulin; if using long-acting insulin only and glycemic goals are not met with escalating doses, add prandial insulin; total daily insulin dose may exceed 1 unit/kg/day. A1C 8.5% = 69 mmol/mol.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to modify replacement fluids once the plasma glucose concentration is < 250 mg/dL (< 13.9 mmol/L) to contain 5–10% dextrose in addition to the 0.9% sodium chloride to prevent hypoglycemia and allow continued insulin administration until the ketonemia is corrected, as plasma glucose concentrations usually decrease before the resolution of ketoacidosis (usually within 4–8 hours).

### Causes of diabetic ketoacidosis among adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: insulin pump users and non-users [^114vpsuX]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Previous studies focused on describing DKA trends in children; however, about 80% of patients with DKA are adults. In this study, we aimed to identify factors contributing to DKA in adult insulin pump users that may help future preventive measures.

Among the 43 adults enrolled in our study with DKA, 20 (46.5%) were using an insulin pump device at admission. A Medtronic pump device was used by more than half of the participants (70%). Of these, 75% were female, Caucasian race, median age 27.0 years (22.0–43.5), duration of T1DM for more than 10 years (80%), and with poor underlying glycemic control. Compared with the population characteristics described in the updated US Type 1 Diabetes Exchange Clinic Registry from 2016 to 2018, our population shared similar baseline characteristics. Based on the registry data, the population between 26 and 49 years old were mostly females (50%), non-Hispanic whites (89%), and with T1DM duration of 27.7 years ± 10.1. Insulin pump device was present in 64% of this subgroup and a Medtronic pump device was mostly used (53%).

In our study, CSII users had a lower DKA frequency compared with MDII users, which is supported by previous studies where treatment with CSII is associated with a low incidence of DKA. Based on our data, pump/tubing-related problems were the most important reason for insulin pump users for DKA development. Similar data were found in a Danish survey where kinking of the tubing and/or leakage of insulin at the infusion site was the most likely contributor to DKA development. This is in contrast to the results described by Hanas et al, which found that the most common causes of DKA in patients using CSII were missed insulin doses (48.6%), followed by gastroenteritis (14.1%) and technical pump problems (12.7%).

### Healthcare resource utilization and costs associated with ketosis events in pediatric and adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus in the UK [^1153G14A]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia with ketosis are the two most common acute complications in established type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). However, while self-management of hypoglycemia is well documented in the literature, there is little information available regarding the management of ketosis events.

Defined as the presence of elevated ketone bodies in the blood, and arising during periods of insulin deficiency and increased concentrations of counter-regulatory hormones, ketosis is often asymptomatic, but at high levels patients may experience nausea or abdominal pain. Common causes of ketosis include infection, gastrointestinal illness, insulin omission, and exercise, and its incidence may be increased in insulin pump users.

It is generally recommended that compensatory actions should be taken when blood ketone levels are greater than 0.6 mmol/L. Unidentified and untreated, high ketone levels cause the body to enter diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is defined as a state of metabolic acidosis, ketosis, and hyperglycemia. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common and significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in people with T1DM and is associated with high hospitalization and healthcare resource costs. In 2015, over 7000 patients were hospitalized for DKA in the UK, at a cost to the National Health Service (NHS) of almost £10,000,000.

Patients should be taught to identify and initiate treatment of ketosis to prevent progression to DKA. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advises ketone monitoring with blood ketone strips for children, and urine or blood ketone strips for adults in the sick-day rules for T1DM. Where raised ketones are identified, patients are instructed to adjust their insulin dose and increase their liquid intake. While NICE does not provide guidelines on insulin dose adjustments, the British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes advises the administration of 10% of a patient's daily dose where ketone levels are 0.6–1.5 mmol/L, or 20% where levels are greater than 1.5 mmol/L. At ketone levels above 3.0 mmol/L, patients should seek medical assistance. However, a preliminary literature review identified no publications reporting actual healthcare resource use during and following ketosis events, or the associated costs.

This study aimed to quantify the cost of healthcare resource utilization in the UK attributable to ketosis events in adults and children with T1DM.

### Causes of diabetic ketoacidosis among adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: insulin pump users and non-users [^1171MCeF]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Insulin pumps are increasingly being used as a method of insulin delivery in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of T1DM. This study aims to identify the causes of DKA in patients with T1DM on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and to compare these with patients with T1DM on multiple daily insulin injections (MDIIs).

Research Design and Methods

This is a prospective observational study between January and June 2019 at the Cleveland Clinic Fairview Hospital. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were obtained from chart review. A questionnaire to explore additional clinical data relating to DKA was administered, with additional items for patients on the insulin pump.

Results

Seventy-four patients were admitted with a diagnosis of DKA between the period of January and June 2019. Of these, 45 met the inclusion criteria and 43 consented. These were divided into two groups: group 1 included patients on MDII and group 2 included CSII. Overall, the most common precipitating factor for developing DKA was insulin non-adherence, seen in 51.2% of the cases. The most common cause of DKA in group 2 was pump/tubing related to 55% of the cases.

Conclusion

Despite non-adherence being common in both CSII and MDII, a combination of social factors, education and insulin pump malfunction, such as pump/tubing problems, might be playing a pivotal role in DKA etiology in young adults with T1DM, especially in CSII users. Continued education on pump use may reduce the rate of DKA in pump users.

### Sotagliflozin, the first dual SGLT inhibitor: current outlook and perspectives [^112TxmzB]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

A recently published meta-analysis of the three hallmark CV outcome trials (EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS, DECLARE TIMI-58) has documented, despite the unquestionable benefits on reducing hospitalisation for heart failure and progression of renal disease, a two-fold increase in the risk of DKA with the use of this drug class. However, expecially in type 1 diabetes, instead of considering SGLT inhibitors as responsible for the increase in DKA episodes, patients treated with SGLTis should be considered as more vulnerable to DKA episodes. Indeed, ketoacidosis per se represents a known risk in type 1 diabetes. A recent systematic review of the literature, found a 5 to 10% overall prevalence of ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetic adult patients, comparable to the incidence of DKA observed in the SGLT inhibitor trials. Monitoring for ketosis, discontinuation of SGLTis before surgical procedures, and caution during stressful situations could be sufficient to mitigate the risk of DKA during SGLTi treatment, especially for patients on insulin pump therapy, in which a malfunction of the infusion set may increase the risk of DKA. With proper education, these episodes are probably entirely avoidable. And the benefits obtained with SGLTi treatment certainly outweigh the risks, especially if the latter are well understood and managed by both physicians and patients. Further, by delaying glucose absorption, sotagliflozin may reduce the need for ultra-fast insulin in type 1 diabetes.
