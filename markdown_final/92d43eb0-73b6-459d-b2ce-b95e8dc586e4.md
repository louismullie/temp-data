## Question

How to overcome nitrate tolerance in acs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to overcome nitrate tolerance in acute coronary syndromes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining nitrate tolerance and its mechanism in the ACS context. Then, I should verify the clinical implications of tolerance for acute care. Next, I will review guideline-based acute management and where tolerance fits in. After that, I need to examine evidence-based strategies to prevent or reverse tolerance, including nitrate-free intervals, alternative NO donors, and adjuncts. Finally, I should consider special populations, monitoring, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking safety interactions and contraindications before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the definition and mechanism of nitrate tolerance so I don't jump to conclusions. Nitrate tolerance is the loss of hemodynamic and antianginal efficacy with continuous exposure to organic nitrates, typically emerging within 24 hours of uninterrupted therapy, and it is mechanistically linked to increased oxidative stress, impaired bioactivation via mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibition, and neurohormonal counter-regulation, which together blunt NO-mediated vasodilation and can worsen endothelial function over time [^1121rh1Z] [^114EeQo2] [^115GphYs].

> Hold on, I should verify the clinical implications in ACS because tolerance changes acute management. In ACS, continuous IV nitroglycerin can lose effectiveness after about 24 hours due to tachyphylaxis, so relying on escalating doses alone is ineffective; guidelines emphasize that persistent ischemic pain unresponsive to nitrates should prompt urgent coronary revascularization rather than futile dose escalation, and they caution about hypotension, especially in the elderly, which can complicate ACS care [^111oFs3f] [^112VwZwq] [^114hA6b8].

> Next, I should review acute-phase management and where tolerance fits. Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.3–0.4 mg every 5 minutes up to 3 doses is first-line for chest pain, then IV nitroglycerin at 10 μg/min titrated to pain and hemodynamics if ischemia persists, with strict avoidance in suspected right ventricular infarction, SBP less than 90 mmHg, or a drop in SBP greater than 30 mmHg from baseline. Importantly, tachyphylaxis after about 24 hours is anticipated, so I need to ensure we do not simply escalate indefinitely without addressing tolerance physiology [^111oFs3f] [^113PUmRb].

> Wait, let me verify the core principle for preventing and reversing tolerance. The cornerstone is instituting a nitrate-free interval of roughly 10–12 hours daily for long-acting formulations to restore antianginal efficacy. Attempts to override tolerance by increasing dose have consistently failed, and only after several hours off therapy does responsiveness return, which is why intermittent dosing is foundational rather than optional [^114g2cV6] [^1121rh1Z] [^112zGG64].

> I will now examine practical strategies to implement nitrate-free intervals in the ACS setting. For patients requiring continuous IV nitroglycerin beyond 24 hours, I should consider a planned 10–12 hour washout period if clinically safe, using alternative antianginals during the interval. For oral regimens, daytime ISMN with a nighttime nitrate-free window or vice versa can maintain efficacy while minimizing tolerance, and I should double-check that the chosen schedule aligns with symptom patterns and hemodynamics [^114g2cV6] [^1125eAVH].

> But wait, what if continuous NO delivery is still needed. Let me consider inorganic nitrate as a tolerance-sparing pathway. Inorganic nitrate is reduced to nitrite and then NO via a noncanonical pathway that does not induce tachyphylaxis, and in the NITRATE-CIN ACS trial, potassium nitrate reduced contrast-induced nephropathy without evidence of tolerance, suggesting a mechanistically distinct and durable NO source; however, prior organic nitrate exposure may blunt benefit, so I should confirm timing and consider switching strategies rather than layering indefinitely [^113zC6TR] [^115ZLfMY] [^114juGcm].

> Next, I should review adjunctive therapies that mitigate tolerance biology. ACE inhibitors and hydralazine can attenuate nitrate tolerance by reducing oxidative stress and neurohormonal activation. In heart failure populations, hydralazine–nitrate combinations have long-standing supportive data, and pairing an ACE inhibitor with intermittent nitrates is a reasonable, evidence-aligned approach when feasible in ACS patients with ongoing ischemia or heart failure physiology [^111MSaw2] [^116Tf3gH].

> Hold on, I should verify whether alternative antianginals can substitute during nitrate-free intervals. Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ranolazine are guideline-endorsed options to control ischemia when nitrates are ineffective or contraindicated; ranolazine reduced angina frequency and nitroglycerin use in chronic angina trials and is mechanistically complementary, though it did not improve outcomes in ACS, so I should frame it as symptom control rather than prognostic therapy in the acute phase [^113fwhca] [^115gq4xR] [^114TLBJp].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and scenarios. In vasospastic angina, nitrates remain first-line with calcium channel blockers, but tolerance can emerge; if refractory, I should confirm the diagnosis with provocative testing and consider nicorandil or other vasodilators, while still applying nitrate-free intervals to preserve efficacy. In elderly ACS patients, hypotension with nitrates is more common, so I should titrate cautiously and prioritize revascularization for refractory ischemia rather than escalating to unsafe nitrate doses [^112eWGLH] [^111aMDBp] [^114hA6b8].

> Let me think about monitoring and safety interactions so I don't overlook critical contraindications. I should confirm blood pressure and heart rate frequently during IV nitroglycerin titration, watch for headache and tolerance, and avoid coadministration with PDE5 inhibitors within 24–48 hours depending on the agent to prevent profound hypotension; if a patient on a PDE5 inhibitor presents with ACS, I must withhold nitrates until the appropriate interval has elapsed and use alternative analgesics and anti-ischemics in the meantime [^111oFs3f] [^114Za4J5] [^1136cBSj].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought dose escalation might restore effect in true tolerance, but I should correct that assumption. Multiple FDA labels and clinical studies show that escalating organic nitrate doses does not overcome tolerance. Only a drug-free interval restores responsiveness, so my plan must pivot to scheduled washouts and mechanistically distinct NO delivery rather than ever-higher nitrate rates [^1121rh1Z] [^112zGG64] [^114WD6xZ].

> Next, I should review a practical algorithm and make sure it aligns with guidelines. Start with sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain, escalate to IV nitroglycerin if ischemia persists, reassess at 24 hours for tachyphylaxis, and if continuous therapy is still needed, implement a planned 10–12 hour nitrate-free interval with beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker, or ranolazine coverage, consider switching to inorganic nitrate where appropriate, and expedite coronary angiography and revascularization for refractory ischemia rather than persisting with futile nitrate escalation [^111oFs3f] [^114g2cV6] [^113zC6TR].

> Finally, I should confirm discharge and longitudinal planning. On discharge, provide sublingual nitroglycerin with clear instructions to limit frequency to avoid excessive use and tolerance, reinforce the nitrate-free interval concept for any long-acting regimens, and coordinate antianginal combinations to maintain symptom control while minimizing tolerance risk during follow-up [^115ZTHvq] [^114g2cV6].

---

Nitrate tolerance in ACS is best managed by **intermittent dosing** with a 10–12 hour nitrate-free interval [^117GRfLQ] to restore efficacy [^112zGG64] and prevent tachyphylaxis [^117GRfLQ]. If continuous therapy is needed, **rotate agents** (e.g. switch to CCBs, beta-blockers, or ranolazine) [^113fwhca] and use the lowest effective nitrate dose [^116k5XHg]. Avoid dose escalation, as it worsens tolerance and side effects [^1121rh1Z]. Consider inorganic nitrate [^113zC6TR] or nitric oxide donors if available, and always address underlying ischemia with revascularization [^112VwZwq] and guideline-directed medical therapy [^114umR5N].

---

## Clinical significance of nitrate tolerance in ACS

Nitrate tolerance **reduces anti-ischemic efficacy** [^1121rh1Z], leading to persistent chest pain, higher myocardial oxygen demand, and worse outcomes [^1121VEzK]. It also causes rebound vasoconstriction and endothelial dysfunction [^114EeQo2], increasing ischemic risk [^117GRfLQ].

---

## Mechanisms underlying nitrate tolerance

Key mechanisms include **oxidative stress** — with increased ROS reducing NO bioavailability and causing tolerance [^114EeQo2] — and impaired bioactivation, as nitrate tolerance inhibits mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, limiting nitrate conversion to NO [^114EeQo2]. Neurohormonal activation with upregulation of vasoconstrictors (e.g. endothelin-1, angiotensin II) also contributes [^114EeQo2].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **intermittent dosing** with a 10–12 hour nitrate-free interval [^114g2cV6] to prevent tolerance [^112zGG64]. They also advise using the lowest effective dose and avoiding continuous high-dose regimens [^1121rh1Z] [^116k5XHg]. If tolerance develops, switch to alternative antianginals (CCBs, beta-blockers, ranolazine) [^notfound].

---

## Practical strategies to overcome nitrate tolerance

### Intermittent dosing and nitrate-free intervals

- **Schedule**: Use a 10–12 hour nitrate-free interval [^117GRfLQ] (e.g. daytime dosing with a nighttime interval) [^1162d81N].
- **Rationale**: Restores anti-ischemic efficacy and prevents tachyphylaxis [^117GRfLQ].
- **Evidence**: FDA labeling and ESC guidelines support this approach [^114g2cV6] [^112zGG64].

---

### Dose optimization and rotation strategies

- **Lowest effective dose**: Avoid dose escalation; it worsens tolerance and side effects [^116k5XHg].
- **Agent rotation**: Switch to CCBs, beta-blockers, or ranolazine if tolerance develops [^113fwhca] [^116dTCon].
- **Evidence**: Guidelines endorse alternative antianginals for refractory symptoms [^113fwhca].

---

### Adjunctive therapies and novel agents

- **Antioxidants**: Hydralazine, ACE inhibitors, or NAC may reduce oxidative stress and mitigate tolerance [^114EeQo2] [^116Tf3gH].
- **Inorganic nitrates**: Sodium/potassium nitrate bypasses tolerance mechanisms and may be beneficial [^113zC6TR] [^114juGcm].
- **NO donors**: Novel agents (e.g. MK-8150) are under study to avoid tolerance [^114dtP2v].

---

### Addressing underlying ischemia

Revascularization with **PCI or CABG** reduces nitrate need and tolerance risk [^notfound]. Guideline-directed medical therapy with beta-blockers, statins, and antiplatelets addresses the underlying disease [^115Li6ow].

---

## Clinical outcomes and implications

Overcoming nitrate tolerance improves symptom control, reduces ischemic burden, and may improve outcomes. Persistent tolerance is linked to **worse symptoms, higher ischemic risk, and adverse events** [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Strategy** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Intermittent dosing | 10–12 hour nitrate-free interval | High |
| Dose optimization | Use lowest effective dose | High |
| Agent rotation | Switch to CCBs, beta-blockers, ranolazine | High |
| Adjunctive therapies | Consider antioxidants, inorganic nitrates | Moderate |
| Address ischemia | Revascularization, GDMT | High |

---

Nitrate tolerance in ACS is best managed by **intermittent dosing**, dose optimization, and agent rotation, with adjunctive therapies and definitive ischemia management to restore efficacy and improve outcomes.

Epicardial spasm (vasospastic angina)

The poor nitrate response or tolerance seen in MVA contrasts with patients with vasospastic angina, in whom nitrates are a cornerstone of therapy and BB are relatively contraindicated. Dual pathologies (VSA with underlying microvascular disease) is increasingly recognised. A diagnosis of VSA facilitates treatment using non-dihydropiridine calcium antagonists (eg, diltiazem-controlled release up to 500 mg daily). Overall, CCB are effective in treating over 90% of patients. High doses of calcium antagonists (non-dihydropiridine and dihydropyridine) may be required either alone or in combination. Unfortunately, ankle swelling, constipation and other side effects may render some patients intolerant. In these cases, long-term nitrates may be used with good efficacy in this group. In about 10% of cases, coronary artery spasm may be refractory to optimal vasodilator therapy. Japanese VSA registry data shows nitrates were not associated with MACE reduction in VSA, and importantly when added to Nicorandil were potentially associated with higher rates of adverse cardiac events. Alpha blockers (eg, clonidine) may be helpful in selected patients with persistent vasospasm. In patients with poor nitrate tolerance the K+-channel opener nicorandil (5–10 mg two times a day) can be tried. Consider secondary causes in refractory VSA (eg, coronary vasculitis) and in selected patients with ACS presentations, coronary angioplasty may be considered as a bailout option.

### Stable angina and acute coronary syndromes are associated with nitric oxide resistance in platelets [^113N3zU2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

The study examined possible clinical determinants of platelet resistance to nitric oxide (NO) donors in patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP) and acute coronary syndromes (ACS), relative to nonischemic patients and normal subjects.

Background

We have shown previously that platelets from patients with SAP are resistant to the antiaggregating effects of nitroglycerin (NTG) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP).

Methods

Extent of adenosine diphosphate (1 micromol/liter)-induced platelet aggregation (impedance aggregometry in whole blood) and inhibition of aggregation by NTG (100 micromol/liter) and SNP (10 micromol/liter) were compared in normal subjects (n = 43), nonischemic patients (those with chest pain but no fixed coronary disease, (n = 35) and patients with SAP (n = 82) or ACS (n = 153). Association of NO resistance with coronary risk factors, coronary artery disease (CAD), intensity of angina and current medication was examined by univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results

In patients with SAP and ACS as distinct from nonischemic patients and normal subjects, platelet aggregability was increased (both p < 0.01), and inhibition of aggregation by NTG and SNP was decreased (both p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that NO resistance occurred significantly more frequently with ACS than with SAP (odds ratio [OR] 2.3:1), and was less common among patients treated with perhexiline (OR 0.3:1) or statins (OR 0.45:1). Therapy with other antianginal drugs, extent of CAD, intensity of angina and coronary risk factors were not associated with variability in platelet responsiveness to NO donor.

Conclusions

Patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease, especially ACS, exhibit increased platelet aggregability and decreased platelet responsiveness to the antiaggregatory effects of NO donors. The extent of NO resistance in platelets is not correlated with coronary risk factors. Pharmacotherapy with perhexiline and/or statins may improve platelet responsiveness to NO.

### Nonantithrombotic medical options in acute coronary syndromes: old agents and new lines on the horizon [^1167LcFM]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) constitute a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to ST-segment myocardial infarction. Myocardial ischemia in this context occurs as a result of an abrupt decrease in coronary blood flow and resultant imbalance in the myocardial oxygen supply-demand relationship. Coronary blood flow is further compromised by other mechanisms that increase coronary vascular resistance or reduce coronary driving pressure. The goals of treatment are to decrease myocardial oxygen demand, increase coronary blood flow and oxygen supply, and limit myocardial injury. Treatments are generally divided into disease-modifying agents or interventions that improve hard clinical outcomes and other strategies that can reduce ischemia. In addition to traditional drugs such as β-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, newer agents have expanded the number of molecular pathways targeted for treatment of ACS. Ranolazine, trimetazidine, nicorandil, and ivabradine are medications that have been shown to reduce myocardial ischemia through diverse mechanisms and have been tested in limited fashion in patients with ACS. Attenuating the no-reflow phenomenon and reducing the injury compounded by acute reperfusion after a period of coronary occlusion are active areas of research. Additionally, interventions aimed at ischemic pre- and postconditioning may be useful means by which to limit myocardial infarct size. Trials are also underway to examine altered metabolic and oxygen-related pathways in ACS. This review will discuss traditional and newer anti-ischemic therapies for patients with ACS, exclusive of revascularization, antithrombotic agents, and the use of high-intensity statins.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — supportive evidence for high-intensity statins: High-intensity statin regimens lower LDL-C concentration by an average of ≥ 50%, and compared with moderate-intensity statins they reduce major vascular events by approximately 15% in patients with coronary artery disease; the benefit of a high-intensity statin regimen appears early after ACS and persists over time, and no indication was observed of any safety concerns from achieving very low LDL-C concentrations on statins or other lipid-lowering therapies; therefore, high-intensity statin therapy should not be de-escalated during follow-up in patients who are tolerating treatment.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to post-revascularization care (sexual health), ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to do not use PDE5 inhibitors concomitantly with nitrate medications because of the risk of severe hypotension.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to antianginal therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate antianginal therapy with either a β-blocker, CCB, or long-acting nitrate to relieve angina or equivalent symptoms in patients with chronic coronary disease and angina. Add a second antianginal agent from a different therapeutic class (β-blockers, CCBs, long-acting nitrates) if remaining symptomatic after initial treatment.

### Clinical features and prognosis of patients with coronary spasm-induced non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome [^1125ovn1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Disruption of the coronary atherosclerotic plaque complicated by thrombosis is the most common pathophysiological mechanism of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Coronary artery spasm is also considered an important etiologic factor in the pathogenesis of ACS. – In fact, it is not uncommon in the clinical setting to find no significant coronary artery disease in ACS patients who undergo urgent coronary angiography. Although the etiologic mechanisms of ACS in patients lacking obstructive coronary artery disease remain obscure, coronary spasm seems to be the main etiomechanism of nonobstructive ACS. Currently, there is little information on the prevalence and clinical features of coronary spasm in patients with ACS. A recent study reported that one fourth of whites with ACS had no culprit coronary lesion and ~50% of the ACS patients without culprit lesions develop coronary spasm in response to intracoronary administration of acetylcholine (ACh), supporting the hypothesis that coronary spasm is an important cause of ACS.

ACS includes a spectrum of clinical presentations and is classified into ST‐segment elevation ACS (STE‐ACS) and non–ST‐segment elevation ACS (NSTE‐ACS), based on ECG findings. The therapeutic approaches vary considerably between these 2 presentations. Immediate reperfusion therapy is the established treatment for STE‐ACS, while NSTE‐ACS requires initial medical stabilization and early invasive therapy based on risk stratification. – Unlike the invasive percutaneous coronary intervention or intensive medical treatment for complicated coronary atherosclerotic plaques and thrombosis, coronary spasm can be suppressed effectively with calcium channel blockers or nitrates. Therefore, an accurate understanding of the pathological condition in NSTE‐ACS patients is required to provide better medical treatments.

Previous studies described the presence of racial differences in the frequency of coronary spasm, which is more frequent in Japanese subjects than in white subjects. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence, clinical features, and long‐term outcome of NSTE‐ACS associated with coronary spasm in a large Japanese study population.

### Inorganic nitrate benefits contrast-induced nephropathy after coronary angiography for acute coronary syndromes: the NITRATE-CIN trial [^115ZLfMY]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The protective effect of inorganic nitrate against CIN evidenced herein is supported by studies suggesting renoprotective effects of inorganic nitrate or nitrite in pre-clinical studies. Reduction of nitrite to NO following topicaladministration of sodium nitrite (30 nmol) protected rats against kidney ischaemia/reperfusion-induced injury in vivo, an observation supported by similar studies in miceand mimicked with dietary inorganic treatment. Additionally, the protection mechanistically related to NO delivery is supported by clinical data demonstrating some benefits with the direct NO donor isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) against CIN. In a study of 394 patients, ISDN administration together with hydration reduced CIN rates, in patients with heart failureas also did administration of organic nitrate in a small study of 199 patients specifically undergoing angioplasty, demonstrating that only 15.2% developed kidney impairment with organic nitrate treatment compared to 29.9% in those who did not. Further larger studies have yet to be performed to confirm the observations but a key issue limiting the therapeutic potential of organic nitrates is that continuous/repeated administration is of limited benefit due to the development of tolerance. This issue is not a limiting factor with inorganic nitrate, since there is no evidence of tolerance with either inorganic nitrite or nitrate treatment. Further support for benefits against CIN, of NO delivery in the ACS setting, comes from a trial showing that inhaled NO reduced the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury and improved long-term kidney outcomes after cardiopulmonary bypass. Whilst these data support the concept of CIN reduction and improved outcomes with NO supplementation, the major cost and logistical issues associated with inhaled NO therapy, however, reduce enthusiasm for such an approach. In contrast, treatment with a nitrate salt such as KNO₃ is simple-to-administer and likely substantially superior as a cost-effective approach to CIN reduction.

Interestingly, in NITRATE-CIN prior use of an organic nitrate appeared to eliminate the positive effects of inorganic nitrate. One could speculate that the exposure to organic nitrate had already recovered NO levels and thus no further benefit was achievable. However, only 72 patients in total received organic nitrate before angiography indicating that there was likely insufficient power for this analysis. It is also worth noting that despite the lack of statistical significance there was a trend for less CIN with inorganic nitrate treatment. Further study powered to detect differences is needed to better assess the impact of organic nitrate on the efficacy of inorganic nitrate.

### More answers to the still unresolved question of nitrate tolerance [^115GphYs]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Organic nitrates are traditionally felt to be a safe adjuvant in the chronic therapy of patients with coronary artery disease. Despite their long use, progress in the understanding of the pharmacology and mechanism of action of these drugs has been achieved only in the last two decades, with the identification of the role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of nitrate tolerance, with, the discovery of the ancillary effects of nitrates, and with the demonstration that nitrate therapy has important chronic side effects that might modify patients' prognosis. These advances are however mostly confined to the molecular level or to studies in healthy volunteers, and the true impact of organic nitrates on clinical outcome remains unknown. Complicating this issue, evidence supports the existence of important differences among the different drugs belonging to the group, and there are reasons to believe that the nitrates should not be treated as a homogeneous class. As well, the understanding of the effects of alternative nitric oxide (NO) donors is currently being developed, and future studies will need to test whether the properties of these new medications may compensate and prevent the abnormalities imposed by chronic nitrate therapy. Intermittent therapy with nitroglycerin and isosorbide mononitrate is now established in clinical practice, but they should neither be considered a definitive solution to the problem of nitrate tolerance. Both these strategies are not deprived of complications, and should currently be seen as a compromise rather than a way fully to exploit the benefits of NO donor therapy.

### Impact of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors on long-term clinical outcomes of patients with coronary artery spasm [^113DqivG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery spasm (CAS) is a well‐known endothelial dysfunction, and a major cause of vasospastic angina (VSA). 1 Obstructive CAS could lead to myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and even sudden cardiac death. 2, 3, 4 Recently, the prevalence of CAS, as documented with the acetylcholine (Ach) provocation test, was reported at a rate of 33.4% to 57.6% in Western countries (consisted mostly of whites), 54.7% for South Korea, and 40% to 79% for Japan in Asian countries. 5, 6, 7

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and nitrates are primary medications in the management of VSA as they are known to be effective in reducing cardiovascular complications. 8 Despite the availability of these treatment options, persistent angina remains a challenging problem. 5, 9 In addition, chronic use of nitrates may lead to problems in tolerance, and even further raise cardiovascular risks. 10, 11 Therefore, renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors such as the angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker may be effective in treating CAS patients since RAS is known to be closely associated with endothelial function, and RAS inhibitors are known to improve endothelial dysfunctions in patients with hypertension. 12, 13 However, the long‐term efficacy of RAS inhibitors on CAS patients is not thoroughly assessed. Thus, we sought to evaluate the impact of RAS inhibitors on long‐term clinical outcomes of CAS patients.

### Isosorbide dinitrate [^114WD6xZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The principal pharmacological action of isosorbide dinitrate is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.

Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were no more effective than placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed.

Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their anti-anginal efficacy been restored.

Regarding medical management for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to nitrates, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to do not administer nitrates in patients recently received a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, especially within 24 hours of sildenafil or vardenafil, or within 48 hours of tadalafil.

Conclusion

Despite an improvement in the management of high‐risk ACS patients during the past decade, they are still undertreated with guideline‐recommended therapies. Nevertheless, the outcome of high‐risk ACS patients has improved significantly in the past decade; therefore, these patients should not be denied these therapies.

Around 2 million people in the UK have angina pectoris and are therefore at high risk of severe coronary events such as myocardial infarction (MI) or sudden death. Conventional management of patients with stable angina includes glyceryl trinitrate, a beta-blocker, aspirin and a statin, with the aim of controlling symptoms and reducing the risk of a coronary event. For patients unable to tolerate a beta-blocker, the choice is less clear but calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates provide effective symptom control. Another option is nicorandil (Ikorel — Rhône-Poulenc Rorer), a potassium channel activator licensed for the "prevention and long term treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris". In our review of nicorandil 8 years ago, we concluded that it provided symptom control that was as good as, but no better than, other less expensive anti-anginal drugs. Since then, new data have suggested that nicorandil might reduce the frequency of coronary events in patients with stable angina. Here, we consider these findings and reassess the place of nicorandil for patients with angina.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — analgesics: Patients presenting with known or suspected ACS often experience chest pain or other uncomfortable symptoms, and rapid and effective pain relief remains an important treatment goal to prevent sympathetic activation and adverse clinical sequelae. Analgesic therapies may provide symptomatic relief, but they have not been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with ACS. Nitrates and opiate medications remain effective treatment options for management of pain in ACS but should be thoughtfully utilized to prevent potential harm, and rapid coronary revascularization should be pursued for patients with ongoing ischemic symptoms that are not relieved with nitrates.

### Intravenous sodium nitrite in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: a randomized controlled trial (NIAMI) [^112XfdS9]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Organic nitrates confer cardioprotection in experimental modelsDirect NO donors (and organic nitrates) appear to exhibit a biphasic dose response as conditioning agents, with lower doses reducing IRI while higher doses are ineffective. However, evidence from clinical studies demonstrating cardioprotection by organic nitrates is limited. Evidence from rodent models suggests that nitrite mediates the majority of its actions by conversion to NO. In experimental models a biphasic dose–response relationship is also observed for the cardioprotective effects of nitrite. It is therefore possible that the prior use of organic nitrates, which apart from NO, also generate nitrite and other NO-related metabolites during tissue biotransformation, may have already induced a degree of cardioprotection, thereby limiting the potential for additional cardioprotection by nitrite. The deleterious effects of high doses of NO donors and nitrite are likely in part mediated via the generation of peroxynitrite, which may itself result in IRI. Furthermore, nitroglycerine causes increased electron leak from complex 1 and complex 11 of the electron transport chain that appears to be involved in the induction of second window preconditioning, but in contrast when nitrite is administered as a periconditioning agent on a background of organic nitrite therapy this could potentially favour peroxynitrite formation. Almost all of our patients had received organic nitrates acutely prior to reperfusion (> 90% of whom had received glyceryl trinitrate), reflecting widespread clinical practice, none was receiving chronic organic nitrate therapy. This could be an important reason for the discrepancy between the preclinical data and these clinical data. Nevertheless, new therapies need to be effective when given to patients receiving standard therapy.

### Discovery and clinical evaluation of MK-8150, A novel nitric oxide donor with a unique mechanism of nitric oxide release [^114dtP2v]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The nitric oxide (NO) donors are a class of vasorelaxant drugs that have been used for over a century in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Commercially available, orally administered organic nitrate NO donors such as nitroglycerin (NTG), isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN), and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) are indicated for the treatment of angina. The general mechanism of action for NO involves stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), subsequent formation of cyclic GMP (cGMP), and consequent activation of protein kinase G, which downstream leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Clinically, this vasorelaxation leads to decreased preload, afterload, blood pressure (BP), and propensity for cardiac vasospasm as well as dilation of large coronary arteries. NO is also known to have anti‐inflammatory and antithrombotic effects, although the clinical relevance of these properties is not well characterized. 1, 2, 3, 4

Despite the critical importance of NO to regulation of cardiovascular physiology, the use of organic nitrate NO donors for the management of chronic cardiovascular disease has been limited, primarily due to the development of tolerance to the clinical and physiological effects of these compounds upon continuous administration. Although long‐term administration of organic nitrates is utilized in selected patients, a nitrate‐free period must be employed to avoid the development of tolerance, a strategy that can lead to fluctuations in BP control and/or increased incidence of symptoms and cardiac ischemic events. 5, 6, 7 The mechanism of tolerance has been thoroughly investigated but remains elusive and highly debated, 8 although metabolism and bioconversion to NO have been shown to play an important role. 9 In addition to inducing tolerance, organic nitrate NO donors also have a notable side effect profile that includes headaches, dizziness, and hypotension. Clinical studies suggest that slower onset of action and reduced peak‐to‐trough ratio of BP effects can help mitigate the severity of such symptoms.

### Nitrates for acute heart failure syndromes [^112fWFgK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Current drug therapy for acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS) consists mainly of diuretics supplemented by vasodilators or inotropes. Nitrates have been used as vasodilators in AHFS for many years and have been shown to improve some aspects of AHFS in some small studies. The aim of this review was to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of nitrate vasodilators in AHFS.

Objectives

To quantify the effect of different nitrate preparations (isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin) and the effect of route of administration of nitrates on clinical outcome, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of nitrates in the management of AHFS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to July week 2 2011) and EMBASE (1980 to week 28 2011). We searched the Current Controlled Trials MetaRegister of Clinical Trials (compiled by Current Science) (July 2011). We checked the reference lists of trials and contacted trial authors. We imposed no language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing nitrates (isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin) with alternative interventions (frusemide and morphine, frusemide alone, hydralazine, prenalterol, intravenous nesiritide and placebo) in the management of AHFS in adults aged 18 and over.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently performed data extraction. Two authors performed trial quality assessment. We used mean difference (MD), odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to measure effect sizes. Two authors independently assessed and rated the methodological quality of each trial using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias.

Main Results

Four studies (634 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Two of the included studies included only patients with AHFS following acute myocardial infarction (AMI); one study excluded patients with overt AMI; and one study included participants with AHFS with and without acute coronary syndromes. Based on a single study, there was no significant difference in the rapidity of symptom relief between intravenous nitroglycerin/N-acetylcysteine and intravenous frusemide/morphine after 30 minutes (fixed-effect MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.05), 60 minutes (fixed-effect MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.25), three hours (fixed-effect MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.67) and 24 hours (fixed-effect MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.31). There is no evidence to support a difference in AHFS patients receiving intravenous nitrate vasodilator therapy or alternative interventions with regard to the following outcome measures: requirement for mechanical ventilation, systolic blood pressure (SBP) change after three hours and 24 hours, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) change after 30, 60 and 90 minutes, heart rate change at 30 minutes, 60 minutes, three hours and 24 hours, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) change after three hours and 18 hours, cardiac output (CO) change at 90 minutes and three hours and progression to myocardial infarction. There is a significantly higher incidence of adverse events after three hours with nitroglycerin compared with placebo (odds ratio 2.29, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.16) based on a single study. There was no consistent evidence to support a difference in AHFS patients receiving intravenous nitrate vasodilator therapy or alternative interventions with regard to the following secondary outcome measures: SBP change after 30 and 60 minutes, heart rate change after 90 minutes, and PAOP change after 90 minutes. None of the included studies reported healthcare costs as an outcome measure. There were no data reported by any of the studies relating to the acceptability of the treatment to the patients (patient satisfaction scores). Overall there was a paucity of relevant quality data in the included studies. Assessment of overall risk of bias in these studies was limited as three of the studies did not give sufficient detail to allow assessment of potential risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

There appears to be no significant difference between nitrate vasodilator therapy and alternative interventions in the treatment of AHFS, with regard to symptom relief and haemodynamic variables. Nitrates may be associated with a lower incidence of adverse effects after three hours compared with placebo. However, there is a lack of data to draw any firm conclusions concerning the use of nitrates in AHFS because current evidence is based on few low-quality studies.

Subgroup Analyses

We performed subgroup analyses according to the intensity of the positive ERGT results and risk stratification. The higher risk of ACS associated with conventional nitrate usage or combination was observed in an intermediate positive ERGT (multivariable‐adjusted HR, 7.28; 95% CI, 1.48–35.77; P = 0.015 for the conventional nitrate group; and HR, 8.16; 95% CI, 1.65–40.30; P = 0.010 for the combination group) and those with a low JCSA risk score (multivariable‐adjusted HR, 5.71; 95% CI, 1.15–28.34; P = 0.033 for the conventional nitrate group; and 1HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 2.24–51.95; P = 0.003 for the combination group). This association was maintained in inverse probability of treatment weighting adjusted analysis. There was no significant difference in the risk of ACS according to vasodilator usage patterns in the subgroup of a definite positive ERGT and an intermediate or high JCSA risk score (Table 6 and Figure 3).

Independent Predictors of Primary End Point and ACS

The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model identified independent predictors of the primary and secondary outcomes (Table S3). Atrial fibrillation or flutter at initial electrocardiography and fixed coronary artery stenosis were independent predictors of both the primary end point and ACS. Dyslipidemia predicted the incidence of ACS only during the 2‐year follow‐up and did not predict the primary end point.

### Efficacy of the long-acting nitro vasodilator pentaerithrityl tetranitrate in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving anti-anginal background therapy with β-blockers: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115D9Bhq]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the predominant cause of death in most developed countries. The most common manifestation of this disease is chronic stable angina pectoris, a clinical syndrome characterized by discomfort in the chest, jaw, shoulder, back, or arm typically aggravated by exertion or emotional stress.

With respect to treatment of patients with chronic stable angina, guidelines differentiate among drugs which relieve acute angina pectoris (such as short-acting nitrates), drugs that may improve prognosis (such as statins, ACE-inhibitors, and aspirin, or, in the secondary prevention, beta-receptor blockers), and drugs that can be added for patients who remain symptomatic despite therapy with the other classes of agents (such as calcium antagonists, beta-receptor blockers, and long-acting organic nitrates).

Pentaerithrityl tetranitrate (PETN) is a long-acting nitrate vasodilator used in the treatment of angina pectoris. Similar to nitroglycerin (GTN), it is the nitric acid ester of a polyalcohol, in this case pentaerithrityl instead of glycerine.

Recent pre-clinical and clinical studies have established that, rather than a homogeneous class, organic nitrates represent a heterogeneous group of substances that differ greatly with respect to side effects such as the induction of nitrate tolerance and endothelial dysfunction (for review see Munzel et al.). Although ISDN, ISMN, and GTN have been documented to cause tolerance – and endothelial dysfunction – mainly due to the pro-oxidant effects of these compounds, the organic nitrate PETN was shown to be deprived of these side effects, and it actually improved endothelial function in an animal model of diabetes mellitus. This favourable profile may be due to the up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes such as the heme-oxygenase-1, thereby preventing the development of tolerance and endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, PETN has been associated with increased numbers and improved function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells, and it has been shown to have protective properties similar to those of ischaemic pre-conditioning.

The current trial is the largest to date to investigate the effects of long-term therapy with an organic nitrate, PETN, when compared with placebo, in patients with stable angina pectoris undergoing therapy with beta-blockers and/or ivabradine.

### Isorbide dinitrate [^112zGG64]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The principal pharmacological action of isosorbide dinitrate is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end–diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.

Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were no more effective than placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their anti-anginal efficacy been restored.

### The on-and off-target effects of morphine in acute coronary syndrome: a narrative review [^112ZrNwR]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

With potent analgesic properties, perceived hemodynamic benefits and limited alternatives, morphine is the analgesic mainstay for patients with nitrate resistant chest pain due to acute Myocardial Infarction (MI). However, observational data suggest that morphine administration during MI may have negative consequences. While vomiting, hypotension and respiratory depression are established side effects, recent reports have demonstrated attenuated and delayed oral anti-platelet agent absorption, as well as suboptimal reperfusion after MI, all of which may translate into adverse cardiovascular outcomes. These data have resulted in reduced support for morphine in recent European and U.S. clinical practice guidelines for MI; despite the absence of any prospective randomized outcomes trials addressing this question. As such, randomized trials are now necessary to confirm whether or not morphine, which is administered in up to 30% of MI cases, causes adverse clinical outcomes in these patients. However, given that placebo-controlled randomized trial designs evaluating morphine in MI are limited by an ethical requirement for appropriate analgesia, alternative investigational approaches may be necessary. In this article we review the updated evidence for morphine in MI and outline novel strategies that may facilitate future investigation of this clinical dilemma.

### Isosorbide mononitrate (isosorbide) [^1155Zc5h]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Mechanism of Action:

The Isosorbide Mononitrate Extended-Release Tablets, USP product is an oral extended-release formulation of ISMN, the major active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate; most of the clinical activity of the dinitrate is attributable to the mononitrate.

The principal pharmacological action of ISMN and all organic nitrates in general is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, producing dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.

Pharmacodynamics:

Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentration's that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the antianginal efficacy of continuously delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their antianginal efficacy been restored. Isosorbide Mononitrate Extended-Release Tablets during long-term use over 42 days dosed at 120 mg once daily continued to improve exercise performance at 4 hours and at 12 hours after dosing, but its effects (although better than placebo) are less than or, at best, equal to the effects of the first dose of 60 mg.

### Part II. medical management of chronic stable angina… [^1125eAVH]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The onset of action of sublingual nitrates, intravenous nitrates and nitrate spray occurs within minutes of administration, making these formulations useful for immediate relief of angina. Alternatively, the spray and the sublingual forms of nitroglycerin can be used as a prophylactic measure before the patient begins an activity that usually precipitates angina. Oral or transdermal nitrates may be practical for use in patients who have frequent episodes of angina or cannot predict an attack. Newer long-acting mononitrates offer the advantage of improved bioavailability, as they avoid first-pass hepatic elimination. They are at least as effective as the isosorbide dinitrates in relieving angina and in allowing an increased duration of exercise before the onset of ischemia. Long-acting mononitrates also require less frequent dosing. Tolerance, and with it loss of antianginal effect, develops with long-term use of any form of nitrate.

It is therefore important to assure a 10- to 12-hour nitrate-free interval. If overnight protection against angina is needed, a trial of nighttime dosing, with a nitrate-free interval during the daytime, may be appropriate. Alternatively, such patients may benefit from the addition of another class of antianginal agents, as may patients who continue to have angina despite nitrate therapy. Combination therapy with beta blockers and nitrates 10 or calcium channel blockers 11 decreases the degree of cardiac ischemia and improves exercise tolerance. However, use of diltiazem or verapamil with a beta blocker requires careful monitoring of the heart rate and blood pressure, as this combination has additive effects on the sinus and atrioventricular nodes. If prohibitive bradycardia develops, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is an effective alternative to diltiazem or verapamil.

The NCEP guidelines provide the details for a stepwise approach, beginning with dietary modifications and then initiating drug therapy as indicated to achieve the desired cholesterol level.

### Harmonizing the paradigm with the data in stable coronary artery disease: a review and viewpoint [^1142gaQ2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Challenges to the Paradigm

Prevention of Death and MI

The first trial comparing PTCA with medical therapy in patients with stable CAD, the 1992 ACME (Angioplasty Compared to Medicine) study randomized 212 patients with single‐vessel CAD to PTCA or medical therapy. 5 PTCA resulted in greater freedom from angina (64% versus 46%) and exercise tolerance at 6 months but did not reduce mortality or MI, although the study was not powered for these outcomes. Subsequent trials were consistent in demonstrating greater but far from universal short‐term angina relief with PTCA than medical therapy but no reduction in mortality or MI. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

The results of the early studies led some to argue that the failure of PTCA to improve hard outcomes (death or MI) was attributable to the inclusion of patients at low risk. MASS (Medicine Angioplasty and Surgery Study), therefore, only included patients with proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) stenosis, yet still found no reduction in mortality or MI with PTCA. 6 These early PTCA trials came before the advent of stenting; medical therapy in this era was limited to antianginal medications such as β‐blockers and nitrates.

Among these early trials, the RITA‐2 (second Randomised Intervention Treatment of Angina) was the first large (> 1000 patients) investigation to compare PTCA with medical therapy. Despite medical therapy that was rudimentary by today's standards, death or definite MI were less frequent with medical therapy than PTCA (3.3% versus 6.3%) (relative risk, 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–3.41 [P = 0.02]). Angina improved in both groups but more so with PTCA. Compared with the PTCA group, there was a 16.5% absolute excess of grade 2 or worse angina in the medical group 3 months after randomization (P < 0.001), which attenuated to 7.6% after 2 years. Bare‐metal stents were introduced at the end of the trial and were only used in 9% of procedures.

### Ranolazine [^115gq4xR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 3. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p = 0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p = 0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

Table 3 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA)

a 1000 mg twice daily

Gender Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males.

Race

There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup.

14.2	Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome

In a large (n = 6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], and there was no difference between ranolazine and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22).

The principal pharmacological action of isosorbide dinitrate is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.

Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were no more effective than placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their anti-anginal efficacy been restored.

### Inorganic nitrate in angina study: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^114juGcm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clinicians are increasingly encountering patients with diffuse coronary artery disease years after their revascularization, when repeated intervention is either impossible or of limited benefit. Approximately 30% of "completely revascularized" patients still continue to experience angina. 1 Current antianginal drugs are very effective, but their use can be precluded because of side effects (especially bradycardia or hypotension).

Experimental evidence suggests that targeting the nitrate‐nitrite‐nitric oxide pathway may have therapeutic potential in patients with angina. Plasma nitrite is derived both from oxidation of endothelium‐derived nitric oxide and from dietary sources via bioconversion of nitrate involving an enterosalivary circulation, reduction by the oral microbial flora, and low stomach pH. 2

The vasodilator effect of nitrite is potentiated by hypoxia 3, 4, 5, 6 and, unlike organic nitrates (eg, glyceryl trinitrate [GTN], isosorbide 5‐mononitrate, and isosorbide dinitrate), not subject to development of tolerance. 7

Nitrate has been reported to improve metabolic efficiency during exercise in human skeletal muscle, but it is unknown whether this also occurs in cardiac muscle. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Under experimental conditions both nitrite and nitrate led to protection from ischemia‐reperfusion injury, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 blood pressure reduction, 18, 19, 20, 21 reversal of pulmonary arterial hypertension, 5, 22, 23 and induction of angiogenesis. 24, 25, 26

In light of these preclinical experimental results we hypothesized that oral sodium nitrate supplementation will delay the onset of myocardial ischemia in patients suffering from chronic angina.

### Long-term oral nitrate therapy is associated with adverse outcome in diabetic patients following elective percutaneous coronary intervention [^114LhPhS]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Although the use of oral nitrate therapy may be associated with an adverse cardiovascular outcome, the underlying mechanism, particularly in diabetic patients, remains unclear. One of the major limitations of long-term oral nitrate treatment is the rapid diminution of its hemodynamic and anti-ischemic effects as a result of nitrate tolerance. Recent studies have also demonstrated that sustained nitrate therapy is associated with an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by uncoupling of endothelial nitrate oxide synthase and activation of protein kinase C. In addition, hyperglycaemia may cause vascular damage that is mediated through an increased oxidative stress with the generation of ROS, such as superoxide (O₂⁻), hydroxyl (OH) and peroxyl (RO₂). The amplified oxidative stress in patients with type II diabetes and chronic nitrate therapy may aggravate the harmful vascular effects, and contribute to an increased adverse long-term clinical outcome. Another possible explanation of our findings is that the increased platelet aggregating activity in patients with CAD and diabetes following nitrate administration may subsequently lead to higher rates of cardiovascular events. The presence of diabetes and nitrate therapy has recently been shown to be associated with residual platelet reactivity in patients on clopidogrel therapy. This evidence further supports our observation that chronic nitrate therapy may have a detrimental effect in type II diabetic patients with established CAD.

A limitation of our study was its retrospective nature: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial would be preferable. Prescription of medication was at the discretion of individual physicians and the rationale could not be easily qualified from patients' records. Although patients prescribed long term nitrate therapy were likely a group of patients with more angina symptoms (reflecting worse coronary disease), the independent predictive effect of MACEs persisted in such patients despite multivariate adjustment for underlying triple vessel disease. In addition, a significant proportion of diabetic patients may remain asymptomatic due to underlying silent myocardial ischemia. Thus symptom-driven prescription of oral nitrates may not allow accurate identification of diabetic patients with underlying myocardial ischemia. A study involving 310 diabetic patients who underwent coronary angiogram with or without revascularization has demonstrated that asymptomatic diabetic patients have a higher cardiac death risk (26.4 vs. 8.8%; P < 0.001) compared with well-matched symptomatic diabetic patients during a 5 year follow up. We believe that diabetic patients using oral nitrate may not necessarily represent an excessive higher risk subgroup. Lastly, the small study population may not allow the identification of other potential variables (for example triple vessel disease) that could be associated with MACEs.

Therapy

Pharmacological symptomatic therapy

A detailed review of therapy for the different disorders of coronary artery function is beyond the scope of this review. A summary of currently available therapies aligning with the different SCS disease endotypes is shown in table 2 (see additional references in online supplementary file 1). Robust evidence for the treatment of SCS is lacking. The treatment effect in many studies is potentially diluted by enrolment of heterogeneous groups of patients with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms of CMD that may respond differently to specific treatment modalities. Current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines provide recommendations for patients with CMD suggesting ß-blockers as first-line therapy, with calcium antagonists recommended if the former is not tolerated or efficacious. Unlike in patients with angina and obstructive CAD, nitrates are not generally effective for treating SCS due to CMD. In a randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial of ranolazine led by the WISE investigators, although there were no overall improvements in angina and MPRi with ranolazine, benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with a reduced CFR (< 2.5) at baseline. Patients with VSA may benefit symptomatically from treatment with both nitrate and calcium channel antagonists while the latter may have prognostic benefit. Rho-kinase inhibitors and endothelin-receptor antagonists represent potential future therapeutic options.

Treatment of SCS endotypes

Secondary prevention

ESC guidelines support the use of secondary prevention with aspirin and statin therapy. In contrast, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline-95 on management of stable angina cites the enigmatic term 'Syndrome X', but guidance on the diagnosis and management is limited, reflecting the limited evidence base. Contemporary guidelines should be followed for the management of vascular risk factors in patients with INOCA. In patients with CMD, statin therapy reduces ischaemia as revealed by reduced ST-segment deviation following exercise testing and improves exercise capacity and flow-mediated dilatation in the brachial artery in patients with CMD. ACE inhibitors (ACEi) improve endothelial dysfunction and vasoreactivity via NO stimulation helping to reverse vascular hypertrophy and improve vascular compliance.

Non-pharmacological therapy

Lifestyle measures promote well-being in patients with INOCA through smoking cessation, healthy eating (eg, Mediterranean diet) and physical activity. The Comprehensive Treatment of Angina in Women With Microvascular Dysfunction trial (NCT02910154) will randomise women with angina and CMD to comprehensive multimodality intervention (dietary, exercise, and statin and ACEi therapy) or control therapy to determine whether angina and microvascular dysfunction can be improved.

### Comparison of intracoronary epinephrine and adenosine for No-reflow in normotensive patients with acute coronary syndrome (COAR trial) [^116uS1wG]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Generally, 93.4% (188 out of 201) of patients recruited in this trial had ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction and enrolled during primary PCI, as this is the most common scenario for the development of no-reflow among ACS settings. There are other settings like rotational atherectomy or saphenous venous graft PCI where no-reflow is common. The saphenous venous graft PCI patients could not be enrolled in either group in this trial due to rare presentation or failure to meet the inclusion criteria during the study interim, whereas patients with rotational atherectomy were excluded due to their procedure in non-ACS setting. Epinephrine administration was generally well tolerated with occasional and controllable adverse effects, and none of the patients experienced ventricular fibrillation or table death, as observed in earlier studies such as Skelding et alin 2002, where intracoronary epinephrine was used in 29 patients at a mean dose of 139 ± 189 µg, and Aksu et alin 2015, who utilized intracoronary epinephrine to treat refractory no-reflow in 12 patients, demonstrated the safety of its use with significant improvement of TIMI flow grade and attainment of TIMI 3 flow in 69% and 75% of patients, respectively, with no significant dysrhythmia except significant but controllable rise in heart and blood pressure. In this trial, mostly similar effects of epinephrine were translated as far as safety was concerned, where only 2 patients out of 101 (< 2%) developed ventricular tachycardia and required direct current cardioversion, and one patient developed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, whereas the remaining patients tolerated intracoronary epinephrine well with significant but self-limiting rise in heart rate and blood pressure in only 5.94% and 3.9%, respectively. Use of nitrates was more frequent in the control group (88% versus 75.2%, P = 0.020), suggesting better tolerance in terms of blood pressure. However, the use of GpIIb IIIa inhibitor was similar in the treatment and control groups (23.8% versus 20%, P = 0.519).

### Safety of nitrate withdrawal in angina-free and hemodynamically stable patients with coronary artery disease [^114WQ5rZ]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To assess the consequences of nitrate withdrawal in angina-free and hemodynamically stable coronary patients.

Design

Prospective, open, intervention study.

Setting

Cardiology outpatient clinic of a university-affiliated municipal hospital.

Patients

Angina-free patients who were hemodynamically stable for at least 3 months before study onset were enrolled. They were all regularly receiving nitrates for symptom control. Those with significant reasons to avoid stopping nitrates, such as heart failure (ejection fraction < 35%) or high BP (> 160 mm Hg systolic and/or > 100 mm Hg diastolic), and noncompliant patients were excluded.

Interventions

After providing informed consent and undergoing an exercise test (whenever possible), the participants were randomized to abruptly discontinue (study group) or continue (control group) nitrate treatment. Follow-up continued for at least 3 months after study entry.

Measurements and Results

Eighty patients were randomized to the study group and 40 patients to the control group (mean age [± 1 SD], 65.5 ± 11 years and 66.1 ± 10.9 years, respectively; p = not significant). The first month, eight study patients (10%) had a recurrence of anginal symptoms, compared with one control subject (2.5%) [p = not significant]. All eight patients responded promptly and favorably to the resumption of nitrate administration.

Conclusions

Nitrate administration can be safely discontinued in angina-free and hemodynamically stable coronary patients who receive this medication on a regular basis. If relapse of anginal symptoms occurs, it will be within 1 month following nitrate withdrawal, and will resolve satisfactorily with reinstatement of treatment.

### Inorganic nitrate benefits contrast-induced nephropathy after coronary angiography for acute coronary syndromes: the NITRATE-CIN trial [^113zC6TR]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) also termed contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI), defined by a deterioration in renal function after contrast exposure, is considered a serious complication of coronary angiography. The incidence of CIN (CA-AKI) ranges from < 1% to > 50% depending on patient characteristics and comorbidities, type of procedures, and definitions used. CIN (CA-AKI) often occurs following coronary angiography for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with a reported incidence of up to 55% in high-risk patients, such as those with older age, heart failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or diabetes with CKD. The clinical consequences of CIN are significant, being associated with increased risk for renal replacement therapy (RRT), longer length of hospital stay, recurrent revascularization procedures, and higher mortality.

Whilst the pathophysiology of CIN (CA-AKI) remains uncertain, one of the principal mechanisms thought to underlie the condition is the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and vasoconstrictive renal hypoxic injury. Importantly, studies in pre-clinical models and early phase trials suggest that, in part, this oxidative stress decreases levels of protective nitric oxide (NO). Thus, strategies that seek to replace this 'lost' NO represent an approach that may confer therapeutic benefit. To date approaches to deliver NO in the form of organic nitrate have not translated well. There is some evidence that antioxidant therapy, in the form of N -acetylcysteine (NAC) that would indirectly elevate NO, provides some benefit, however further trials have failed to reproduce these findings.

A potential alternative and more direct solution for elevating endogenous NO levels lies in targeting the non-canonical pathway for NO synthesis via the in vivo two-step sequential chemical reduction of inorganic nitrate (NO₃⁻) to nitrite (NO₂⁻) and then nitrite to NO. This activity is coupled with the major advantage over the organic nitrates and nitrites of no development of tachyphylaxis and tolerance; the characteristic that is the primary and major factor limiting use of the organic compounds in the clinical setting. Inorganic nitrate (NO 3 −) is used to safely and effectively enhance this non-canonical pathway, and thus we assessed the potential therapeutic benefit that could be derived from the use of inorganic nitrate in the prevention of CIN (CA-AKI) in patients with ACS.

### Delayed preconditioning-mimetic action of nitroglycerin in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty [^116sFJbE]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Experimental studies suggest that the cardioprotective effects of the late phase of ischemic preconditioning (PC) can be mimicked pharmacologically. However, to date, no drug has been tested with respect to its ability to elicit a late PC effect in humans. As a consequence, clinical exploitation of the powerful anti-stunning and anti-infarct actions of late PC has been elusive thus far.

Methods and Results

A total of 66 patients were randomized to receive a 4-hour intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin (NTG) or normal saline; on the following day, they underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (three 2-minute balloon inflations 5 minutes apart). Measurements of ST-segment shifts (intracoronary and surface ECGs), regional wall motion (quantitative 2D echocardiography), and chest pain score indicated that the infusion of NTG 24 hours before angioplasty rendered the myocardium relatively resistant to ischemia and that the degree of this cardioprotective effect was comparable to that afforded by the ischemia associated with the first balloon inflation in control subjects (early phase of ischemic PC). Collateral flow (estimated from a pressure-derived index) did not differ between control and NTG-pretreated patients, indicating that the enhanced tolerance to ischemia in NTG-pretreated patients cannot be accounted for by baseline differences in collateral function.

Conclusions

NTG protects human myocardium against ischemia 24 hours after its administration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that a late PC effect can be recruited pharmacologically in humans. The results suggest that prophylactic administration of nitrates could be a novel approach to the protection of the ischemic myocardium in patients.

Recommendation-specific supportive text for lipid therapy after acute coronary syndromes (ACS): High-intensity statin regimens lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration by an average of ≥ 50%, and there is no indication of safety concerns from very low LDL-C levels; therefore, high-intensity statin therapy should not be de-escalated following in-patient hospitalization in patients who are tolerating treatment. In IMPROVE IT, addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin 40 mg daily in patients ≤ 10 days after ACS led to a modest but significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) over a median follow-up of 6 years. Clinical trials of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have demonstrated a 15% relative risk reduction in MACE over a median of 2 to 3 years including patients > 1 month after ACS.

### Elevated plasma nitrate levels in patients with acute coronary syndrome [^115KKzXb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) encompasses a spectrum of coronary artery diseases, including unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and ST-segment elevation MI. At present, ACS is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the community. The diagnosis of ACS is of critical importance for guiding appropriate therapeutic strategies, although this can be onerous if the standard presenting manifestations are lacking. While high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) is a proven biomarker of ACS, additional markers to support the clinical diagnosis could be valuable. Since nitrate metabolism is crucial to the vasomotion of coronary arteries, in this study, we compared the plasma nitrate levels in consecutive patients with ACS and healthy volunteers. Systemic hemodynamic parameters were also compared between the groups. The pulse wave velocity of individuals with ACS was higher than that in healthy volunteers, thereby verifying the association between coronary artery disease and a loss of vascular elasticity in the circulatory system. Notably, median plasma nitrate levels were significantly higher in patients with ACS compared to healthy volunteers. Although plasma nitrate levels seem to be higher in patients with ACS, whether this finding is incidental, contributory, or a consequential factor in the pathogenesis of ACS remains to be determined.

Although organic nitrates have been clinically used for more than a century, findings in the last decade have radically challenged our traditional view concerning the mechanism(s) of their clinical effects and implications. While their hemodynamic properties are well known, the knowledge that nitrates possess previously unexpected nonhemodynamic effects is a unique opportunity of which clinicians should be aware but, at the same time, it also provides a rationale to worry about previously unanticipated clinical consequences of long-term treatment with these drugs.

### Acute heart failure with and without concomitant acute coronary syndromes: patient characteristics, management, and survival [^114zgYVe]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) may precipitate up to a third of acute heart failure (AHF) cases. We assessed the characteristics, initial management, and survival of AHF patients with (ACS-AHF) and without (nACS-AHF) concomitant ACS.

Methods and Results

Data from 620 AHF patients were analyzed in a prospective multicenter study. The ACS-AHF patients (32%) more often presented with de novo AHF (61% vs. 43%; P < .001). Although no differences existed between the 2 groups in mean blood pressure, heart rate, or routine biochemistry on admission, cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema were more common manifestations in ACS-AHF (P < .01 for both). Use of intravenous nitrates, furosemide, opioids, inotropes, and vasopressors, as well as noninvasive ventilation and invasive coronary procedures (angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft surgery), were more frequent in ACS-AHF (P < .001 for all). Although 30-day mortality was significantly higher for ACS-AHF (13% vs. 8%; p = 0.03), survival in the 2 groups at 5 years was similar. Overall, ACS was an independent predictor of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.07–3.79; p = 0.03).

Conclusions

Whereas medical history and the manifestation and initial treatment of AHF between ACS-AHF and nACS-AHF patients differ, long-term survival is similar. ACS is, however, independently associated with increased short-term mortality.

Vasospastic angina — diagnostic criteria: Diagnosis considers "Nitrate-responsive angina: during spontaneous episode, with at least 1 of the following" clinical features, plus ECG and angiographic findings. Transient ischemia is supported by "Transient ischemic electrocardiographic changes: during spontaneous episode, including any of the following in at least 2 contiguous leads: ST segment elevation ≥ 0.1 mV; ST segment depression ≥ 0.1 mV; New negative U waves". Coronary spasm is defined as "transient total or subtotal coronary artery occlusion (> 90% constriction) with angina and ischemic electrocardiographic changes either spontaneously or in response to a provocative stimulus (typically acetylcholine, ergonovine, or hyperventilation)". "Definitive" vasospastic angina requires nitrate-responsive angina during spontaneous episodes and fulfillment of either transient ischemic ECG changes or coronary spasm criteria, whereas "Suspected" vasospastic angina is when nitrate-responsive angina is present but ischemic ECG changes are equivocal or unavailable and spasm criteria are equivocal.

### Chronic nitrate therapy is associated with different presentation and evolution of acute coronary syndromes: insights from 52, 693 patients in the global registry of acute coronary events [^1121VEzK]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

Brief episode(s) of ischaemia may increase cardiac tolerance to a subsequent major ischaemic insult ('preconditioning'). Nitrates can pharmacologically mimic ischaemic preconditioning in animals. In this study, we investigated whether antecedent nitrate therapy affords protection toward acute ischaemic events using data from the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events.

Methods and Results

The dataset comprised 52,693 patients from 123 centres in 14 countries: 42,138 (80%) were nitrate-naïve and 10,555 (20%) were on chronic nitrates at admission. In nitrate-naïve patients, admission diagnosis was ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in 41%, whereas 59% presented with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). In contrast, only 18% nitrate users showed STEMI, whereas 82% presented with NSTE-ACS. Thus, among nitrate users clinical presentation was tilted toward NSTE-ACS by more than four-fold, STEMI occurring in less than one of five patients (P < 0.0001). After adjustment (age, sex, medical history, prior therapy, revascularization, previous angina), chronic nitrate use remained independent predictor of NSTE-ACS (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.26–1.46; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, regardless of presentation, within both STEMI and NSTEMI populations, antecedent nitrate use was associated with significantly lower levels of CK-MB and troponin (P < 0.0001 for all).

Conclusion

In this large multinational registry, chronic nitrate use was associated with a shift away from STEMI in favour of NSTE-ACS and with less release of markers of cardiac necrosis. These findings suggest that in nitrate users acute coronary events may develop to a smaller extent. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials are warranted to establish whether nitrate therapy may pharmacologically precondition the heart toward ischaemic episodes.

### Time-honored treatments for the initial management of acute coronary syndromes: challenging the status quo [^114RWu8c]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Morphine, oxygen, and nitrates are time-honored therapies for the initial management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The traditional goal of these agents in ACS has been to (1) relieve symptoms, (2) prevent infarction or limit its size, and (3) improve outcomes, both acutely and during follow-up. Despite their ongoing use in routine ACS care, nitrates, morphine, and oxygen have no evidence of clinical outcomes benefit from randomized trials. Furthermore, emerging data have recently suggested that, in certain situations, morphine and oxygen may actually be associated with harm in the setting of ACS. In this review article, we thoroughly examine updated evidence for each of these acute-phase ACS agents with respect to their individual risks and benefits. We review guideline recommendations for these therapies and outline future directions for their use in clinical practice.

### Trials and tribulations associated with angina and traditional therapeutic approaches [^114X2r15]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Ischemic heart disease is the foremost cause of death in the United States and the developed countries. Stable angina is the initial manifestation of ischemic heart disease in one half of the patients and becomes a recurrent symptom in survivors of myocardial infarction (MI) and other forms of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). There are multiple therapeutic modalities currently available for treatment of anginal symptoms in patients with stable CAD. These include anti-anginal drugs and myocardial revascularization procedures such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABGS), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Anti-anginal drug therapy is based on treatment with nitrates, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. A newly approved antianginal drug, ranolazine, is undergoing phase III evaluation. Not infrequently, combination therapy is often necessary for adequate symptom control in some patients with stable angina. However, there has not been a systematic evaluation of individual or combination antianginal drug therapy on hard clinical end points in patients with stable angina. Most revascularization trials that have evaluated treatment with CABGS, PTCA, or PCI in patients with chronic CAD and stable angina have not shown significant improvement in survival or decreased incidence of non-fatal MI compared to medical treatment. In the CABGS trials, various post-hoc analyses have identified several smaller subgroups at high-risk in whom CABGS might improve clinical outcomes. However, there are conflicting findings in different reports and these findings are further compromised due to the heterogeneous groups of patients in these trials. Moreover, no prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) has confirmed an advantage of CABGS, compared to medical treatment, in reduction of hard clinical outcomes in any of the high-risk subgroups. Based on the available data, it appears reasonable to conclude that for most patients (except perhaps in those with presence of left main disease > 50% stenosis) there is no apparent survival benefit of CABGS compared to medical therapy in stable CAD patients with angina. Although these trial have reported better symptom control associated with the revascularization intervention in most patients, this has not been adequately compared using modern medical therapies. Available data from recent studies also suggest treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), a statin and a regular exercise regimen in patients with stable CAD and angina pectoris.

### Differences in the mode of presentation for acute coronary syndrome by pre-hospitalization medication, in relation to coronary risk factors, east-osaka acute coronary syndrome (EACS) registry [^116kK9ds]. Atherosclerosis (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Pre-hospitalization medication such as aspirin and nitrates has been shown to affect the mode of presentation in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, it is not formally assessed whether other cardiovascular medications may be contributed to the differences in the mode of presentation, especially in relation to coronary risk factors.

Methods and Results

We conducted a registration study of patients (M/F 850/323) with either ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or unstable angina (UA), and examined the differences in the mode of presentation, pre-hospitalization medication, and coronary risk factors. The ratio of the incidence of STEMI and NSTEMI/UA was significantly reduced in patients having pre-hospitalization medication with aspirin, nitrates or statins, but not with other medications such as beta-blockers in multivariate analysis. Pre-hospitalization medication with aspirin and nitrates was significantly associated with the same reduction of the ratio in patients with male gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and a history of coronary artery disease. However, in patients who smoked, were obese and hypercholesterolemic, pre-hospitalization medication with nitrates was significantly associated with the reduced ratio. The ratio was significantly low in patients with males and hypercholesterolemia treated with statins before admission.

Conclusion

Depending on their coronary risk factors, pre-hospitalization medication with aspirin, nitrates or statins was associated with a different presentation and evolution of ACS.

### Nitroglycerin (Nitro-bid) [^1121rh1Z]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:

The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.

Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates had been absent from the body for several hours was their anti-anginal efficacy restored.

### Nitrate therapy for heart failure: benefits and strategies to overcome tolerance [^116Tf3gH]. JACC: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Combination therapy with hydralazine and nitrates can improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and low ejection fraction. However, this combination is underused in clinical practice for several reasons, including side effects related to hydralazine and polypharmacy. Some of the benefits seen with hydralazine, including afterload reduction and attenuation of nitrate tolerance, have also been observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Demonstrating similar clinical benefits with nitrates plus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy alone, in the absence of hydralazine, may represent an opportunity to improve heart failure care by increasing the use of nitrates. In this paper, we summarize data that support studying such an approach.

### Ranolazine (Aspruzyo sprinkle) [^114TLBJp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despite treatment with the maximum dose of an antianginal agent. In the ERICA (Efficacy of Ranolazine In Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatment with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily or placebo, in addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. In addition, 45% of the study population also received long-acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrates were used as needed to treat angina episodes. Results are shown in Table 4. Statistically significant decreases in angina attack frequency (p = 0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p = 0.014) were observed with ranolazine compared to placebo. These treatment effects appeared consistent across age and use of long-acting nitrates.

Table 4 Angina Frequency and Nitroglycerin Use (ERICA)

a 1000 mg twice daily

Gender

Effects on angina frequency and exercise tolerance were considerably smaller in women than in men. In CARISA, the improvement in Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) in females was about 33% of that in males at the 1000 mg twice-daily dose level. In ERICA, where the primary endpoint was angina attack frequency, the mean reduction in weekly angina attacks was 0.3 for females and 1.3 for males.

Race

There were insufficient numbers of non-Caucasian patients to allow for analyses of efficacy or safety by racial subgroup.

14.2 Lack of Benefit in Acute Coronary Syndrome

In a large (n = 6560) placebo-controlled trial (MERLIN-TIMI 36) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, there was no benefit shown on outcome measures. However, the study is somewhat reassuring regarding proarrhythmic risks, as ventricular arrhythmias were less common on ranolazine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], and there was no difference between ranolazine and placebo in the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk ranolazine: placebo 0.99 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 1.22).

### Nitroglycerin (nitroglycerin in dextrose) [^117GRfLQ]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.

Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their anti-anginal efficacy been restored.

Pharmacokinetics:

The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about 3 minutes. The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow; known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls.

The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate and the 1,2-and 1,3- dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin, but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized to (non-vasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon dioxide.

To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10–12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo.

### Explaining the phenomenon of nitrate tolerance [^114EeQo2]. Circulation Research (2005). Low credibility.

During the last century, nitroglycerin has been the most commonly used antiischemic and antianginal agent. Unfortunately, after continuous application, its therapeutic efficacy rapidly vanishes. Neurohormonal activation of vasoconstrictor signals and intravascular volume expansion constitute early counter-regulatory responses (pseudotolerance), whereas long-term treatment induces intrinsic vascular changes, eg, a loss of nitrovasodilator-responsiveness (vascular tolerance). This is caused by increased vascular superoxide production and a supersensitivity to vasoconstrictors secondary to a tonic activation of protein kinase C. NADPH oxidase(s) and uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase have been proposed as superoxide sources. Superoxide and vascular NO rapidly form peroxynitrite, which aggravates tolerance by promoting NO synthase uncoupling and inhibition of soluble guanylyl cyclase and prostacyclin synthase. This oxidative stress concept may explain why radical scavengers and substances, which reduce oxidative stress indirectly, are able to relieve tolerance and endothelial dysfunction. Recent work has defined a new tolerance mechanism, ie, an inhibition of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme that accomplishes bioactivation of nitroglycerin, and has identified mitochondria as an additional source of reactive oxygen species. Nitroglycerin-induced reactive oxygen species inhibit the bioactivation of nitroglycerin by thiol oxidation of aldehyde dehydrogenase. Both mechanisms, increased oxidative stress and impaired bioactivation of nitroglycerin, can be joined to provide a new concept for nitroglycerin tolerance and cross-tolerance. The consequences of these processes for the nitroglycerin downstream targets soluble guanylyl cyclase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, cGMP-degrading phosphodiesterases, and toxic side effects contributing to endothelial dysfunction, such as inhibition of prostacyclin synthase, are discussed in this review.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — drug selection and combination strategies emphasizes that beta blockers have been considered the first antianginal to use in patients with symptomatic CCD, although the evidence basis for this prioritization is not strong. Early randomized, placebo-controlled studies found that beta blockers increased the percentage of patients free of exertional angina, reduced anginal attacks and reduced nitroglycerin consumption. A meta-analysis of 72 studies comparing beta blockers with CCBs found fewer episodes of angina per week with beta blockers and lower rates of drug discontinuation, with no difference observed in the rate of death or MI between the 2 drug classes and no difference in the primary endpoint of exercise duration in a more recent meta-analysis. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, CCBs effectively relieve angina, decrease nitroglycerin consumption, and increase exercise duration, and long-acting nitrates decrease angina and improve exercise duration. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil and diltiazem) can further depress LV function and should not be used in patients with CCD and significant LV dysfunction; in patients with CCD and angina refractory to 1 agent, a combination with another antianginal agent improves symptom control, and non-dihydropyridine CCBs should be used with caution in patients on beta blockers because of the potential for synergistic induction or exacerbation of bradycardia and LV dysfunction; the addition of a long-acting nitrate to a beta blocker or a CCB improves exercise tolerance, reduces angina frequency and short-acting nitrate use. Control of symptoms may be achieved by most patients, but full freedom from angina is only achieved in 40% to 50%, depending on anginal frequency at the onset of treatment.

### Efficacy of the long-acting nitro vasodilator pentaerithrityl tetranitrate in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving anti-anginal background therapy with β-blockers: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113gbXME]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Therapy with organic nitrates is commonly used in the management of patients with angina pectoris, and the current guidelines encourage the use of long-acting nitrates in patients who remain symptomatic despite appropriate anti-anginal therapy with beta-blockers. The major limitation of nitrate therapy, however, is that, due to the development of nitrate tolerance, it can only be applied on a 12 h intermittent basis, thus typically providing no protection during night hours and exposing patients to rebound phenomena. – A number of possible approaches have been proposed to address this issue, including co-administration of compounds aimed at limiting the oxidant effects of GTN and other nitrates, as well as the use of nitrates with independent antioxidant properties. PETN is an organic nitrate that has been shown to induce the expression of the antioxidant enzyme heme-oxygenase-1and that, in human studies, has been shown to be deprived of the side effects common to other nitrates, including the induction of nitrate toleranceand endothelial dysfunction. To date, the anti-ischaemic efficacy of this drug has not been studied in large multicentre clinical trials.

Summary of the findings

The CLEOPATRA study was designed to investigate the anti-anginal efficacy of PETN administered on top of a background anti-ischaemic therapy. Patients enrolled received appropriate anti-anginal therapy with a beta-blocker or ivabradine with add-on PETN 80 mg b.i.d. or placebo. The study was run as a multicentre, randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial with centralized analysis of data and safety assessment, and the primary efficacy endpoint was the change in TED after 12 weeks of treatment. As expected, an important placebo (or time) effect was shown for all endpoints. When the analysis included the whole population of patients enrolled into the study, no difference was shown between PETN and placebo for any of the endpoints. Notably, an analysis that included the baseline TED as a covariate evidenced that the benefit of PETN was more pronounced in those patients who had a lower TED at randomization. In line with this, a clear superiority of PETN over placebo was demonstrated with regard to all clinically relevant efficacy endpoints in the subset of patients showing low exercise capacity and distinct symptoms of angina pectoris.

### Nitroglycerin use and adverse clinical outcomes in elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome [^114hA6b8]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

The latest guidelines from the Japanese Circulation Society, European Society of Cardiologyand American College of Cardiology/American Heart Associationrecommend the administration of nitrates in the primary management for ACS, except in cases with contraindications such as marked hypotension, bradycardia and complicated right ventricular infarction. However, as Ekmejian et al recently described, these guidelines rely on the results from the GISSI-3and ISIS-4 studyconducted more than 30 years ago when the treatment of ACS and the demographics of patients with ACS were significantly different from the current situation. Moreover, the results of these studies did not fully support the strong recommendations for the use of GTN for ACS. The percentage of patients with ACS undergoing primary PCI followed by OMT has increased markedly over the past 30 years, and these multidisciplinary treatments have significantly suppressed the development and progression of heart failure and the recurrence of ischaemic events. Additionally, the recent promotion of timely reperfusion after the onset of ST-elevation myocardial infarction includes shortening the D2B time to less than 90 min. Our hospital data also indicated that the D2B time was 73 min, meeting the goal stated in the guidelines. All of these initiatives help preserve cardiac function after ACS, resulting in that the haemodynamically beneficial effect of GTN in the acute phase, might have become relatively limited and less apparent compared with the era without widespread PCI and OMT.

The concerns regarding the safety of GTN use for ACS might have been relatively increased because the number and proportion of elderly patients with ACS increased, and elderly patients are more prone to hypotension after GTN administration. This study also confirmed that the GTN group showed less pre-PCI systolic blood pressure than the non-GTN group among elderly patients. Elderly patients 75 or more years of age account for 30%–40% of all hospitalised patients with ACS, and the incidence of ACS-associated death is also mainly observed in this age group. Similarly, this study included approximately 40% of patients aged 75 or more years, and the trend of outcomes for the study population as a whole and those in this age group were nearly identical. These findings suggest that the incidence of clinical events occurs mainly in elderly patients, which is similar to previous reports. Hence, optimisation of primary management for elderly patients with ACS is required, and the pros and cons of GTN use should be debated and examined separately for elderly and non-elderly patients.

### Nitroglycerin extended-release capsules… [^1162d81N]. FDA (DailyMed) (2012). Low credibility.

This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates had been absent from the body for several hours was their anti-anginal efficacy restored. To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10–12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo.

less. Controlled trials of multiple-dose oral nitroglycerin have shown statistically significant anti-anginal efficacy 2½ and 4 hours after a dose when oral nitroglycerin had been administered four times a day for 2 weeks or three times a day for 1 week. As noted above, careful studies with other formulations of nitroglycerin have shown that maintenance of continuous 24-hour plasma levels of nitroglycerin results in insurmountable tolerance. Presumably, the studied 1-week and 2-week regimens of oral nitroglycerin therapy achieved adequate nitrate-free intervals by non-uniformity of dosing interval, with longer intervals overnight. The investigators did not report how subjects interpreted their dosing instructions, and they similarly did not report which dose of the day was the one after which they obtained the end-of-trial exercise results.

Thus, these studies of oral nitroglycerin should be interpreted as demonstrations that these regimens provide round-the-clock anti-anginal protection. From large, well-controlled studies of other nitroglycerin formulations, it is reasonable to believe that the maximal achievable daily duration of anti-anginal effect from Nitroglycerin Extended-Release Capsules is about 12 hours. not. As noted above careful studies with other formulations of nitroglycerin have shown that maintenance of continuous 24-hour plasma levels of nitroglycerin results in tolerance. Every dosing regimen for Nitroglycerin Extended-Release Capsules should provide a daily nitrate-free interval to avoid the development of this tolerance.

### Nitroglycerin (nitroMist) [^116k5XHg]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance (5.1).

5.1 Tolerance

Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest number of doses required for effective relief of the acute anginal attack should be used [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)].

As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is reduced.

5.2 Hypotension

Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur even with small doses of nitroglycerin. The drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume-depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris.

The benefits of NitroMist in patients with acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established. If one elects to use NitroMist in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used because of the possibility of hypotension and tachycardia.

5.3 Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

5.4 Headache

Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, which may be severe. Tolerance to headaches occurs.

1 Introduction

Recognizing that acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) constitute a spectrum encompassing unstable angina, non‐ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the 2023 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the management of ACSs addressed all three. This differs from the prior US guidelines that individually addressed unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI. The 2023 ESCACS Guidelines thus encompass comprehensive patient management from admission to long‐term care, again including what in prior US guidelines would have been a secondary prevention guideline. In addition, the task force included a patient member who provided a patient perspective that is highlighted in the European publication.

### Vericiguat in combination with short-acting nitroglycerin in patients with chronic coronary syndromes: the randomized, phase Ib, VENICE study [^1142DKn1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The magnitude of the global burden of heart failure (HF) is significant. As well as being a growing economic problem, clinical outcomes for patients with chronic HF remain poor, despite the availability of HF therapies and the implementation of current guidelines.

Comorbidities are of great importance in HF, as they add to the complexity of patient management as well as potentially increase mortality risk. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major risk factor for HF, and recent guidelines categorize patients with CAD as having acute or chronic coronary syndromes (CCSs). Angina pectoris is a common symptom in patients with HF and CCSs. Short‐acting nitrates, such as nitroglycerin, are recommended for the acute treatment of angina in patients with CCSs, according to recent guidelines.

Vericiguat is an orally administered, direct soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization following a hospitalization for HF or need for outpatient intravenous diuretics in adults with symptomatic chronic HF and ejection fraction less than 45%. Nitric oxide (NO) availability and the functionality of sGC are impaired in HF; this results in a loss of production of the molecular messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which may contribute to the progression of cardiovascular disease. Vericiguat enhances the NO–sGC–cGMP pathway by directly stimulating sGC through a binding site independent of NO and by sensitizing sGC to endogenous NO. Given that vericiguat and nitroglycerin both act on the NO–sGC–cGMP pathway, and may be coadministered to patients with HF, it is important to understand their potential pharmacodynamic interactions.

In a previous phase I drug–drug interaction study in healthy male subjects (EudraCT number: 2014‐001235‐36; data on file), exposure to vericiguat (5 mg) was not affected by coadministration with nitroglycerin (0.2 mg sublingual), and the combination was generally well tolerated. In this article, we report the results from the phase Ib Vericiguat Nitroglycerin Clinical Interaction (VENICE) study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02617550; EudraCT number: 2015‐001444‐11), which investigated the hemodynamic effects of vericiguat plus nitroglycerin in patients with CCSs and whether concomitant administration would be well tolerated without clinically significant adverse effects beyond those known for nitroglycerin.

### Medical management of stable coronary artery disease [^115Li6ow]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

All patients with stable coronary artery disease require medical therapy to prevent disease progression and recurrent cardiovascular events. Three classes of medication are essential to therapy: lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and antiplatelet agents. Lipid-lowering therapy is necessary to decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a target level of less than 100 mg per dL, and physicians should consider a goal of less than 70 mg per dL for very high-risk patients. Statins have demonstrated clear benefits in morbidity and mortality in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease; other medications that can be used in addition to statins to lower cholesterol include ezetimibe, fibrates, and nicotinic acid. Blood pressure therapy for patients with coronary artery disease should start with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. If these medications are not tolerated, calcium channel blockers or angiotensin receptor blockers are acceptable alternatives. Aspirin is the first-line antiplatelet agent except in patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction or undergone stent placement, in which case clopidogrel is recommended. Anginal symptoms of coronary artery disease can be treated with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, or any combination of these. Familiarity with these medications and with the evidence supporting their use is essential to reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease.

### Inorganic nitrate benefits contrast-induced nephropathy after coronary angiography for acute coronary syndromes: the NITRATE-CIN trial [^113DknXz]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Characteristics of the study population

Between November 2018 and July 2021, 2675 patients presenting with NSTE-ACS were referred for invasive coronary angiography at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Among these, 1162 patients were excluded as CIN prophylaxis was not required (as per local policy (see Supplementary data online, Appendix S1) consistent with NICE guidelines. The remaining 1513 patients who were at risk of CIN were evaluated with the following excluded: unstable presentation (STEMI, cardiac arrest, or cardiogenic shock) (n = 50), eGFR < 20 mL/min or established on long-term RRT (n = 39), study team or investigational medicinal product (IMP) being unavailable (n = 80), recruitment to other research studies (n = 140), unable to consent (language barrier, capacity) (n = 126) and 247 patients were felt to be unsuitable by the research team (compliance, co-morbidity, and life expectancy) so were unsuitable for randomization. This left 831 suitable patients, of which 191 declined. Data are thus presented for 640 patients (319 in the inorganic nitrate group and 321 in the placebo group) (Figure 1 -Consortdiagram).

### 2023 AHA / ACC / ACCP / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114Za4J5]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Chronic coronary disease — phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and nitrates guidance states that "Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors should not be used concomitantly with nitrate medications, often used to treat CCD, because of the potential for severe hypotension". "Sildenafil and vardenafil have half-lives of ∼4 hours". "Tadalafil is long-acting and has a half-life of 17.5 hours". "Patients on sildenafil or vardenafil should avoid taking nitroglycerine for ≥ 24 hours (≥ 48 hours for tadalafil)".

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^111MSaw2]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Isosorbide dinitrate and other nitrates — symptomatic therapy in heart failure (HF) — may decrease dyspnea and improve exercise tolerance in patients with persistent limitations, with the only common side effects being headaches and hypotension; in practice, nitrates are frequently prescribed to patients with persistent congestive symptoms, and nitrate tolerance appears minimized by a "nitrate-free interval" of at least 10 hours and by combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or hydralazine.

### Platelet nitric oxide responsiveness: a novel prognostic marker in acute coronary syndromes [^1139o4dp]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Nitric oxide (NO) is critically important in the regulation of vascular tone and the inhibition of platelet aggregation. We have shown previously that patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or stable angina pectoris have impaired platelet responses to NO donors when compared with normal subjects. We tested the hypotheses that platelet hyporesponsiveness to NO is a predictor of (1) cardiovascular readmission and/or death and (2) all-cause mortality in patients with ACS (unstable angina pectoris or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction).

Methods and Results

Patients (n = 51) with ACS had evaluation of platelet aggregation within 24 hours of coronary care unit admission using impedance aggregometry. Patients were categorized as having "normal" (≥ 32% inhibition of ADP-induced aggregation with the NO donor sodium nitroprusside; 10 micromol/L; n = 18) or "impaired" (< 32% inhibition of ADP-induced aggregation; n = 33) NO responses. We then compared the incidence of cardiovascular readmission and death during a median of 7 years of follow-up in these 2 groups. Using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age, sex, index event, postdischarge medical treatment, revascularization status, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, concurrent disease states, and cardiac risk factors, impaired NO responsiveness was associated with an increased risk of the combination of cardiovascular readmission and/or death (relative risk, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.03 to 7.10; P = 0.041) and all-cause mortality (relative risk, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.09 to 36.7; P = 0.033).

Conclusions

Impaired platelet NO responsiveness is a novel, independent predictor of increased mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with high-risk ACS.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to antianginal therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating long-acting nitrates or ranolazine as add-on therapy in patients with inadequate control of symptoms while on treatment with β-blockers and/or CCBs, or as part of initial treatment in properly selected patients.
