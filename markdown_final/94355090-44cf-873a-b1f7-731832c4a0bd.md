## Question

A 56-year-old woman with a history of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, treated with lumpectomy and adjuvant tamoxifen, presents to your clinic with severe vulvovaginal dryness and dyspareunia that significantly affect her quality of life. She has tried non-hormonal moisturizers and lubricants with minimal relief. She asks about the possibility of using intravaginal estrogen therapy. She also reports bothersome hot flashes. She is concerned about the risk of breast cancer recurrence with any hormonal treatment.

Based on current guidelines, how should you counsel this patient regarding the use of intravaginal estrogen therapy and systemic hormone therapy for her symptoms?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to counsel a 56-year-old woman with ER-positive breast cancer on tamoxifen who has severe GSM symptoms and hot flashes, specifically about the safety and appropriateness of intravaginal estrogen and systemic hormone therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for local vaginal estrogen in breast cancer survivors. Next, I will review guideline positions and the role of shared decision-making. After that, I need to examine systemic hormone therapy risks and alternatives for vasomotor symptoms. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise plan with monitoring and documentation needs, and I should double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk framing. She has ER-positive breast cancer and is on tamoxifen, which functions as a selective estrogen receptor modulator with antagonistic effects in breast tissue, while GSM is common in breast cancer survivors due to endocrine therapy–induced hypoestrogenism, with prevalence estimates often exceeding 50% and symptoms including dryness, dyspareunia, and urinary complaints, which can impair quality of life and adherence to endocrine therapy [^2f69786a] [^bfb7f8da].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for local vaginal estrogen in this population. Observational cohorts and meta-analyses consistently show no increased risk of breast cancer recurrence or mortality with low-dose vaginal estrogen, including a large cohort of 49,237 women showing no increase in breast cancer–specific mortality with vaginal estrogen use, and a meta-analysis of 8 observational studies showing no increase in recurrence, breast cancer mortality, or overall mortality, although these are nonrandomized data and confounding remains possible [^40a96d4b] [^ea027fb0] [^47d3fc18].

> I should confirm guideline positions next. The AUA/SUFU/AUGS 2025 guideline advises that clinicians may recommend local low-dose vaginal estrogen in breast cancer survivors after shared decision-making, noting no increase in cancer-specific mortality in registry analyses and emphasizing individualized risk assessment, while ACOG and NAMS similarly support considering low-dose vaginal estrogen after nonhormonal failure and in coordination with oncology, with the Endocrine Society recommending shared decision-making that includes the oncologist when GSM persists despite nonhormonal therapy [^94f99eef] [^842a5060] [^7be8da43] [^bfc7efb9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about systemic absorption. I need to check pharmacokinetics. Low-dose vaginal estradiol products generally result in minimal systemic absorption, with most studies showing transient or negligible increases in serum estradiol that resolve within weeks, and formulations such as 4–10 mcg estradiol tablets or 7.5 mcg rings are associated with serum estradiol levels below 20 pg/mL, supporting a favorable safety profile in this context when used appropriately [^8a203215] [^75e3db9d].

> But wait, what if the patient is on an aromatase inhibitor rather than tamoxifen. I should double-check that nuance. While overall data are reassuring, some observational signals suggest a possible increase in recurrence with vaginal estrogen among AI users, so if she were on an AI, I would favor even more cautious selection of ultra-low dose formulations, consider nonhormonal alternatives first, and ensure close oncologic coordination, whereas on tamoxifen the mechanistic antagonism at the breast receptor provides additional reassurance [^faddb02b] [^d31513e3].

> Next, I should review systemic hormone therapy for hot flashes. Systemic menopausal hormone therapy is generally not recommended after breast cancer due to increased recurrence risk in randomized trials such as HABITS, and guidelines advise nonhormonal options as first-line for vasomotor symptoms in patients at intermediate or high breast cancer risk, with effective choices including SSRIs/SNRIs like venlafaxine or paroxetine, gabapentin, and newer agents such as fezolinetant, while acknowledging that some observational data conflict and that shared decision-making is essential if exceptional circumstances are considered [^f8ba8722] [^00ebdd0f] [^875a6a21].

> I will now examine nonhormonal GSM options since she already tried moisturizers and lubricants. Let me consider alternatives with some evidence: vaginal DHEA is FDA-approved for GSM and has supportive data in general populations, with guidelines noting it as a reasonable option when estrogen is undesirable, and ospemifene is an oral SERM approved for dyspareunia, though its label warns against use in women with breast cancer, so if considered off-label, it requires careful oncologic input and discussion of limited long-term safety data in breast cancer survivors [^81e46bec] [^6a2003ac] [^d90d330c].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise plan. First, confirm diagnosis and severity of GSM and document baseline symptoms and sexual function. Second, optimize nonhormonal therapy with regular moisturizers and lubricants and consider pelvic floor therapy or dilators if indicated. Third, if symptoms persist and quality of life is significantly impacted, discuss low-dose vaginal estrogen using the lowest effective dose and a formulation with minimal systemic absorption, apply the product to the proximal lower third of the vagina, and coordinate with the oncologist. Fourth, monitor for response and any bleeding, and counsel that routine endometrial surveillance is not required solely due to local low-dose estrogen use. Fifth, for hot flashes, prioritize nonhormonal pharmacologic options and consider referral to menopause or sexual health specialists if needed [^75e3db9d] [^55fbc471] [^bfc7efb9].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential inconsistency I initially thought I saw. I briefly recalled an Endocrine Society statement recommending against ospemifene in breast cancer survivors, but wait, let me verify the exact wording. The Endocrine Society guideline explicitly recommends against ospemifene in women with a history of breast cancer, so I should correct that and emphasize that ospemifene is not advised in this population despite its approval for GSM in general postmenopausal women, reinforcing the preference for nonhormonal vasomotor therapies and careful consideration of local estrogen only when necessary [^d90d330c] [^73571698].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and follow-up are explicit. I should record the severity of GSM, prior nonhormonal trials, the shared decision-making conversation including oncologist input, the chosen low-dose vaginal estrogen product and dosing, counseling on expected benefits and minimal systemic absorption, and a plan to reassess symptoms and adherence within 4–12 weeks, with clear instructions to report any bleeding promptly and to continue routine breast cancer surveillance per oncologic care [^bfc7efb9] [^c09ed7dd].

---

For a 56-year-old woman with ER-positive breast cancer on tamoxifen and severe GSM symptoms unresponsive to nonhormonal therapy, **low-dose vaginal estrogen is reasonable** after shared decision-making with oncology, as current evidence shows no increase in recurrence or mortality with vaginal estrogen [^40a96d4b] [^ea027fb0] [^47d3fc18]. Use the **lowest effective dose** (e.g. 10 mcg estradiol tablet or ring) and monitor for any vaginal bleeding. Systemic hormone therapy is **not recommended** due to increased recurrence risk; consider nonhormonal options (e.g. venlafaxine, gabapentin, fezolinetant) for hot flashes [^f8ba8722] [^875a6a21].

## Intravaginal estrogen therapy for GSM

### Evidence on safety and recurrence risk

- **Observational data**: Multiple large cohorts show no increased recurrence or mortality with vaginal estrogen in breast cancer survivors, including those on tamoxifen [^40a96d4b] [^ea027fb0] [^47d3fc18].

- **Systemic absorption**: Low-dose vaginal estrogen has minimal systemic absorption, typically keeping serum estradiol within postmenopausal ranges, though transient rises can occur [^8a203215] [^75e3db9d].

- **Tamoxifen context**: Tamoxifen's antagonism at breast receptors further reduces theoretical risk, though caution remains prudent, especially with aromatase inhibitors [^fa8c59fd].

---

### Guidelines and expert consensus

- **Shared decision-making**: AUA/SUFU/AUGS, ACOG, and NAMS support low-dose vaginal estrogen after nonhormonal failure, with oncology input and individualized risk assessment [^94f99eef] [^7be8da43] [^442890bd].

- **Formulations**: Preferred options include 10 mcg estradiol tablets, 7.5 mcg estradiol ring, or ultra-low-dose estriol gel, aiming for minimal systemic exposure [^8a203215] [^2fdf4c3f].

- **Monitoring**: No routine endometrial surveillance is needed, but any postmenopausal bleeding warrants evaluation [^55fbc471].

---

### Practical recommendations

- **Start low**: Begin with the lowest effective dose (e.g. 10 mcg estradiol tablet twice weekly or ring every 90 days) and titrate to symptom control.

- **Application technique**: Place in the proximal lower third of the vagina to optimize local effect and limit absorption [^75e3db9d].

- **Reassess**: Review at 4–6 weeks; if effective, continue as needed, with periodic oncology follow-up.

## Systemic hormone therapy for vasomotor symptoms

### Risks and recommendations

Systemic hormone therapy is **contraindicated** after ER-positive breast cancer due to increased recurrence risk in randomized data (e.g. HABITS) [^f8ba8722]. Observational data conflict, but guideline bodies advise against routine systemic estrogen in this setting [^f8ba8722].

---

### Nonhormonal alternatives

- **SSRIs/SNRIs**: Venlafaxine, paroxetine, and citalopram reduce hot flashes; avoid paroxetine with tamoxifen due to CYP2D6 inhibition.

- **Gabapentin**: Effective for hot flashes, especially at night.

- **Fezolinetant**: A neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist, FDA-approved for vasomotor symptoms, with no estrogen activity.

- **Lifestyle**: Weight loss, smoking cessation, and cognitive behavioral therapy can modestly improve symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Counseling and shared decision-making

Counseling should **weigh benefits** — symptom relief, sexual function, and quality of life — against **uncertainties** — largely theoretical risks given minimal absorption and reassuring observational data [^40a96d4b] [^ea027fb0]. Include the oncologist in decisions, especially if considering vaginal estrogen during aromatase inhibitor therapy, where caution is greater [^7be8da43] [^faddb02b]. Document the discussion, rationale, and monitoring plan.

## Summary of recommendations

| **Symptom** | **Recommended therapy** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| GSM | Low-dose vaginal estrogen (tablet, ring, or ultra-low-dose estriol gel) | - Minimal systemic absorption <br/> - No increased recurrence in observational data <br/> - Effective symptom relief [^40a96d4b] [^ea027fb0] [^47d3fc18] |
| Hot flashes | Nonhormonal options (venlafaxine, gabapentin, fezolinetant) | Systemic estrogen increases recurrence risk; nonhormonal therapies are effective alternatives [^f8ba8722] [^875a6a21] |

---

Low-dose vaginal estrogen is **reasonable for severe GSM unresponsive to nonhormonal therapy** in ER-positive breast cancer survivors on tamoxifen, with shared decision-making and oncology input. Systemic hormone therapy is not recommended for hot flashes; use nonhormonal alternatives instead [^94f99eef] [^7be8da43] [^f8ba8722].

### A practical guide to the management of menopausal symptoms in breast cancer patients [^3bb21ba3]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in Canadian women. As a result of increased screening and improved treatment, more women are becoming long-term breast cancer survivors. However, due to either their treatment or prolonged survival, many of these women now have to face the consequences of premature menopause and prolonged estrogen deprivation. Hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy (HRT/ERT) has, in the past, been recommended to healthy women at menopause not only for relief of short-term menopausal changes, particularly hot flashes, but also for its benefits on bone density, fracture reduction, and genitourinary symptoms. Recent studies have demonstrated that not only is HRT associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer, but it also has been shown to increase the risk of recurrence in those with a breast cancer history. Until the safety of HRT/ERT in breast cancer patients can be more fully clarified, it would be wise to develop alternative strategies for the management of menopausal symptoms in these patients. This paper will discuss nonestrogen-based therapies for hot flashes, osteoporosis, and genitourinary symptoms, with emphasis on efficacy and safety in breast cancer survivors.

1and 60% of these are estrogen receptor –positive, compared with 80% being ER-positive in women older than the age of 50 years. 2Tamoxifen has been the mainstay of adjuvant endocrine treatment for many years, but recent developments with aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women have stimulated renewed interest in the role of estrogen suppression and its optimal duration as part of premenopausal endocrine therapy. In addition, tamoxifen was associated with a 39% reduction in the annual risk of developing a contralateral breast cancer in all ER-positive women. 7 Tamoxifen was shown to be associated with an increased incidence of thromboembolic disease and uterine cancers in the 2005 Overview and a nonsignificant excess mortality related to these.

10No advantage beyond 5 years was found, and indeed longer duration of tamoxifen use was associated with a significantly worse disease-free survival for patients still receiving tamoxifen than for those stopping after 5 years. The Overview shows that the incidence of uterine cancer increases with duration of treatment, but it should be noted that it does not confirm an increased risk of recurrence with prolonged tamoxifen administration beyond 5 years, and two large trials of tamoxifen duration are still ongoing. It should also be noted that the NSABP B-14 trial only involved node-negative patients, and there may be benefit to longer tamoxifen therapy in those patients with node-positive disease.

Updated but so far unpublished results from the Overview itself confirm that this PgR-negative subtype has a worse prognosis, but also show that the proportional benefit with tamoxifen is the same as for PgR-positive cancers. Likewise, two large postmenopausal adjuvant trials comparing tamoxifen with an aromatase inhibitor both show an adverse prognosis for PgR-negative cancers but also show proportionately the same benefit as for the much more common PgR-positive subtype. 18, 19 HER2 overexpression likewise carries an adverse prognosis. 20Data are limited on HER2 influence on adjuvant endocrine therapy in younger women, but in the presence of oophorectomy, adjuvant tamoxifen is reported as having the same outcome in patients with HER2-positive as with HER2-negative tumors.

21In the two postmenopausal adjuvant aromatase inhibitor trials referred to above, the small proportion who had HER2-positive cancers had a worse prognosis, but as with the PgR-negative subgroup, the proportional benefit with tamoxifen was the same as for the majority with HER2-negative cancers. 18, 19. Tamoxifen and Chemotherapy Chemotherapy has a central role in the adjuvant treatment of premenopausal women with early breast cancer, with an annual reduction in mortality of 38% for women younger than 50 years. 7The question is whether endocrine therapy can add to this benefit or even replace chemotherapy in those with ER-positive cancer. 26Tamoxifen significantly improved disease-free survival in the ER-positive cohort, although no overall survival difference emerged during the period of follow-up.

### Management of genitourinary syndrome of menopause in women with or at high risk for breast cancer: consensus recommendations from the North American Menopause Society and the international society for the study of women's sexual health [^041e4957]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) and The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health (ISSWSH) Expert Consensus Panel was to create a point of care algorithm for treating genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in women with or at high risk for breast cancer. The consensus recommendations will assist healthcare providers in managing GSM with a goal of improving the care and quality of life for these women. The Expert Consensus Panel is comprised of a diverse group of 16 multidisciplinary experts well respected in their fields. The panelists individually conducted an evidence-based review of the literature in their respective areas of expertise. They then met to discuss the latest treatment options for genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in survivors of breast cancer and review management strategies for GSM in women with or at high risk for breast cancer, using a modified Delphi method. This iterative process involved presentations summarizing the current literature, debate, and discussion of divergent opinions concerning GSM assessment and management, leading to the development of consensus recommendations for the clinician.Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is more prevalent in survivors of breast cancer, is commonly undiagnosed and untreated, and may have early onset because of cancer treatments or risk-reducing strategies. The paucity of evidence regarding the safety of vaginal hormone therapies in women with or at high risk for breast cancer has resulted in avoidance of treatment, potentially adversely affecting quality of life and intimate relationships. Factors influencing decision-making regarding treatment for GSM include breast cancer recurrence risk, severity of symptoms, response to prior therapies, and personal preference.We review current evidence for various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic modalities in women with a history of or at high risk for breast cancer and highlight the substantial gaps in the evidence for safe and effective therapies and the need for future research. Treatment of GSM is individualized, with nonhormone treatments generally being first line in this population. The use of local hormone therapies may be an option for some women who fail nonpharmacologic and nonhormone treatments after a discussion of risks and benefits and review with a woman's oncologist. We provide consensus recommendations for an approach to the management of GSM in specific patient populations, including women at high risk for breast cancer, women with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers, women with triple-negative breast cancers, and women with metastatic disease.

### Treatment of urogenital symptoms in individuals with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer: clinical consensus [^871d7f21]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

With an estimated 3.8 million breast cancer survivors in the United States, obstetrician-gynecologists often are on the front lines of addressing survivorship issues, including the hypoestrogenic-related adverse effects of cancer therapies or early menopause in survivors (1). Although systemic and vaginal estrogen are used widely for symptomatic relief of genitourinary syndrome of menopause in the general population, among individuals with a history of hormone-sensitive cancer, there is uncertainty about the safety of hormone-based therapy, leading many individuals with bothersome symptoms to remain untreated, with potential negative consequences on quality of life (2). An effective management strategy requires familiarity with a range of both hormonal and nonhormonal treatment options, knowledge about the pharmaceutical mechanisms of action, and the ability to tailor treatment based on individual risk factors. This clinical consensus document was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction with two authors specializing in urogynecology and gynecologic oncology. This document has been updated to review the safety and efficacy of newer hormonal treatment options as well as nonhormonal modalities.

### Endocrine therapy for surgeons: practical pearls for managing menopausal, bone loss and sexual adverse effects [^9f761e0c]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer patients are living longer than ever before and as such the population of breast cancer survivors continues to grow. Approximately 80% of breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and most patients will receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant estrogen blockade, referred to as endocrine therapy. Although endocrine therapy reduces HR+ breast cancer recurrence by 30-50%, significant adverse effects pose a threat to treatment adherence. These adverse effects include vasomotor symptoms, colloquially referred to as hot flashes, bone loss, joint arthralgias, genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), previously referred to as vaginal atrophy, and low libido. This review will present the evidence-based treatments available for each of these adverse effects, including clear treatment algorithms for GSM, which is often experienced by patients but overlooked by providers. The most important takeaway is to ask open-ended questions, encourage reporting of these symptoms, and refer patients to specialty providers as needed. Surgeons may be the first to encounter these symptoms, therefore it is critical to remain informed of the treatment options.

### Executive summary: the AUA / SUFU / AUGS guideline on genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^a619faef]. Urogynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) describes the symptoms and physical changes that result from declining estrogen and androgen concentrations in the genitourinary tract during the menopausal transition. This guideline provides information to clinicians regarding identification, diagnosis, counseling, and treatment for patients with GSM to optimize symptom control and quality of life while minimizing adverse events.

Methods

The systematic review used in the creation of this guideline is based on research conducted by the Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) under contract to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and funded by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute. The EPC synthesized effectiveness and/or harms outcomes from 68 publications. An additional 66 articles evaluating 46 nonhormonal interventions were described in an evidence map.

Results

Clinicians diagnose GSM based on symptoms, with or without related physical findings, and after ruling out other etiologies or co-occurring pathologies. There is a large body of evidence examining the use of hormonal and nonhormonal treatment options to manage the symptoms of GSM; however, the local low-dose vaginal estrogen has the most robust evidence base.

Conclusion

The strategies defined in this document were derived from evidence-based and consensus-based processes. Given that there is insufficient information to recommend one hormonal therapy over another, this guideline is not meant to support a stepwise progression through different hormonal approaches. The clinician should make treatment decisions in the context of shared decision-making, considering patient goals and preferences, using the evidence of efficacy and adverse events of each possible intervention as a guide.

### Executive summary of the early-onset breast cancer evidence review conference [^87eafbd4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EARLY-ONSET BREAST CANCER

Survivorship in women with early-onset breast cancer is a critical component to initial evaluation and treatment as well as ongoing care. Chemotherapy is often and variably responsible for chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea, menopause, or true ovarian failure, resulting in consequences such as infertility or subfertility, bone loss, and increased cardiac risk as well as menopausal symptoms, which can have a significant effect on quality of life. Age at diagnosis, receptor status, and treatment regimen are important considerations in managing ongoing care for women affected by early-onset breast cancer.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Society of Clinical Oncology have produced comprehensive guidelines for survivorship. The American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology jointly created survivorship guidelines after systematic review in 2015.Although not specific for early-onset breast cancer, ACOG provides resources about managing gynecologic issues in women with breast cancer, many of which are applicable for women with early-onset breast cancer.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations include use of nonhormonal interventions for symptomatic patients, because data are conflicting about the deleterious effects of hormone therapy on recurrence and overall survival rates.Although not specific to women with early-onset breast cancer, the North American Menopause Society and the International Society on Women's Sexual Health have co-authored recommendations regarding the treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause in women with breast cancer.

### Approach to the patient with menopausal symptoms [^3e96eb5e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Many women experience menopausal symptoms during the menopausal transition and postmenopausal years. Hot flashes, the most common symptom, typically resolve after several years, but for 15-20% of women, they interfere with quality of life. For these women, estrogen therapy, the most effective treatment for hot flashes, should be considered. The decision to use hormone therapy involves balancing the potential benefits of hormone therapy against its potential risks. Accumulating data suggest that initiation of estrogen many years after menopause is associated with excess coronary risk, whereas initiation soon after menopause is not. Therefore, most now agree that short-term estrogen therapy, using the lowest effective estrogen dose, is a reasonable option for recently menopausal women with moderate to severe symptoms who are in good cardiovascular health. Short-term therapy is considered to be not more than 4-5 yr because symptoms diminish after several years, whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with longer duration of hormone therapy. A minority of women may need long-term therapy for severe, persistent vasomotor symptoms after stopping hormone therapy. However, these women should first undergo trials of nonhormonal options such as gabapentin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, returning to estrogen only if these alternatives are ineffective or cause significant side effects. Low-dose vaginal estrogens are highly effective for genitourinary atrophy symptoms, with minimal systemic absorption and endometrial effects.

Hormone therapy after breast cancer—randomized trials, clinical cautions, and GSM management: Two RCTs reported conflicting outcomes, with one study showing an elevated risk of breast cancer recurrence in hormone therapy users after a median follow-up of 2.1 years (HR, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.5-8.1) and 4 years (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2), whereas the Stockholm Breast Cancer Study showed no effect on recurrence after median follow-up of 4.1 years (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.35-1.9) and 10.8 years (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9-1.9) but an increased risk of contralateral breast cancer (HR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.2-10.9). Although systemic use of hormone therapy in survivors of breast cancer is generally not advised, if symptoms of estrogen deficiency are severe and unresponsive to nonhormone options, women, in consultation with their oncologists, may choose hormone therapy after being fully informed about the risks and benefits; observational studies and meta-analyses have reported decreased or neutral recurrence and reduced mortality, with the confounding that lower-risk women are more likely to elect hormone therapy. For genitourinary syndrome of menopause, low-dose vaginal ET remains an effective option with minimal systemic absorption, and treatment with low-dose vaginal ET or DHEA may be considered if symptoms persist after an initial trial of nonhormone therapies and in consultation with an oncologist, with more concern for women on AIs.

### Treatment of urogenital symptoms in individuals with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer: clinical consensus [^fa8c59fd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Estrogen-dependent breast cancer—endocrine therapy mechanisms and implications for genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)—note that postmenopausal individuals are 'commonly treated with up to 10 years of an aromatase inhibitor (AI).' Tamoxifen 'acts as a selective estrogen antagonist in the breast, blocking estrogen at the receptor level,' whereas AIs 'block peripheral estrogen biosynthesis from androstenedione and testosterone,' and 'both forms of endocrine therapy are associated with GSM resulting from low estrogen levels,' with AI users having 'estrogen levels ... lower than levels typically associated with menopause.' Because exogenous estrogen effects 'would be expected to be blocked in those taking tamoxifen but not in those taking AIs,' systemic estrogen 'is generally considered contraindicated in individuals with a history of hormone receptor–positive breast cancer,' and 'this document focuses on the use of vaginal estrogen and other local vaginal treatment options.'

### Management of genitourinary syndrome of menopause in female cancer patients: a focus on vaginal hormonal therapy [^69b7d93e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is a condition describing the hypoestrogenic effects on the female genitals and lower urinary tract leading to symptoms such as vaginal dryness, vulvar and vaginal burning, dyspareunia and dysuria. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is experienced by over half of postmenopausal women, and is even more pervasive in women with cancer. Due to treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and hormonal therapy, women may experience early menopause resulting in earlier and more severe symptoms. Understanding the scope of this issue in female breast and gynecologic cancer survivors and identifying treatment options for this complex patient population are paramount. Tailored patient treatments include nonhormonal therapies (vaginal moisturizers, lubricants, pelvic floor physical therapy, dilator therapy, counseling), systemic and local hormonal therapies. Consensus recommendations by medical societies and associated evidence are reviewed, with emphasis on safety and efficacy of local vaginal hormonal therapies, and management variations noted depending on cancer type and characteristics. With knowledge and understanding of the unmet need associated with under-recognition and under-treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause, providers caring for women with cancer are in a position to improve the quality of life of their patients by providing safe and effective treatments.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 659: the use of vaginal estrogen in women with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer [^0a8e0a19]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Cancer treatment should address female-specific survivorship issues, including the hypoestrogenic- related adverse effects of cancer therapies or of natural menopause in survivors. Systemic and vaginal estrogen are widely used for symptomatic relief of vasomotor symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and lower urinary tract infections in the general population. However, given that some types of cancer are hormone sensitive, there are safety concerns about the use of local hormone therapy in women who currently have breast cancer or have a history of breast cancer. Nonhormonal approaches are the first-line choices for managing urogenital symptoms or atrophy-related urinary symptoms experienced by women during or after treatment for breast cancer. Among women with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer who are experiencing urogenital symptoms, vaginal estrogen should be reserved for those patients who are unresponsive to nonhormonal remedies. The decision to use vaginal estrogen may be made in coordination with a woman's oncologist. Additionally, it should be preceded by an informed decision-making and consent process in which the woman has the information and resources to consider the benefits and potential risks of low-dose vaginal estrogen. Data do not show an increased risk of cancer recurrence among women currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer or those with a personal history of breast cancer who use vaginal estrogen to relieve urogenital symptoms.

### Committee opinion: number 262, December 2001. risk of breast cancer with estrogen-progestin replacement therapy [^58fa1ca8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Recent articles have examined the association between the use of combination estrogen-progestin regimens for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the risk of breast cancer. The objective of this Committee Opinion is to evaluate critically the presented evidence. Although epidemiologic studies suggest that the addition of progestin to estrogens may increase the risk of breast cancer, this increased risk has not been proved. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend that HRT be considered as a treatment to relieve vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary tract atrophy and to reduce the risks and benefits of HRT. When considering the use of HRT for longer than 5 years, the clinician and individual patient should weigh the benefits versus the potential side effects and risks for that particular patient.

### Objective and subjective vulvovaginal symptoms in breast cancer patients (...) [^aca7b9d5]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract e24056 Background: Breast cancer and its treatment adversely impact sexual function and QoL. As more women become survivors, information is needed about vulvovaginal symptoms, sexual concerns and treatment options. Methods: An IRB Limited Waiver of Authorization was obtained to evaluate the medical records of 650 breast cancer patients with initial sexual medicine consults between 7/19/12 & 3/5/19. All women completed the Clinic Assessment form including a pelvic exam checklist, vulvovaginal tissue quality assessment /Vulvar Assessment Scale and sexual function measures at initial visit and 56% completed it at follow-up visits. R v3.
6. 1 was used to perform statistical analysis. Results: Women were categorized at initial consult as either postmenopausal, pre/perimenopausal or menopausal from ovarian suppression.

Median age at initial consult was 52 and median endocrine exposure ranged from 12 months on Tamoxifen only to 52 months on Tamoxifen followed by an AI. Of the total sample, 60% reported no confidence in future sexual activity and 68% reported pelvic pain with exam at initial consult. Improvements were seen at the first follow-up in confidence about intimacy and sexual health concerns. Vulvovaginal symptoms and dilator and vulvovaginal moisturizer use also improved from baseline to follow-up 1. The women most likely to attend first follow-up appointments were OS and PM women on AIs who also reported worse symptoms at baseline compared to pre/perimenopausal women on Tamoxifen. At initial presentation, PM on AIs and OS had poor exam outcomes respectively: pH > 5, poor vaginal elasticity, vaginal dryness, decreased rugosity and poor vascularity.

At initial consult, exam findings for pH, moisture, vulvar and vestibular irritation each correlated significantly with patient reported vaginal and vulvar symptoms. Conclusions: Breast cancer patients can benefit from coordinated multidisciplinary care addressing the long-term effects of premature menopause and endocrine therapy. Patient characteristics such as menopausal status and type/duration of endocrine therapy should be considered when assessing sexual health since aromatase inhibitors and ovarian suppression appear to worsen clinical exam and patient reported outcomes. Sexual health counseling and treatment can help women cope with sexual concerns during and after breast cancer therapy.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) management—For postmenopausal women with symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy, we suggest a trial of vaginal moisturizers to be used at least twice weekly, and for women who do not produce sufficient vaginal secretions for comfortable sexual activity, we suggest vaginal lubricants. For women without a history of hormone-(estrogen) dependent cancers whose GSM symptoms, including vulvovaginal atrophy, persist despite using vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, we recommend low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. In women with a history of breast or endometrial cancer whose symptomatic GSM does not respond to nonhormonal therapies, we suggest a shared decision-making approach that includes the treating oncologist to discuss using low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. For women taking raloxifene, without a history of hormone- (estrogen) dependent cancers, who develop GSM symptoms that do not respond to nonhormonal therapies, we suggest adding low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy, and for women using low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy, we suggest against adding a progestogen (ie, no need for adding progestogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia). For women using vaginal estrogen therapy who report postmenopausal bleeding or spotting, we recommend prompt evaluation for endometrial pathology.

### Management of male breast cancer: ASCO guideline [^cfcb3ab2]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASCO male breast cancer guideline—endocrine therapy toxicity management states that management of endocrine therapy toxicity is similar to the approach used for women (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate), and that testosterone/androgen supplementation should not be used by men with breast cancer (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). There is no evidence from clinical trials in men with breast cancer to inform clinical questions regarding the optimal management of endocrine therapy toxicity in men, and the consensus review identified four studies of adverse effects, including an increased incidence of thrombotic events in men treated with tamoxifen, more than 80% of which occurred in the first 18 months after the start of treatment, and a high rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects. For hot flashes, venlafaxine has been shown to be an effective treatment of hot flashes in men with prostate cancer who were receiving GnRH analogs and may be effective in reducing hot flashes in men with breast cancer treated with tamoxifen or GnRH analogs. With respect to testosterone, its conversion to estrogen by aromatase raises concern about its use among men with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer, and use of exogenous testosterone for hypogonadism among men with a history of hormone receptor–positive breast cancer should follow an informed discussion about the potential benefits and risks of this treatment, considering the patient's residual risk of breast cancer recurrence.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^8f7033e5]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

North American Menopause Society (NAMS) 2022 hormone therapy position statement—Hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture; risks differ by type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used, and treatment should be individualized with periodic reevaluation. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and prevention of bone loss, whereas for women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or who are aged older than 60 years, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia; longer duration of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS, with shared decision-making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies in women without indications for use of systemic hormone therapy, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies (eg, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone or oral ospemifene) are recommended.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^995d5342]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy—discontinuation: Controversy exists regarding how long hormone therapy may safely be used and when it should be discontinued. Based on WHI findings, breast cancer risk becomes detectable after 3 to 5 years in women using estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT), whereas for women without a uterus using estrogen therapy (ET) alone, breast cancer risk did not increase after 7 years, so a longer duration of hormone therapy use may be acceptable. There are few studies to guide the optimal way to stop, and vasomotor symptoms (VMS) will recur in approximately 50% of women after discontinuation; data directly comparing abrupt versus tapered discontinuation are lacking, although clinical experts generally advise gradually decreasing hormone therapy doses over time. If hormone therapy is being used for prevention of osteoporosis, protection against bone density loss and fracture prevention is lost rapidly with discontinuation. Although VMS generally improve with time, genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) worsens with prolonged estrogen deficiency, observational studies confirm the long-term safety of low-dose vaginal ET as a highly effective treatment for GSM, and, in the absence of contraindications, a woman should determine her preferred hormone therapy formulation, dose, and duration of use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-making with her healthcare professional.

### The 2017 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^266511ea]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) updates the 2012 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2012 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of HT differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized to identify the most appropriate HT type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use, using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing or discontinuing HT.For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is most favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for those at elevated risk for bone loss or fracture. For women who initiate HT more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or are aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS or bone loss, with shared decision making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome GSM symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies and without indications for use of systemic HT, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies are recommended.This NAMS position statement has been endorsed by Academy of Women's Health, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Association of Nurse Practitioners, American Medical Women's Association, American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Asociación Mexicana para el Estudio del Climaterio, Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, Australasian Menopause Society, Chinese Menopause Society, Colegio Mexicano de Especialistas en Ginecologia y Obstetricia, Czech Menopause and Andropause Society, Dominican Menopause Society, European Menopause and Andropause Society, German Menopause Society, Groupe d'études de la ménopause et du vieillissement Hormonal, HealthyWomen, Indian Menopause Society, International Menopause Society, International Osteoporosis Foundation, International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health, Israeli Menopause Society, Japan Society of Menopause and Women's Health, Korean Society of Menopause, Menopause Research Society of Singapore, National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health, SOBRAC and FEBRASGO, SIGMA Canadian Menopause Society, Società Italiana della Menopausa, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, South African Menopause Society, Taiwanese Menopause Society, and the Thai Menopause Society.

### The 2020 genitourinary syndrome of menopause position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^0b291bc8]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update and expand the 2013 position statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) on the management of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), of which symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is a component.

Methods

A Panel of acknowledged experts in the field of genitourinary health reviewed the literature to evaluate new evidence on vaginal hormone therapies as well as on other management options available or in development for GSM. A search of PubMed was conducted identifying medical literature on VVA and GSM published since the 2013 position statement on the role of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for VVA in postmenopausal women. The Panel revised and added recommendations on the basis of current evidence. The Panel's conclusions and recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause affects approximately 27% to 84% of postmenopausal women and can significantly impair health, sexual function, and quality of life. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is likely underdiagnosed and undertreated. In most cases, symptoms can be effectively managed. A number of over-the-counter and government-approved prescription therapies available in the United States and Canada demonstrate effectiveness, depending on the severity of symptoms. These include vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, vaginal estrogens and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), systemic hormone therapy, and the estrogen agonist/antagonist ospemifene. Long-term studies on the endometrial safety of vaginal estrogen, vaginal DHEA, and ospemifene are lacking. There are insufficient placebo-controlled trials of energy-based therapies, including laser, to draw conclusions on efficacy and safety or to make treatment recommendations.

Conclusions

Clinicians can resolve many distressing genitourinary symptoms and improve sexual health and the quality of life of postmenopausal women by educating women about, diagnosing, and appropriately managing GSM. Choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, the effectiveness and safety of treatments for the individual patient, and patient preference. Nonhormone therapies available without a prescription provide sufficient relief for most women with mild symptoms. Low-dose vaginal estrogens, vaginal DHEA, systemic estrogen therapy, and ospemifene are effective treatments for moderate to severe GSM. When low-dose vaginal estrogen or DHEA or ospemifene is administered, a progestogen is not indicated; however, endometrial safety has not been studied in clinical trials beyond 1 year. There are insufficient data at present to confirm the safety of vaginal estrogen or DHEA or ospemifene in women with breast cancer; management of GSM should consider the woman's needs and the recommendations of her oncologist.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^75e3db9d]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)—vaginal estrogen therapy (ET) use, formulations, and oncology considerations—Estrogen therapy, specifically vaginal ET, is an effective treatment for GSM, with no evidence to suggest a difference in safety or efficacy between the various vaginal ET preparations. Low-dose vaginal ET preparations include creams, tablets, rings, and a softgel vaginal insert; all contain estradiol, and one cream contains CEE. One ring is available for long-term (3 mo) delivery of low-dose estradiol to the vagina, whereas another aims to provide systemic levels; available low-dose vaginal estradiol products result in minimal systemic absorption. For administration, it is preferred to insert vaginal products (except the vaginal ring) in the proximal, lower third of the vagina to improve efficacy for genitourinary symptoms and attenuate estradiol absorption. In women with breast cancer, the decision to use low-dose vaginal ET should be made in conjunction with their oncologists, which is particularly important for those on aromatase inhibitors; an observational trial of survivors on tamoxifen or aromatase therapy using low-dose vaginal ET reported 3.5 years’ mean follow-up without increased risk. A progestogen is generally not indicated with low-dose vaginal ET for GSM, although clinical trial data supporting endometrial safety beyond 1 year are lacking; approved nonestrogen options for dyspareunia include ospemifene and intravaginal DHEA.

### Treatment of urogenital symptoms in individuals with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer: clinical consensus [^8a203215]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Hormonal treatment options—If nonhormonal treatments have failed to adequately address symptoms, after discussion of risks and benefits, low-dose vaginal estrogen may be used in individuals with a history of breast cancer, including those taking tamoxifen, and for individuals taking aromatase inhibitors (AIs), low-dose vaginal estrogen can be used after shared decision making between the patient, gynecologist, and oncologist. Low-dose options include an estradiol-releasing vaginal ring, 10-microgram estradiol vaginal tablets or inserts, and comparable low doses of vaginal estrogen cream, with formulations associated with serum estradiol levels of less than 20 pg/mL being the 4-microgram estradiol insert, 7.5-microgram estradiol ring, and 10-microgram estradiol inserts and tablets; other regimens reviewed were estriol 0.25 mg twice a week and 12.5-microgram estradiol vaginal tablets twice a week. To date, there is no evidence to indicate harm from these local treatments, and when serum estradiol levels were evaluated in 10 studies on AIs, most showed only a transient increase resolving within 12 weeks or no increase at all, with only one study reporting sustained increases in two of six participants at 7 and 12 weeks of use.

This article applies the current state of evidence for postmenopausal estrogen use to management decisions in 2 clinical scenarios initiating therapy in a perimenopausal woman with hot flashes and discontinuing estrogen use in a long-term user.

### Managing patients on endocrine therapy: focus on quality-of-life issues [^6f7ea204]. Clinical Cancer Research (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the health-related quality of life (QOL) of women treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy.

Experimental Design

To review the limited QOL data from randomized trials of tamoxifen versus placebo and ovarian ablation versus none. To discuss QOL results from randomized trials of aromatase inhibitors compared with tamoxifen or placebo for adjuvant therapy of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer.

Results

QOL is generally good in up to 3 years of follow-up with either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. Vasomotor and sexual complaints remain problematic, however, in only a small proportion of women. There are fewer data regarding the QOL effects of ovarian ablation, which may nonetheless be more substantial.

Conclusion

Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors cause specific vasomotor or gynecologic symptoms, which may affect sexual function. However, clinical benefits of these agents are generally achieved without major detrimental effect on overall QOL.

### Genitourinary syndrome of menopause in breast cancer survivors: a common complication with effective treatment strategies | JCO oncology practice (...) [^2f69786a]. ASCO (2019). Medium credibility.

Accompanying ArticleCLINICAL REVIEWSManaging Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause in Breast Cancer Survivors Receiving Endocrine Therapy Hormone receptor–positive cancer is the most common subtype of breast cancer that we encounter in clinical practice. Endocrine therapy—tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, fulvestrant—forms the cornerstone of treatment and has resulted in excellent outcomes for patients with breast cancer in terms of reduced risk of recurrence of disease and improved survival. 1Although highly effective, it can result in genitourinary syndrome of menopause that can adversely affect quality of life. The term GSM was coined to encompass a constellation of vulvovaginal and genitourinary symptoms—vaginal itching, irritation, dryness, dyspareunia—that result from estrogen loss in postmenopausal patients and the ensuing structural and physiologic alterations in the vaginal mucosa and genital structures.

This is also applicable to patients who have these symptoms while receiving endocrine therapy for breast cancer, more often with aromatase inhibitors than tamoxifen or fulvestrant, primarily because of differences in mechanism of action. Aromatase inhibitors reduce peripheral estrogen synthesis, whereas tamoxifen and fulvestrant are selective estrogen receptor modulators. Studies have shown that up to 60% of postmenopausal and 40% of premenopausal breast cancer survivors suffer from GSM. 2Patients are often skeptical about bringing this up with their oncologist, either because of sexual embarrassment or considering it as part of natural aging. The increased risk of recurrence of breast cancer has swayed oncologists from prescribing estrogen replacement. As highlighted in the accompanying review article by Sussman et al, 4this is an important complication of endocrine therapy for breast cancer, which has multiple effective and fairly safe treatment options.
3.

The choice of treatment of GSM depends on the severity of symptoms. We treat mild symptoms with nonhormonal therapies, which is in line with the recommendation by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Vaginal moisturizers and lubricants work effectively by reducing friction and irritation, whereas pH-balancing gels help by reducing the vaginal pH and restoring vaginal mucosa. 4Hyaluronic acid gel and CO 2laser therapy are other options, which are still being studied. Because estrogen depletion is the primary cause of GSM, replacement with systemic estrogen was believed to be an attractive option. Multiple randomized trials investigated their role but found a statistically significant increase in risk of breast cancer recurrence and higher rates of cardiovascular disease, without showing a true benefit in terms of GSM. 5, 6Hence, we have refrained from using systemic estrogen replacement as an option for breast cancer survivors with symptoms of GSM.

Topical estrogen-based therapies have been extensively studied in postmenopausal patients with GSM, but data in breast cancer survivors are not as robust. The dilemma has always been whether there is any systemic absorption and if that translates into a worse outcome in terms of breast cancer recurrence. Some studies showed that intravaginal estrogen did not result in a statistically significant increase in serum estradiol levels, whereas others showed that although the levels of estradiol may increase, they are not sustained for a prolonged period. Importantly, there was no convincing evidence for increased risk of breast cancer recurrence, especially with topical therapy containing estrogen alone. 7Despite this, given the lack of high-level data, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends caution with vaginal estrogen use, especially in breast cancer survivors.

Future research priorities for GSM after estrogen-dependent breast cancer—Available evidence suggest that low-dose vaginal estrogen is safe in individuals with a history of hormone receptor–positive breast cancer who are at low risk of recurrence, but the low incidence of recurrence and extended follow-up needs mean large prospective longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these treatments are associated with any increased risk of recurrence. In addition, further research is needed on psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressants, and on the safety and efficacy of newer agents such as ospemifene and alternative treatments such as laser therapy to manage GSM. Finally, because existing studies have evaluated effectiveness among predominately White patients, additional studies are needed to assess whether findings are generalizable to all racial and ethnic groups.

Endometrial surveillance in GSM is addressed as follows: 24. Clinicians should not perform endometrial surveillance in patients with GSM solely due to their use of local low-dose vaginal estrogen, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), or ospemifene. (Expert Opinion) There is no data to suggest that screening for endometrial hyperplasia or cancer in average risk patients with GSM on local hormone treatment is beneficial, and a 2014 Practice Bulletin from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) affirms that local low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy does not require endometrial surveillance. Screening for endometrial cancer is not recommended for women on systemic hormone therapy or tamoxifen. Patients with any postmenopausal bleeding (PMB), who are using local low-dose vaginal estrogen for GSM, should notify their clinician and undergo evaluation, and most cases of endometrial cancer (85%) are diagnosed at low stage because of symptoms.

### Addressing the needs of breast cancer survivors [^b527ed28]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

In advanced cases, symptoms may be attributable to vaginal stenosis or shortening and the patient may not be able to engage in sexual activity. For such cases, low-dose vaginal hormones (estradiol or dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA] have been studied. This is postulated to enhance collagen remodeling and augment elasticity and mucosal thickness. In conjunction with this, vaginal dilators may be used (recommended usage is three times each week for 10 min in each session).

In situations where symptoms are refractory to non-hormonal pharmacological and non-pharmacological options, vaginal estradiol can be considered an effective management option for GSM. However, there is a concern for potential systemic absorption and elevation of serum estradiol levels which raises concerns for its utilization in patients with a breast cancer history. Utilizing lower doses of commercially available vaginal estrogens and application following nonhormonal moisturizer use to allow for mucosal atrophy recovery may help mitigate the risk of absorption. A large case-controlled study showed no increased risk of breast cancer recurrence with vaginal estrogen use. Similarly, a large observational Danish Cohort study of postmenopausal women with early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who received systemic or local estrogen for endocrine-related genitourinary syndrome did not show an elevated recurrence risk or death. However, among patients using vaginal estrogen therapy while receiving aromatase inhibitors, there was a higher observed risk of cancer recurrence, although this did not translate into an increased risk of mortality. In conclusion, there may be a potential risk of breast cancer recurrence from using vaginal estrogen; this should be carefully weighed against the risk of recurrence due to stopping endocrine therapy secondary to side effects.

### Management of menopausal symptoms [^c5079fc6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Most menopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms with bothersome symptoms often lasting longer than one decade. Hormone therapy (HT) represents the most effective treatment for these symptoms with oral and transdermal estrogen formulations having comparable efficacy. Findings from the Women's Health Initiative and other recent randomized clinical trials have helped to clarify the benefits and risks of combination estrogen-progestin and estrogen-alone therapy. Absolute risks observed with HT tended to be small, especially in younger women. Neither regimen increased all-cause mortality rates. Given the lower rates of adverse events on HT among women close to menopause onset and at lower baseline risk of cardiovascular disease, risk stratification and personalized risk assessment appear to represent a sound strategy for optimizing the benefit-risk profile and safety of HT. Systemic HT should not be arbitrarily stopped at age 65 years; instead treatment duration should be individualized based on patients' risk profiles and personal preferences. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause represents a common condition that adversely affects the quality of life of many menopausal women. Without treatment, symptoms worsen over time. Low-dose vaginal estrogen represents highly effective treatment for this condition. Because custom-compounded hormones have not been tested for efficacy or safety, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved HT is preferred. A low-dose formulation of paroxetine mesylate currently represents the only nonhormonal medication FDA-approved to treat vasomotor symptoms. Gynecologists and other clinicians who remain abreast of data addressing the benefit-risk profile of hormonal and nonhormonal treatments can help menopausal women make sound choices regarding management of menopausal symptoms.

### The role of local vaginal estrogen for treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women: 2007 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^135bfd32]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To create an evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) on the role of local vaginal estrogen therapy (ET) for the treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this document. A panel of clinicians and researchers acknowledged to be experts in the field of genitourinary disease was enlisted to review, synthesize, and interpret the current evidence on vaginal ET for vaginal atrophy, develop conclusions, and make recommendations. Their advice was used to assist the NAMS Board of Trustees in publishing this position statement.

Results

Randomized controlled trials, albeit limited, have shown that low-dose, local vaginal estrogen delivery is effective and well tolerated for treating vaginal atrophy. All of the low-dose vaginal estrogen products approved in the United States for treatment of vaginal atrophy are equally effective at the doses recommended in labeling.

Conclusions

The choice of therapy should be guided by clinical experience and patient preference. Progestogen is generally not indicated when low-dose estrogen is administered locally for vaginal atrophy. Data are insufficient to recommend annual endometrial surveillance in asymptomatic women using vaginal ET. Vaginal ET should be continued for women as long as distressful symptoms remain. For women treated for non-hormone-dependent cancer, management of vaginal atrophy is similar to that for women without a cancer history. For women with a history of hormone-dependent cancer, management recommendations are dependent upon each woman's preference in consultation with her oncologist.

Perimenopausal care—counseling, testing, and treatment: Providers should be able to offer basic guidance about what to expect during perimenopause, counsel on lifestyle changes to help mitigate symptoms, and therapeutic options, either directly or by referral, and should advise that pregnancy can still occur during perimenopause; patients wishing to avoid pregnancy should be offered contraceptive counseling. Perimenopause lasts four years on average and is often associated with irregular menses, vaginal dryness, vasomotor instability, sleep disturbances, mood changes, and other symptoms. Laboratory testing, including testing for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, is not helpful in diagnosing menopause or determining fertility and should be avoided. Lifestyle changes include smoking cessation, sleep hygiene, maintaining a lower ambient temperature, and using non-estrogen water- or silicone-based vaginal lubricants. Systemic hormone therapy with estrogen, with or without progestin, has been shown to be the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats, as well as protecting against bone loss; any patient with a uterus who uses systemic estrogen therapy should also use progestin to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Progestin can be administered continuously or intermittently through a variety of delivery systems, including orally or via intrauterine device. Local estrogen is the most effective treatment for genitourinary symptoms of menopause, and clinicians should consider non-hormonal medical management of vasomotor symptoms with medications like paroxetine and fezolinetant for patients who prefer non-hormonal management or those ineligible for hormone therapy. Both NAMS and ACOG also offer fact sheets and other information for patients.

### Clinical management of adverse events in adjuvant therapy for hormone-responsive early breast cancer [^e2fcf66f]. Annals of Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Systemic adjuvant therapy has proven highly effective at reducing recurrences and deaths in patients who have received primary therapy for early breast cancer. However, as with all treatments, adjuvant therapy can cause unwanted side effects, and effective management of these events is essential to ensure that patients comply with, and continue, treatment. Adjuvant endocrine therapy is not associated with the more severe, acute toxicities of chemotherapy, and can therefore be taken for many years. At present, the standard duration of postoperative adjuvant endocrine therapy is 5 years. Prevention and treatment of adverse events associated with long-term endocrine therapy is particularly important in the adjuvant setting, where patients are clinically cancer free. In this situation, the efficacy benefits are not, therefore, obvious to the patient, but side effects may have a negative impact on daily life. Tamoxifen has been the gold standard endocrine therapy for hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer for many years, and the long-term side effects of this agent are well documented. In recent years, the aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have begun to displace tamoxifen as the adjuvant therapy of choice, owing to greater efficacy and good tolerability. Predictably, the AIs and tamoxifen have partially overlapping side-effect profiles. Both therapies are associated with typical symptoms of estrogen deprivation; however, tamoxifen also has estrogenic activity in some tissues, which can cause either detrimental (genital tract) or beneficial (bone, cardiovascular system, lipids) effects that are not associated with AI use. To reduce treatment discontinuations, it is important that patients are made aware of the possible side effects of adjuvant therapy and the management strategies available to them, prior to starting therapy. The role of physical, alternative and pharmaceutical therapies in the management of adverse events associated with endocrine therapy has been investigated, and strategies are now available to alleviate symptoms and enable patients to benefit from adjuvant endocrine therapy without a significant adverse impact on quality of life.

Principles of gynecologic survivorship—clinical approach and supportive care specify that all gynecologic cancer survivors should receive regular general medical care that focuses on managing chronic disease, monitoring cardiovascular risk factors, providing recommended vaccinations, and encouraging adoption of a healthy lifestyle. To assess late and long-term effects, clinicians should comprehensively document the patient’s history, conduct a thorough physical examination, and provide any necessary imaging and/or laboratory testing, and all patients, whether sexually active or not, should be asked about genitourinary symptoms, including vulvovaginal dryness. Referral to appropriate specialty providers is recommended. Post-radiation use of vaginal dilators and moisturizers is recommended, and local vaginal estrogen may be considered if symptomatic. For treatment-related menopause, hormone therapy should be considered. Communication and coordination with all clinicians involved in the care of survivors is critical, and providing cancer survivors with a summary of their treatment and recommendations for follow-up is recommended.

### Study of sexual quality of life in women with breast (...) [^699c14f1]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Study of Sexual Quality of Life in Women With Breast Cancer Who Had Multidisciplinary Management With Photobiomodulation for Genitourinary Syndrome of the Menopause ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The treatment of breast cancer as well as the disease are responsible for genito-urinary symptoms that can persist over time and impair quality of life. Given the improved prognosis of breast cancer, more and more patients are confronted with specific post-cancer issues, and the care has become a major health challenge. Sexual health is a crucial component of well-being and overall quality of life. Vaginal dryness and dyspareunia are symptoms frequently found in patients treated for breast cancer, with chemotherapy and hormone therapy as risk factors. However, the treatment of sexual disorders remains underdeveloped in France.

Vaginal dryness is part of a broader syndrome known as genitourinary syndrome of menopause, or vulvovaginal atrophy, which may combine vulvovaginal, sexual and urinary symptoms secondary to hypoestrogenemia, exacerbated by breast cancer treatments. Since hormonal treatments are contraindicated, the first-line treatment for GSM in patients treated for breast cancer is the application of non-hormonal trophic treatments. However, these treatments are often insufficient to provide effective relief. There is therefore growing interest in the development of second-line treatments for GSM: intra-vaginal hyaluronic acid injections, laser, photobiomodulation, etc. PBM using Light Emitting Diodes has been proposed as an alternative treatment for genitourinary syndrome of the menopause.

The tissues are exposed to light sources in the visible spectrum, inducing non-thermal, non-cytotoxic biological effects that improve vaginal tissue trophicity. In line with previous studies of sexual quality of life carried out at the center, and in the context of the recent establishment of our multidisciplinary network for the 2nd-line treatment of genitourinary menopausal syndrome with Photobiomodulation, we would like to carry out a descriptive study of the sexual QoL of patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer and benefiting from this oncosexological support. However, the disease and its treatment are responsible for symptoms that can persist over time and impair quality of life. Given the improved prognosis of breast cancer, more and more patients are confronted with the specific problems of the post-cancer period, and care for them has become a major health issue, highlighted in international recommendations and in Cancer Plans since 2003.

Sexual health is a crucial component of well-being and overall quality of life. Sexual quality of life is frequently impaired after cancer treatment. A large-scale survey carried out in France showed that sexual quality of life remained impaired in almost two thirds of patients 2 years and 5 years after cancer diagnosis, all sites combined. An abundance of literature underlines the high frequency of sexuality and intimacy disorders in patients treated for breast cancer, from diagnosis, throughout treatment and into the post-cancer period. Sexual health is a complex issue, influenced by multiple factors such as education, beliefs, socio-cultural factors, intimacy, relationship with partner, physical and psychological well-being, body image, and personal and gender identity. These multiple factors can be disrupted, modified and altered as a result of cancer diagnosis and treatment.

### Hormone therapy and other treatments for symptoms of menopause [^a495ac76]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

The results of large clinical trials have led physicians and patients to question the safety of hormone therapy for menopause. In the past, physicians prescribed hormone therapy to improve overall health and prevent cardiac disease, as well as for symptoms of menopause. Combined estrogen/progestogen therapy, but not estrogen alone, increases the risk of breast cancer when used for more than three to five years. Therefore, in women with a uterus, it is recommended that physicians prescribe combination therapy only to treat menopausal symptoms such as vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) and vaginal atrophy, using the smallest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Although estrogen is the most effective treatment for hot flashes, nonhormonal alternatives such as low-dose paroxetine, venlafaxine, and gabapentin are effective alternatives. Women with a uterus who are using estrogen should also take a progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Women who cannot tolerate adverse effects of progestogens may benefit from a combined formulation of estrogen and the selective estrogen receptor modulator bazedoxifene. There is no highquality, consistent evidence that yoga, paced respiration, acupuncture, exercise, stress reduction, relaxation therapy, and alternative therapies such as black cohosh, botanical products, omega-3 fatty acid supplements, and dietary Chinese herbs benefit patients more than placebo. One systematic review suggests modest improvement in hot flashes and vaginal dryness with soy products, and small studies suggest that clinical hypnosis significantly reduces hot flashes. Patients with genitourinary syndrome of menopause may benefit from vaginal estrogen, nonhormonal vaginal moisturizers, or ospemifene (the only nonhormonal treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for dyspareunia due to menopausal atrophy). The decision to use hormone therapy depends on clinical presentation, a thorough evaluation of the risks and benefits, and an informed discussion with the patient.

### Risks and benefits of therapy with menopausal hormones versus selective estrogen-receptor modulators in peri-and postmenopausal women at increased breast cancer risk [^cdca02f8]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Decision making about menopausal therapies is complex because of the number of clinical factors that must be considered. Menopausal hormone therapy can relieve the vasomotor symptoms of menopause, but the most common preparation, combination estrogen and progesterone, increases the risk of breast cancer. Both tamoxifen and raloxifene can reduce the risk of developing invasive breast cancer, but the adverse effects of these drugs differ substantially. Risk models have been built to identify women at high risk for developing breast cancer, but their application in clinical practice has been develop disappointingly low. We propose an approach for identifying and managing menopausal women at high risk for breast cancer that can be readily implemented in clinical practice. The first step is to identify women at sufficiently high risk for breast cancer to merit treatment. For women aged 45 or older, the presence of one or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer and one or more previous breast biopsies will identify those whose 5-year risk is 2% or higher. For women 55 years or older, the presence of either one of these risk factors is sufficient. Any woman with a family history of breast cancer should be assessed as to whether she is likely to carry a BRCA mutation and referred for genetic counseling and possible genetic testing. Decisions about treatment options should be based on the presence or absence of bothersome vasomotor symptoms, an intact uterus, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. A simple algorithm is presented to streamline identification and management of menopausal women at high risk for breast cancer.

Introduction

Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause or vulvovaginal atrophy is commonly reported in women with a history of breast cancer, with up to 75% of breast cancer survivors reporting at least one genitourinary symptom. This constellation of symptoms includes: vaginal dryness; vaginal itch or burning; dysuria; urinary urgency; urinary incontinence; dyspareunia; loss of libido; and dysfunction of arousal and orgasm.

Genitourinary symptoms (GUS) can be caused or exacerbated by breast cancer treatment. Chemotherapy-induced premature menopause, ovarian function suppression and aromatase inhibitors are most implicated. Chronic oestrogen depletion changes the female genital tract through reduced blood flow and secretions, increased pH, thinning of the epithelium, and loss of elasticity. GUS can result in poor adherence and premature cessation of endocrine therapy and can negatively impact health-related quality of life and sexual function.

Several treatment options are available for GUS including non-hormone based vaginal moisturisers and lubricants, oral and transdermal systemic menopausal hormone therapy, vaginal oestrogens, and vaginal laser. For women with a history of breast cancer, particularly hormone driven cancers, systemic hormone therapy is not advised and vaginal oestrogen-based treatments are often avoided due to concerns that such treatments may stimulate cancer growth, increasing breast cancer recurrences. However existing evidence suggests vaginal oestrogens are probably safe in women with breast cancer, with studies showing no increased risk of de novo breast cancer or breast cancer recurrence. International guidelines and position statements from various groups support use of vaginal oestrogens for GUS in women with breast cancer, when non-hormonal interventions (e.g. moisturisers and/or lubricants) are ineffective. Despite this, vaginal oestrogen product labelling continues to include a warning against use in women with breast cancer; consequently many women avoid their use.

Medical professionals who care for women with breast cancer are frequently required to manage GUS despite most having little or no training in this. A cross-sectional survey of medical professionals involved in the care of women with breast cancer in Australia and New Zealand found that despite GUS being recognised as common in this population only 16% felt confident managing these symptoms.

The aim of this study was to determine the experiences of GUS in women with breast cancer. Better understanding of patients’ experience will help inform future approaches to patient care, development of treatment guidelines, and implementation of medical recommendations.

Clinical management during menopausal hormone therapy (MHT)—For women with persistent unscheduled bleeding while taking MHT, we recommend evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology, most importantly, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and we recommend informing women about the possible increased risk of breast cancer during and after discontinuing EPT while emphasizing adherence to age-appropriate breast cancer screening. Regular clinical follow-up, initially, within 1 to 3 months after starting MHT, and then every 6 to 12 months, allows monitoring of efficacy and side effects and treatment adjustments as needed.

### From diagnosis to survivorship addressing the sexuality of women during cancer [^d31513e3]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause

The genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) includes vaginal and vulvar dryness, decreased lubrication, vaginal narrowing or shortening, and urinary symptoms. GSM is common in patients who are affected by cancer and is caused by cancer treatments and menopause.Non-hormonal moisturizers, lubricants, and low-dose local vaginal hormones are used to treat GSM. Use of a vaginal moisturizer containing hyaluronic acid three to five times per week can improve vulvovaginal tissue and sexual function. Patients should be educated about the appropriate use of vaginal lubricants, including recommendations of products with the appropriate pH of around 4.5 for vaginal products and osmolality of <1200 mOsm/kg as recommended by the World Health Organization, as well as the differences between water and silicone-based lubricants.The use of local vaginal hormones in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is included in all the noted guidelines after a discussion of risks and benefits with the patient. Both a cohort study and a nested case-control study did not show an increased risk of cancer recurrence in patients with breast cancer on endocrine therapy who used vaginal estrogen when comparing quantity of use to non-use respectively. The Danish observational cohort study reported that while, overall, women with breast cancer who used local estrogen did not have an increased risk of cancer recurrence, the subgroup of patients on aromatase inhibitors did have an increased risk of cancer recurrence (1.39 [95% CI = 1.04-1.85), without an increase in mortality.Limitations of this study include that the doses of vaginal estrogen were not reported and may have been higher than the currently used low-dose vaginal estrogen, the study period pre-dated HER2 testing, which significantly affects the risk of recurrence, and that many patients were treated without any endocrine therapy.Another more recent retrospective study evaluated a group of 42 113 women diagnosed with genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) following a breast cancer diagnosis, of which 3.9% utilized prescriptions for vaginal estrogen.The risk of recurrence was comparable between vaginal estrogen and the control group. Among the 10 584 patients with documented estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, 3.9% used vaginal estrogen, and the risk of recurrence was similar. In a very small subgroup of patients identified to have concurrent prescriptions for vaginal estrogen and an aromatase inhibitor, there was an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence; however, results were not controlled for stage, grade, or nodal status.Lastly, a recent study of 49 237 women with breast cancer with 5% of patients using vaginal estrogen therapy found no increased risk of breast cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.94).

### Treatment of urogenital symptoms in individuals with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer: clinical consensus [^edd53ecf]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Health inequities—GSM care after breast cancer—are described with demographic and adherence disparities: 'the average age of diagnosis of breast cancer is slightly younger in Black women (56 years) when compared with White women (59 years),' 'suggesting that endocrine therapy may result in more severe symptoms among Black women, because younger women may experience a greater change in estrogen levels.' 'Lower initiation and adherence rates to endocrine therapy have been reported among Black, Hispanic, and Asian women compared with White women,' due to factors 'including lack of recommendation by health professionals, fear of adverse effects, and cost.' In a survey 'of 743 breast cancer survivors, 40% of those who discontinued endocrine therapy cited adverse effects as the main reason for stopping,' and because adjuvant endocrine therapy 'has been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence by approximately 40%,' nonadherence may heighten recurrence risk. Barriers such as 'health insurance, out-of-pocket cost of medications, and socioeconomic status, can affect access,' and clinicians 'should be knowledgeable about adverse effects ... and take a proactive approach' to support adherence; studies 'should strive to include a diverse cohort of participants.'

### Vaginal estrogen therapy use and survival in breast cancer (...) [^40a96d4b]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

eMethods. eResults. eTable. Additional Patient Characteristics by HRT Use After Diagnosis in Patients eFigure. Figure Illustrating the Study Design for the Main Analysis of Vaginal Estrogen Therapy eReferences Data Sharing Statement Question Do females with breast cancer who use vaginal estrogen therapy, such as tablets or creams, have a higher risk of breast cancer–specific mortality. Findings In this cohort study of 49 237 females with breast cancer, there was no evidence of an increase in early breast cancer–specific mortality with use of vaginal estrogen therapy compared with no hormone replacement therapy use after breast cancer diagnosis. Meaning Findings of this study may provide some reassurance to clinicians and support the guidelines suggesting that vaginal estrogen therapy can be considered in patients with breast cancer and genitourinary symptoms if nonhormonal treatments were unsuccessful.

Importance Genitourinary syndrome of menopause can be treated with vaginal estrogen therapy. However, there are concerns about the safety of vaginal estrogen therapy in patients with breast cancer. Objective To determine whether the risk of breast cancer–specific mortality was higher in females with breast cancer who used vaginal estrogen therapy vs females with breast cancer who did not use hormone replacement therapy. Exposure Use of vaginal estrogen therapy, including vaginal tablets and creams, was ascertained from pharmacy dispensing records of the Prescribing Information System for the Scotland cohort and from general practice prescription records for the Wales cohort. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was time to breast cancer–specific mortality, which was obtained from national mortality records.

Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% CIs for breast cancer–specific mortality, comparing vaginal estrogen therapy users with HRT nonusers and adjusting for confounders, including cancer stage and grade. Results The 2 cohorts comprised 49 237 females with breast cancer and 5795 breast cancer–specific deaths. Five percent of patients with breast cancer used vaginal estrogen therapy after breast cancer diagnosis. In vaginal estrogen therapy users compared with HRT nonusers, there was no evidence of a higher risk of breast cancer–specific mortality in the pooled fully adjusted model. Conclusions and Relevance Results of this study showed no evidence of increased early breast cancer–specific mortality in patients who used vaginal estrogen therapy compared with patients who did not use HRT.

This finding may provide some reassurance to prescribing clinicians and support the guidelines suggesting that vaginal estrogen therapy can be considered in patients with breast cancer and genitourinary symptoms. Many females with breast cancer experience symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause, 1 such as vaginal itchiness, burning, pain with sexual activity, and urinary incontinence. These symptoms may be precipitated by endocrine treatments and contribute to noncompliance with endocrine therapy. 2 Vaginal estrogen therapy is an effective treatment for genitourinary syndrome of menopause. 3 Trials have shown increased recurrence in patients with breast cancer who received systemic hormone replacement therapy. 4 A recent trial observed a small increase in serum estradiol with use of a vaginal estradiol tablet. 5.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 141: management of menopausal symptoms [^bd802411]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Vasomotor and vaginal symptoms are cardinal symptoms of menopause. Vasomotor symptoms can be particularly troubling to women and are the most commonly reported menopausal symptoms, with a reported prevalence of 50-82% among U.S. women who experience natural menopause (1, 2). The occurrence of vasomotor symptoms increases during the transition to menopause and peaks approximately 1 year after the final menstrual period (3-5). The purpose of this document is to provide evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of vasomotor and vaginal symptoms related to natural and surgical menopause. (Treatment of menopausal symptoms in cancer survivors is discussed in the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Practice Bulletin Number 126, Management of Gynecologic Issues in Women With Breast Cancer.).

### Treatment of urogenital symptoms in individuals with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer: clinical consensus [^6a2003ac]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Ospemifene for vulvovaginal symptoms—ospemifene may be considered as an option for individuals with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer, with no indication of increased risk of recurrence but limited long-term safety data; it is approved by the FDA for postmenopausal vulvovaginal atrophy, and randomized placebo-controlled trials of more than 1,000 women with use ranging from 12 weeks to 1 year showed improved vaginal pH and vaginal tissue health and decreased reports of dyspareunia; however, the FDA-approved label warns that “it should not be used in women with known or suspected breast cancer,” though in Europe it is approved for women with a history of breast cancer who have completed all treatment; data since FDA approval have not demonstrated an increased risk of recurrence and may indicate higher patient satisfaction and adherence compared with other local therapies; available data indicate antagonism in breast tissue, and clinicians should discuss the label warning with patients and use clinical judgment to assess appropriateness.

ASCO guideline—duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy in men with early-stage, hormone receptor–positive breast cancer—states that men who are treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy should be treated for an initial duration of five years (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong). Men who have completed five years of tamoxifen, have tolerated therapy, and still have a high risk of recurrence based on considerations of recurrence risk using established prognostic factors may be offered an additional five years of tamoxifen therapy (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong). There is no evidence from clinical trials in men to inform duration, and tamoxifen use in men with breast cancer can be associated with treatment-limiting adverse effects that can lead to low adherence, treatment discontinuation, and a greater risk of recurrence and death.

### Efficacy and safety of ultra-low dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer treated with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors: a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^2fdf4c3f]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer survivors (BCSs) who initiate adjuvant therapy with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) experience various genitourinary signs and symptoms associated with menopausal stage. This clinical condition, currently encompassed within the term “genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM),” are mainly attributed to vulvovaginal atrophy and include genital (ie dryness, burning, and irritation), sexual (ie, lack of lubrication, discomfort, and pain), and urinary problems (ie, urgency, dysuria, and recurrent urinary tract infections). Intense estrogen deprivation associated with NSAI therapy increases the severity of GSM symptoms, which negatively impact patients’ quality of life and may consequently compromise their compliance with adjuvant endocrine therapy. -

Symptoms associated with vulvovaginal atrophy appear in 50% to 75% of BCSs, the most common being vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. - To alleviate these and other vulvovaginal symptoms such as itching and burning, vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are recommended as first-line therapy. However, these products only provide temporary symptomatic relief, and do not restore the normal function of vaginal tissue. Conversely, local hormonal treatments have proven efficacy in reversing vulvovaginal atrophy associated with estrogen depletion, although their use in BCSs is controversial due to the risk of increasing estrogen levels.

In this regard, low-dose local estrogen treatments are considered to have a lower risk profile compared to standard doses and have shown efficacy in several studies in BCSs. Among the variety of local treatments, ultra-low dose of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel has shown a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile (ie, a negligible increase of serum estriol levels after three weeks of daily use) and efficacy in reversing vulvovaginal symptoms in healthy postmenopausal women after 12 weeks of treatment. Estriol is a final metabolite unable to convert back to other estrogenic precursors, and has low binding affinity to the estrogen receptor. Furthermore, estriol displays preferential affinity to β (urogenital) rather than α (breast) estrogen receptors. Compared with estradiol, estriol is a less potent hormone with lower estrogenic potential; yet, clinical studies indicate a similar effectiveness of both agents in controlling GSM symptoms.,

### Vaginal estrogen use in breast cancer survivors: a systematic review and meta-analysis of recurrence and mortality risks [^ea027fb0]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the risk of breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer-specific mortality, and overall mortality for breast cancer survivors receiving vaginal estrogen therapy for genitourinary syndrome of menopause.

Data Sources

From the inception of each database to April 6th, 2024, a systematic literature search was conducted in Google Scholar, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, NCBI, and Science Direct. A secondary search was conducted on September 26th, 2024 utilizing Google Scholar, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Science Direct.

Study Eligibility Criteria

We identified studies that reported on breast cancer recurrence defined per individual review criteria and considered both local and distant recurrence.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Three reviewers evaluated studies with eligibility criteria in mind. Breast cancer recurrence was the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes included: breast cancer mortality and overall mortality. Pooled unadjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a random-effects model. We assessed the 95% prediction intervals to calculate the likely range within which we can expect to observe future individual values, based on a current model or dataset. We calculated the fragility index to evaluate the robustness of the pooled estimates.

Results

Of 5522 articles identified, 8 observational studies were included in this meta-analysis. The use of vaginal estrogen in patients with a history of breast cancer was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence (6 articles, 24,060 patients, odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.98). There was no increase in the risk of breast cancer mortality (4 articles, 61,695 patients, odds ratio 0.60; 95% confidence interval 0.18-1.95). Lastly, there was no increase in overall mortality with use of vaginal estrogen in breast cancer survivors (5 articles 59,724, odds ratio 0.46; 95% confidence interval 0.42-0.49).

Conclusion

The use of vaginal estrogen in patients with a history of breast cancer does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer-specific mortality, or overall mortality.

### Systemic or vaginal hormone therapy after early breast cancer: a Danish observational cohort study [^ea3c6bc7]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2022). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer (BC) survivors often experience symptoms of declining estrogen levels. Adjuvant endocrine therapy, in particular aromatase inhibitors (AIs), may aggravate these symptoms. The urogenital system is particularly sensitive to estrogen deprivation, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) often develops, including vaginal dryness, itchiness, burning, overactive bladder, and urinary incontinence. The American Endocrine Society concluded that level A evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of systemic or local hormone therapy in GSM. Vaginal estrogen therapy (VET) is well-tolerated and indicated for isolated GSM among healthy women. The use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) has been cautioned in BC survivors following demonstration of an increased risk of recurrence in the HABITS (Hormonal Replacement After Breast Cancer – is it Safe?) trial and in the Livial Intervention following Breast cancer: Efficacy, Recurrence, And Tolerability Endpoints trial, though this association was not reproduced in the results published from the Stockholm trial. A small cohort study and a nested case-control study including a total of 340 women with early BC investigated the risk of BC recurrence associated with the use of VET. Neither showed an increased risk. However, the studies had several limitations, including small sample size and short follow-up. Therefore, it remains unclear whether VET or MHT is safe in women treated for BC.

Among women without a history of BC, a meta-analysis from the Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer reported increased risk of primary BC among women treated with MHT compared with never-users, whereas VET was not associated with an increased risk of BC.

The objective of this observational cohort study was to determine the association of use of hormonal treatment (VET and MHT) with the risk of BC recurrence and mortality in a large population-based cohort of Danish postmenopausal women treated for early-stage estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) BC.

### Variation in outcome reporting and measurement tools in clinical trials of treatments for genitourinary symptoms in peri-and postmenopausal women: a systematic review [^e7585501]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Importance

Genitourinary symptoms affect 40% to 60% of postmenopausal women. Evidence-based approaches to diagnosing and managing these symptoms are limited by inconsistencies in outcomes and measures used in clinical trials.

Objective

The aim of the study was to systematically review all outcomes and measurement tools reported in randomized clinical trials of interventions for genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause.

Evidence Review

We searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to December 2018. Randomized controlled trials with a primary or secondary outcome of genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause, English language, and sample size of 20 or more women per study arm were included. Study characteristics, outcomes, and measurement methods were collected.

Findings

The search yielded 3,478 articles of which 109 met inclusion criteria. Forty-eight different outcomes were reported with "atrophy" as the most common (56/109, 51%) followed by measures of sexual function (19/109, 17%). Almost all (108/109, 99%) trials included patient-reported measures, with 21 different measures and 39 symptom combinations. Clinician-reported scales of vulvovaginal appearance were used in 36 of 109 (33%) trials, with extensive variation in what was measured and reported. Cytological measures from the vaginal epithelium were the most commonly used objective tools (76/109, 70%).

Conclusions and Relevance

There is heterogeneity in reported outcomes and measures used in clinical trials of treatments for genitourinary symptoms at menopause and uncertainty as to which outcomes best reflect patient priorities and symptoms. The findings from this systematic review have informed an international survey of stakeholders to determine priorities for outcome selection and reporting. This survey will then inform the development of a Core Outcome Set for use in future clinical trials by the COMMA (Core OutcoMes in MenopAuse) consortium. : Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A599.

### WISDOM survey: attitudes and behaviors of physicians toward vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) treatment in women including those with breast cancer history [^f6f6fd06]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 41.7 million women were reaching or were currently of menopausal age in 2010.Menopausal symptoms are common, affecting up to 75% of menopausal women, and can negatively impact women's quality of life, personal and intimate relationships, and productivity. Of the women afflicted with menopausal symptoms, up to 45% experience symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), such as vaginal dryness, irritation, itching, dysuria, and pain or bleeding with sexual activity. VVA, a component of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM),can be progressive and may not resolve without treatment.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in US women with an estimated 250,000 women diagnosed in 2017.Most diagnoses of breast cancer are in postmenopausal women, with a median age of 62 years at diagnosis,and are hormone receptor-positive breast tumors.More than 60% of postmenopausal breast cancer patients report symptoms of VVA, notably vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. These VVA symptoms are often the most poorly addressed side-effects of women on adjuvant endocrine therapy (e.g. Aromatase inhibitors).Aromatase inhibitors, a standard treatment for many postmenopausal breast cancer patients, reduce breast cancer recurrence by inducing a profound estrogen-deficiency state prevented by the conversion of androgens to estrogens.Such a low estrogen state can lead to VVA due to a lack of estrogen in the vaginal tissues.

Vulvar and vaginal atrophy symptoms can be managed successfully with over-the-counter (OTC) products or US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription therapies, such as local estrogen therapy (ET).In women with a history of estrogen-dependent breast cancer who are experiencing significant VVA, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), The North American Menopause Society (NAMS), and the International Menopause Society (IMS) recommend the short-term use of vaginal low-dose ET in those who are unresponsive to lubricants and moisturizers, a recommendation which should be made in coordination with their oncologist.

In the past decade, many international, large-scale surveys have been aimed towards understanding the attitudes of menopausal women regarding hormone therapy (HT) use,,- whereas few physicians have been surveyed. - The aim of the WISDOM survey was to evaluate and compare physicians’ behaviors and attitudes regarding VVA treatment in menopausal women, with a focus on women with an elevated risk or personal history of breast cancer.

### Safety of vaginal estrogen therapy for genitourinary syndrome of menopause in women with a history of breast cancer [^47d3fc18]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the risk of recurrence of breast cancer associated with vaginal estrogen therapy in women diagnosed with genitourinary syndrome of menopause with a history of breast cancer using a large U.S. claims database.

Methods

A U.S. health research network (TriNetX Diamond Network) was queried from January 2009 to June 2022. Our cohort consisted of women diagnosed with breast cancer within 5 years before the initial genitourinary syndrome of menopause diagnosis. Patients with active disease , defined as those undergoing mastectomy, radiation treatment, or chemotherapy within 3 months before diagnosis of genitourinary syndrome of menopause, were excluded. Recurrence was defined as mastectomy, radiation, chemotherapy, or secondary malignancy within 3 months to 5 years after the initiation of vaginal estrogen therapy for genitourinary syndrome of menopause. The study cohort included those with three or more vaginal estrogen prescriptions. The control cohort included women with breast cancer without any vaginal estrogen prescriptions after genitourinary syndrome of menopause diagnosis. Propensity matching was performed. A subanalysis by positive estrogen receptor status, when available, was performed.

Results

We identified 42,113 women with a diagnosis of genitourinary syndrome of menopause after breast cancer diagnosis with any estrogen receptor status, 5.0% of whom received vaginal estrogen. Of the initial cohort, 10,584 patients had a history of positive estrogen receptor breast cancer, and 3.9% of this group received vaginal estrogen. Risk of breast cancer recurrence was comparable between those who received vaginal estrogen and those who did not in both the any estrogen receptor (risk ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.91-1.18) and positive estrogen receptor (risk ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.77-1.15) status analyses.

Conclusion

In a large, claims-based analysis, we did not find an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence within 5 years in women with a personal history of breast cancer who were using vaginal estrogen for genitourinary syndrome of menopause.

### Menopausal hormone therapy for breast cancer patients: what is the current evidence? [^8ff6d359]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance and Objectives

Many breast cancer survivors struggle with menopausal symptoms due to oncological treatment-induced hormone deficiency, or because they experience menopause some years after completing treatment, but have limited menopause treatment options. Estrogen replacement therapy is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, but is not recommended after breast cancer because it can﻿ increase the risk of relapse. Our objectives were to review the evidence and develop a consensus statement to define the role of menopausal hormone therapy after breast cancer, and to highlight evidence gaps to inform future research.

Methods

A 25-member multidisciplinary panel developed the consensus statements using a modified Delphi methodology. The panel consisted of 18 senior doctors who voted (5 GP menopause specialists, 5 gynecologists, 4 medical oncologists, 3 breast surgical oncologists, and 1 breast radiologist), and 7 members﻿ who did not vote ﻿(4 patient representatives, 1 medical oncologist, 1 urologist and 1 administrator). Consensus was defined as ≥70% agreement with low-to-moderate variation in extent of agreement (mean absolute deviation from median of ≤0.75). We reviewed current evidence relating to use of vaginal and systemic menopausal hormone therapy ("MHT",﻿ also known as "hormone therapy," "HT" or "hormone replacement therapy," "HRT") after breast cancer diagnosis, and adjuvant endocrine (anti-estrogen) therapy, and developed a narrative synthesis. Finally, four additional breast cancer specialists peer-reviewed the manuscript.

Discussion and Conclusions

The panel agreed that some women may choose to take MHT, (off-label use) and accept an increased risk of relapse in exchange for relief from menopausal symptoms and an improved quality of life, and that preferences may vary according to individual circumstances and the absolute risk of relapse. All respondents agreed or strongly agreed with statements supporting shared decision making and individualized menopause care (MADM 0.29).In our review of the literature, we found mainly moderate quality evidence concerning use of vaginal and systemic estrogen after breast cancer, and high quality evidence concerning the benefits of anti-estrogen therapy for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Based on the available data, we recommend that shared decisions are based on (1) an individual's menopausal symptoms and impact on quality of life, (2) the potential increase in an individual's risk of relapse by use of menopausal hormone therapy, and (3) patient preferences, views and treatment goals. Clinicians and patients can use our findings to make informed menopause treatment choices after breast cancer. We strongly recommend registering all patients considering MHT after breast cancer in a clinical study (eg, MENopausal hormone therapy and Outcomes After Breast Cancer, the MENO-ABC trial).
