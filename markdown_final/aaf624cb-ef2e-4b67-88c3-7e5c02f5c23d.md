## Question

What are the screening guidelines for AAA in a mae with a history of smoking?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about screening guidelines for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in men with a history of smoking, including age range, modality, frequency, and how to handle special situations like family history and those outside the core age window. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guideline source and its exact recommendation. Then, I should verify the age range and the definition of "ever smoker". Next, I will confirm the screening modality and whether this is one-time or repeated. After that, I should review the strength of evidence and magnitude of benefit. Then, I will consider professional society variations and Medicare coverage. Finally, I will address exceptions, implementation gaps, and practical next steps for surveillance if an aneurysm is found.

> Let me first confirm the authoritative source and the core recommendation. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2019 Recommendation Statement gives a Grade B recommendation for one-time AAA screening with abdominal ultrasound in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked, and this is the most current and widely adopted U.S. primary care guidance for this population [^113bVFup] [^114in37w].

> Wait, let me verify the age window and the smoking definition before I proceed. The USPSTF explicitly targets men aged 65 to 75 years, and "ever smoker" is commonly defined as having smoked 100 or more cigarettes in a lifetime, which aligns with epidemiologic conventions used in the evidence base and guideline summaries [^116FZNY3] [^1154dWzp].

> I need to check the screening modality and whether this is a one-time event. The USPSTF specifies abdominal ultrasonography as the screening test and supports a one-time screening approach, with no routine repeat screening recommended if the initial ultrasound is negative, based on randomized trials and cohort data showing low long-term AAA-associated mortality after a normal screen [^111yWiBB] [^117BfKyd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benefits without quantifying them. I should confirm the magnitude of benefit. Meta-analyses of randomized trials show that screening men aged 65 years and older reduces AAA-related mortality and ruptures over 12 to 15 years, with an odds ratio around 0.65 for AAA-related mortality, translating into a meaningful absolute risk reduction and supporting the Grade B recommendation in ever-smokers [^113myZhY] [^112XJvTw].

> Next, I should review how other professional societies position this. The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) recommends one-time ultrasound screening for men and women aged 65 to 75 years with a history of tobacco use, and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2022 guideline recommends ultrasound screening for men aged 65 years and older who have ever smoked, with broader consideration for first-degree relatives and some women smokers, reflecting a more expansive stance than USPSTF in certain subgroups [^1125Xvf3] [^1121pMUN] [^115vmayf].

> I should confirm Medicare coverage because this affects real-world uptake. Under the SAAAVE Act, Medicare covers a one-time ultrasound screening for new beneficiaries who are men aged 65 to 75 years who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, and for individuals of any sex with a family history of AAA, which operationalizes the USPSTF target group and facilitates access in primary care [^117K2Wn4] [^116VdUfZ].

> But wait, what if the patient is outside the 65–75 window or has a strong family history. Let me consider exceptions and related guidance. For men older than 75, evidence is limited and routine screening is not recommended by USPSTF, though SVS suggests that otherwise healthy smokers over 75 may be considered for a one-time screen; for first-degree relatives of patients with AAA, ACC/AHA recommends screening from age 65, and some guidance extends consideration to those 60 and older with family history, recognizing the roughly 20% prevalence among siblings and offspring of AAA patients [^113uKxwT] [^112Te1Nv] [^112XJvTw].

> I should double-check implementation realities because underuse is common. Real-world data show very low screening uptake among eligible men, with marked disparities and low adherence to guideline-based screening, highlighting the need for system-level prompts, EMR integration, and provider education to close the gap [^114VowXV] [^112j5xYH].

> Let me think about what to do if an aneurysm is detected. I need to ensure surveillance thresholds are correct. Small AAAs, typically 3.0–4.4 cm, are managed with periodic ultrasound surveillance rather than immediate repair, whereas elective repair is generally indicated at 5.5 cm in men or if rapid growth or symptoms occur; this balances rupture risk against operative risk and is consistent with contemporary primary care and vascular surgery guidance [^116vjd1Z].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. For a man aged 65 to 75 years with a history of smoking, a one-time abdominal ultrasound for AAA is recommended by the USPSTF with a Grade B rating, supported by randomized evidence showing reduced AAA-related mortality and ruptures; no routine repeat screening is advised if the initial study is normal, though individual risk factors and professional society variations may prompt selective consideration outside this narrow window [^113bVFup] [^114in37w] [^113myZhY].

---

The USPSTF recommends a **one-time ultrasound screening** for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in men aged 65–75 years who have ever smoked, as this reduces AAA-related mortality with moderate net benefit [^113bVFup] [^114in37w]. Screening is not recommended for men outside this age range, women, or men who have never smoked, unless they have a family history or other strong risk factors [^notfound] [^notfound]. If the initial ultrasound is normal, **repeat screening is not advised** [^117BfKyd] [^116FZNY3].

---

## USPSTF screening recommendations

The USPSTF provides **clear, evidence-based recommendations** for AAA screening in men with a history of smoking:

- **Recommended screening**: One-time ultrasound screening for AAA in men aged 65–75 years who have ever smoked (≥ 100 cigarettes in their lifetime) [^113bVFup] [^114in37w].

- **Rationale**: Moderate certainty of moderate net benefit, supported by randomized trials showing reduced AAA-related mortality [^1124NMj9] [^113myZhY].

- **Selective screening**: For men aged 65–75 years who have never smoked, clinicians may selectively offer screening based on individual risk factors and patient preferences [^115qUASX] [^113ZAQjB].

---

## Evidence supporting screening

Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses demonstrate that **one-time ultrasound screening** in men aged 65–75 years with a smoking history significantly reduces AAA-related mortality and rupture rates [^1124NMj9] [^112XJvTw]. The **Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS)** showed a 42% reduction in AAA-related mortality over 13 years, with an estimated number needed to screen (NNS) of 216 to prevent one AAA-related death [^117K2Wn4]. Meta-analyses confirm a significant reduction in AAA-related mortality and rupture among screened men [^113myZhY] [^112XJvTw].

---

## Screening test and methodology

Ultrasound is the **preferred screening modality** for AAA because it is non-invasive, accurate, and cost-effective [^115ShLQ7]. Key features include:

- **Accuracy**: High sensitivity (94–100%) and specificity (98–100%) for detecting AAA [^116MjzNQ].

- **Procedure**: Patients fast for 6–8 hours prior to the exam; the ultrasound probe is placed on the abdomen to measure the abdominal aortic diameter [^notfound].

- **Interpretation**: An aortic diameter ≥ 3.0 cm indicates AAA, with further management based on size and growth rate [^115kA9rW].

---

## Management of screen-detected AAA

Management of screen-detected AAA **depends on aneurysm size and growth rate**:

| **Aneurysm size** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| < 3.0 cm | No further screening or follow-up required [^117BfKyd] |
| 3.0–3.9 cm | Ultrasound surveillance every 3 years [^notfound] |
| 4.0–4.9 cm | Ultrasound surveillance every 12 months [^notfound] |
| 5.0–5.4 cm | Ultrasound surveillance every 6 months [^notfound] |
| ≥ 5.5 cm or rapid growth (> 0.5 cm/year) | Referral to vascular surgery for elective repair [^116vjd1Z] |

---

## Potential benefits and harms of screening

Benefits include reduced AAA-related mortality, fewer ruptures, and less emergency surgery, whereas harms include anxiety from positive results, potential overtreatment of small aneurysms, and procedural risks from elective repair [^117K2Wn4] [^113uN5Wx]. Overall, the **benefits outweigh the harms** in the target population [^1124NMj9].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Age range**: Restricting screening to ages 65–75 may miss cases in younger smokers or older individuals with prolonged life expectancy [^112vLup1].

- **Gender considerations**: Women, especially smokers, may benefit from screening, but evidence remains insufficient for routine recommendations [^116v4jpV] [^113JK5Dk].

- **Underutilization**: Screening remains underutilized, with low uptake among eligible men [^114VowXV] [^112j5xYH].

---

## Current clinical practice guidelines

Current guidelines align with USPSTF recommendations, emphasizing **one-time ultrasound screening** for men aged 65–75 years with a smoking history [^1165EbdC] [^1121pMUN]. The **Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS)** recommends one-time ultrasound screening for men and women aged 65–75 years with a history of tobacco use, and the **American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA)** recommends ultrasound screening for men aged ≥ 65 years who have ever smoked [^1125Xvf3] [^1121pMUN].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The USPSTF recommends a **one-time ultrasound screening** for AAA in men aged 65–75 years who have ever smoked, given the moderate net benefit of reduced AAA-related mortality. Screening is not recommended for men outside this age range, women, or men who have never smoked, unless they have specific risk factors. If the initial ultrasound is normal, **repeat screening is not advised** [^113bVFup] [^117BfKyd].

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113bVFup]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is typically defined as aortic enlargement with a diameter of 3.0 cm or larger. The prevalence of AAA has declined over the past 2 decades among screened men 65 years or older in various European countries. The current prevalence of AAA in the United States is unclear because of the low uptake of screening. Most AAAs are asymptomatic until they rupture. Although the risk for rupture varies greatly by aneurysm size, the associated risk for death with rupture is as high as 81%.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the effectiveness of 1-time and repeated screening for AAA, the associated harms of screening, and the benefits and harms of available treatments for small AAAs (3.0–5.4 cm in diameter) identified through screening.

Population

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 50 years or older. However, the randomized trial evidence focuses almost entirely on men aged 65 to 75 years.

Evidence Assessment

Based on a review of the evidence, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked is of moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked is of small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the net benefit of screening for AAA in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for AAA in women aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA outweigh the benefits.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends 1-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked rather than routinely screening all men in this group. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against routine screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA. (D recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA. (I statement).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^115ShLQ7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a significant vascular disease found in 4% to 8% of the screening population. If ruptured, its mortality rate is between 75% and 90%, and it accounts for up to 5% of sudden deaths in the United States. Therefore, screening of AAA while asymptomatic has been a crucial portion of preventive health care worldwide. Ultrasound of the abdominal aorta is the primary imaging modality for screening of AAA recommended for asymptomatic adults regardless of their family history or smoking history. Alternatively, duplex ultrasound and CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast may be appropriate for screening. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Extended screening guidelines for the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^112vLup1]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines are the most widely used criteria for screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). However, when the USPSTF criteria are applied retrospectively to a group of patients who have undergone treatment for AAA, there are many patients who satisfy none of the AAA screening criteria. The more sensitive Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) guidelines have expanded the criteria for screening for AAA with the hope of capturing a greater fraction of those individuals who can undergo treatment for their AAA before presenting with AAA rupture. We sought to identify the number of patients who would have been identified as having criteria for screening for AAA by both the USPSTF and SVS criteria, in a cohort of patients who have undergone treatment for AAA.

Methods

We assessed demographic, comorbidity, and perioperative complication data for all patients undergoing endovascular and open AAA repair in the Vascular Quality Initiative. Patients meeting each of the screening criteria were identified. Clinical factors and demographic variables were collected.

Results

We identified 55,197 patients undergoing AAA repair in the Vascular Quality Initiative, including 44,602 patients who underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and 10,595 patients undergoing open repair. Of these, the USPTF guidelines would have identified fewer than one-third of patients (32% EVAR and 33% open repair). Applying the SVS guidelines increased the number meeting criteria for screening by 6% and 12% for the EVAR and open repair cohorts, respectively. Finally, adoption of the expanded SVS guidelines (including the "weak recommendations") would have identified an additional 34% of EVAR patients and 21% of open AAA repair patients. Use of the expanded criteria would have resulted in 27% of patients undergoing EVAR and 33% of patients undergoing open AAA repair who would not have met any screening criteria. In EVAR patients not meeting the criteria, 52% were younger than 65 years had a history of heavy smoking. Of all those who did not meet screening criteria, ruptured AAA was twice as prevalent as those who met screening criteria (8.5% vs 4.4%; P ≤ .0001).

Conclusions

Expanding established USPSTF screening guidelines to include the expanded SVS criteria may potentially double the number of patients identified with AAA. Smokers under the age of 65, and elderly patients 70 and older with no smoking history, represent two groups with AAA and potentially twice the risk of presenting with rupture.

### The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force abdominal aortic aneurysm screening guidelines negligibly impacted repair rates in male never-smokers and female smokers [^112ukWQs]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

In 2014, in addition to male smokers aged 65–75 years, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening for male never-smokers aged 65–75 years with cardiovascular risk factors (Grade C). The USPSTF evolved from a negative to neutral position on screening for female smokers aged 65–75 years (Grade I). We sought to determine whether 2014 guidelines resulted in more AAA repairs in these populations.

Methods

We queried the Vascular Quality Initiative national database (2013–2018) for elective endovascular aortic repairs and open aortic repairs. We implemented difference-in-differences (DID) analysis, a causal inference technique that adjusts for secular time trends, to isolate changes in repair numbers due to the 2014 USPSTF guidelines. Our DID models compared changes in repair numbers in patient groups targeted by the USPSTF updates (intervention group) to those in unaffected, older patient groups (control), before and after 2014. The first model compared changes in repair numbers between male never-smokers aged 65–75 years (intervention group) and 76–85 years (control). The second model compared repair numbers between female smokers aged 65–75 years (intervention group) and 76–85 years (control).

Results

There was no significant change in male never-smokers (n = 1,295) aged 65–75 (42%) vs. 76–85 (58%) undergoing AAA repairs after guideline updates, averaged over 4.5 years (+2.4 percentage points; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] -.56–5.26). However, when their primary insurer was Medicare, male never-smokers aged 65–75 years compared with 76–85 years underwent significantly more repairs over 4.5 years (+3.69 percentage points; 95% CI.16–7.22; representing a 10.4% relative increase from baseline in the proportion of male never-smokers on Medicare undergoing AAA repair). Comparing female smokers (n = 2,312) aged 65–75 (54%) vs. 76–85 (46%), there was no significant change in repairs over 4.5 years (-.66 percentage points; 95% CI -4.57–3.26).

Conclusions

The USPSTF 2014 AAA guidelines were associated with modestly increased repairs in male never-smokers aged 65–75 years only on Medicare. There was no impact among female smokers. Higher-grade recommendations and improved guideline adherence may be requisites for change.

### The case for expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm screening [^113nbY3j]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Both the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence are re-evaluating their screening paradigms for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Currently, most countries that screen for AAA do so only in male ever-smokers between the ages of 65 and 75 years and in patients with a family history of AAA. However, these recommendations are based primarily on screening trials predating the endovascular era. The wider applicability of endovascular aneurysm repair and its safety profile, especially in the elderly, have changed the risk-benefit of repair and, by extension, screening. This is despite the decreasing prevalence of AAA thanks to improved medical therapies and lower smoking rates. This evidence summary critically examines the evidence behind screening and the potential for expanded screening.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm [^114nsvCC]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm refers to abdominal aortic dilation of 3.0 cm or greater. The main risk factors are age older than 65 years, male sex, and smoking history. Other risk factors include a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. Diagnosis may be made by physical examination, an incidental finding on imaging, or ultrasonography. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released updated recommendations for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in 2014. Men 65 to 75 years of age with a history of smoking should undergo one-time screening with ultrasonography based on evidence that screening will improve abdominal aortic aneurysm-related mortality in this population. Men in this age group without a history of smoking may benefit if they have other risk factors (e.g., family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease). There is inconclusive evidence to recommend screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in women 65 to 75 years of age with a smoking history. Women without a smoking history should not undergo screening because the harms likely outweigh the benefits. Persons who have a stable abdominal aortic aneurysm should undergo regular surveillance or operative intervention depending on aneurysm size. Surgical intervention by open or endovascular repair is the primary option and is typically reserved for aneurysms 5.5 cm in diameter or greater. There are limited options for medical treatment beyond risk factor modification. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency presenting with hypotension, shooting abdominal or back pain, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. It is associated with high prehospitalization mortality. Emergent surgical intervention is indicated for a rupture but has a high operative mortality rate.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111yWiBB]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening rationale — by sex, smoking, and family history: Ultrasonography is described as "a safe and accurate screening test for AAA". In men aged 65 to 75 who have ever smoked, "1-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography results in a moderate benefit", the harms "are small to moderate", and there is "moderate certainty" this "has a moderate net benefit". In men aged 65 to 75 who have never smoked, screening yields "a small benefit", with harms "small to moderate", and "moderate certainty" of "a small net benefit". For women who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA, there is "inadequate evidence to conclude whether 1-time screening… is beneficial", and "the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined". For women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA, "1-time screening… results in no benefit", and "the harms of screening… outweigh the benefits".

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116FZNY3]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening recommendations — Asymptomatic adults: For men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked, Grade B recommends, "Perform 1-time screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with ultrasonography in men who have a history of smoking". For men aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked, Grade C says to "Selectively offer screening to men who do not have a history of smoking, rather than routinely screening all men in this group". For women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA, Grade D advises, "Do not screen women who have never smoked and do not have a family history of AAA". For women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA, the USPSTF issues an I statement: "Evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA". This recommendation applies to "Asymptomatic adults"; abdominal duplex ultrasonography is "the standard approach for AAA screening", screening is "One-time", and "Ever-smoker" is commonly defined as "smoking 100 or more cigarettes".

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^117K2Wn4]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for aneurysm screening — Randomized trials of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening showed benefit: four trials including 127,891 men and 9342 women aged 65 to 79 years found ultrasound screening reduced aneurysm-related mortality, with benefit beginning within 3 years and persisting up to 15 years, and screening was associated with reduced risk for AAA rupture and emergency surgery. In the MASS trial over 13 years there was a 42% reduction in AAA-related mortality, an estimated 216 men needed to be invited to screening to save one death during 13 years, and roughly half of ruptures had an initial diameter of 2.5 to 2.9 cm. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2005 recommended a one-time abdominal ultrasound for men aged 65 to 75 years with a history of smoking, and in 2014 updated to one-time screening for men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked (grade B) with selective screening for those who have never smoked (grade C); screening was not recommended for women aged 65 to 75 years who have never smoked (grade D), and evidence was insufficient for women aged 65 to 75 years with a smoking history. In the absence of a smoking history, prevalence drops to 2%; among women of similar age with a past smoking history prevalence is 0.8%, in current smokers prevalence is 5%, and in women who have never smoked AAA prevalence is < 0.60%. Under the SAAAVE amendment, Medicare began offering one-time ultrasound screening for men aged 65 to 75 years if they had smoked ≥ 100 cigarettes and for men and women with a family history of AAA disease as part of the Welcome to Medicare exam, and originally the order could be placed only by the primary care physician within 6 months of activation of Medicare benefits.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm [^113uKxwT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening — We recommend a one-time ultrasound screening for AAAs in men or women 65 to 75 years of age with a history of tobacco use. We suggest ultrasound screening for AAA in first-degree relatives of patients who present with an AAA, and screening should be performed in first-degree relatives who are between 65 and 75 years of age or in those older than 75 years and in good health. We suggest a one-time ultrasound screening for AAAs in men or women older than 75 years with a history of tobacco use and in otherwise good health who have not previously received a screening ultrasound examination.

### A 66-year-old man with an abdominal aortic aneurysm: review of screening and treatment [^113J6FXy]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common cause of death. Abdominal aortic aneurysms tend to be asymptomatic until the time of rupture, which has a mortality rate of greater than 80%. Therefore, elective repair prior to rupture is preferred if life expectancy is reasonable and the risk of rupture outweighs the risk of repair. Mr F, a 66-year-old man with a 5.2-cm AAA, illustrates the issues surrounding monitoring and treating AAA. Risk factors for AAA include older age, male sex, smoking history, and a family history of AAA. Screening for AAA with ultrasound has been shown to prevent rupture, prevent AAA-related death, and be cost-effective. Risk factors for rupture include larger diameter, female sex, and smoking history. Endovascular repair has lower operative mortality and complications and has replaced standard open surgery in more than half of patients. However, long-term survival is similar after endovascular and open surgical repair. Those at risk of AAA who would benefit from repair should undergo screening.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm [^116vjd1Z]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a pathologic condition with progressive abdominal aortic dilatation of 3.0 cm or more that predisposes the abdominal aorta to rupture. Most abdominal aortic aneurysms are asymptomatic until they rupture, although some are detected when an imaging study is performed for other reasons. The risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm include hypertension, coronary artery disease, tobacco use, male sex, a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, age older than 65 years, and peripheral artery disease. Abdominal ultrasonography is the preferred modality to screen for abdominal aortic aneurysm because of its cost-effectiveness and lack of exposure to ionizing radiation. Abdominal aortic aneurysm can be managed medically or surgically, depending on the patient's symptoms and the size and growth rate of the aneurysm. Medical management is appropriate for asymptomatic patients and smaller aneurysms and includes tobacco cessation and therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction. Surgical management, which includes open and endovascular aneurysm repair, is indicated when the aneurysm diameter is 5.5 cm or larger in men and 5.0 cm or larger in women. Surveillance of abdominal aortic aneurysm depends on the size and growth rate of the aneurysm. The most serious complication of abdominal aortic aneurysm is rupture, which requires emergent surgical intervention. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men with a history of smoking who are 65 to 75 years of age should undergo one-time abdominal aortic aneurysm screening with ultrasonography.

Clinical Perspective

An aneurysm is a pathological distension of a section of blood vessel, typically the aorta. – Aortic aneurysms can occur anywhere in the aorta's length, but abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are associated with increased mortality if rupture occurs (around 50% in those who reach the hospital) because of catastrophic bleeding. In the Oxford Vascular Study, among 65- to 74-year-olds, the incidence was 5.5 events per 10 000 person-years in men and 1.1 events per 10 000 person-years in women. Death from AAA accounts for around 2% of all deaths in men aged 65 and over, and few clinical symptoms are noted in AAA that subsequently rupture.

In the United Kingdom, a routine screening program invites men in the year of their 65th birthday for abdominal ultrasonography, and more recent updates suggest women of age 70 years and over be screened if they have risk factors such as ever smoking, or if they have cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral arterial disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or a family history of AAA. If an AAA of > 5.5 cm diameter is detected, the patient is rapidly referred for surgical intervention, with slower referral for smaller-sized AAA. In 2019, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended screening for AAA in men aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. The USPSTF recommends against routine screening in women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA and states that evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against AAA screening in women with either history of smoking or family history of AAA. Although not all international recommendations agree on a precise screening strategy, others are broadly similar. Screening for AAA in women has not been demonstrated to be clinically effective. In considering balancing the risks and benefits of screening, ultrasonography itself has high sensitivity (94%–100%) and specificity (98%–100%) for the detection of AAA, although risk and benefits of surgical intervention for smaller aneurysms must be carefully considered. Although age-based screening thresholds in women may not be cost-effective, a more refined risk score based on systematic routine clinical data may help improve clinical care.

This study aimed to use a large, well-phenotyped United Kingdom database to develop, and internally validate, an AAA risk score using simple clinical data. It was hypothesized that such a risk score could more precisely discriminate those at risk of adverse outcomes from AAA than current approaches.

### The global and regional prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms: a systematic review and modeling analysis [^116bNjQg]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Smoking is an important and modifiable risk factor associated with almost all stages in the pathogenesis of AAA, including development, expansion, rupture, and even death, making it a useful target in the response to AAA. Although the cumulative risk over the years even after quitting smoking cannot be ruled out, the benefits of smoking cessation in reducing the risk of AAA abound, as partly supported in the current study where we estimated a significantly lower pooled ORs among former smokers (2.68, 95% CI, 2.29–3.14) compared with current smokers (4.70, 95% CI, 3.94–5.62). In terms of the specific response, smoking is indicated across all levels of the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, with a 1-time screening for AAA by ultrasonography recommended in asymptomatic men aged 65 to 75 years that have ever smoked, and selectively for those that have never smoked. Implementing this remains a major challenge in many low-income settings, which still highlights our earlier above recommendations on harnessing opportunities from research within the resources available.

Although we could not account for sex differences in the contributions of smoking to the global prevalence of AAA, we note from our observations in the literature that women still form an important part of the response to AAA. The US Preventive Services Task Force stated that current evidence for routine screening for AAA among women who have never smoked is insufficient, this rather reaffirms the limited research among women and an important implication for policy and practice, particularly with a relatively increasing smoking prevalence and use of tobacco products among women in many world settings.

In summary, a substantial global burden of AAA is revealed globally. Importantly, the relatively large number of AAA cases in AFR and EMR in the young-age to middle-age groups makes the 2 regions an important target for response. We also reaffirm the importance of smoking, male sex, and family history as leading risks of AAA globally, with the WPR the most affected region globally. We note a need to optimize epidemiological studies and existing structures for research in LMICs and resource-limited populations to promptly respond to at-risk and identified cases to improve outcomes. Although data from many countries remain patchy, our study has included the most up-to-date data set from available evidence on AAA prevalence and associated factors that can inform a much needed public health response and further research across world regions.

### Analysis of clinical benefit, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening women for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^114nGsxK]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) traditionally has been considered a disease of men, strongly associated with smoking. However, a third of deaths caused by AAA rupture are in women. In men, synthesis of four randomised trials has shown a benefit of population-based screening in reducing AAA-related mortality by up to 40% although any reduction in all-cause mortality is small. Several countries including Sweden and the UK have introduced cost-effective population screening programmes for AAA in men aged at least 65 years, and screening for older men is available in the United States, and regionally in Italy and other countries. The only randomised trial of AAA screening in women, which was done in the 1990s, was underpowered. In 2014, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended against screening in women. The reasons for this recommendation include the reportedly lower prevalence of AAA in women, on the basis of the maximum aortic diameter threshold of at least 3 cm, and paucity of evidence about the management of AAA in women. However, with long-term health-economic modelling in men suggesting that population-based screening would be cost-effective with an AAA prevalence as low as 0.35–0.5%, smoking now almost as common in women as in men, and with the association between smoking and AAA almost twice as strong for women compared with men, the case for AAA screening in women needs to be formally assessed.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening — supportive evidence and definitions — Smoking history is defined as lifetime use of ≥ 100 cigarettes, with risk attributable to smoking varying by exposure and lower risk in those with lower versus higher pack-year history. Based on a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials inclusive of nearly 125 000 mostly male patients, screening of men ≥ 65 years of age reduced long-term AAA-related mortality (4 RCTs: OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.57–0.74) and AAA-related ruptures (4 RCTs; OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.55–0.70) over 12 to 15 years. In a population-based study in the United Kingdom, two-thirds of the acute AAA events occurred in those ≥ 75 years of age; consequently, screening to elderly patients should be offered, provided they would benefit from potential aortic repair. Having a first-degree relative with AAA is a well-known and well-established risk factor for development of AAA, and small cohort studies of ultrasound screening in relatives have identified an overall prevalence of new AAA of 10% to 20%, with the highest prevalence of 25% found among brothers.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) epidemiology and growth — A complex interplay of hereditary and environmental risk factors contributes to AAA, most notably older age, male sex, smoking, and a positive family history. Lifetime risk for AAA is 8.2% in men and 10.5% in current smokers. At least 10% to 25% of patients with AAA have a family member with the same condition. The growth of AAA is nonlinear, with a mean rate of 2.6 mm/y for AAA < 5.0 cm, and may accelerate in the setting of smoking or a family history of AAA, and smoking may have a greater impact on growth in women than in men. Smoking history is defined as lifetime use of ≥ 100 cigarettes. Ultrasound screening should be targeted toward those at the greatest risk for AAA and growth, with the goal of preventing rupture and associated mortality.

### Underutilization of guideline-based abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in an academic health system [^114VowXV]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends a 1 time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men aged 65–75 who have ever smoked. Our objectives were to identify the AAA screening rates in a large academic health system and assess factors associated with receipt of screening.

Methods

Data were extracted from electronic health records from the Duke University Health System and the US Census Bureau. Index screening eligibility date was defined as the 65th birthdate for male patients with a history of smoking. Patients with an index screening eligibility date between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018 were included in the study population and followed through December 31, 2019. Screened patients were identified by procedure codes for ultrasonography, CT or MRI.

Results

Among 6,682 eligible patients who turned 65 years old between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018 with at least 1 year of follow-up, only 463 (6.9%) received AAA screening during the study period. The odds of receiving AAA screening within 1 year of index eligibility were 27% lower for Black patients compared to whites [OR = 0.73, 95% CI (0.58,0.93)]. Patients who visited a PCP or were diagnosed with hypertension had 75% and 41% greater odds of receiving screening, respectively [OR 1.75, 95% CI (1.36,2.25)] and [OR 1.41 95% CI (1.11,1.80)] compared with patients who did not. Among 4,580 men with 2 years of follow-up, AAA screening rate increased to 13.0%. Patients who visited a PCP had 64% greater odds of receiving screening within 2 years of index eligibility compared to those who did not [OR = 1.64, 95% CI (1.30,2.06)].

Conclusions

Screening for AAA per USPSTF guidelines is underutilized with evidence of a racial disparity. Although PCP visit is the most consistent predictor of screening, provider screening rates are low.

Guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist patients and providers in choosing appropriate health care for specific clinical conditions. Consensus exists across guidelines on one-time screening of elderly men to detect and treat abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) ≥ 5.5 cm. However, the recommendations regarding other age groups, imaging intervals for small AAAs, inclusion of women, and cost-effectiveness have not been universally adopted. As many countries are considering the initiation of an AAA screening program, this is an overview on the current status of such programs.

### Analysis of risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm in a cohort of more than 3 million individuals [^114pXYZX]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is an insidious condition with an 85% chance of death after rupture. Ultrasound screening can reduce mortality, but its use is advocated only for a limited subset of the population at risk.

Methods

We used data from a retrospective cohort of 3.1 million patients who completed a medical and lifestyle questionnaire and were evaluated by ultrasound imaging for the presence of AAA by Life Line Screening in 2003 to 2008. Risk factors associated with AAA were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis.

Results

We observed a positive association with increasing years of smoking and cigarettes smoked and a negative association with smoking cessation. Excess weight was associated with increased risk, whereas exercise and consumption of nuts, vegetables, and fruits were associated with reduced risk. Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians had lower risk of AAA than whites and Native Americans. Well-known risk factors were reaffirmed, including male gender, age, family history, and cardiovascular disease. A predictive scoring system was created that identifies aneurysms more efficiently than current criteria and includes women, nonsmokers, and individuals aged < 65 years. Using this model on national statistics of risk factors prevalence, we estimated 1.1 million AAAs in the United States, of which 569,000 are among women, nonsmokers, and individuals aged < 65 years.

Conclusions

Smoking cessation and a healthy lifestyle are associated with lower risk of AAA. We estimated that about half of the patients with AAA disease are not eligible for screening under current guidelines. We have created a high-yield screening algorithm that expands the target population for screening by including at-risk individuals not identified with existing screening criteria.

### Leveraging the electronic medical record to implement an abdominal aortic aneurysm screening program [^115pfsrm]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) reduces aneurysm-related mortality and has been recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and American Heart Association since 2005. Medicare has covered a one-time screening ultrasound for new male enrollees with a familial or smoking history since 2007. Nevertheless, in the U.S., screening has remained underutilized. Review of patients with ruptured AAA in our system in 2007 showed the majority were undiagnosed, yet met U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and American Heart Association screening guidelines. To reduce the number of preventable AAA ruptures and deaths in our patients, we implemented an AAA screening program using our electronic medical record (EMR). This study describes the design, implementation, and early results of that screening program.

Methods

Between March 2012 and June 2013, men aged 65 to 75 years with any history of smoking were targeted for screening. Medical records were reviewed electronically to exclude patients with abdominal imaging studies within 10 years that would have diagnosed an AAA. Best practice alerts (BPA) were created in the EMR so when an appropriate patient is seen, office staff and providers are prompted to order an aortic ultrasound. AAA was defined as aortic diameter ≥ 3.0 cm or greater, and ultrasound reports contained a standard template providing guidance for patient management when an aneurysm was identified. Newly identified AAAs were triaged for vascular surgery consultation or follow-up with their primary physician. The number of eligible patients, unscreened patients, and AAAs identified were tabulated by our Regional Outpatient Safety Net Program.

Results

In a population of 3.6 million, 55,610 patients initially met screening criteria, and 26,837 (48.26%) were excluded from the BPA because of prior abdominal imaging studies. After 15 months, there were 68,164 patients who met screening criteria, 54,356 (79.74%) of whom had undergone an abdominal imaging study. Thus, 27,519 patients underwent an imaging study after the BPA was activated. During the study period, 731 new AAAs were diagnosed, 165 over 4.0 cm in diameter. Screening rates have increased at all medical centers where the BPA was activated, and the percentage of unscreened patients has been reduced from 51.74% to 20.26% system-wide.

Conclusions

In an integrated health care system using an EMR, AAA screening can be implemented with a dramatic reduction in unscreened patients. Further analysis is required to assess the impact of the screening program on AAA rupture rate and cost-effectiveness in our system.

### Evaluating the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms in the United States through a national screening database [^113kGQDH]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force guidelines for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening are based mainly on studies of older Caucasian males from non-U.S.

Populations

This study was designed to analyze the findings of a large, all-inclusive AAA screening program in the United States.

Methods

Screening events were held nationally by a U.S. nonprofit organization between 2001 and 2017. AAA screening was offered regardless of risk profile. Participants filled out a demographics form with known comorbidities. Significant risk factors were determined using logistic regression with backward stepwise variable selection. Odds ratios (OR) are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

A total of 9457 screened participants (47% male) were analyzed. The mean age was 67 ± 9 years with 40.8% between 65 and 75 years old. Most participants were Caucasian (83.4%), followed by African American (13.1%). Screened risk factors included hypertension (58.1%), hyperlipidemia (54.9%), smoking (52.0%), cardiac disease (29.2%), diabetes mellitus (18.4%), a family history of AAA (22.4%) or brain aneurysms (8.6%), and body mass index (26.9 ± 5.28). Overall, 267 participants (2.82%) were found to have an AAA (> 3 cm). Those ages 65 to 75 had a prevalence of 2.98%. In a fully adjusted, multivariate logistic regression, there was an increased risk of AAA in males (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 2.39–4.40), current smokers (OR, 3.28; 95% CI, 2.36–4.54), previous smokers (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.41–2.47), cardiac disease (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.01–1.68), family history of AAA (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.20–2.14), and advancing age (P < .0001). Female ever smokers 65 to 75 years old had a prevalence of 1.7%. Male smokers 45 to 54 and 55 to 64 years old had a prevalence of 3.37% and 4.43%, respectively. There was an increased risk of AAA in females with morbid obesity (OR, 5.54; 95% CI, 1.34–22.83 in never smokers and OR, 5.61; 95% CI, 1.04–30.15 in smokers), female smokers with hypertension (OR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.21–8.58), males with cardiac disease (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.08–3.90 in never smokers and OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.05–2.09), male smokers with a family history of AAA (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.61–2.46), and current smokers (OR, 6.33; 95% CI, 2.62–15.24 for females and OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.70–3.65 for males).

Conclusions

This study shows that there remain high-risk groups outside the current guidelines that would likely benefit from AAA screening. Risk factors for AAA include male gender, smoking, cardiac disease, family history of AAA, and advancing age. The most significant risk factor is current smoking status.

### Ultrasonographic screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms [^115jopnx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) occur in 1 of 20 older men, remain asymptomatic for many years, and, if left untreated, cause death from rupture in about one third of patients. Ultrasonography is a suitable screening test for AAA, and elective repair can prevent rupture. Although these features suggest a promising target for a screening program, evidence of benefit from AAA screening has only recently become available. Four randomized trials of ultrasonographic screening involving more than 125 000 men have been reported, and each trial observed a reduction in AAA-related mortality (which was statistically significant in 2 trials), ranging from 21% to 68%. One trial in women found no benefit. Other studies indicate that screening can begin in men older than 65 years of age and does not need to be repeated if results are negative. An AAA larger than 5.5 cm in diameter should be considered for elective open or endovascular repair. Most aneurysms detected at screening are smaller and should be kept under surveillance with periodic imaging measurement. Widespread elective repair of small AAAs could reduce the benefits and increase the costs of screening. No medical treatments have been proven to reduce the enlargement rate. If elective repair is reserved for larger AAAs, one-time ultrasonographic screening for AAA can be recommended for men 65 to 79 years of age who have ever smoked [correction].

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117KdpXP]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

ACC/AHA aortic disease — cost and value considerations note that studies are limited on cost-effectiveness and lack standard methods for comparison; however, screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) among men ≥ 65 years of age has been shown to be cost-effective, whereas data for women are less clear. Women have a lower incidence of AAA but higher rupture risk and longer life expectancy, so incremental cost-effectiveness is similar to men and may justify screening, especially in those with a history of smoking. In patients with AAA, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) generally shows lower initial costs than open repair due to shorter hospital stays, but ongoing expenses for EVAR surveillance and reinterventions may minimize long-term cost advantages after 2 to 5 years.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: a best-evidence systematic review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113uN5Wx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

While the prognosis for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture is poor, ultrasound imaging is an accurate and reliable test for detecting AAAs before rupture.

Purpose

To examine the benefits and harms of population-based AAA screening.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1994 to July 2004) supplemented by the Cochrane Library, a reference list of retrieved articles, and expert suggestions.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of AAA population screening, population studies of AAA risk factors, and data on adverse screening and treatment events from randomized trials and cohort studies.

Data Extraction

All studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined criteria.

Data Synthesis

The authors identified 4 population-based randomized, controlled trials of AAA screening in men 65 years of age and older. On the basis of meta-analysis, an invitation to attend screening was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-related mortality (odds ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.74]). A meta-analysis of 3 trials revealed no significant difference in all-cause mortality (odds ratio, 0.98 [CI, 0.95 to 1.02]). No significant reduction in AAA-related mortality was found in 1 study of AAA screening in women. Screening does not appear to be associated with significant physical or psychological harms. Major treatment harms include an operative mortality rate of 2% to 6% and significant risk for major complications.

Limitations

The population screening studies focused on men and provided no information on racial or ethnic groups. No information was available on uninvited control group characteristics, so the importance of risk factors such as tobacco use or family history could not be assessed. Since all trials were conducted in countries other than the United States, generalizability to the U.S. population is uncertain.

Conclusion

For men age 65 to 75 years, an invitation to attend AAA screening reduces AAA-related mortality.

### Development of a novel scoring tool for the identification of large ≥ 5 CM abdominal aortic aneurysms [^114X587G]. Annals of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Current screening recommendations for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) target > 3-cm diameter aneurysms in ever-smoking 65- to 75-year-old males. However, more than 50% of AAA ruptures occur in individuals outside this patient cohort, and only a subset of AAAs detected are large enough to warrant surgery. In this analysis, we evaluated more than 3 million screened individuals and developed a scoring tool to identify ≥ 5-cm diameter AAAs in the entire population at risk.

Methods

Between 2003 and 2008, demographics and risk factors were collected from 3.1 million people undergoing ultrasound screening for AAA by Life Line Screening, Inc. Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, we identified risk factors and developed a scoring system to predict the presence of ≥ 5-cm diameter AAAs.

Results

Smoking had a profound influence on the risk of AAA, which increased with number of cigarettes smoked and years of smoking, and decreased following smoking cessation. Novel findings included a protective effect of exercise, normal weight, and Black/Hispanic race/ethnicity. Using these and other factors, the scoring system provided good predictive accuracy (C-statistic = 0.82), when tested against the validation subset of the study cohort. The model predicts the presence of 121,000 ≥ 5 cm AAA in the US population (prevalence: 0.14%). Demonstrating the inadequacy of the current screening recommendations, only 35% of these aneurysms were among males aged 65 to 75 years.

Conclusions

Based on the largest cohort of patients ever screened for AAA, we developed a screening strategy that can identify large AAAs in a broad population of individuals at risk.

### Risk factor-targeted abdominal aortic aneurysm screening: systematic review of risk prediction for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^111mSLRj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity. In England and Wales each year, AAA rupture causes over 3000 deaths and more than 7000 patients undergo surgical AAA repair to prevent rupture.

Risk prediction models can be used to calculate the probability that an individual has a certain pathology or disorder; prognostic models work similarly to predict the probability or risk of future occurrence of a particular pathology or outcome. In healthcare, these models often use information about a patient's demographics and associated co-morbidities to calculate the person's risk/prognosis.

Multiple trials have confirmed the long-term effectiveness of screening in reducing the risk of dying from ruptured AAA. In the UK, the NHS AAA screening programme has been established since 2009, offering men in their 65th year a one-off ultrasound examination to screen for AAA. Currently the programme detects an aneurysm in less than 1% of the men screened, and this number is expected to drop further in the future. As disease prevalence falls over time, screening will become less and less cost-effective. Targeted screening has the potential to improve the cost-effectiveness of existing population-based AAA screening programmes. Any targeted screening strategy is likely to be based, at least in part, on AAA risk factors. In the United States, a targeted screening strategy for AAA has been established since 2005. In this programme, men aged 65–75 years who have a history of smoking are recommended for screening with ultrasound imaging.

Electronic healthcare records (EHRs), such as those that exist in primary care or hospitals, offer an opportunity to apply clinical prediction models for screening, based on multiple risk factors (provided that these risk factors are recorded/detected in such records).

The aim of this review was to investigate the current state of risk prediction for AAA in the literature, identifying and comparing published models, and describing their performance and applicability to targeted screening strategies using EHR-based populations.

### Meta-analysis of the current prevalence of screen-detected abdominal aortic aneurysm in women [^113LowKX]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The data for the contemporary prevalence of AAA in women should be considered in the context of the ongoing debate about whether AAAs in women are diagnosed and treated adequately. If AAA screening in 65‐year‐old men is cost‐effective down to a prevalence rate as low as 0.35 per cent 39, AAA screening also may be cost‐effective in 70‐year‐old women, especially as the AAA rupture rate in women is about four times that in men for a given AAA diameter 40. Indeed, a modelling study from Sweden 41 has already suggested that AAA screening for older women would be cost‐effective, based on an AAA prevalence of 1.1 per cent in 65‐year‐old women.

Present guidelines for AAA screening in women are only that it is not recommended for older women who have never smoked 37. This contemporary review, showing a pooled prevalence of 0.74 per cent in women aged at least 60 years, rising to over 1.0 per cent in ever smokers and those aged 70 years or older, might stimulate the debate about offering targeted AAA screening to older women.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) epidemiology and smoking-related risk factors are detailed with odds ratios and prevalence. AAA was more likely among men (OR, 5.7) and less common in Hispanics (OR, 0.7), African Americans (OR, 0.7), and Asian Americans (OR, 0.7). A smoking history of < 0.5 pack per day for up to 10 years carried an increased risk of an AAA (OR, 2.6), rising such that smoking more than one pack per day for > 35 years was associated with a 12-fold increased risk (OR, 12.1). Reduced risk was noted for smoking cessation, diabetes mellitus, eating fruits and vegetables more than three times a week, and exercise more than once a week. In the United States, the prevalence of AAA, as defined by an aortic diameter > 3 cm, was estimated at 1.4% among those between 50 and 84 years old, or 1.1 million adults, and first-degree relatives of patients with an AAA have an approximately 20% likelihood for development of an AAA. More than 90% of patients with AAA have smoked cigarettes at some point in their lifetime; for patients with any aneurysmal disease, smoking increased the rate of aneurysm enlargement by 35%, current smokers are more than seven times more likely to have an aneurysm than nonsmokers, and each year of smoking increases the relative risk for development of an aneurysm by 4%.

### Genetic association of lipids and lipid drug targets with abdominal aortic aneurysm: a meta-analysis [^114QoKJR]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an important cardiovascular disease (CVD) resulting in approximately 4500 deaths from AAA rupture per year in the United States. Approximately 45 000 operations are carried out each year to prevent rupture, resulting in 1400 deaths. Screening for AAA reduces the burden of rupture, and therefore many countries now offer such screening to at-risk groups. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening men aged 65 to 75 years with a history of smoking, and the American Heart Association guidelines suggest surgical repair is needed when the AAA reaches 5.5 cm in diameter.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm shares risk factors with occlusive atherosclerotic disease, but the magnitude and direction of this association is not always consistent. A growing body of evidence suggests considerable heterogeneity of risk factor associations among different forms of CVDs. For example, the risk of smoking for AAA is at least 2-fold greater than that for coronary heart disease (CHD), whereas type 2 diabetes appears to be protective for AAA but is a major risk factor for occlusive vascular disease. This example suggests that AAA may have some distinct causal pathways, and understanding these pathways is important for setting public health policies aimed at reducing the risk posed by AAA and its complications.

### Cost effectiveness of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening and rescreening in men in a modern context: evaluation of a hypothetical cohort using a decision analytical model [^117KwKkz]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms has been the subject of intensive focus over the past two decades. It is a classic example of a scenario that seems to satisfy the World Health Organisation screening criteria, because mortality can be reduced if a simple test is performed. Long term follow-up data from large randomised controlled trials have established that screening in men older than 65 years can reduce mortality related to abdominal aortic aneurysm by about 50%. Also, from the ethical perspective, this form of screening offers a clear balance of good over harm.

Several studies have attempted to extrapolate the benefits and costs of screening to a lifetime perspective using decision analytical models. These studies show a highly efficacious and cost effective technology from the healthcare system perspective. The most recent studies have been critically appraised in a systematic review. With one or two exceptions, the review noted that the studies had some limitations with respect to the way the natural history of disease was modelled. Furthermore, the results seemed to be driven by very few original studies; for example, the growth and rupture rates from the Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Studyare used in most models. There are good reasons for the adoption of these rates, since this trial seemed to be a unique, well conducted and high quality study. Nevertheless, if the context or the way we see the biological disease process changes over time, these estimates could ultimately have a date of expiry.

Over the past two decades, the practice of primary and secondary prevention for cardiovascular disease has improved substantially. The extent to which such contextual changes affect the efficacy of screening is controversial, as noted by a recent clinical review. This review suggested that smoking cessation had a role in the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms; however, it noted that there is currently no definitive evidence on the effect of statins, antihypertensive drugs, and β blockers. Although the optimal medical management thus remains unclear, does the efficacy of screening in a context without modern regimens for cardiovascular disease prevention hold true today?

The emergence of additional non-pharmaceutical technologies is also likely to have influenced the efficacy of screening. For example, if the rate of incidental detection of aneurysms increases, it subsequently reduces the number of undetected cases and thereby the rationale for screening. The use of ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging has increased markedly over recent years. Furthermore, endovascular aorta repair has been rapidly emerging, which has probably influenced the costs of detected aneurysms and possibly the outcomes.

Cost and value considerations — screening and repair strategies: Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) among men ≥ 65 years of age has been shown to be cost-effective, whereas data for women are less clear; women have a lower incidence of AAA but higher rupture risk and longer life expectancy, so incremental cost-effectiveness is similar to men and may justify screening, especially in those with a history of smoking. In AAA, studies comparing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with open repair generally show lower initial costs for EVAR due to shorter hospital stays, but ongoing surveillance and reintervention expenses may minimize long-term cost advantages after 2 to 5 years. For descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), findings are mixed but similar, with trends toward lower initial hospital costs with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) versus open surgery from shorter length of stay, but the long-term results are more neutral. Overall, studies on cost-effectiveness are limited and lack standard methods for comparison.

### Guideline-based screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms is significantly underperformed and possibly impacted by medical comorbidities [^112j5xYH]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to define the level of under-screening of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and its effect on rupture rates and elucidate if prior medical comorbidities may impact this.

Methods

The TriNetX Analytics National Database was queried. The United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines of male smokers 65 to 75 years and the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) guidelines of any smoker 65 years and older were used. Family history for AAA was not used. Three populations were defined: USPSTF-eligible (male smokers 65–75 years old), SVS-eligible (any smoker 65+ years old), and SVS-only-eligible (female smokers 65+ years old, male smokers 75+ years old). For each population, we isolated screened and unscreened individuals. Screened patients were defined as those who underwent a screening ultrasound (US) during the eligible period, and unscreened patients were those who met screening eligibility but did not undergo US as determined by CPT/HCPCS codes. ICD-10 codes were used to identify AAA and comorbidities. Data were matched by propensity score for age, race/ethnicity, and medical utilization (primary care visits, lab orders, etc).

Results

Screening rates for USPSTF-eligible, SVS-eligible, and SVS-only eligible patients were 3.98%, 2.12%, and 0.83%, respectively. Screening according to USPSTF, SVS, and SVS-only guidelines were associated with lower AAA rupture rates (odds ratio [OR], 0.416, 0.499, and 0.717, respectively; P < .05 for each). After propensity matching, a total of 109,444 patients were analyzed with 54,722 patients in each cohort (screened and unscreened). The screened cohort had higher rates of hyperlipidemia (OR, 2.17), hypertension (OR, 1.7), obesity (OR, 1.5), neoplasms (OR, 1.37), inflammatory polyarthropathies (OR, 1.31), systemic connective tissue disorder (OR, 1.25), diabetes mellitus (OR, 1.24), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR, 1.2), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (OR, 1.07), and coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR, 1.06). There were lower rates of paraplegia (OR, 0.43), hemiplegia (OR, 0.7), dementia (OR, 0.76), myocardial infarction (MI) (OR, 0.81), and heart failure (OR, 0.87) in the screened cohort. Each of the above reached statistical significance (P ≤ .01).

Conclusions

A small percentage of screening-eligible patients were actually screened for AAAs, less so based on SVS guidelines. Screening from each guideline was effective in reducing rupture rates. USPSTF guideline-based screened patients had higher rates of specific medical comorbidities, whereas a prior history of other comorbidities was less prevalent in screened patients. Medical comorbidities may influence clinical decisions to obtain AAA screening.

### Aortic aneurysm screening using duplex ultrasound: choosing wisely who to examine [^115UEnEx]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The noninvasive vascular laboratory plays a critical role in screening patients at risk for development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). One-time duplex ultrasound screening reduces aneurysm-related mortality due to rupture and is cost-effective. Population screening based on AAA risk factors is recommended, as it allows for proactive, elective repair of aneurysms at risk for rupture, and surveillance of smaller aneurysms for enlargement. Utilization of societal screening guidelines, such as those published by the Society for Vascular Surgery, can be employed by vascular laboratories to justify individual patient screening, aid primary care physicians to refer patients for testing, and encourage integrated medical health care systems to build prompts in patient electronic health records to ensure compliance with a AAA screening program. Risk factors for developing AAA, that is, age older than 65 years, male sex, family history, and a smoking history of > 100 cigarettes, should be used to recommend patient screening, including for women and other elderly (older than 75 years) patients who fall outside of professional societal guidelines.

A retrospective chart review of all patients screened for AAA from 2007 to 2016 within a regional Veterans Affairs health care system was conducted. Screening criteria were men 65 to 75 years of age who smoked a minimum of 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. An AAA was defined as a maximum aortic diameter ≥ 3 cm. A comparison was made of the AAA diagnosis rate and clinical adherence rate of screening criteria between the first 5 years and total years evaluated. AAA-related mortality was identified by using terminal diagnosis notes or autopsy reports. All data were recorded by August 31, 2017.

Results

A total of 19,649 patients (70.7 ± 4.8 years of age, mean ± standard deviation) were screened from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016. There were 9916 new patients screened from 2012 to 2016. A total of 1232 aneurysms (6.3% total patients) were identified during the 10-year period. The overall AAA diagnosis rate has declined from 7.2% in the first 5 years to 6.3% in 10 years (13.5% decrease; P < .01). There were 66 patients found with AAA ≥ 5.5 cm (5.3% of AAAs), and 54 of these patients received successful elective repair. A total of 2321 patients died (11.8%) and 6 deaths were suspected AAA ruptures (0.03%) within the analysis period. A total of 3680 patients screened (18.7%) did not meet screening criteria: 593 patients were < 65 years of age, 3087 patients were > 75 years of age, and 59 patients were women. This rate has declined from 28.2% within the first 5 years to 18.7% overall in 10 years (33.7% decrease; P < .01). The compliance of screened patients using screening criteria improved significantly from 61.7% in 2007 to 92.4% in 2016 (P < .01). The overall compliance rate since implementation of the screening program during the past 10 years is 81.3%.

Conclusions

The overall 10-year rate of AAA diagnosis is 6.3%. There are more smaller aneurysms (3.0–4.4 cm) detected and fewer large AAAs ≥ 5.5 cm in the last 5 years compared with the first 5 years of the screening program. The overall AAA-related mortality rate of all screened patients is 0.03%. There were 54 patients with AAA ≥ 5.5 cm who underwent successful elective repair resulting from the AAA screening program. The overall compliance of screened patients using screening criteria improved significantly from 61.7% in 2007 to 81.3% since implementation of the screening program during the past 10 years.

### Impact of implicit abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in the veterans affairs health care system over 10 years [^1125dWHr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease, typically considered an abdominal aortic diameter > 3 cm, has a pooled global prevalence of 4.8% and is commonly seen in men aged ≥ 65 years. Most small AAAs (< 4 cm) are asymptomatic and pose little danger, whereas larger AAAs have a significant risk of fatal rupture. At a diameter of 5.5 cm, asymptomatic aneurysms are considered for surgical or endovascular repair to prevent rupture. Given the significant risk associated with larger AAAs, screening programs have been implemented in the United States and other countries to detect aneurysms earlier and at smaller diameters, so that surveillance and intervention can reduce the incidence of rupture.

The US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended in 2005 that men aged 65 to 75 years with any history of smoking undergo a 1‐time AAA screening via ultrasonography. This recommendation was based largely on the outcomes of 4 population‐based randomized controlled trials of sonographic AAA screening performed in the United Kingdom and Australia, which at that time collectively demonstrated a reduction in AAA‐specific mortality, which favored screening (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.45–0.74). An extrapolation of the trials' findings to a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 US men aged 65 to 74 years showed that 89% of AAA‐attributable death could be prevented by screening only those with smoking history.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm or AAA ("triple A") is one of the top 15 leading causes of death in the United States. In this condition, a weakened aortic wall can lead to progressive aortic diameter enlargement and, in some cases, rupture. Aortic rupture is highly morbid and lethal with a mortality rate of up to ~80%.

Risk factors for AAA (defined here as a maximal aortic diameter > 3.5 cm) include advanced age, male sex, smoking, family history of the condition, and hypertension –. AAA can be treated via open or endovascular repair. The mortality rate of the surgery can be just 2–3%. Surgery is indicated for AAAs > 5.5 cm or expanding at a rate > 1 cm/year. Since most AAAs are asymptomatic, screening and surveillance are essential –.

Ultrasound permits accurate and safe detection of AAAs with sensitivity/specificity of 94–100% –. Furthermore, guidelines (e.g. Society for Vascular Surgery) and programs (e.g. Medicare) are in place for one-time screening in specific populations (e.g. men above 65 yearsor men and women aged 65–75 years who have ever smoked,) and for surveillance (e.g. every 12–36 months for AAAs < 5 cm 3). However, ultrasound requires an expert operator, capital equipment, and costs ~$100 per scan. As a result, ultrasound is used in < 1–20% of those patients eligible for AAA screening, and AAA diagnosis is often made based on incidental findings when imaging for other reasons or at the time of rupture. About 1.3 years of life are lost for every 10 unscreened patients, which is similar to breast cancer screening. Ultrasound may be underutilized for AAA surveillance as well. The guidelines assume fixed AAA expansion rates, but AAAs can grow in spurts or even shrink over time. The guidelines and programs are also based on the argument that competing causes of death are significant at very old ages (e.g. > 80 years). However, this argument may become less tenable as society ages and the quality of healthcare advances.

### Overview of screening eligibility in patients undergoing ruptured AAA repair from 2003 to 2019 in the vascular quality initiative [^1116urYR]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although efforts such as the Screening Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Very Efficiently (SAAAVE) Act have improved access to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening, certain high-risk populations are currently excluded from the guidelines yet may benefit from screening. We therefore examined all patients who underwent repair of ruptured AAA (rAAA) to characterize those who are ineligible for screening under current guidelines and evaluate the potential impact of these restrictions on their disease.

Methods

We identified patients undergoing rAAA repair in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) database between 2003 and 2019. These patients were stratified by AAA screening eligibility according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement guidelines. We then described baseline characteristics to identify high-risk features of these cohorts. Groups with disproportionate representation in the screening-ineligible cohort were identified as potential targets of screening expansion. Trends over time in screening eligibility and the proportion of AAA repairs performed for rAAA were also analyzed.

Results

A total of 5340 patients underwent rAAA repair. The majority (66%) were screening-ineligible. When characterizing the screening-ineligible group by sex and risk factors (smoking history or family history of AAA), the largest contributors to screening ineligibility were males less than 65 years of age with a smoking history or family history of AAA (25%), males greater than 75 years of age with a smoking history (25%), and females older than 65 years of age with a smoking history (19%). In comparison with rAAAs prior to implementation of the SAAAVE act, the proportion of AAA repair performed for rupture among males undergoing AAA repair in the VQI decreased from 12% to 8% (P < .001), whereas in females, there was no change (P = 0.990). There was no statically significant difference in screening eligibility for either males (P = 0.762) or females (P = 0.335).

Conclusions

Most patients who underwent rAAA repair were ineligible for initial AAA screening or aged out of the screening window. Furthermore, rAAA rates and screening ineligibility have not improved as much as expected since the passage of the SAAAVE Act. Our data suggest that three high-risk populations may benefit from expansion of AAA screening guidelines: males with a smoking history or family history of AAA between ages 55 and 64 years, female smokers older than 65 years, and male smokers older than 75 years who are otherwise in good health. Increased efforts to screen these high-risk populations may increase elective AAA repair and minimize the morbidity and mortality associated with rAAAs.

### The adult well-male examination [^114Rs2vb]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

The adult well-male examination should provide evidence-based guidance toward the promotion of optimal health and well-being. The medical history should focus on tobacco and alcohol use, risk of human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted infections, and diet and exercise habits. The physical examination should include blood pressure screening, and height and weight measurements to calculate body mass index. Lipid screening is performed in men 40 to 75 years of age; there is insufficient evidence for screening younger men. One-time screening ultrasonography for detection of abdominal aortic aneurysm is recommended in men 65 to 75 years of age who have ever smoked. Screening for prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen testing in men 55 to 69 years of age should be individualized using shared decision making. Screening for colorectal cancer should begin at 50 years of age for average-risk men and continue until at least 75 years of age. Screening options include fecal immunochemical testing, colonoscopy, or computed tomography colonography. Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography is recommended in men 55 to 80 years of age who have at least a 30-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Immunizations should be updated according to guidelines from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

### Outcomes of an abdominal aortic aneurysm screening program [^112Cs4Qo]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2007, Medicare guidelines were established to identify persons at risk for the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 5-year outcomes of an AAA screening program in a regional Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system.

Methods

Data were extracted from a regional VA health care network identifying all veteran males 65 to 75 years of age who smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime. In 2007, an AAA screening mandate was implemented allowing patients meeting screening criteria to be evaluated for AAA as part of the patient's health maintenance. AAA is identified as an aortic diameter size of 3.0 cm or greater. Clinician adherence to screening protocols and referral to a vascular surgeon for aneurysms > 5.5 cm were also evaluated.

Results

A total of 9751 patients (71.5 ± 5.6 standard deviation years of age) were screened for an AAA over a 5-year period from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. A total of 698 aneurysms (7.1%) were found. Referrals to a vascular surgeon were made on 45 patients with aneurysms > 5.5 cm. Over a 5-year period, a total of 2754 patients (28.2%) were inappropriately screened: 416 patients were under 65 years old, 2243 patients were over 75 years old, 36 patients were women, and 123 patients without aneurysms had multiple screenings. In 2007, during the first year of implementation, 39.2% of patients were inappropriately screened. Over the next 4 years, inappropriate screenings decreased with 33.7% in 2008, 28.6% in 2009, 17.7% in 2010, and 14.3% in 2011.

Conclusions

A large AAA screening program at the VA detects more aneurysms, but at smaller diameters than that published in clinical trials. Over time, the number of inappropriate AAA screenings has continued to decrease, demonstrating greater awareness and application of the AAA screening guidelines by primary care providers. Developing surveillance guidelines for small and medium aneurysms is a potential area for future research.

### Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of polygenic risk score-stratified screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^117FwCto]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an enlargement of the abdominal aorta to greater than 3 cm diameter. To promote early detection and management of AAA (which reduces the likelihood of fatal aortic ruptures), authorities in the UK, Sweden, and Oslo, Norway, offer screening to all men aged 65. By contrast, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends a one-off screening with ultrasound scan (USS) in men aged 65–75 who have ever smoked and recommends selective screening based on clinical judgement in men who have never smoked. However, despite the introduction of such screening programmes, ruptured AAA continues to be a significant source of morbidity and mortality, exemplified by AAA's contribution to around 0.8% of deaths in men aged 65 and older and 0.4% in women aged 65 and older in England and Wales.

Rupture of AAAs occurs primarily in people not captured by current screening programmes. They include, for example women, men under 65, men invited to screening at 65 but who did not attend, and men with a normal aortic ultrasound scan at age 65 but who develop an AAA later in life. A small number of ruptures also occur in screen-detected AAAseither prior to reaching the threshold for elective intervention, whilst waiting for this intervention, or after being declared unfit for intervention. However, the prevalence of AAA is falling over time. For example, less than 1% of men screened as part of the UK National Health Service (NHS) abdominal aortic aneurysm screening programme (NAAASP) in 2021 were observed to have an AAA. By contrast, the prevalence of AAA was 4.9% in the UK Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS), carried out in 1997–9. This temporal decline in the population burden of AAA suggests that the cost-effectiveness of AAA screening may also be changing, encouraging consideration and evaluation of more targeted screening approaches. The USPSTF has, for example, highlighted that research is needed to define the benefits of screening in particular subgroups, suggesting that a stratified approach may have net benefit over current strategies. One potential subgroup is current cigarette smokers, for whom a strong association with AAAhas been reported (7-fold increase in risk in men, and 15-fold in women).

### Meta-analysis of the current prevalence of screen-detected abdominal aortic aneurysm in women [^111HfXcN]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Previously abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has been considered a male‐dominated disorder, with four to six times more men than women receiving both elective and emergency AAA repair, and epidemiological studies showing that the prevalence of AAA was three to six times higher in men than in women 1, 2, 3. Women tend to develop AAA later in life than men 4, 5. Population screening for AAA in men has been introduced in several countries, to reduce mortality from ruptured AAA 6. However, today almost one‐third of the patients presenting to hospital with ruptured AAA are women and their mortality is very high, so that women are contributing an increasing proportion of AAA deaths 7, 8. Therefore, it is questionable whether women are being offered appropriate diagnosis and adequate management of their AAA 9.

Smoking is the strongest risk factor for AAA, the association being much stronger than that between smoking and other forms of cardiovascular disease 10. Historically, women took up smoking in large numbers some 15–20 years after men, and several studies 11, 12, 13 suggest that today the prevalence of smoking may be higher in women than in men. There has been a steady decline in the prevalence of smoking over the past 25–30 years, most notably among men, which has been linked to a declining prevalence of screen‐detected AAA in men, from 4–5 per cent in the 1990s to about 1–2 per cent today 14, 15. Other factors, including the more widespread use of diagnostic imaging leading to an increasing incidental detection of AAA, could also have contributed to the declining prevalence of screen‐detected AAA in men. There are far fewer data available for women. This study is a systematic review of contemporary (2000 or later) AAA screening studies in women, to assess the population prevalence, and determine how this may vary with age and smoking status.

### Trends, risk factors, and outcomes of selective screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms in at-risk patients [^1169Yd2c]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

For men ages 65 to 75 years without a smoking history and for women ages 65 to 75 years with a smoking history, the United States Preventative Service Task Force recommends that primary care providers (PCPs) use their clinical judgement when offering abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening. This study describes the trends in screening for these cohorts, identifies factors that may influence screening rates, and compares outcomes between screened and unscreened patients.

Methods

The TriNetX population database was queried for subjects with routine PCP visit between ages 65 to 75 from 2007 to 2023 to create cohorts of male smokers, male nonsmokers, and female smokers. Prevalence and 1- and 3-year incidences of AAA screening by ultrasound and computed tomography scans/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) were calculated. Screened and unscreened patients' demographics, diagnoses, and medications were compared. Rates of AAA diagnosis and repair were compared between unmatched screened and unscreened patients.

Results

Screening for all groups peaked in 2023. Male smokers had the highest screening prevalence (21.2%), followed by male nonsmokers (3.1%) and female smokers (0.90%). The 1-year incidence of screening increased for male smokers, peaking at 8.2% in 2021. The 1-year incidence plateaued at 1.9% for male nonsmokers in 2020 and remained between 0.25% and 0.35% for female smokers for the whole observation period. By 2023, 23.6%, 14.3%, and 24.3% of male smokers, male nonsmokers, and female smokers had been screened via CT/MRI, respectively, with CT/MRI comprising the majority of screening events for all three cohorts. Hyperlipidemia and statin use were associated with screening for all groups (P < .05), whereas a personal history of coronary artery disease was associated with no screening. Screening for male nonsmokers was associated with hypertension, diabetes, and chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (P < .05). Screening in female smokers was associated with family history of coronary artery disease (odds ratio, 1.50; P < .001). For all groups, screening was associated with unruptured AAA diagnosis and endovascular aortic repair (P < .05). Screened female smokers had similar rates of AAA diagnosis as male nonsmokers (4.58% and 4.37%, respectively).

Conclusions

AAA screening in all at-risk populations increases diagnosis and treatment of AAA, but the screening rate is low for all groups, even with increasing CT/MRI use. Patients with strong risk factors for AAA are not undergoing screening. Collaboration with PCPs is necessary to increase screening rates and ensure that patients with the most clinically consequential risk factors are managed appropriately.

### Analysis of clinical benefit, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening women for abdominal aortic aneurysm [^111poq8W]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

There would be no quick answers from doing a randomised trial of AAA screening in women, because of the large sample size and long-term follow-up that would be required. The alternative is long-term modelling. This requires contemporary and reliable estimates of parameters that can influence the clinical and cost-effectiveness of screening in women. The aim of this project was to obtain this information and then apply discrete event simulation modelling to explore the hypothesis that a variation of the current AAA screening programmes for men might prove clinically beneficial and cost-effective in reducing deaths from ruptured AAA in women.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Historically, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has been considered to be a disease in older male smokers, with prevalence being 4–5 times higher in men than in women. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL using the terms "abdominal aortic aneurysm", "aneurysm", "women" OR "gender" OR "sex" OR "women's health" OR "sex difference", "prevalence" OR "incidence" OR "occurrence" OR "frequency", "screening", and "population" OR "population-based". The search was restricted to major European languages and the final search date was Jan 15, 2017. Four randomised trials of population screening in older men have shown that screening can reduce AAA-related deaths by up to half, meta-analysis of these trials indicate a small decrease in all-cause mortality, and associated studies have shown that screening is cost-effective. Therefore, in many countries or regions, there are programmes for ultrasonographic AAA screening for men. In women, AAA screening is not recommended as there has been only a single underpowered randomised trial to date. However, the rupture rate of small AAAs is four times higher in women than in men, and a third of the deaths from AAA rupture are in women. Moreover, women with incidentally detected AAA are disadvantaged with respect to availability of elective repair, the types of treatment available, and the higher elective operative mortality and complication rates compared with men. Although the effect of AAA screening on quality of life has been assessed in men, the instruments used might not be sensitive to detect either small changes or changes in specific health domains such as depression and emotional status and, to our knowledge, there have been no studies in women to date.

### Population-based study of incidence of acute abdominal aortic aneurysms with projected impact of screening strategy [^1138b1fq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

We have also shown that a risk-factor–targeted screening strategy would both increase the number of deaths prevented and life-years saved and reduce the number of scans required per year. Current smoking was particularly strongly associated with occurrence of acute AAA at younger ages. The U.S. Medicare screening program limits screening to men age 65 years who have ever smoked, whereas our data suggest that screening could be further limited to current smokers. Screening only male current smokers age 65 and then all men at age 75 would result in an almost 4-fold increase in the number of deaths prevented and a 3-fold increase in the number of life-years saved, compared to the current UK strategy, with an approximate 20% reduction in the number of scans required.

Previous HTN was a particularly important risk factor in women, being present in 93% of those with incident acute AAA. Over one quarter of acute AAA events at all ages currently occur in women, rising to one third by 2030, and so consideration should be given to offering screening to women with risk factors, and a policy of screening all women age 75 with known HTN might be evaluated in randomized trials. We found that such a policy would potentially prevent 150 deaths per year in the UK, with 590 scans required to prevent each death and 93 scans per year of life saved.

### The adult well male examination [^117UHZ5W]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

The adult well male examination should incorporate evidence-based guidance toward the promotion of optimal health and well-being, including screening tests shown to improve health outcomes. Nearly one-third of men report not having a primary care physician. The medical history should include substance use; risk factors for sexually transmitted infections; diet and exercise habits; and symptoms of depression. Physical examination should include blood pressure and body mass index screening. Men with sustained blood pressures greater than 135/80 mm Hg should be screened for diabetes mellitus. Lipid screening is warranted in all men 35 years and older, and in men 20 to 34 years of age who have cardiovascular risk factors. Ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm should occur between 65 and 75 years of age in men who have ever smoked. There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening men for osteoporosis or skin cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has provisionally recommended against prostate-specific antigen-based screening for prostate cancer because the harms of testing and overtreatment outweigh potential benefits. Screening for colorectal cancer should begin at 50 years of age in men of average risk and continue until at least 75 years of age. Screening should be performed by high-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing every year, flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years combined with fecal occult blood testing every three years. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening for testicular cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Immunizations should be recommended according to guidelines from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

### Long term outcomes in men screened for abdominal aortic aneurysm: prospective cohort study [^111PP41Z]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Men with abdominal aortic aneurysm therefore have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, suggesting that secondary prevention interventions for cardiovascular disease are appropriate. Men with an aortic diameter of 25–29 mm have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which disappears when confounders such as smoking, deprivation, and hypertension are taken into account. The Tromso study compared participants with an aortic diameter of 27–29 mm with a reference group measuring 21–23 mm and found a twofold increase in cardiovascular mortality in the higher diameter group. In our study, the increased risk of mortality from all causes for the 25–29 mm category became non-significant after adjustment for confounding variables, perhaps reflecting the differing diameter criteria used. However, there was a significantly increased risk of subsequent hospital admission due to hypertensive and ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It could be argued that interventions known to reduce the impact of these factors, such as smoking cessation, antihypertensive treatment, statins, and aspirin, might reduce that risk.

Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm is being implemented throughout the United Kingdom. According to current proposed protocols, men with an aortic diameter less than 30 mm would receive no further intervention and no follow-up screening. In the Tromso study, it was recommended that those participants with an aortic diameter greater than 27 mm should be followed up for subsequent development of an aneurysm and for cardiovascular risk reduction, although specifics of a follow-up regimen were not given. Another study was even more tentative, concluding that it remains unclear whether screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm could be used to identify people at risk of cardiovascular disease.

Strengths and weaknesses of the study

Our study has several strengths. The cohort comprised 86% of men aged 65–74 in Highland and Western Isles at the time of enrolment. We obtained outcome data by linking to national hospital admissions and cancer and death registrations, with no loss to follow-up. Data were available on a wide range of potential confounders, including smoking, health status, family medical history, and socioeconomic status, enabling these to be taken into account. An obvious limitation is that no women were included in the cohort. Most screening programmes for aortic aneurysm to date have not included women as they are less likely to have aortic aneurysmand are likely to have them later in life than men. Furthermore, although the cohort was large, relatively few men died, so the study may have lacked power to detect differences for some of the specific causes of mortality.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening: how many life years lost from underuse of the Medicare screening benefit? [^116VdUfZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Since 2007, Medicare has provided one-time abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening for men with smoking history, and men and women with a family history of AAA as part of its Welcome to Medicare visit.

Objective

We examined utilization of the new AAA screening benefit and estimated how increased utilization could influence population health as measured by life years gained. Additionally, we explored the impact of expanding screening to women with smoking history.

Design

Analysis of Medicare claims and a simulation model to estimate the effects of screening, using published data for parameter estimates.

Setting

AAA screening in the primary care setting.

Patients

Newly-enrolled Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years, with smoking history or family history of AAA.

Main Measures

Life expectancy, 10-year survival rates.

Key Results

Medicare data revealed low utilization of AAA screening, under 1% among those eligible. We estimate that screening could increase life expectancy per individual invited to screening for men with smoking history (0.11 years), with family history of AAA (0.17 years), and women with family history (0.08 years), and smoking history (0.09 years). Average gains of 131 life years per 1,000 persons screened for AAA compare favorably with the grade B United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation for breast cancer screening, which yields 95–128 life years per 1,000 women screened. These findings were robust over a range of scenarios.

Limitations

The simulation results reflect assumptions regarding AAA prevalence, treatment, and outcomes in specific populations based on published research and US survey data. Published data on women were limited.

Conclusions

The Welcome to Medicare and AAA screening benefits have been underutilized. Increasing utilization of AAA screening would yield substantial gains in life expectancy. Expanding screening to women with smoking history also has the potential for substantial health benefits.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening context — family history, sex/age considerations, and repeat screening: The "lifetime prevalence of AAA is estimated to be 32% in brothers of those with AAA", and "Select women may be at risk for AAA and related complications". "Select patients < 65 years of age may be at increased risk of AAA rupture", but "in patients < 65 years, data are lacking on the mortality benefit of AAA screening". "Some patients may develop AAA after the age of 75 years even if they had an initial negative screen between the ages of 65 and 75 years", yet "data from cohort studies suggest long-term AAA-related mortality is low among patients with an initial negative screening ultrasound who had a subsequent AAA detected on repeat screening after the age of 75 years". For borderline enlargement with risk factors, selected low-surgical-risk patients "may be considered for repeat screening on an individualized basis".

ASSESSMENT OF RISK Important risk factors for AAA include older age, male sex, smoking, and having a first-degree relative with an AAA. 13–16 Other risk factors include a history of other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. 17–19 Factors associated with a reduced risk include African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, Asian ethnicity, and diabetes. 13, 20–24 Risk factors for AAA rupture include older age, female sex, smoking, and elevated blood pressure. 1 Clinicians should consider the presence of comorbid conditions and not offering screening if patients are unable to undergo surgical intervention or have a reduced life expectancy. Smoking Status. Epidemiologic literature commonly defines an "ever smoker" as someone who has smoked 100 or more cigarettes. Indirect evidence shows that smoking is the strongest predictor of AAA prevalence, growth, and rupture rates.

1 There is a dose-response relationship, as greater smoking exposure is associated with an increased risk for AAA.

1. Family History. Family history of AAA in a first-degree relative doubles the risk of developing AAA. 25 The risk of developing an AAA is stronger with a female first-degree relative than with a male first-degree relative. 1, 25 However, evidence is lacking on whether persons with family history experience a different natural history or surgical outcomes than those without such a history.
2. SCREENING TESTS The primary method of screening for AAA is conventional abdominal duplex ultrasonography. SCREENING INTERVALS Evidence is adequate to support 1-time screening for men who have ever smoked.

All of the population-based randomized clinical trials of AAA screening used a 1-time screening approach; 7 fair- to good-quality cohort studies and 1 fair-quality case-control study show that AAA-associated mortality over 5 to 12 years is rare in men with initially normal results on ultrasonography.

1. 33 In women, small AAAs have an increased risk of rupture and rupture at an older age than in men. 1 Studies estimate that one-fourth to one-third of women have an AAA with a diameter below the current 5. 5-cm threshold at the time of rupture. 1.

### USPSTF recommends screening older men who… [^114Cs7Mx]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The group that benefits most from screening is men ages 65–75 who smoke or used to smoke. The task force recommends one-time AAA screening with ultrasonography in this group — a "B" recommendation. "Screening can reduce AAA-related death, rupture and emergency surgery, " said USPSTF member Michael Barry, M. D., in a related news release. "The evidence shows that older men who are current or past smokers benefit the most from screening and should be screened. Older men who have never smoked might also consider screening". For men this age who have never smoked, the USPSTF recommends that physicians selectively offer screening with ultrasonography — a "C" recommendation. In such instances, patients and physicians should carefully consider the balance of benefits and harms of screening based on evidence relevant to the patient's personal medical history, family history of AAA, other risk factors and personal values.

As for women, the task force said they are significantly less likely than men to experience AAA and have a higher risk of harm from treatment of the condition than do men. Treatment can entail surgeries that may be unnecessary, harmful and potentially life-threatening. For these reasons, the USPSTF recommends against routine screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women who have never smoked and have no family history — a "D" recommendation. However, for women ages 65–75 who are current or past smokers or who have a family history of AAA, the USPSTF concluded that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA with ultrasonography and, therefore, recommends that physicians use their judgment — in concert with patients' preferences and values — when deciding who should be screened — an "I" recommendation.

"The task force found that women who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA have a very low chance of having AAA and should not be screened because the evidence shows it could be harmful, " says family physician and task force member Chyke Doubeni, M. D. M. P. H., in the release. "However, for women who have ever smoked or who have a family history of AAA, more research is needed to determine if screening is beneficial". Finally, a number of commenters said the populations recommended for AAA screening should be expanded. However, the task force said it didn't want to expand the scope of its recommendation statement beyond the populations justified according to its review of the current evidence. Rather, task force members called for research focused on the benefits and harms of screening in these additional groups.

### Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm… [^112Qp8BV]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Women Ages 65 to 75 Years Who Have Ever Smoked. Only one RCT on screening for AAA included women. 7 It detected no difference in the rate of AAA rupture, AAA-specific mortality, or all-cause mortality between women invited for screening and the control group. 8 However, the trial was ultimately underpowered to detect differences in health outcomes by sex; as such, the results do not rule out the possibility of a small benefit of screening in this population. Women age 70 years who have ever smoked have a relatively low prevalence of AAA. 9 Evidence is inadequate to conclude whether one-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography is beneficial in women ages 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. Women Who Have Never Smoked. The prevalence of AAA in women who have never smoked is low. 5, 9 The evidence also shows no apparent benefit of screening for AAA in women.

8 The USPSTF therefore concludes that adequate evidence shows that the absolute benefit of one-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in women who have never smoked can effectively be bounded at none or almost none. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA in women ages 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for AAA outweigh any potential benefits in women who have never smoked. Screening in Men Ages 65 to 75 Years Who Have Never Smoked. Despite the demonstrated benefits of screening for AAA in men overall, the lower prevalence of AAA in male never-smokers versus male ever-smokers suggests that clinicians should consider a patient's risk factors and the potential for harm before screening for AAA rather than routinely offering screening to all male never-smokers.

SCREENING INTERVALS Evidence is adequate to support one-time screening in men who have ever smoked. All of the population-based RCTs of AAA screening used a one-time screening approach, and several fair- to good-quality prospective cohort studies show that AAA-associated mortality over 5 to 12 years is low in men with initially normal results on ultrasonography. 1, 2.

### Abstract… [^114cSBhC]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients without symptoms, screening for carotid artery stenosis does not improve outcomes and is not recommended by the USPSTF or the AAFP. 15, 16 The low prevalence of carotid artery stenosis in the population leads to a high rate of false-positive results. No reliable method exists to estimate stroke risk for patients who are asymptomatic with carotid artery stenosis.
15. The most recent guidelines for stroke prevention are from
2021. Carotid endarterectomy is recommended for patients with transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke within the past six months and ipsilateral severe carotid artery stenosis when the estimated perioperative morbidity and mortality risk is less than 6%. In a single-arm study of transcarotid artery revascularization in patients at high risk of complications from endarterectomy, only 2. 3% of patients experienced stroke or death within 30 days of surgery.

28 ABI is less sensitive in patients with small vessel disease from atherosclerosis associated with hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease. The USPSTF and AAFP conclude that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for PAD with ABI in adults who are asymptomatic. 29, 30. 33 RAS is difficult to accurately diagnose by noninvasive methods. Vascular duplex ultrasonography is an accurate screening tool but does not often correlate well with computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography, which may overestimate RAS. Angiography, the diagnostic standard, is also subject to interobserver variability and does not always correlate with ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance angiography.
