## Question

Cholesterol 114

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a total cholesterol value of 114 mg/dL and what clinical actions, if any, are appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the lipid fraction involved and whether this is total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol. Then, I should verify the unit and perform a quick unit conversion to ensure we're not mixing mmol/L and mg/dL. Next, I will compare the value to population norms and guideline thresholds to classify risk. After that, I need to consider potential causes of low total cholesterol, including genetic, nutritional, hepatic, and medication-related etiologies. Finally, I will outline a practical evaluation plan and clarify when treatment or further testing is warranted, making sure I don't over-interpret a single data point without context.

> Let me first confirm the analyte and unit. A reported "cholesterol 114" most plausibly refers to total cholesterol measured in mg/dL. If it were LDL cholesterol, it would typically be labeled LDL-C, and if it were in mmol/L, 114 mmol/L would be physiologically impossible, so I should correct that assumption and proceed with 114 mg/dL as total cholesterol, which equals approximately 2.95 mmol/L using the standard conversion factor of 38.6 mg/dL per mmol/L [^112LNQLr].

> Now, I should classify where 114 mg/dL sits relative to population benchmarks. Wait, let me verify the optimal total cholesterol range cited by major guidelines: the AHA/ACC notes that optimal total cholesterol is about 150 mg/dL, corresponding to LDL-C around 100 mg/dL, and that levels near this range are associated with low ASCVD event rates. By contrast, NHANES-era data show mean total cholesterol around 203 mg/dL, so 114 mg/dL is substantially below average and below the "optimal" benchmark of about 150 mg/dL, placing it in a low range rather than a high-risk category [^111HqJEA] [^116Fq2wT] [^112WQy5r].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm pediatric versus adult cut points. For adults, there is no formal "too low" total cholesterol threshold in cardiovascular guidelines, whereas pediatric tables list acceptable total cholesterol as less than 170 mg/dL, so an adult total cholesterol of 114 mg/dL is low but not categorized as pathological by adult lipid guidelines, which focus on elevated atherogenic cholesterol rather than defining a lower bound for total cholesterol [^1146tkEK] [^116dbGRD].

> Next, I should review potential causes of low total cholesterol. Let me think about this systematically: primary causes include genetic conditions such as hypobetalipoproteinemia, secondary causes include severe malnutrition or fat restriction, liver disease affecting lipoprotein synthesis, and certain medications. I initially thought statins could explain a value this low, but wait, I should double-check — statins typically lower LDL-C by about 30–50% and would rarely drive total cholesterol to 114 mg/dL unless baseline was already very low, so a statin effect alone is unlikely unless the pre-treatment total cholesterol was near 150–160 mg/dL, in which case a 30% reduction could reach this range. Other drugs like PCSK9 inhibitors can produce very low LDL-C and thus lower total cholesterol, and rare adverse effects of other agents can modestly affect lipids, so a careful medication reconciliation is essential [^114BGYMh] [^113b8LQh] [^111CzrrQ] [^1151ZXu9].

> I need to ensure I'm not missing a measurement artifact. Let me verify the lipid profile components: total cholesterol is the sum of LDL-C, HDL-C, and VLDL-C (estimated from triglycerides/5 when triglycerides are < 400 mg/dL), so a very low LDL-C and/or low HDL-C could both contribute to a total of 114 mg/dL. If LDL-C is very low, I should confirm there is no assay interference or Lp(a) confounding, and if HDL-C is low, I should consider secondary causes or genetic contributors, keeping in mind that non–HDL-C and apoB often track risk better than LDL-C alone in some settings [^114BNdyo] [^1113TbEL] [^112MyBhC].

> Next, I should review a practical clinical approach. I will now examine the full fasting or nonfasting lipid panel to see LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, and calculate non–HDL-C; I should confirm there is no calculation error and, if triglycerides are high, consider direct LDL-C or alternative methods. I should screen for secondary causes with history, nutrition review, liver enzymes, thyroid function, and a medication inventory, and I should ask about symptoms of fat-soluble vitamin deficiency or neuropathy if hereditary low-cholesterol states are suspected. If there is a family history of very low cholesterol or unexplained neuropathy or retinopathy, I should consider genetic counseling and testing for hypobetalipoproteinemia or related disorders, recognizing that markedly low LDL-C (< 50–70 mg/dL) is uncommon without therapy and may warrant specialist input [^11416FF5] [^1151ZXu9] [^1115GNwp].

> But wait, what if the patient is on combination lipid-lowering therapy already? I should confirm the baseline pre-treatment values and the percent LDL-C reduction achieved. Contemporary pathways endorse aggressive LDL-C lowering in very high-risk patients, and very low on-treatment LDL-C levels down to about 30–55 mg/dL have not shown increased adverse events in trials, so if 114 mg/dL total cholesterol reflects very low LDL-C on therapy, continuation is reasonable with monitoring for adherence and tolerability rather than automatic de-escalation [^117J6cZm] [^1113KeWi] [^114BGYMh].

> I should double-check whether any intervention is needed. For an asymptomatic adult with total cholesterol 114 mg/dL and no red flags, no pharmacologic therapy is indicated; the priority is to identify and address secondary causes, ensure adequate nutrition including fat intake for essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamin absorption, and monitor clinically. If hereditary hypobetalipoproteinemia is confirmed, fat-soluble vitamin supplementation and periodic ophthalmologic and neurologic follow-up are standard; if malnutrition or an eating disorder is present, that should be the focus of management rather than lipid-directed therapy [^notfound].

> In summary, I should confirm that "cholesterol 114" is total cholesterol in mg/dL, recognize it as below average and below the adult "optimal" benchmark of about 150 mg/dL, and avoid over-interpreting it as inherently harmful. Instead, I need to check the full lipid profile, evaluate for secondary causes and medications, consider genetic testing if hereditary patterns are suspected, and reserve specialist referral for persistent, unexplained very low LDL-C or concerning symptoms, while avoiding unnecessary lipid-lowering treatment in the absence of an indication [^111HqJEA] [^116Fq2wT] [^1151ZXu9].

A total cholesterol of 114 mg/dL is **low but not harmful** and is associated with a lower cardiovascular risk [^113Fg4TJ]. It is **not a standalone cause for concern** unless accompanied by symptoms or other abnormal labs. No specific treatment is needed; focus on a balanced diet, regular exercise, and routine follow-up. If low cholesterol persists or is accompanied by symptoms, evaluate for nutritional deficiencies, liver disease, or rare genetic disorders [^1151ZXu9].

## Clinical significance of total cholesterol 114 mg/dL

- **Normal range**: Total cholesterol is typically 150–199 mg/dL; 114 mg/dL is below average but not inherently harmful [^notfound].
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Lower total cholesterol is associated with reduced ASCVD risk [^111HqJEA] [^116Fq2wT].
- **Potential concerns**: Persistent low cholesterol may signal nutritional deficiencies, liver disease, or rare genetic disorders [^notfound].

## Factors influencing low total cholesterol levels

Several factors can contribute to **low total cholesterol levels**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Dietary factors | - Very low-fat diets <br/> - Malnutrition <br/> - Strict vegetarian/vegan diets without adequate fat intake |
| Medical conditions | - Liver disease <br/> - Hyperthyroidism <br/> - Malabsorption syndromes <br/> - Certain cancers |
| Medications | - Statins <br/> - Ezetimibe <br/> - PCSK9 inhibitors <br/> - Bile acid sequestrants |
| Genetic factors | - Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia <br/> - Abetalipoproteinemia |

---

## Health implications of low total cholesterol

Low total cholesterol is **generally not harmful** and may reduce cardiovascular risk [^111HqJEA]. Potential concerns include possible links to anxiety, depression, or cancer risk, though evidence is limited and mixed; clinically significant adverse effects are not well established.

---

## Recommended clinical evaluation

When a patient presents with **low total cholesterol**, the following evaluation is recommended:

- **Confirm results**: Repeat lipid panel to verify persistence.
- **Review history**: Assess diet, medications, and symptoms.
- **Secondary causes**: Evaluate for liver disease, hyperthyroidism, malabsorption, and nutritional deficiencies.
- **Genetic testing**: Consider if familial hypobetalipoproteinemia or abetalipoproteinemia is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Dietary adjustments**: Increase healthy fats (nuts, seeds, avocados, fatty fish, olive oil).
- **Treat underlying conditions**: Address liver disease, hyperthyroidism, or malabsorption.
- **Monitor**: Regular follow-up to track cholesterol and nutritional status.
- **Supplementation**: Consider fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) if malabsorption is present.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

There are **no specific guidelines** for low total cholesterol; management is individualized based on the cause and patient context. The emphasis remains on **cardiovascular risk reduction** and addressing modifiable risk factors [^112pfcZN].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

A total cholesterol of 114 mg/dL is **low but not inherently harmful** and is associated with lower cardiovascular risk [^notfound]. No specific treatment is required; focus on balanced nutrition, regular exercise, and routine follow-up. If low cholesterol persists or is accompanied by symptoms, evaluate for nutritional deficiencies, liver disease, or rare genetic disorders [^notfound].

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^111ykjRF]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

The leadership of the National Lipid Association convened an Expert Panel to develop a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. An Executive Summary of those recommendations was previously published. This document provides support for the recommendations outlined in the Executive Summary. The major conclusions include (1) an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis, the key underlying process contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events; (2) reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies; (3) the intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event; (4) atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting a clinical ASCVD event. Therefore, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies; (5) for patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk; (6) nonlipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus; and (7) the measurement and monitoring of atherogenic cholesterol levels remain an important part of a comprehensive ASCVD prevention strategy.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^113115Yt]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) were updated in late 2019 in light of recent intervention trials involving the use of innovative lipid-lowering agents in combination with statins. The new guidelines advocate achieving very low LDL-C levels in individuals at highest risk, within the paradigm of 'lower is better'. With the advent of combination therapy using ezetimibe and/or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors in addition to statins, the routine attainment of extremely low LDL-C levels in the clinic has become a reality. Moreover, clinical trials in this setting have shown that, over the 5–7 years of treatment experience to date, profound LDL-C lowering leads to further reduction in cardiovascular events compared with more moderate lipid lowering, with no associated safety concerns. These reassuring findings are bolstered by genetic studies showing lifelong very low LDL-C levels (< 1.4mmol/L; < 55mg/dL) are associated with lower cardiovascular risk than in the general population, with no known detrimental health effects. Nevertheless, long-term safety studies are required to consolidate the present evidence base. This review summarises key data supporting the ESC/EAS recommendation to reduce markedly LDL-C levels, with aggressive goals for LDL-C in patients at highest risk, and provides expert opinion on its significance for clinical practice.

### Safety and efficacy of nipocalimab in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis: results from the randomized phase 2 vivacity-MG study [^115ApVGE]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Mild dose-dependent decreases from baseline in the mean serum albumin were observed in the nipocalimab groups. At the highest dose group of 60 mg/kg Q2W, the mean albumin reduction at day 57 was −0.83 g/dL (baseline mean 4.34 g/dL, day 57 mean 3.5 g/dL); the albumin levels returned to baseline by the end of the posttreatment follow-up (4.8 g/dL at day 113). Overall, mean serum albumin concentrations stayed within the normal limits of 3.5–5.5 g/dL throughout the treatment and follow-up periods for all doses tested (eFigure 2). No grade 3 AESI of hypoalbuminemia was reported.

Nonfasting lipid levels were measured in this study (eTable 3). Mild dose-dependent and reversible elevations of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were observed. Baseline and postbaseline (average value over all postbaseline visits from day 8 to day 113 for that patient) values in the highest dose group of 60 mg/kg Q2W for mean total cholesterol levels were 168 (range 98–210) and 198 mg/dL (range 114–268), respectively, and mean LDL levels were 90 (range 37–131) and 108 mg/dL (range 40–170), respectively. Increases in HDL levels were also seen in the highest dose group of 60 mg/kg Q2W; the baseline and postbaseline mean HDL levels were 56 (range 23–83) and 64 mg/dL (range 25–94), respectively. Due to the increase in HDL level, the maximum mean percentage increases in the cholesterol-to-HDL ratio were < 5% across all nipocalimab dose groups. The average values for all dosing arms did not exceed the National Cholesterol Education Program's reference safety guidelines (Figure 2). No cholesterol change was reported as clinically significant in the study. Similarly, there were no clinically significant changes reported in other clinical laboratory evaluations, nor in vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, and C-SSRS.

### Efficacy and safety of further lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients starting with very low levels: a meta-analysis [^1113KeWi]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

In the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists Collaboration (CTTC), in patients starting with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of approximately 3.4 mmol/L (131.5 mg/dL), there was a 22% reduction in major vascular events per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) lowering of LDL-C. The magnitude of clinical benefit of further LDL-C lowering in patients already with very low LDL-C levels remains debated.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy and safety of further lowering LDL-C levels in patient populations presenting with median LDL-C levels of 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or less.

Data Sources and Study Selection

The CTTC was used for statin data. For nonstatin therapy, Medline database was searched (2015-April 2018). Key inclusion criteria were a randomized, double-blind, controlled cardiovascular outcome trial of LDL-C lowering with data in populations starting with LDL-C levels averaging 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or less.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors independently extracted data into standardized data sheets, and data were analyzed using meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The risk ratio (RR) of major vascular events (a composite of coronary heart death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or coronary revascularization) per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C level.

Results

In the subgroup of patients from the CTTC meta-analysis of statins with a mean LDL-C in the control arm of 1.7 mmol/L (65.7 mg/dL), 1922 major vascular events occurred and the RR for major vascular events per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.65–0.94). For 3 trials of nonstatin LDL-C-lowering therapies added to statins, there were 50 627 patients, the median LDL-C in the control arms ranged from 1.6 mmol/L to 1.8 mmol/L (63 mg/dL to 70 mg/dL), and 9570 major vascular events occurred. Nonstatin therapy lowered LDL-C by 0.3 to 1.2 mmol/L (11 mg/dL to 45 mg/dL), and the RR for major vascular events per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.70–0.88). For statins and nonstatins combined, the RR was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.71–0.87; P < .001). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering was not associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events, myalgias and/or myositis, elevation in the level of aminotransferases, new-onset diabetes, hemorrhagic stroke, or cancer.

Conclusions and Relevance

There is a consistent relative risk reduction in major vascular events per change in LDL-C in patient populations starting as low as a median of 1.6 mmol/L (63 mg/dL) and achieving levels as low as a median of 0.5 mmol/L (21 mg/dL), with no observed offsetting adverse effects. These data suggest further lowering of LDL-C beyond the lowest current targets would further reduce cardiovascular risk.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115RKokL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — treatment targets in moderate hypertriglyceridemia: We recommend that the treatment goal for patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia be a non-HDL cholesterol level in agreement with NCEP ATP guidelines. Non-HDL cholesterol (total serum cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol) reflects the amount of cholesterol in all atherogenic lipoprotein particles, and measurement of non-HDL cholesterol is recommended in subjects with hypertriglyceridemia both for risk stratification and as a secondary target for therapy. Alternatively, the blood level of atherogenic lipoprotein particles can be assessed by measuring the concentration of apoB, and because measurement of apoB is helpful in the differentiation of FCHL from FHTG, apoB levels may be measured during an initial evaluation of a hypertriglyceridemic patient; non-HDL cholesterol can then be followed as the therapeutic target.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^116GcMEM]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Dietary cholesterol — magnitude of lipid changes per 100 mg/day — shows small average increases in circulating cholesterol. An increase of 100 mg/day in dietary cholesterol was reported to increase total-C approximately 2 to 3 mg/dL. Weggemans et al. predicted that an addition of 100 mg/day increases total-C by 2.17 mg/dL, LDL-C by 1.93 mg/dL, and HDL-C by 0.31 mg/dL, producing a total-C:HDL-C ratio increase of 0.02, based on 17 studies involving 556 subjects with diets differing only in cholesterol or egg yolks over at least 14 days.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Primary prevention — adults 40 to 75 years with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL without diabetes mellitus: In intermediate-risk patients, LDL-C levels "should be reduced by 30% or more", and for optimal ASCVD risk reduction, especially in high-risk patients, "levels should be reduced by 50% or more"; adults should be categorized by Pooled Cohort Equations as low risk (< 5%), borderline risk (5% to < 7.5%), intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20%), and high-risk (≥ 20%), and clinicians and patients "should engage in a risk discussion" that considers benefits, adverse effects, drug–drug interactions, lifestyle, and preferences for an individualized decision.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^116R6py5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — lipid screening — Screening for dyslipidemias is not necessary for the safe initiation of CHCs because of the low likelihood of clinically significant changes with use of hormonal contraceptives; a systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with lipid measurement before initiation of hormonal contraceptives. During 2015–2016 among women aged 20–39 years in the United States, 6.7% had high cholesterol, defined as total serum cholesterol ≥ 240 mg/dL. Few poor-quality studies suggest that women with known dyslipidemias using CHCs might be at increased risk for myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or venous thromboembolism compared with women without dyslipidemias, no studies were identified that examined risk for pancreatitis, and studies have reported mixed results on lipid levels with unclear clinical significance.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^117J6cZm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — LDL-C thresholds and nonstatin considerations: Adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk should be treated first at the maximally tolerated statin intensity. If patients have achieved ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 85 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and monitor adherence and LDL-C response. In view of trial evidence and very low LDL-C levels achieved with nonstatin therapies, a lower LDL-C threshold of LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≤ 85 mg/dL) is recommended by the writing committee, and preference should be given to therapies with demonstrated cardiovascular outcomes benefits. Individuals who achieve LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL experience lower event rates than those with higher LDL-C, there appears to be no LDL-C level below which benefit ceases, and lifelong very low LDL-C levels in the range of 15–30 mg/dL are associated with a lower incidence of ASCVD without adverse effects.

### Lipid management beyond the guidelines [^116vPDwE]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline builds on the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline statin recommendations to provide more detailed recommendations for the use of nonstatin therapy risk stratification for primary prevention statin use. New information has become available after the development of the 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline that can further inform clinical practice. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type-9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies are now a reasonable or even good value following over 60% reductions in their acquisition price, and the identification of high risk patient groups most likely to benefit from further low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering. Meta-analyses and clinical trial data now show that patients with LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dl are more likely to experience progressively greater reductions in the risk of cardiovascular and total mortality and coronary heart disease events for progressively higher LDL-C levels. Icosapent ethyl, a highly concentrated form of modified EPA has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in high risk patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia on statin therapy. Comparisons with other statin guidelines revealed that statin initiation for those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk is the most effective strategy for reducing the most ASCVD events for the proportion of the population treated. Data from younger populations finally became available for coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring (mean age of 51 years) which confirmed the value of CAC > 0 for identifying individuals at increased ASCVD risk most likely to benefit from statin initiation. This analysis also found that statins could keep CAC = 0 in those with risk factors. Epidemiologic pooling studies now clearly show that LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in young adulthood confer excess risk for ASCVD later in life. Accumulating data support earlier risk factor intervention trials as the next research priority.

### Is there a relation between lateral epicondylitis and total cholesterol levels? [^112S2RUS]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate whether high total cholesterol (TC) levels are associated with lateral epicondylitis (LE).

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all patients with LE who presented to our institution between 2011 and 2015. The inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of LE based on clinical history and physical examination findings and age between 40 and 55 years. For healthy controls, we obtained data from a national cohort (sixth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) aged between 40 and 55 years. We compared TC levels between the groups, determined the incidence of hypercholesterolemia (TC level ≥ 240 mg/dL) according to the occurrence of LE, and calculated odds ratios for the occurrence of LE. We also evaluated whether cholesterol levels were associated with clinical findings of LE, such as pain level, onset age, symptom duration, and number of corticosteroid injections.

Results

The study comprised 289 patients with LE (mean age, 47.9 years) and 1,077 healthy individuals (mean age, 47.7 years). TC levels were significantly higher in patients with LE than in healthy individuals (205.0 mg/dL vs 194.6 mg/dL, P < .001). The mean difference of 10.4 mg/dL was clinically meaningful because a change of 10 mg/dL with medical intervention is considered significant. The incidence of hypercholesterolemia was higher in LE patients than in healthy controls (16.6% vs 9.0%, P < .001). After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and glucose level, patients with hypercholesterolemia (TC level ≥ 240 mg/dL) were 2.47 (95% confidence interval, 1.65–3.70) times more likely to experience LE than those with normal cholesterol levels (< 200 mg/dL). TC levels correlated with pain level, onset age, and number of corticosteroid injections.

Conclusions

A clinically meaningful difference in TC levels was found between LE patients and healthy controls. In addition, the incidence of hypercholesterolemia was higher in LE patients than in controls. The present findings suggest a potential association between high TC levels and LE.

Level Of Evidence

Level III, case-control study.

Primary prevention adults 40 to 75 years of age with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.7 to 4.8 mmol/L) without diabetes mellitus — risk estimation and statin intensity are specified as follows: the 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk should be estimated by using the race- and sex-specific pooled cohort equations (PCE), and adults should be categorized as low risk (< 5%), borderline risk (5% to < 7.5%), intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20%), and high-risk (≥ 20%); in adults at intermediate-risk, if a decision is made for statin therapy after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in intermediate-risk patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more, and for optimal ASCVD risk reduction, especially in high-risk patients, levels should be reduced by 50% or more; and clinicians and patients should engage in a risk discussion that considers risk factors, healthy lifestyle, expected ASCVD risk-reduction benefits, potential adverse effects and drug–drug interactions, and patient preferences.

### Prevalence of dyslipidemia and lipid goal attainment in statin-treated subjects from 3 data sources: a retrospective analysis [^111zg4F7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Treatment guidelines for reducing cardiovascular risk focus on lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on the basis of extensive evidence from primary and secondary prevention trials with statins. Treatment goals for LDL-C, as specified by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III, are risk stratified: < 100 mg/dL for high-risk patients (coronary heart disease [CHD] or CHD risk equivalents, 10-year risk > 20%), < 130 mg/dL for moderate-risk patients (≥ 2 risk factors, 10-year risk 10% to 20%), and < 160 mg/dL for low-risk patients (0 to 1 risk factors). CHD risk assessment is generally evaluated with the Framingham scoring system, which takes into account cigarette smoking, treated or untreated systolic hypertension, sex, age, total cholesterol level, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level. The 2004 update to the NCEP ATP III added an optional LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL for very high-risk patients (established cardiovascular disease [CVD] with multiple major risk factors), which also has been endorsed by the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the American Diabetes Association. –

Although statins are excellent at reducing LDL-C and remain the mainstay of lipid-modifying therapies, patients optimally treated with statins continue to have cardiovascular events. One potential reason for this might be suboptimal non–HDL-C levels. The NCEP ATP III recommends non–HDL-C as a secondary target in patients with elevated triglycerides (TG) (≥ 200 mg/dL) after the LDL-C goal has been achieved.

There is some confirmation, based on recent evaluations and reviews, that non–HDL-C does have an impact on cardiovascular outcomes. – Additionally, Boekholdt et al, in a meta-analysis evaluating statin-treated patients, concluded that elevated non–HDL-C imparted just as much high risk for cardiovascular events as elevated LDL-C. With the growing evidence that non–HDL-C is a better predictor of outcomes, the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Diabetes Association Consensus Conference, in 2008 endorsed non–HDL-C as a cotarget in patients with cardiometabolic risk.

### Hit or miss: the new cholesterol targets [^111HmLvz]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Drug treatment to reduce cholesterol to new target levels is now recommended in four moderate- to high-risk patient populations: patients who have already sustained a cardiovascular event, adult diabetic patients, individuals with low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥ 190mg/dL and individuals with an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk ≥ 7.5%. Achieving these cholesterol target levels did not confer any additional benefit in a systematic review of 35 randomised controlled trials. Recommending cholesterol lowering treatment based on estimated cardiovascular risk fails to identify many high-risk patients and may lead to unnecessary treatment of low-risk individuals. The negative results of numerous cholesterol lowering randomised controlled trials call into question the validity of using low density lipoprotein cholesterol as a surrogate target for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^116U8Lqy]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Non–HDL–C and LDL–C — The NLA Expert Panel's consensus view is that non–HDL–C (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) is a better primary target for modification than LDL–C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and non–HDL–C is listed first to emphasize its primary importance. LDL–C comprises ~75% of the cholesterol in circulation carried by lipoprotein particles other than HDL. Epidemiologic studies have shown that non–HDL–C is a stronger predictor of ASCVD morbidity and mortality than LDL–C. Using non–HDL–C as a target for intervention also simplifies the management of patients with high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), and an elevated triglyceride concentration confounds the relationship between LDL–C and ASCVD risk, but this appears to be less of an issue with non–HDL–C.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment — scope and general use: ASCVD risk assessment includes lipoprotein lipid levels, evaluation of other major risk factors, clinical evidence of ASCVD, and conditions associated with high or very high risk (including LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL and chronic kidney disease [CKD] stage 3B or higher). Quantitative risk scoring is generally not recommended for high-risk and very high–risk groups unless a validated equation for that subset is used. ASCVD risk category is used to define treatment goals for atherogenic cholesterol and when pharmacotherapy might be considered, and lifestyle therapy should be emphasized and monitored in all patients with elevated atherogenic cholesterol whether or not pharmacotherapy is used.

Metabolic syndrome and patient profile

MetS affected 13.5% of the entire study sample (Table 1). Sex-dependent differences were observed regarding hyperlipidaemia, with more women having hyperlipidaemia with a significantly higher total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol concentration compared with men (Table 1). This finding of significantly higher total cholesterol levels in women was observed in all subgroups (see Figure 1) except in the overweight patients and patients ≥ 60 years. Especially in the subgroups of obese and hypertonic women, not only was total cholesterol significantly higher than in their respective male subgroups (220.8 [54.1] vs. 183.7 [41.2] mg/dl, P < 0.05, and 206.2 [42.6] vs. 185.9 [34.6] mg/dl, P < 0.05, respectively) but LDL cholesterol was also significantly higher (135.0 [48.5] vs. 98.0 [34.8], P < 0.05, and 114.5 [39.2] vs. 100.1 [27.8] mg/dl, P < 0.05). Remarkably, compared with the whole female sample and other female subgroups, HDL cholesterol in obese women was lowest at 62.8 [23.0] mg/dl. Consequently, this lower HDL cholesterol value resulted in an increase in the total cholesterol/HDL ratio, which was higher in men than in women in the total sample (Table 1) and in all other subgroups. In obese patients, however, the total cholesterol/HDL ratio of 3.65 [1.15] for women was not different from that of men (3.64 [0.91]). Furthermore, in all male subgroups, triglycerides were elevated and higher than those in their female counterparts, particularly in obese men (172.3 [75.2] vs. 115.08 [71.2], P < 0.05) and in male patients with insufficient glycaemic control (132.9 [68.7] vs. 109.7 [63.3], P < 0.05).

Dietary cholesterol — LDL-C effects and ASCVD risk context are described as follows: In controlled feeding randomized controlled trials (RCTs), each 100 mg/day of dietary cholesterol raises low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by an average of ~1.9 mg/dL, while observational data report no association between dietary cholesterol or egg consumption and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in the general population but suggest increased ASCVD risk with greater cholesterol and egg consumption in those with diabetes mellitus; accordingly, the NLA Expert Panel bases recommendations mainly on controlled-feeding RCTs showing modest effects of dietary cholesterol to raise total-C and LDL-C, recognizing that other dietary factors more reliably influence atherogenic cholesterol levels.

Pathophysiological Characteristics of the 4 Major apoB Dyslipoproteinemic Phenotypes

Normal

Normal (Figure 6A) is defined as a normal production and clearance rate of VLDL apoB particles and a normal production and clearance rate of LDL particles, which results in a normal level of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and apoB. A normal level of triglycerides is defined as a value < 1.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). This level was selected because it is the level above which cholesterol‐depleted LDL particles become more common. As explained above, a normal number of VLDL and LDL apoB particles is defined as an apoB < 105 mg/dL. The triglycerides/apoB ratio (millimoles per gram per liter) must be < 10/1 and the TC/apoB (millimoles per gram per liter) ratio will be < 6.2. Importantly, in some individuals, the LDL‐C will be elevated (≥ 3.6 mmol/L, > 135 mg/dL [ie, ≥ 75th percentile]), but the total apoB will be < 105 mg/dL (ie, < 75th percentile). In these cases, the LDL particles are cholesterol enriched, but the total atherogenic particle number is not increased. Therefore, cardiovascular risk attributable to the apoB lipoproteins is not as increased in these individuals as the elevated LDL‐C suggests. The degree of risk attributable to the apoB lipoproteins is determined by the plasma apoB. Such individuals should be reassured and informed that this is a normal variant.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^1151ZXu9]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

AACE dyslipidemia — identifying genetic dyslipidemias specifies abnormal lipid thresholds and prompts for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH): At initial assessment, an elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is defined as > 160 mg/dL, elevated triglycerides (TG) (fasting) as > 150 mg/dL, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as < 45 mg/dL for men and < 55 mg/dL for women; the algorithm starts with extreme clinical findings or significantly abnormal lipid profiles. Suspicion for FH should be considered when the LDL-C is at the 95th percentile or higher, and heterozygous FH has an estimated worldwide prevalence of 1:250. Observing an LDL-C > 190 mg/dL (> 4.9 mmol/L) in adulthood should prompt consideration of heterozygous FH with the use of a likelihood scoring system such as the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) system, the Simon Broome Register criteria, or the U.S. Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Deaths (MEDPED) Diagnostic Criteria for FH. The presence of tendon xanthomas with much less extreme LDL-C levels should prompt consideration of sitosterolemia or cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Secondary causes for extremely low LDL-C (< 39 mg/dL or < 1 mmol/L) far outnumber monogenic causes.

Utility of non-HDL-C measurement — Increased non-HDL-C, defined as the difference between total cholesterol and HDL-C, is highly associated with the development of ASCVD events, is not affected by fasting status, and at low atherogenic lipid concentrations can be readily estimated from the standard lipid panel. The statement notes that several meta-analyses support the superiority of non-HDL-C and apoB over LDL-C for ASCVD risk and on-treatment risk assessment, and one meta-analysis reported that apoB was the most potent marker of relative risk reduction for ASCVD with RRR, 1.43.

Dyslipidemia risk rationale — In randomized controlled trials, each reduction of 1% in LDL-C or non-HDL-C is associated with a 1% reduction in coronary heart disease event risk over a period of ~5 years, and genetic variants generally show that each 1% difference in LDL-C is associated with a 2–3% difference in CHD risk; results from intervention studies lasting only ~ 5 years likely underestimate the potential benefit of decades-long exposure to lower levels of atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol. In the Copenhagen Heart Studies, each 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) difference in LDL-C was associated with a 47% difference in CHD event risk, whereas each 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) difference in VLDL-C was associated with a CHD risk difference of 182%, supporting the importance of both LDL-C and non-HDL-C as targets of therapy.

Recommendation‐specific supportive text

In 2007, a meta‐analysis of 61 prospective studies analyzed ischemic heart disease mortality as a function of total cholesterol or non‐high‐ density lipoprotein cholesterol (non‐HDL‐C) stratified by sex and age (5th to 9th decade). Relative risk of ischemic heart disease mortality related to the level of total cholesterol or non‐HDL‐C was highest among 40‐49 year‐olds. Relative risk decreased in a graded fashion with each advancing decade, but it remained statistically significant to age 80‐89 years. In contrast, absolute risk was lowest in the youngest age group and increased with advancing age.

The prospective Copenhagen General Study investigated the association of LDL‐C with incident myocardial infarction (MI) and ASCVD in 91,131 participants ranging in age from 20‐100 years old; 10,591 participants were 70‐79 years old and 3,188 participants were 80‐100 years old. Higher LDL‐C was predictive of incident MI and ASCVD independent of age. As in the Prospective Studies Collaboration, relative risks of MI and ASCVD (expressed as adjusted hazard ratios (HRadj)) were highest in the youngest (20‐49 year‐old) age group (MI HRadj 1.68 (95% CI 1.45‐1.87); ASCVD HRadj 1.47 (95% CI 1.32‐1.64)) and lowest in the oldest (80‐100 year‐old) age group (MI HRadj 1.28 (95% CI 1.08‐1.52); ASCVD HRadj 1.16 (95% CI 1.05‐1.29)). By contrast, absolute risk of events was lowest in the youngest age group and highest in the oldest age group. Based on these prospective observational data, the authors estimated the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent MI or ASCVD for every 1 mmol/L (38.67 mg/dL) lowering of LDL‐C over 5 years. The estimated NNT declined with each decade of age (Figure 2). For ASCVD, the estimated NNT for 80‐100 year‐old participants was 42 compared to 345 for 50‐59 year‐old participants; for MI, the respective estimated NNTs were 80 and 439. Thus, LDL‐C is an important risk factor among patients older than 75 years and should be measured for ASCVD risk stratification.

LDL-C and non–HDL-C preventive thresholds — evidence cited supports an LDL-C concentration of < 100 mg/dL and a non–HDL-C level of < 130 mg/dL for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), corresponding to an LDL-C concentration of ∼ 100 mg/dL; lipid-lowering therapy which reduced LDL-C to ≤ 100 mg/dL was associated with a significantly lower percentage of total and CHD-related deaths (40% vs 61%) compared with patients with LDL-C of ≥ 100 mg/dL, and lower-risk associations have been shown to be present to LDL-C values of < 55 mg/dL; designation of non–HDL-C treatment targets as 30 mg/dL more than the LDL-C concentration is based on the assumption that "normal" very low–density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) when triglycerides are < 150 mg/dL is typically ≤ 30 mg/dL, whereas when triglycerides are elevated, VLDL-C is typically > 30 mg/dL; in observational studies, each 1 mg/dL increment in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with an increment in ASCVD event risk at least as large as that for each 1 mg/dL increase in LDL-C.

Whom to screen: how do we recognize index cases?

Probands (index cases) should be identified according to the following criteria:
plasma total cholesterol ≥ 8 mmol/L (≥ 310 mg/dL) in an adult or adult family member(s) (or > 95th percentile by age and gender for country),
premature CHD in the subject or family member(s),
tendon xanthomas in the subject or family member(s),
sudden premature cardiac death in a family member.

For child probands, criteria #(ii)–(iv) are identical to those of adults, but criterion #(i) should be a plasma total cholesterol ≥ 6 mmol/L (≥ 230 mg/dL) in a child or child family member(s) (or > 95th percentile by age and gender for country). The highest likelihood of detecting FH is in those with very high LDL cholesterol levels, tendon xanthomas, and/or premature CHD in a family member.

Drawing a family pedigree (Figure 7) is essential to evaluate the likelihood of FH (Table 1). In cases of probable or definite FH, cascade screening using LDL cholesterol measurement in the family should be conducted and the subject referred for genetic testing if available, with subsequent cascade testing in the family if a causative mutation is found. Initial family members to be tested are biological first-degree relatives, namely parents, siblings, and children. Biological second-degree relatives including grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, and half-siblings should also be considered. 'Premature CHD' signifies CHD before age 55 in males and before age 60 in female first-degree relatives, while in second-degree relatives, the corresponding ages are 50 and 55.

### 2013 cholesterol guidelines revisited: percent LDL cholesterol reduction or attained LDL cholesterol level or both for prognosis? [^117LiauX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol recommends moderate- to high-intensity statins for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease but departs from the traditional treat-to-target approach. Whether percent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction or attained LDL-C levels add incremental prognostic value to statin dose is not known.

Methods

Patients in the Treating to New Targets (TNT), Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL), and Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trials (patient-level data) randomized to a statin arm (atorvastatin 80 mg/10 mg or simvastatin 20 mg) were chosen. Patients were divided into groups based on attained LDL-C levels (≤ 70 vs > 70 mg/dL) and percent LDL-C reduction (≥ 50% vs < 50%). Primary outcome was major cardiovascular event defined as death due to coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or stroke. Incremental prognostic value was assessed by using a forward conditional Cox proportional hazards model. Two models were tested: Model 1: Step 1 statin dose; Step 2 add attained LDL-C levels (continuous variable); Step 3 add percent LDL-C reduction (continuous variable). Model 2: Steps 2 and 3 were reversed.

Results

Among 13,937 patients included in this study, percent LDL-C reduction added incremental prognostic value over both statin dose and attained LDL-C levels (global chi-square increased from 3.64 to 26.1 to 47.5; P < .0001). However, attained LDL-C level did not provide incremental prognostic value over statin dose and percent LDL-C reduction (global chi-square increased from 3.64 to 47.5 to 47.5; P < .0001 and .94, respectively). Among patients with attained LDL-C ≤ 70 mg/dL, those with percent LDL-C reduction of < 50% had a significantly higher risk of primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16–1.97; p = 0.002) and stroke (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.46–2.93; P < .0001) and a numerically higher risk of death (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.98–1.90; p = 0.06) when compared with the group with percent LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50%.

Conclusions

In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, percent LDL-C reduction provides incremental prognostic value over statin dose and attained LDL-C levels. However, the attained LDL-C level does not provide additional prognostic value over statin dose and percent LDL-C reduction.

The Role of Other Atherogenic Lipids

Beyond LDL‐C, elevated levels of other atherogenic lipids contribute to an individual's ASCVD risk. For example, elevated lipoprotein(a) is a genetically determined, independent, causal risk factor for ASCVD. Current AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines recommend consideration of a lipoprotein(a) level ≥ 50 mg/dL (or ≥ 125 nmol/L) if measured as a risk‐enhancing factor to guide statin initiation in those at borderline or intermediate risk of ASCVD events. Guidance on how to incorporate lipoprotein(a) concentration into a person's 10‐year ASCVD risk has also recently been provided within a statement from the AHA. Statins do not lower lipoprotein(a) and, in some studies, have been associated with increased lipoprotein(a) levels among recipients. Consequently, clinicians should be aware that elevated lipoprotein(a) remains an important contributor to ASCVD risk in the setting of LDL‐C lowering with statins.

In addition to lipoprotein(a), triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins (which are reflected in measures such as non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and remnant cholesterol) contribute to lipid‐related risk for ASCVD. Persistent elevations of triglycerides ≥ 175 mg/dL are recognized as a risk‐enhancing factor in the AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines.

### Should all diabetic patients be treated with a statin? [^112DRFDJ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CARDIOVASCULAR RISK ASSESSMENT OF DIABETIC PATIENTS: IMPLICATIONS IN PRACTICE GUIDELINES

The NCEP ATP III guidelines recognized the fact that not all diabetic patients are alike. The authors chose to consider all diabetic patients to be in the highest-risk category, because of the notion that most seemingly low-risk diabetic patients are younger and do not manifest multiple major risk factors. However, if their risk is projected to age 65 years, the majority will attain a risk of 20%. For example, in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), individuals aged 50 years, with both diabetes and metabolic syndrome, had the highest prevalence of CHD (19.2%), compared with individuals with neither condition. Among people with diabetes, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was extremely high (86%). In the small subset of diabetic patients who did not meet the criteria for metabolic syndrome, the incidence of CHD was only 7.5%, which was comparable to that of individuals with neither diabetes nor metabolic syndrome (8.7%). Furthermore, diabetic patients have an increased case-fatality rate with an MI, and their overall prognosis for survival is far worse once they develop CHD than it is for CHD patients without diabetes, making primary prevention of cardiovascular events extremely important in this patient population. Therefore, an LDL cholesterol goal of < 100 mg/dl was set for all patients with diabetes. It is stated that if a patient with diabetes and no CVD is considered to be at lower risk, because of young age or lack of other risk factors, an LDL-lowering drug should not be started if the LDL cholesterol level is < 130 mg/dl, depending on clinical judgment.

### Olanzapine [^112NuCAT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dyslipidemia

Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed with olanzapine use. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using olanzapine, is recommended [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Clinically significant, and sometimes very high (> 500 mg/dL), elevations in triglyceride levels have been observed with olanzapine use. Modest mean increases in total cholesterol have also been seen with olanzapine use.

Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults — In an analysis of 5 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies with treatment duration up to 12 weeks, olanzapine-treated patients had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.3 mg/dL, 3.0 mg/dL, and 20.8 mg/dL respectively compared to decreases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 6.1 mg/dL, 4.3 mg/dL, and 10.7 mg/dL for placebo-treated patients. For fasting HDL cholesterol, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between olanzapine-treated patients and placebo-treated patients. Mean increases in fasting lipid values (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline, where lipid dysregulation was defined as patients diagnosed with dyslipidemia or related adverse reactions, patients treated with lipid lowering agents, or patients with high baseline lipid levels.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^117XuUuN]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA dyslipidemia recommendations — atherogenic cholesterol lowering and ASCVD risk: For statin therapy, every 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduced major vascular events by 22% (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.76–0.80; P < .001) after approximately 5 years; reductions in LDL-C of 77.4 and 116.1 mg/dL would be expected to reduce the risk of a major vascular event by 40% and 53%, respectively. Over approximately 5 years, each 1% reduction in LDL-C or non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is associated with an approximately 1% reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) event risk. With high intensity statin therapy, the best average LDL-C reduction (~50%) would be associated with ~50% reduction in CHD events or ~40% reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events assuming a mean untreated LDL-C of 150 mg/dL and a 75 mg/dL reduction. Lifelong genetic evidence suggests that ASCVD risk reduction per 1% atherogenic cholesterol lowering may be greater, with reductions of ~3% per 1% lower LDL-C concentration over decades.

Progressive atherosclerosis or recurrent events despite evidence-based therapy — NLA Expert Panel consensus emphasizes that "little evidence is available from RCTs" to guide such patients on high-intensity statins; "very aggressive therapy to lower atherogenic cholesterol levels to values well below goal thresholds may be considered", although "this approach is not clearly supported by clinical trial evidence". Additional evaluation "such as an elevated level of Lp(a) or other additional risk indicators may be warranted", and "nonlipid risk factors should be well controlled in such patients".

Estimated Decline in ASCVD 10 With Statin Therapy

Assumptions included (1) for each 39‐mg/dL decline in LDL‐C, ASCVD events would fall 21% for ASCVD 10 ≥ 20% and 33% for ASCVD 10 < 20% 15; (2) LDL–C would fall 33% with moderate‐intensity and 51% with high‐intensity statin therapy, that is, the conservative end of the estimated 30% to < 50% LDL‐C reduction with moderate‐intensity and ≥ 50% decline with high‐intensity statins 6, 29; and (3) for patients with prior stroke or myocardial infarction in whom ASCVD 10 is not calculated, a 39% 10‐year risk was assigned. In subjects with angina or transient ischemic attack, a 10‐year risk of 31.5% was assigned. Estimates were derived as follows. Adults with clinical CHD have a ≥ 26% 10‐year risk of another CHD event. Patients with CHD risk equivalent status, excluding diabetes mellitus, 6 have a 10‐year CHD risk of > 20%. 20, 30, 31 Respective risks of 26% and 21% were multiplied by 1.5, which assumes ASCVD 10 event rates were 50% greater than 10‐year CHD risk alone. This assumption is conservative, as annual numbers of strokes (≈795 000) and myocardial infarctions (≈735 000) in the United States are similar. 1, 2

ASCVD 10, while not required for treating adults aged 21 to 79 years with LDL‐C ≥ 190 mg/dL, 6 was calculated to estimate absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed‐to‐treat (NNT). The ACC/AHA ASCVD risk calculator accepts ages 20 to 79 years and limits total cholesterol values to a maximum of 320 mg/dL. In NHANES 2007–2012, 0.59% of adults aged 21 to 79 years in the fasting sample used for this analysis had total cholesterol levels of > 320, and all of them had LDL‐C levels of ≥ 190 mg/dL. Total cholesterol values > 320 were entered as 320 in the ASCVD risk calculator.

### Efficacy and safety of alirocumab in reducing lipids and cardiovascular events [^113b8LQh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The study ODYSSEY was published by Robinson JG and colleagues in 2015 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Dyslipidemia. In the ODYSSEY study, the trial question was: what is the role of alirocumab in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events? In the ODYSSEY study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ODYSSEY study, the population was: 2341 patients (884 female, 1457 male). The inclusion criteria were patients at high risk for cardiovascular events who had LDL cholesterol levels ≥ 70 mg/dL and were receiving treatment with statins at the maximum tolerated dose, with or without other lipid-lowering therapy. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years, LDL cholesterol < 70 mg/dL, fasting serum triglycerides > 400 mg/dL. In the ODYSSEY study, the interventions were: n = 1553 alirocumab (150 mg as a single 1 mL subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks for 78 weeks) n = 788 placebo (matching placebo as a single 1 mL subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks for 78 weeks). In the ODYSSEY study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in change in calculated LDL cholesterol level at 24 weeks (-61% vs. 0.8%; ARD -61.9, 95% CI -64.3 to -59.4). In the ODYSSEY study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in change in calculated LDL cholesterol at 78 weeks (-52.4% vs. 3.6%; ARD -56, 95% CI -59.1 to -52.8) Significant decrease in change in total cholesterol (-37.8% vs. -0.3%; ARD -37.5, 95% CI -39.1 to -35.9) Significant increase in change in HDL cholesterol (4% vs. -0.6%; AD 4.6%, 95% CI 3.3 to 5.9). In the ODYSSEY study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in any adverse event and adverse event leading to study-drug discontinuation. significant difference in myalgia (5.4% vs. 2.9%). In the ODYSSEY study, the conclusion was: in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events who had LDL cholesterol levels ≥ 70 mg/dL and were receiving treatment with statins at the maximum tolerated dose, with or without other lipid-lowering therapy, alirocumab was superior to placebo with respect to change in calculated LDL cholesterol level at 24 weeks.

### The importance of cholesterol follow-up testing under current statin treatment guidelines [^111S9YPi]. Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Under "treat to risk" goals, low-density (LDL)-cholesterol follow-up measurements monitor statin compliance rather than titration to target levels, however, there is little evidence showing that more-frequent monitoring reduces LDL-cholesterol. We therefore tested whether frequency of blood tests significantly predicted lipoprotein improvements in a large anonymized clinical laboratory database. Differences (∆ ± SE) in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol between baseline and follow-up visits were calculated for 97,548 men and 110,424 women whose physicians sent blood to Boston Heart Diagnostics for analysis between 2010 and 2017. When adjusted for age and follow-up duration, plasma concentration changes per each follow-up measurement in men and women respectively were -2.84 ± 0.10 mg/dL and -3.03 ± 0.10 mg/dL for total cholesterol, -3.78 ± 0.30 mg/dL and -2.26 ± 0.19 mg/dL for triglycerides, and -2.54 ± 0.09 mg/dL and -3.06 ± 0.09 mg/dL for LDL-cholesterol (all P < 10⁻¹⁶). Relative to baseline, significant decreases (P < 10⁻¹⁶) were observed for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd follow-up measurements for total cholesterol (mean ± SE, men: -9.4 ± 0.1, -11.9 ± 0.2, -13.7 ± 0.3; women: -8.0 ± 0.1, -10.5 ± 0.2, -12.6 ± 0.3 mg/dL, respectively), triglycerides (men: -10.3 ± 0.4, -12.8 ± 0.5, -13.4 ± 0.7; women: -6.4 ± 0.2, -8.8 ± 0.4, -10.1 ± 0.5 mg/dL, respectively) and LDL-cholesterol (men: -7.8 ± 0.1, -9.9 ± 0.2, -11.1 ± 0.2; women: -6.9 ± 0.1, -9.0 ± 0.2, -10.7 ± 0.2 mg/dL, respectively). When adjusted for regression to the mean, 6.9%, 9.9% and 11.8% of men, and 5.7%, 9.7% and 11.5% of women, went from having an LDL-cholesterol ≥ 160 to < 160 mg/dL for their 1st, 2nd, and 3rd follow-up measurements, respectively. We conclude that under usual physician care, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL-cholesterol concentrations decreased progressively with increased physician monitoring within a large patient population.

### Trends in serum lipids and lipoproteins of adults, 1960–2002 [^112WQy5r]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Serum total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol contribute significantly to atherosclerosis and its clinical sequelae. Previous analyses of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) showed that mean levels of total cholesterol of US adults had declined from 1960–1962 to 1988–1994, and mean levels of LDL cholesterol (available beginning in 1976) had declined between 1976–1980 and 1988–1994.

Objective

To examine trends in serum lipid levels among US adults between 1960 and 2002, with a particular focus on changes since the 1988–1994 NHANES survey.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Blood lipid measurements taken from 6098 to 15 719 adults who were examined in 5 distinct cross-sectional surveys of the US population during 1960–1962, 1971–1974, 1976–1980, 1988–1994, and 1999–2002.

Main Outcome Measures

Mean serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and geometric mean serum triglyceride levels, and the percentage of adults with a serum total cholesterol level of at least 240 mg/dL (≥ 6.22 mmol/L).

Results

Between 1988–1994 and 1999–2002, total serum cholesterol level of adults aged 20 years or older decreased from 206 mg/dL (5.34 mmol/L) to 203 mg/dL (5.26 mmol/L) (P = 0.009) and LDL cholesterol levels decreased from 129 mg/dL (3.34 mmol/L) to 123 mg/dL (3.19 mmol/L) (P < .001). Greater and significant decreases were observed in men 60 years or older and in women 50 years or older. The percentage of adults with a total cholesterol level of at least 240 mg/dL (≥ 6.22 mmol/L) decreased from 20% during 1988–1994 to 17% during 1999–2002 (P < .001). There was no change in mean HDL cholesterol levels and a nonsignificant increase in geometric mean serum triglyceride levels (P = 0.06).

Conclusions

The decrease in total cholesterol level observed during 1960–1994 and LDL cholesterol level observed during 1976–1994 has continued during 1999–2002 in men 60 to 74 years and women 50 to 74 years. The target value of no more than 17% of US adults with a total cholesterol level of at least 240 mg/dL (≥ 6.22 mmol/L), an objective of Healthy People 2010, has been attained. The increase in the proportion of adults using lipid-lowering medication, particularly in older age groups, likely contributed to the decreases in total and LDL cholesterol levels observed. The increased prevalence of obesity in the US population may have contributed to the increase in mean serum triglyceride levels.

### Lipid measurements in the management of cardiovascular diseases: practical recommendations a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association writing group [^114FkNBd]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Residual atherogenic burden assessment at low LDL-C — For patients at high ASCVD risk with LDL-C < 70 mg/dl, residual burden may be assessed using measures beyond LDL-C; the three most widely used assays are non-HDL-C, apoB, and LDL-P, which are more likely to be discordant from LDL-C in the presence of elevated plasma TG and/or low HDL-C. Triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol (TRL-C) is at least equivalent in atherogenicity to LDL-C, and a level of TRL-C < 30 mg/dl is considered desirable. Because non-HDL-C represents [(LDL-C) + (TRL-C)], a desirable level would be < 100 mg/dl once LDL-C is less than 70 mg/dL. Measurements of apoB or LDL-P may effectively identify patients with increased ASCVD risk due to higher atherogenic lipoprotein burden, and such patients may benefit from additional therapy (higher statin doses, adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors), although data from clinical trials are lacking on this topic.

The clinical calculator "Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk (ASCVD) risk score" for dyslipidemia, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2 and tobacco use.

The ASCVD calculator estimates the 10-year risk of heart attack or stroke in adults aged 40–79 based on factors like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking. It follows ACC/AHA guidelines to aid decisions on preventive measures, including statin use.

The Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk (ASCVD) risk score estimator is a tool designed to assess the 10-year risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for individuals between the ages of 40 and 79. It considers a variety of personal health inputs including age, gender, race, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking status, diabetes status, and whether the individual is undergoing blood pressure treatment.

Inputs for the ASCVD calculator include:

- Age in years
- **Gender**: categorized as Male or Female
- **Race**: either African American or Other
- Total Cholesterol, measured in mg/dL or mmol/L
- HDL Cholesterol, measured in mg/dL or mmol/L
- Systolic Blood Pressure, measured in mmHg or kPa
- **Smoking status**: Yes or No
- **Diabetes status**: Yes or No
- **Blood Pressure Treatment status**: Yes or No

Here's how the ASCVD calculation unfolds:

1. **Unit Conversion**:
	- If the cholesterol levels are given in mmol/L, they're multiplied by 38.67 to convert to mg/dL.
	- If the systolic blood pressure is in kPa, it is converted to mmHg by multiplying by 7.50062.

2. **Selection of Coefficients**:
	- Coefficients specific to the individual's race and gender form the basis of the calculations. These include distinctive values related to age, cholesterol levels, HDL levels, and systolic blood pressure, as well as the statuses of smoking and diabetes.

3. **Logarithmic Transformation**:
	- Intermediate values are calculated using logarithmic functions for age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure.

4. **Risk Score Calculation**:
	- The calculator amalgamates various terms, including age-related factors, cholesterol and HDL contributions, systolic blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and medication treatment, to derive a holistic score. This score is derived by combining the selected coefficients with the intermediate logarithmic values.

5. **Conversion to Risk Percentage**:
	- Using race- and gender-specific constants, the intermediate risk score is translated into a percentage risk value. This is achieved by adjusting the score and converting it to a percentage of 100 using exponential functions.

6. **Risk Interpretation**:
	- The calculated risk percentage is categorized into one of four distinct risk levels:

		- **Low risk**: Less than 5%
		- **Borderline risk**: Between 5% and 7.5%
		- **Intermediate risk**: Between 7.5% and 20%
		- **High risk**: 20% or more

The result of this calculation is a comprehensive output detailing the risk percentage and its corresponding risk category. This information is crucial for individuals and healthcare providers aiming to tailor preventive practices and interventions based on the assessed cardiovascular risk.

### Clinical application of low serum cholesterol as an indicator for suicide risk in major depression [^1136uVAo]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Serum total cholesterol is reported to be associated with suicidality and violence. We explored the clinical applicability of low serum total cholesterol as an indicator for suicide risk in major depression.

Method

We measured the serum cholesterol levels in 149 major depressive disorder patients admitted to an emergency room following a suicide attempt, in 149 non-suicidal depressive controls, and in 251 normal controls.

Results

Significant differences in total serum cholesterol levels were observed between the suicide patients and non-suicide depression patients and between violent suicide patients and non-violent suicide patients when age, sex, BMI and total serum protein levels were controlled. The cutoff point of 180 mg/dl gave a high sensitivity (82%), and the cutoff point 150 mg/dl gave a high specificity (72%). These points can be used as discriminative cutoffs between suicidal and non-suicidal depressive patients.

Limitations

A longitudinal study is necessary to confirm the clinical applicability of serum cholesterol as a predictive indicator of suicide risk in depression.

Conclusion

The results suggest that total cholesterol level may be a useful biological marker for the risk of suicide in depression patients.

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^117JUPp4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Cholesterol

Cholesterol‐containing lipoproteins are central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Elevated total cholesterol and LDL‐C are associated with increased ASCVD risk, – and lipid‐lowering medications can reduce this risk. – Intensive lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, should be recommended as first‐line therapy for all patients.

The newest iteration of the guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol (to reduce atherosclerotic CV risk in adults) have markedly changed the approach to lipid management, identifying statins as the preferred drug class to lower LDL‐C. Randomized controlled trial data support the use of statins to reduce CV risk in 4 groups: (1) those with known ASCVD, (2) those with an LDL‐C level ≥ 190 mg/dL, (3) those aged 40 to 75 years with DM and LDL‐C 70 to 189 md/dL, and (4) those aged 40 to 75 years with LDL‐C 70 to 189 mg/dL and an estimated ASCVD 10‐year risk of ≥ 7.5% (Table 4). The new pooled cohort risk estimator weighs age quite heavily; therefore, many more adults may be considered eligible for statin therapy despite having well‐controlled risk factors. Consequently, a central component of the new guideline recommendations is to have an informed discussion with the patient about the relative benefits and risks of drug therapy before starting a statin.

Table 4.
Groups in Who Randomized Controlled Trial Evidence Demonstrated a Reduction in ASCVD With Statin Therapy

Intensity of statin therapy is chosen to match the risk of those who are most likely to benefit (Table 4). A high‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by ≥ 50%, and a moderate‐intensity statin lowers LDL‐C by 30% to < 50%. Recommendations for statin intensity based on indication are summarized in Table 4. In addition, appropriate periodic monitoring (every 3 to 12 months) of lipid values should be obtained to monitor adherence, adequacy of response, and safety measures, as stated in the 2013 cholesterol guidelines.

Patients with increased concentrations of LDL‐C particles, decreased HDL‐C particles, and increased triglycerides carry an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and type 2 DM. This form of atherogenic dyslipidemia can be assessed by non–HDL‐C or by measuring an apolipoprotein B level. In addition, lipoprotein(a), which is a modified form of LDL that confers atherogenic risk independent of LDL‐C, can be elevated in the absence of other lipid abnormalities.

Atherogenic cholesterol and ASCVD risk — Non–HDL-C has been regularly shown to be a better predictor of ASCVD event risk than LDL-C, and the panel included both LDL-C and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL-C is the sum of LDL-C and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol) as atherogenic cholesterol components. Reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced, and numerous clinical trials of atherogenic cholesterol–lowering therapies have demonstrated their ability to reduce the incidence of ASCVD in proportion to the amount of LDL-C and non–HDL-C reduction. Examinations of on-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration compared with coronary heart disease (CHD) events in primary and secondary prevention also show a strong positive correlation, with effects evident with drug, diet/lifestyle, and surgical therapies and across the full spectrum of LDL-C and non–HDL-C levels. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' meta-analysis reported that a 1.0 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) change in LDL-C resulted in a 22% relative risk reduction.

Childhood lipid classification — low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) thresholds in Table 9 define acceptable < 110, borderline 110–129, and abnormal ≥ 130; values are in mg/dL, and to convert to SI units divide LDL-C results by 38.6. The cutpoints for high and borderline high represent approximately the 95th and 75th percentiles, respectively, and low cutpoints for HDL-C represent approximately the 10th percentile.

### Comparison of LDL-cholesterol direct measurement with the estimate using the friedewald formula in a sample of 10, 664 patients [^114BNdyo]. Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "LDL Calculated" for coronary artery disease, hypertriglyceridemia and dyslipidemia.

The Friedewald formula estimates LDL cholesterol from total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, a key marker of cardiovascular risk. LDL targets vary based on risk, with stricter goals for high-risk patients.

The LDL Cholesterol Calculator is designed to estimate the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood, providing an essential insight into cardiovascular health. It achieves this by requiring input values for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. These values can be entered in either mg/dL or mmol/L, and if needed, the calculator will convert the values to mg/dL using precise conversion factors: 38.67 for total and HDL cholesterol, and 88.57 for triglycerides.

With the necessity of unit conversion addressed, the LDL cholesterol is calculated using the following formula:

LDL cholesterol = total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - (triglycerides / 5)

This equation effectively estimates the LDL cholesterol, delivering the result in mg/dL and rounding it to two decimal places for precision.

The calculator then categorizes the LDL cholesterol level into one of several interpretation ranges, providing clarity on the result and its implications:

- LDL Cholesterol < 100 mg/dL is considered "Optimal", suggesting a lower cardiovascular risk.
- A reading between 100 and 129 mg/dL is "Near optimal/above optimal", signifying a slightly increased risk.
- Values from 130 to 159 mg/dL are labeled as "Borderline high", hinting at moderate risk levels.
- Results ranging from 160 to 189 mg/dL are classified as "High", indicating a significant risk that may necessitate intervention.
- An LDL level ≥ 190 mg/dL is "Very high", clearly pointing to a need for medical attention and lifestyle changes.

This categorization aligns with clinical guidelines, assisting individuals and healthcare providers in understanding cardiovascular risk and making informed decisions regarding health management.

### When a "normal" cholesterol level is not normal: exposing an unusual presentation of familial hypercholesterolemia [^115CuuUZ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). Medium credibility.

A classic finding in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia is the presence of markedly elevated levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with an LDL-C concentration of 190 mg/dL or greater. However, severe hypercholesterolemia is not inevitably present, and many patients who carry this diagnosis may have lower LDL-C levels. This case history describes a young woman whose mother and brother met clinical and genetic criteria for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, but who had only a mild elevation in LDL-C, falling to < 130 mg/dL after dietary intervention. Despite this finding, genetic testing revealed the presence of the same genetic variants as were noted in her mother and brother. In addition, a second genetic variant predisposing them to cholesterol gallstone formation was identified in all three family members. If genetic testing had not been performed, the diagnosis may have been missed or delayed, resulting in an increased risk for the vascular complications associated with familial hypercholesterolemia. This case supports the value of genetic testing of family members of those with familial hypercholesterolemia, even when LDL-C levels are not severely elevated.

### Lipid measurements in the management of cardiovascular diseases: practical recommendations a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association writing group [^114hCKuH]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Apolipoprotein B (apoB) measurement and treatment thresholds — guideline language: The 2018 AHA/ACC Multi-Society Cholesterol Guideline states that measurement of apoB "can be considered" when risk-enhancing factors would alter management, with a "relative indication" at triglycerides (TG) ≥ 200 mg/dL; it is unclear what level to begin or intensify therapy, but clinical consensus is that apoB ≥ 130 mg/dL is high and < 90 mg/dL is desirable. That guideline further stated that an apoB level ≥ 130 mg/dL "favors" starting statin therapy in primary prevention. The 2020 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/EASD guideline advocates that apoB > 65, > 80, and > 100 mg/dL for very high, high, and moderate ASCVD risk respectively "should lead to intensification of lipid therapy". Prior NLA recommendations gave clinical thresholds of apoB < 80 and < 90 mg/dL for high-risk patients and < 90 mg/dL in primary prevention, and for cross-reference an apoB > 110 mg/dL corresponds approximately to LDL-C 140–150 mg/dL.

Primary prevention — borderline/intermediate ASCVD risk in adults aged 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD or diabetes: Patients with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL and 10-year ASCVD risk of 5% to < 7.5% were judged borderline and initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy may be considered, while those with 7.5% to < 20% are intermediate risk and the guideline recommends that such patients be considered for treatment with a moderate-intensity statin; in borderline or intermediate risk started on moderate-intensity statin, patients are recommended to achieve a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL; inadequate response is defined as < 30% reduction or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), for which routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted; if these thresholds are not achieved, the writing committee recommends consideration of escalation to a high-intensity statin.

Atherogenic cholesterol–lowering drug therapy — A moderate- or high-intensity statin should be first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol, unless contraindicated; if goal not achieved, intensify atherogenic cholesterol–lowering drug therapy or refer to a lipid specialist. In a patient with very high triglycerides (≥ 500 mg/dL), a triglyceride-lowering drug may be considered for the first-line use to prevent pancreatitis. Monitor response and adherence to therapy every 4–12 months, and in most cases goal levels should be achieved in approximately 6 months.

Screening and classification of initial lipoprotein lipid levels — In all adults (≥ 20 years of age), a fasting or nonfasting lipoprotein profile should be obtained at least every 5 years and should include at minimum total cholesterol and HDL-C to allow calculation of non–HDL-C (total-C – HDL-C); if fasting (generally 9–12 hours), the LDL-C level may be calculated provided the triglyceride concentration is < 400 mg/dL. If atherogenic cholesterol levels (non–HDL-C and LDL-C) are in the desirable range, lipoprotein lipid measurement and ASCVD risk assessment should be repeated in 5 years, or sooner based on clinical judgment, with earlier rescreening prompted by changes in ASCVD risk factors (including weight gain), a premature ASCVD event in a first-degree relative, evidence of ASCVD in the patient, or a new potential secondary cause of dyslipidemia; for those with atherogenic cholesterol in the desirable range, public health recommendations regarding lifestyle should be emphasized.

### Trends in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol blood values between 2012 and 2017 suggest sluggish adoption of the recent 2013 treatment guidelines [^114qsxqK]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Over a 14-year period, age-adjusted high total cholesterol (≥ 240 mg/dL) in the United States declined from 18.3% in 1999 to 2000 to 11.0% in 2013 to 2014, coinciding with the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATP)-III guidelines that endorsed low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol blood value goals. Statin treatment recommendations were revised by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) in November 2013 to a "risk-based prescription" approach that did not utilize blood cholesterol values. This increased dosage and expanded the statin-eligible population by an estimated 12.8 million US adults. These changes should further lower total and LDL cholesterol concentrations nationally.

Methods

We examined data from 507 752 patients nationally aged ≥ 16 years whose fasting bloods were sent to Boston Heart Diagnostics for direct LDL-cholesterol measurements. Between 2012 and 2017, age-adjusted concentrations were examined by analysis of covariance and LDL-cholesterol ≥ 160 mg/dL by logistic regression.

Results

Contrary to expectations, age-adjusted mean LDL-cholesterol concentrations (± SE, mg/dL) increased significantly (P < 10⁻¹⁶) in men (2012:113.8 ± 0.3; 2013:115.3 ± 0.2; 2014:114.7 ± 0.2; 2015:116.0 ± 0.2; 2016:117.6 ± 0.2; and 2017:117.1 ± 0.2 mg/dL) and women (2012:119.5 ± 0.3; 2013:120.7 ± 0.2; 2014:119.8 ± 0.02; 2015:120.8 ± 0.2; 2016:122.7 ± 0.1; and 2017:123.8 ± 0.2 mg/dL). The percentage with LDL-cholesterol ≥ 160 mg/dL also increased significantly (P < 10⁻⁹) in men and women. Similar results were obtained for ages 40 to 75 years olds (corresponding to ACC/AHA guidelines).

Conclusion

These results provide additional evidence that declining blood LDL-cholesterol levels observed following the ATP-III recommendations, did not further decline (actually increased) following the 2013 ACC/AHA recommendations.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

### Implications of recent clinical trials for the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III guidelines [^114Szuyn]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2004). Low credibility.

The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) of the National Cholesterol Education Program issued an evidence-based set of guidelines on cholesterol management in 2001. Since the publication of ATP III, 5 major clinical trials of statin therapy with clinical end points have been published. These trials addressed issues that were not examined in previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The present document reviews the results of these recent trials and assesses their implications for cholesterol management. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain an essential modality in clinical management. The trials confirm the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy in high-risk patients and support the ATP III treatment goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 100 mg/dL. They support the inclusion of patients with diabetes in the high-risk category and confirm the benefits of LDL-lowering therapy in these patients. They further confirm that older persons benefit from therapeutic lowering of LDL-C. The major recommendations for modifications to footnote the ATP III treatment algorithm are the following. In high-risk persons, the recommended LDL-C goal is < 100 mg/dL, but when risk is very high, an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is a therapeutic option, ie, a reasonable clinical strategy, on the basis of available clinical trial evidence. This therapeutic option extends also to patients at very high risk who have a baseline LDL-C < 100 mg/dL. Moreover, when a high-risk patient has high triglycerides or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), consideration can be given to combining a fibrate or nicotinic acid with an LDL-lowering drug. For moderately high-risk persons (2+ risk factors and 10-year risk 10% to 20%), the recommended LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL, but an LDL-C goal < 100 mg/dL is a therapeutic option on the basis of recent trial evidence. The latter option extends also to moderately high-risk persons with a baseline LDL-C of 100 to 129 mg/dL. When LDL-lowering drug therapy is employed in high-risk or moderately high-risk persons, it is advised that intensity of therapy be sufficient to achieve at least a 30% to 40% reduction in LDL-C levels. Moreover, any person at high risk or moderately high risk who has lifestyle-related risk factors (eg, obesity, physical inactivity, elevated triglycerides, low HDL-C, or metabolic syndrome) is a candidate for TLC to modify these risk factors regardless of LDL-C level. Finally, for people in lower-risk categories, recent clinical trials do not modify the goals and cutpoints of therapy.

### The importance of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol measurement and control as performance measures: a joint clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^117XgsVU]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Conclusion — LDL-C performance measurement rationale: Achievement of LDL-C levels < 100 mg/dL in individuals with ASCVD or equivalent risk has been associated with improvements in ASCVD event rates and mortality, making it a Class IA recommendation and an established quality measure in the well-respected HEDIS tool in the past. The transition by the NCQA to a HEDIS process measure focused on statin use in 2015 reflected new data in support of higher-intensity statin treatment but did not incentivize LDL-C monitoring and/or improvement. Many data now support the re-establishment of LDL-C testing in high-risk subsets as a performance measure, including recent data showing minimal improvement in statin use in individuals with ASCVD in recent years, significant heterogeneity in LDL-C response from statin therapy, new evidence-based guidelines that support LDL-C monitoring to assess efficacy/adherence and to assess the need for add-on therapies (e.g., if certain LDL-C thresholds are not met on statin therapy alone), and new clinical trial evidence with nonstatin therapies supporting additional LDL-C lowering in high-risk patients already on maximal statin therapy.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering — benefits and risks: Randomized trials of statins and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors indicate that very low LDL-C levels, including "LDL-C as low as 10 to 20 mg/dL (0.3 to 0.5 mmol/L) in patients taking PCSK9 inhibitors, are not associated with an increase in serious adverse events". Regarding cerebrovascular outcomes, a secondary analysis "showed a small increase in hemorrhagic stroke events (55 vs 33) in participants randomized to atorvastatin 80 mg daily compared with placebo but, importantly, a significant reduction in total stroke and ischemic stroke", and a trial targeting "a goal below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) and a goal of 90 to 110 mg/dL (2.3 to 2.8 mmol/L)" reduced cardiovascular events while intracerebral hemorrhage was "numerically increased (18 vs 13 events), although not statistically significant". In ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, alirocumab "targeting LDL-C levels of 25 to 50 mg/dL, found a significant decrease in ischemic stroke, without an increase in hemorrhagic stroke". Observationally, the Women's Health Study reported "0.8% of women with LDL-C levels of 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) or lower suffered a hemorrhagic stroke, double the rate of women with LDL-C levels between 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) and 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L)". Glycemic effects include that statins "produced a small increase in HbA1c of the magnitude of 0.1%" and "increase the risk of developing diabetes… with an absolute increase of 0.2% per year", especially with "high doses of potent statins" in predisposed individuals, whereas "the PCSK9 antibody evolocumab… showed no statistically significant effect on glycemia in patients with diabetes".

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein (a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^1113TbEL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Management of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is the cornerstone in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. LDL‐C is used as a screening test, diagnostic marker for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), target of therapy for diet, drugs, and apheresis, and goal for adequate care in the outpatient clinic, after hospital discharge and in clinical guidelines. 1, 2 It is generally accepted that the laboratory measure "LDL‐C" is an accurate representation of what is being measured. However, because of methodological limitations, all available clinical methods that measure and report "LDL‐C" are affected by the presence of the cholesterol content of lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]‐C). 3, 4 This includes all methods of calculated or measured "LDL‐C", including the Friedewald formula, ultracentrifugation, or direct LDL‐C methods. 5, 6 The main reason for this is the inability to separate low‐density lipoprotein from lipoprotein(a) particles and quantify cholesterol content separately on these particles.

Lipoprotein(a) is composed of apolipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein B‐100, cholesteryl esters, free cholesterol, phospholipids, and carbohydrates on apolipoprotein(a). 7 On the basis of observations from multiple laboratories with expertise in lipoprotein(a) biochemical analyses, the cholesterol content of lipoprotein(a) constitutes ≈30% to 45% of total lipoprotein(a) mass. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 This implicates that if lipoprotein(a) mass levels are low (eg, < 10 mg/dL), the contribution of Lp(a)‐C to plasma LDL‐C is small (< 5 mg/dL). However, if lipoprotein(a) mass is high (eg, 150 mg/dL), its contribution to "LDL‐C" can be significant (45‐67.5 mg/dL). 3 By inference, true LDL‐C will be significantly lower in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) levels.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia is underdiagnosed and undertreated in the general population: guidance for clinicians to prevent coronary heart disease: consensus statement of the European Atherosclerosis Society [^115Z941o]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common genetic cause of premature coronary heart disease (CHD) (i.e. ischaemic heart disease), namely myocardial infarction and angina pectoris, due to lifelong elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. If left untreated, men and women with heterozygous FH (later referred to simply as FH, unless specified as heterozygous or homozygous FH) with total cholesterol levels of 8–15 mmol/L (310–580 mg/dL) typically develop CHD before age 55 and 60, respectively, while homozygotes with total cholesterol levels of 12–30 mmol/L (460–1160 mg/dL) typically develop CHD very early in life and if untreated die before age 20. However, once diagnosed, heterozygotes can readily be treated with cholesterol-lowering medication to attenuate development of atherosclerosis and to prevent CHD.

The extent of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of individuals in the general population with FH is largely unknown. It is generally believed that among whites, 1/500 are heterozygous for FH and 1/1 000 000 are homozygous; however, even these individuals are not diagnosed in most countries. Furthermore, these prevalences likely represent underestimates and as cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Indeed, many individuals and families with FH may simply be overlooked among the huge number of individuals with any CHD caused by more common risk factors, and as a consequence be underdiagnosed and undertreated for genetically elevated cholesterol levels.

The aim of the present consensus paper is to critically evaluate the extent to which FH is underdiagnosed and undertreated worldwide. Based on a consensus of the opinions of the experts in this panel and/or on small studies, retrospective studies, and registries (level of evidence C), the EAS Consensus Panel proposes recommendations on (i) how better to diagnose individuals and families with FH and (ii) therapeutic strategies for best practice aimed to prevent CHD in these extremely high-risk individuals and families. Importantly, the effect of LDL cholesterol lowering on reduction in CHD and all-cause mortality in individuals without FH is based on multiple randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses(level of evidence A). Details of the levels of evidence specifically derived from FH studies can be found elsewhere. This Consensus Statement is aimed at cardiologists, endocrinologists, internists, paediatricians, general practitioners, clinical biochemists, public health practitioners, health service planners, other health professionals, and healthcare providers worldwide.

NLA Expert Panel — dietary cholesterol effects and practical implications: Dietary cholesterol has modest effects to increase total cholesterol (total-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on average, with hypo- and hyper-responders, and within the context of current intake levels effects appear limited to population subgroups, for whom "restrictions in dietary cholesterol intake are likely warranted". Prediction tools are lacking, as "there is no widely available and inexpensive method for clinical use to predict who is likely to experience a change in atherogenic cholesterol". For most individuals, "restricting saturated fat intake to < 7% of energy" lowers dietary cholesterol intake, and some foods are high in cholesterol but not saturated fat, including "eggs, shrimp and other shellfish, and some organ meats".

Very high risk — population, goals, and therapy — includes patients with clinical evidence of ASCVD and those with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 and ≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage, who have aggressive atherogenic cholesterol goals of non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL; for those at very high risk, pharmacotherapy is recommended when atherogenic cholesterol levels are above goal, and pharmacotherapy with a moderate- or high-intensity statin is considered a therapeutic option even at lower pretreatment levels, with use of a moderate- or high-intensity statin stated as something that should be considered in patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels; end-stage (stage 5) chronic kidney disease is associated with very high risk for ASCVD events, randomized controlled trials of lipid-altering therapies have not consistently shown benefits in this group, and goals for atherogenic cholesterol levels in stage 5 CKD have not been defined and are instead considered a matter of clinical judgment.

ASCVD moderate-risk category — criteria and lipid goals: Patients with 2 major ASCVD risk factors, without conditions placing them into the high- or very high–risk categories, are at moderate risk; consideration should be given to drug therapy in those with values at least 30 mg/dL above goal levels after initiation of lifestyle therapy. For moderate risk, the non–HDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL and the LDL-C goal is < 100 mg/dL.

### 2018 AHA / ACC / AACVPR / AAPA / ABC / ACPM / ADA / AGS / APhA / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline on the management of blood cholesterol: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^114xhPUB]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

AHA/ACC 2018 cholesterol guideline — primary prevention pharmacotherapy for adults 40 to 75 years with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL states that in intermediate-risk adults who would benefit from more aggressive LDL-C lowering and in whom high-intensity statins are advisable but not acceptable or tolerated, it may be reasonable to add a nonstatin drug (ezetimibe or bile acid sequestrant) to a moderate-intensity statin, and that in patients at borderline risk, in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy.

Atherogenic cholesterol and lipoprotein metrics — The NLA Expert Panel concluded that "An elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein (apo) B–containing lipoproteins (non–HDL-C and LDL-C, termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis, the key underlying process contributing to most clinical ASCVD events", and identified HDL, LDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and chylomicrons as "the 5 major classes of lipoproteins". LDL is described as the predominant cholesterol carrier, "comprising ∼75% of cholesterol carried by non-HDL particles, with the remaining ∼25% of non–HDL-C in triglyceride-rich particles". Clinical laboratories "typically report the LDL-C concentration as a calculated value using the Friedewald equation (LDL-C = total cholesterol [total-C] – HDL-C – triglycerides/5 with all values in mg/dL) as long as the triglyceride level is below ∼400 mg/dL", and "This calculated value includes cholesterol carried by true LDL particles, as well as IDL particles"; "LDL-C estimated by the Friedwald equation also includes cholesterol carried by these lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a)] particles". Non–HDL-C is "calculated as total-C – HDL-C" and "represents the sum of cholesterol carried by all potentially atherogenic, apo B–containing lipoprotein particles", and the document states that "non–HDL-C is more strongly related to risk for ASCVD than LDL-C".

Chart 2 — Targets for atherogenic cholesterol in dyslipidemia management state that when intervention beyond public health recommendations for long-term atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk reduction is used, atherogenic cholesterol (non–HDL-C and LDL-C) should be the primary targets for therapies, with desirable levels for primary prevention of < 130 mg/dL for non–HDL-C and < 100 mg/dL for LDL-C; goals for very high risk patients are < 100 mg/dL for non–HDL-C and < 70 mg/dL for LDL-C, and goal levels of non–HDL-C may be attained by targeting either or both LDL-C and VLDL-C.

### Managing residual risk after myocardial infarction among individuals with low cholesterol levels [^111fsuf6]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

About one-half of individuals with an acute myocardial infarction have a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of less than 100 mg/dL at the time of occurrence, but remain at risk for recurrent events. This residual risk is likely mediated by multiple factors, including burden of atherosclerosis, residual dyslipidemia, nonlipid risk factors, and suboptimal implementation of lifestyle therapy and evidence-based pharmacologic therapy. This article reviews management options for this high-risk population.

### What are the priorities for managing cholesterol effectively? [^111sySEP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Many studies have confirmed the risk of coronary artery disease associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The precise role of other lipids, however, is still under investigation. The relation between elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is complex, and the results of clinical trials evaluating interventions to lower triglycerides or increase levels of HDL-C have been equivocal. Based on the data currently available, LDL-C remains the primary target for treatment. Ongoing clinical trials will help to answer the question of how low we should set our goals for lowering cholesterol in patients at risk.

### Optimizing lipid management in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^114ndh7D]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

According to the Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III), patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dL should be discharged on lipid-lowering therapy. When LDL cholesterol levels are between 100 and 129 mg/dL, evaluation of ratios of LDL cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol may provide additional insight into a patient's risk status. Patients who were using statin therapy before admission for an acute coronary syndrome should be continued on lipid-lowering therapy. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2002 guideline update for management of patients with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction recommends statin therapy at discharge as a class I indication, level of evidence A. Furthermore, studies confirm that statin therapy begun early during hospitalization can prevent ischemic events in patients who are treated by an invasive strategy and those who are treated only by a medical strategy. However, studies suggest that patient compliance with a statin regimen after discharge is far from optimal. There are 2 programs available to help ensure that appropriate patients receive and continue taking lipid-lowering therapy. These programs are the Cardiac Hospitalization Atherosclerosis Management Program (CHAMP) and the Guidelines Applied in Practice (GAP).

### LDL cholesterol-how low can we Go? [^112G4SDi]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Combinations of lipid-lowering agents can often bring LDL cholesterol down to around 40 mg/dL (1 mmol/L). Randomized controlled trials indicate that this reduces the risk of atherosclerotic vascular events with minimal adverse effects. This has raised the question of whether there is any concentration of LDL cholesterol below which further lowering is futile and/or a source of new adverse effects. This article examines several lines of evidence that lead to the conclusion that there is no known threshold below which lowering LDL cholesterol is harmful, but reduction of LDL cholesterol below 25 mg/dL may provide little if any further benefit.

### HDL cholesterol studies – more of the same? [^113Z8R66]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Studies published in 2012 in the field of HDL research have provided further evidence suggesting that a low HDL-cholesterol level, in the absence of related lipid or nonlipid risk factors, is not associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease.
