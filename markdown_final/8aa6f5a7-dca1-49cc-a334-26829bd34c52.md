Q10: Under what circumstances might interventions for choking be less effective? Select all that apply

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking under what circumstances choking interventions might be less effective. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the scope of "choking interventions" and make sure I'm discussing foreign body airway obstruction rather than esophageal impaction. Then, I should assess how time-to-intervention and whether the event is witnessed affect effectiveness. Next, I'll compare first-line maneuver choice and the importance of technique quality. After that, I need to consider patient factors such as age, body habitus, and neuromuscular disease, as well as foreign-body location and characteristics. Finally, I should appraise the quality of the evidence and practical implications for bystanders and clinicians [^111u21du].

> Let me first confirm the scope so I don't conflate airway choking with esophageal food impaction, because those pathways and treatments differ meaningfully. Choking interventions for foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO) include back blows, abdominal thrusts, chest thrusts/compressions, and manual removal or suction, whereas esophageal impaction is typically an endoscopic problem; the systematic review of FBAO interventions and emergency medicine reviews of esophageal foreign bodies make this distinction clear, and I need to ensure I keep my reasoning anchored to airway obstruction relief rather than esophageal management [^111u21du] [^111xq2se].

> Next, I should review how timing and witnesses influence success, because those often drive outcome more than the specific technique. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of effect: early bystander removal is associated with far better neurological survival, and in elderly cohorts favorable outcomes drop markedly when removal is delayed from bystander at scene to EMS to hospital, highlighting that any delay diminishes effectiveness of the intervention in practical terms [^111u21du] [^115THPWj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which maneuver is "best" without data. I need to check comparative effectiveness when used as the first intervention: a contemporary analysis summarized in a Resuscitation commentary reported decreased odds of FBAO relief with abdominal thrusts and chest compressions compared with back blows when used first, but I should emphasize the evidence base remains observational with very low certainty overall in the broader systematic review, so local protocols and rescuer training still matter for real-world effectiveness [^114M3oGL] [^111u21du].

> I will now examine technique quality and generated airway pressures, because suboptimal execution likely reduces effectiveness even when the "right" maneuver is chosen. Let me think about the physiology: human volunteer studies show the angle of abdominal thrusts (upward versus circumferential) does not change intrathoracic pressure meaningfully, self-administered thrusts can match rescuer-delivered thrusts, and chair thrusts can generate substantially higher pressures; thus, if the rescuer applies insufficient force, poor hand placement, or an awkward posture, the resultant lower pressures may translate to reduced efficacy in expelling the obstructing bolus [^111J9bKH] [^116j8JYK] [^112kDNG5] [^1133y83v].

> But wait, what if technique is not just suboptimal but harmful; could that make interventions effectively less beneficial or even counterproductive? I should double-check for documented harms: reports note injuries with back blows, abdominal thrusts, and chest thrusts, and blind finger sweeps can worsen obstruction, while rare catastrophic complications have occurred with incorrectly applied abdominal thrusts including aortic thrombosis; fear of causing injury may also inhibit adequate force application, reducing effectiveness, which is why guidance favoring circumferential thrusts in some settings aims to balance risk and performance [^111u21du] [^1165UdS1] [^114ZtvDG].

> I need to ensure I consider rescuer factors like training and panic, because inadequate knowledge or hesitation can blunt the impact of any maneuver. Let me verify: population studies show many caregivers lack first-aid knowledge for suffocation and choking, and that education improves outcomes after unintentional injuries, implying that low training and high anxiety at the scene are circumstances under which interventions are less effective due to delayed recognition, improper sequencing, or weak execution [^114HTaDo].

> Let me consider patient age, because extremes of age can change both the recommended approach and its likelihood of success. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a 25% failure rate reported in infants applied to airway clearance, but I need to check the source carefully: that figure comes from Foley balloon extraction for pediatric esophageal foreign bodies, not airway obstruction, so it should not be directly generalized to choking maneuvers; that said, infants have small, easily occluded airways and require age-appropriate techniques, while older, edentulous adults are at higher risk for impaction and the aging population yields more FBAO events, all of which may complicate or reduce the effectiveness of standard bystander interventions if not adapted properly [^112u8Lpz] [^111xq2se] [^115THPWj].

> I should confirm whether body habitus changes force transmission and success rates. While data are stronger for airway management complications than for choking per se, obesity is associated with more airway complications, and it plausibly reduces the efficacy of abdominal thrusts due to increased soft tissue and altered mechanics; in such patients, rescuers may need to adjust hand position or consider alternative techniques such as chest thrusts or chair thrusts to maintain effectiveness, though I must acknowledge this is extrapolated from adjacent airway literature rather than direct comparative trials in choking [^115NzJgb].

> Next, I should review neuromuscular and bulbar dysfunction, because impaired cough and oropharyngeal control can both predispose to aspiration and blunt the effectiveness of expulsive maneuvers. Historical and contemporary neurology observations underscore that bulbar weakness in disorders like myasthenia gravis compromises airway protection and expiratory force, suggesting that first-aid expulsive maneuvers may be less effective and that early definitive airway management should be considered sooner in these circumstances [^111cmYq5].

> Hold on, I should verify how the location of the foreign body affects the utility of first-aid maneuvers. Once the object passes below the vocal cords into the lower airways, bystander techniques are far less likely to expel it and bronchoscopy becomes the definitive strategy; prolonged unrecognized distal aspiration cases in adults and the pediatric anesthesia literature on retrieval reinforce that late or distal airway foreign bodies are unlikely to be relieved by external thrusts, reducing the effectiveness of choking interventions in these scenarios [^111JP9AF] [^114qJmPt].

> I need to check patient position and scene constraints, because a collapsed, supine, or wheelchair-bound patient may not allow optimal maneuver delivery. Physiologic data suggest chest compressions in a supine CPR position generate lower esophageal pressures than properly executed abdominal thrusts, implying that in the wrong position the expulsive effect may be weaker; conversely, self-administered and chair thrusts can be effective options when no rescuer is available or when height mismatch impairs technique, so inability to position the patient or rescuer optimally can make standard interventions less effective [^116j8JYK] [^116aGbTr].

> Let me reconsider devices and procedural options, because sometimes suction-based devices or manual removal are attempted. I should confirm the evidence: the systematic review identified very low-certainty evidence for all FBAO interventions, including suction devices and manual techniques, with reported harms as well; this means that in circumstances of deep impaction, limited mouth opening, or poor visualization, device-based or manual attempts may be less effective and potentially risky, reinforcing that early, appropriate escalation to trained responders and advanced airway techniques is crucial when simple maneuvers fail [^111u21du].

> Finally, I should synthesize and ensure I am not overstepping the data. Across studies, circumstances that make choking interventions less effective include delays and unwitnessed events, suboptimal choice or sequence of maneuvers, poor technique with inadequate force or positioning, rescuer inexperience or fear of injury, extremes of age and challenging body habitus, neuromuscular or bulbar dysfunction, and distal migration of the foreign body into the lower airways, all in the context of a generally low-certainty evidence base that requires pragmatic, guideline-informed judgment at the scene [^115THPWj] [^114M3oGL] [^111J9bKH] [^111u21du].

Interventions for choking may be less effective in these scenarios: **delayed intervention** (longer obstruction reduces success) [^111u21du] [^115THPWj], **large or irregular objects** (harder to dislodge) [^111u21du] [^111WCJL5], **underlying airway or esophageal disease** (strictures, tumors, or dysphagia impede clearance) [^111xq2se] [^111WCJL5], **impaired consciousness or neuromuscular weakness** (reduced cough and airway protection) [^111cmYq5] [^115myBRa], **incorrect technique** (improper thrusts or blind finger sweeps) [^111u21du] [^1165UdS1], and **very young or elderly patients** (anatomy and frailty limit effectiveness) [^111u21du] [^113Ta79w] [^111J9bKH]. These factors increase the risk of persistent obstruction and complications; therefore, prompt, correct action and early escalation are critical.

---

## Delay in intervention

Delayed intervention **reduces effectiveness** given the **time-sensitive** nature of choking [^111u21du]; early bystander removal improves neurological outcomes and survival [^115THPWj], and **prolonged obstruction** increases hypoxia and complications, making relief more difficult [^111u21du] [^112v44LY].

---

## Size, shape, and consistency of the obstructing object

For object characteristics, **large, irregular, or sticky objects** (e.g. meat, dentures) are harder to dislodge with standard maneuvers [^111u21du] [^111WCJL5], and **sharp or pointed objects** can lodge firmly or cause injury, reducing maneuver success [^111u21du].

---

## Patient-specific factors

### Age

Age-related factors: **infants and young children** have smaller airways and limited cooperation, reducing the effectiveness of standard maneuvers [^111u21du] [^113Ta79w], whereas **elderly patients** have frailty, comorbidities, and reduced airway protection that limit effectiveness [^111u21du] [^111J9bKH] [^115THPWj].

---

### Underlying medical conditions

- **Neurological disorders**: Conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's, or neuromuscular disease impair cough and airway protection, reducing effectiveness [^111cmYq5] [^115myBRa].

- **Respiratory conditions**: COPD or asthma can worsen hypoxia and reduce maneuver success.

- **Esophageal or airway abnormalities**: Strictures, tumors, or dysphagia impede clearance and increase complication risk [^112v44LY] [^111WCJL5].

---

## Incorrect application of techniques

Incorrect application — such as improperly performed abdominal thrusts, back blows, or chest compressions — **reduces effectiveness and increases injury risk** [^111u21du] [^1165UdS1]; **blind finger sweeps** can also push objects deeper, worsening obstruction [^111u21du].

---

## Environmental and situational factors

Environmental and situational constraints — such as **limited space or accessibility** in crowded or confined areas — hinder proper technique application [^111u21du]; a **lack of trained personnel** can result in untrained responders applying ineffective or harmful techniques [^111u21du] [^115NzJgb] [^114HTaDo].

Interventions for choking are less effective in the presence of delays; large or irregular objects; patient-specific factors (age, neurological or respiratory conditions, esophageal or airway abnormalities); incorrect technique; or environmental constraints. Prompt action and early escalation are **essential to improve outcomes** [^111u21du] [^111WCJL5].

### Esophageal foreign bodies and obstruction in the emergency department setting: An evidence-based review [^111xq2se]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with esophageal foreign bodies or food bolus impaction may present to the emergency department with symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe distress. There is a dearth of emergency medicine-focused literature concerning these conditions.

- **Objective of the review**: This narrative review provides evidence-based recommendations for the assessment and management of patients with esophageal foreign bodies and food bolus impactions.

- **Discussion**: Esophageal foreign bodies and food bolus impaction are common but typically pass spontaneously. However, complete obstruction can lead to the inability to tolerate secretions, airway compromise, and death. Pediatric patients are the most common population affected, while in adults, edentulous patients are at greatest risk. Foreign body obstruction and food bolus impaction typically occur at sites of narrowing due to underlying esophageal pathology. Diagnosis is based on history and examination, with most patients presenting with choking/gagging, vomiting, and dysphagia/odynophagia. The preferred test is a plain chest radiograph, although this is not required if the clinician suspects a non-bony food bolus with no suspicion of perforation. Computed tomography is recommended if a radiograph is limited or there are concerns for perforation. Management requires the initial assessment of the patient's airway. Medications evaluated include effervescent agents, glucagon, calcium channel blockers, benzodiazepines, nitrates, and others, but their efficacy is poor. Before administration, shared decision making with the patient is recommended.

### Removal of foreign body airway obstruction: A systematic review of interventions [^111u21du]. Resuscitation (2020). Low credibility.

To summarize in a systematic review the effectiveness of interventions to treat foreign body airway obstructions (FBAO), we conducted a thorough search. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception through 30th September 2019 for studies describing the effectiveness of interventions to treat FBAO in adults and children. The inclusion criteria encompassed randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and case series (≥ 5 cases) that provided evidence of benefit. For assessing harm and complications, we included case reports.

Two reviewers independently evaluated study eligibility, extracted study data, and assessed the risk of bias. Data are summarized in a narrative synthesis, and the GRADE system is used to assess evidence certainty.

Our inclusion criteria led to the analysis of 69 publications, encompassing three cross-sectional studies (557 patients), eight case series (755 patients), and 59 case reports (64 patients). Notably, one paper served both as a case series and a cross-sectional study. All interventions and associated outcomes showed very low evidence certainty. Early removal of FBAO by bystanders was associated with improved neurological survival (odds ratio 6.0, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 23.4).

The evidence identified several key interventions as effective in relieving FBAO, including back blows, abdominal thrusts, chest thrusts/compressions, Magill forceps, manual removal of obstructions from the mouth, and suction-based airway clearance devices. However, we also identified reports of harm related to back blows, abdominal thrusts, chest thrusts/compressions, and blind finger sweeps.

### Clinical observations in acute neurology: A historical explanation of the present [^111cmYq5]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Over several decades, US centers have provided care for respiratory distress, recognizing that oropharyngeal failure signals insufficiency of respiratory muscles. Already in 1945, a reported 60 cases from Massachusetts General Hospital highlighted respiratory failure and specifically oropharyngeal failure. Later, Rowland et al. reported 39 fatal cases between 1930 and 1955, urging physicians to watch for warning signs, use sedatives cautiously, initiate early mechanical ventilation, and control for infection.

Campbell and Bramwell in Brain alerted UK and US physicians to myasthenia gravis and its potential for critical worsening. They offered detailed descriptions of 60 patients, 23 with fatal outcomes. Frequent involvement of bulbar muscles in their cases and ptosis, with accompanying weakness of the neck muscles, impaired the compensatory mechanism of "throwing back the head". The paper emphasized choking, nasal fluid regurgitation, diminished palatal reflex, and lowered voice tone, suggesting weakness of the vocal cord adductors, along with an inability to thrust out the cheek and maintain protrusion of the tongue. Measured circumferentially, the difference in chest movements between inspiration and expiration did not exceed a quarter inch. Dyspnea with exertion was common, and there were "unaccountable attacks of breathlessness, during which the patient is in danger". Accumulated mouth sputum accompanied dyspneic attacks, leaving patients unable to swallow or spit: "The tongue appears to sink back into the mouth". Retracting the tongue markedly improved symptoms.

### Prehospital removal improves neurological outcomes in elderly patient with foreign body airway obstruction [^115THPWj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In Japan, the number of patients with foreign body airway obstruction by food is rapidly increasing with the aging population, and it is becoming a leading cause of unexpected death. This study aimed to determine the factors that influence the prognosis of these patients.

This is a retrospective single institutional study involving a total of 155 patients. We collected variables from the medical records and analyzed them to determine factors associated with patient outcomes. Patient outcomes were evaluated using cerebral performance categories (CPCs) when patients were discharged or transferred to other hospitals. A favorable outcome was defined as CPC 1 or 2, and an unfavorable outcome was defined as CPC 3, 4, or 5.

A higher proportion of patients with favorable outcomes, compared to unfavorable outcomes, had a witness present at the accident scene (68.8% vs. 44.7%, P = 0.0154). Patients whose foreign bodies were removed by a bystander at the accident scene had a significantly higher rate of favorable outcome than those whose foreign bodies were removed by emergency medical technicians or emergency physicians at the scene (73.7% vs. 31.8%, P < 0.0075) and at the hospital after transfer (73.7% vs. 9.6%, P < 0.0001).

The presence of a witness to the aspiration and the removal of airway obstructions by bystanders at the accident scene improves outcomes in patients with foreign body airway obstruction. When airway obstruction occurs, bystanders should remove foreign bodies immediately.

### Choking on a foreign body: A physiological study of the effectiveness of abdominal thrust manoeuvres to increase thoracic pressure [^111J9bKH]. Thorax (2017). High credibility.

Foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO) is a common cause of death, particularly in older people. The National Safety Council USA reports that FBAO is the fourth leading cause of unintentional injury death, with 4,864 reported deaths in 2013. The 'Heimlich' manoeuvre is a technique for expelling an obstructing food bolus where a first-aider places their arms around the subject from behind and delivers a sharp inward and upward thrust to the abdomen below the rib cage. Heimlich described 162 cases where life was saved following successful administration of abdominal thrusts.

The European Resuscitation Council guidance for the treatment of FBAO in conscious adults recommends a combination of back blows and abdominal thrusts, with no preference on order. The Australian and New Zealand Resuscitation Councils recommend back blows and chest thrusts for the management of FBAO in conscious adults but advise against abdominal thrusts, citing concern about complications.

External pressure on the abdomen should be transmitted through the diaphragm regardless of where it is applied, so there is no theoretical reason why force needs to be directed upwards. Motivated in part by three cases of near death from choking involving UK chest physicians, we describe experiments to address these two questions.

### Choking on a foreign body: A physiological study of the effectiveness of abdominal thrust manoeuvres to increase thoracic pressure [^114ZtvDG]. Thorax (2017). Low credibility.

An upward thrust may be more likely to cause injury to the ribcage or other organs, and the person performing it may be inhibited by this possibility. Given the similar pressures generated by circumferential abdominal thrusts, we recommend that the manoeuvre should be performed by inward thrust over the fleshy part of the abdomen, around the level of the navel. This is important information for first aid providers with mismatched height to victim; a smaller individual can perform the circumferential abdominal thrust and produce the same intrathoracic pressure as the Heimlich manoeuvre that requires upthrust.

Australian and New Zealand ALS guidance does not recommend abdominal thrusts. Studies on pigs, cadavers, or anaesthetised subjects are unlikely to be representative of the situation and lung volumes in an upright, conscious choking individual. In our study, manoeuvres were all performed with the subjects at functional residual capacity, which may be more representative of the situation in an emergency. Given our data, we suggest that these guidelines should be amended. Concern about possible risk needs to be balanced against the almost certain risk of death if obstruction persists and the further reduction in risk if a circumferential approach is used.

Self-administered abdominal thrusts were as effective as operator-delivered thrusts, and indeed they had been used successfully in two of our cases. Repeated manoeuvres can be performed quickly and effectively without relying on an external operator. People choking may be encouraged to try this before a rescuer intervenes.

### Target for today: Air hunger [^111tXnT4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

For patients at risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) who are restricted to lower volumes, several palliative interventions can reduce air hunger. Low-dose opiates are effective. Modifications to inspiratory flow may be helpful. Cognitive interventions, such as empathetic reassurance, pleasant music, and hypnosis, may be effective. Sensory "tricks", such as blowing air across the face, introducing flow in the nasal passages bypassed by intubation, and stimulating pulmonary stretch receptors (PSRs) with aerosolized furosemide, may also be useful.

Criteria for instituting mechanical ventilation vary among physicians, hospitals, and countries. There are no generally recognized guidelines informing clinicians when to ventilate. Often, the need to ventilate to support gas exchange is obvious, indicated objectively by hypoxemia that cannot be otherwise alleviated, or by acute hypercapnia. If, however, ventilation is instituted to alleviate respiratory distress, primarily air hunger, the palliative strategies listed above may be sufficient and may avoid invasive ventilation. For example, a low-dose opiate can reduce distress and can (surprisingly) improve gas exchange in a patient who is tachypneic due to dyspnea.

It is possible to incorporate dyspnea palliation into routine care, an approach that we have long advocated and that has recently been promulgated by European guidelines. One of us, R. Brown, was for many years director of a large step-down unit caring for post-ICU patients who still required mechanical ventilation. During daily rounds, it was the practice to ask each patient about shortness of breath.

### Food passageway-related sequelae in the RefluxStop prospective multicenter trial: patient-centric outcomes of dysphagia, odynophagia, gas-bloating, and inability to belch and/or vomit at 5 years [^111n6XPG]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Low credibility.

As mentioned, MSA surgery attempts to balance two opposing effects seemingly a result of its sphincter augmentation mechanism: smaller diameter sizing is associated with dysphagia risk, esophageal constriction, and erosion; and larger diameter sizing is associated with poorer treatment effect. Avoidance of these surgical effects may be a sound methodology for improving the patient experience and quality of life.

Dysphagia after the RefluxStop procedure is generally only caused by hiatal repair being performed too tightly. The approach by which RefluxStop is implanted, hanging freely in an invaginated pouch with limited (90–120°) plication, minimizes esophageal interaction (without encirclement or compression) and, in parallel, improves LES function via correct anatomical placement rather than augmentation, sustaining dynamic function of the esophagogastric junction (including the flap valve). This is a logical explanation for the absence of esophageal dilatation or device removal appreciated in this 5-year study. The very low rate of postoperative AE dysphagia after RefluxStop throughout the entire study (with no dysphagia at 5-year follow-up) compares favorably to 5-year rates of the surgical standard of care, Nissen fundoplication (28.9%), albeit by indirect comparison. Avoidance of esophageal manipulation seems critical to improving the overall treatment effect in anti-reflux surgery even in strict settings. However, the real world encompasses difficult cases that are complicated by dysphagia-predisposing comorbidities and such patients from real-world practice are furt

### Complications and failure of airway management [^115NzJgb]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Airway management complications causing temporary patient harm are common, but serious injury is rare. Because most airways are easy, most complications occur in easy airways; these complications can and do lead to harm and death. Since these events are rare, most of our learning comes from large litigation and critical incident databases that help identify patterns and areas where care can be improved, but both have limitations. The recent 4th National Audit Project of the Royal College of Anaesthetists and Difficult Airway Society provides important detailed information and our best estimates of the incidence of major airway complications.

A significant proportion of airway complications occur in Intensive Care Units and Emergency Departments, and these more frequently cause patient harm or death and are associated with suboptimal care. Hypoxia is the most common cause of airway-related deaths. Obesity markedly increases the risk of airway complications. Pulmonary aspiration remains the leading cause of airway-related anaesthetic deaths, with most cases having identifiable risk factors. Unrecognized oesophageal intubation is not only of historical interest and is entirely avoidable. All airway management techniques fail, and prediction scores are rather poor, so many failures are unanticipated.

Avoidance of airway complications requires institutional and individual preparedness, careful assessment, good planning and judgment, effective communication and teamwork, knowledge and use of a range of techniques and devices, and a willingness to stop performing techniques when they are failing.

### Choking on a foreign body: A physiological study of the effectiveness of abdominal thrust manoeuvres to increase thoracic pressure [^112kDNG5]. Thorax (2017). Low credibility.

The Heimlich manoeuvre is a well-known intervention for the management of choking due to foreign body airway occlusion, but the evidence base for guidance on this topic is limited and guidelines differ. We measured pressures during abdominal thrusts in healthy volunteers. The angle at which thrusts were performed (upthrust vs. circumferential) did not affect intrathoracic pressure. Self-administered abdominal thrusts produced similar pressures to those performed by another person. Chair thrusts, where the subject pushed their upper abdomen against a chair back, produced higher pressures than other manoeuvres. Both approaches should be included in basic life support teaching.

### Maneuver for the recovery of a foreign body causing a complete airway obstruction: Illustrative case [^11479kUu]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

This case discusses a 12-month-old child suffering from a complete airway obstruction due to an upper respiratory tract foreign body. In the absence of intubation or cricothyroidotomy equipment, traditional removal methods were unsuccessful. The child was kept in a prone position. Through continuous mouth-to-mouth and/or nose aspiration, combined with spitting out the secretions, the complete blockage was reduced to a partial one. After several minutes of this maneuver to maintain an open airway, a soft, light plastic object was recovered. Foreign body removal is a life-threatening emergency that can occur in situations where no trained medical personnel or equipment are available. This method offers a potential solution for practitioners or parents in extreme circumstances when conventional techniques have failed.

### Development of a core outcome set for clinical effectiveness trials in esophageal cancer resection surgery [^111mSsEK]. Annals of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical effectiveness trials are designed to evaluate the performance of an intervention under pragmatic or real-world conditions, rather than the ideal and controlled circumstances often observed in efficacy trials. The results of clinical effectiveness trials may therefore be more readily applied to everyday practice and are likely to influence clinical decision-making and health policy. Integral to the design and applicability of effectiveness trials is the selection, measurement, and reporting of outcomes, which are required to evaluate clinical benefit from the viewpoint of the patient and health provider in addition to assessing risks and harms — often the focus of the surgeon. Systematic reviews have shown, however, that there are often inconsistencies in the way in which outcomes are defined, selected, measured, and reported in trials of esophageal cancer surgery, making the robust evaluation of esophageal cancer surgery difficult.

Outcomes that may be relevant to effectiveness trials of esophageal cancer surgery include long-term morbidity, disease recurrence, symptom alleviation, and quality of life. However, the heterogeneity of outcomes measured and reported across such trials hampers comparison of centers and trial results, thereby compromising evidence synthesis. It also means that outcome reporting bias — the selective reporting of some outcomes but not others — may occur. Core outcome sets (COSs), which define a minimum set of key outcomes to be measured and reported in all trials of specific conditions, provide an evidence-based approach to standardize outcome reporting.

### Hysingla ER [^114oZhDk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In clinical studies with specific instructions to take Hysingla ER with adequate water to swallow the tablet, 11 out of 2476 subjects reported difficulty swallowing Hysingla ER. These reports included esophageal obstruction, dysphagia, and choking, one of which required medical intervention to remove the tablet [see Adverse reactions (6)].

Instruct patients not to pre-soak, lick, or otherwise wet Hysingla ER tablets prior to placing them in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth.

Patients with underlying gastrointestinal disorders, such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen, are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider the use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and those at risk for underlying gastrointestinal disorders that result in a small gastrointestinal lumen.

Pediatric patients may be at increased risk of esophageal obstruction, dysphagia, and choking because of a smaller gastrointestinal lumen if they ingest Hysingla ER [see Use in specific populations (8.4)].

- **Risks of use in patients with gastrointestinal conditions**: Hysingla ER is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The hydrocodone in Hysingla ER may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease.

### Esophageal emergencies: WSES guidelines [^111WCJL5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Methods

For the purpose of the paper, we used an etiological classification of esophageal injuries: (1) foreign body ingestion, (2) caustic ingestion, (3) esophageal perforations (iatrogenic and spontaneous), and (4) esophageal trauma. Leading specialists in the field were asked to perform a thorough MEDLINE and EMBASE search for relevant papers on each of these topics between 1985 and June 2018. They were tasked with focusing their search to provide evidence-based answers to pertinent questions with immediate practical application. Topics were presented and opened for discussion at the 5th WSES Congress in Bertinoro, Italy, from 28th to 30th June 2018. The level of evidence for each recommendation statement was assigned using the grading system proposed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Eventually, evidence-based guidelines for the management of esophageal injuries (EI) were developed to outline clinical recommendations.

- **Foreign body ingestion**: In the United States, esophageal foreign body (FB) ingestion accounts for more than 100,000 cases per year. In children, accidental ingestion of coins, batteries, toys, and magnets is common. Accidental ingestions also occur in adults, often in association with intoxication or in the elderly with cognitive impairment; intentional ingestion by patients with psychiatric disorders or by prisoners is not infrequent. Esophageal FB impaction depends on the size and shape of the FB. Impaction usually occurs at the level of the hypopharynx or in the upper thoracic esophagus for anatomical (cricopharyngeus, aortic arch) and physiological reasons (low pressure).

### Development of the small parts cylinder: Lessons learned [^116XGGnJ]. The Laryngoscope (2008). Low credibility.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission mandates federal child choking prevention standards in the United States. The Commission uses the small parts cylinder (SPC), which is a 31.75-mm inside-diameter cylinder with a slanted bottom and depth ranging from 25.4 to 57.1 mm. The SPC was developed with very limited clinical data, and its effectiveness remains controversial. Small parts ingestions are among the most common causes of injury and fatality to preschool children. This study reviews the history, medical basis, and effectiveness of the SPC and provides recommendations for the prevention of choking and airway fatalities.

- **Study design**: Retrospective case series from 48 tertiary care pediatric hospitals (1989–2004) and historical review (1972–2007).

- **Methods**: Reviewed documents from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as published reports. Medical records from 48 children's hospitals were examined using ICD-9 and Procedural Terminology codes for data on injury or fatality from foreign bodies (FBs) involved in airway obstruction or esophageal injury. All FB dimensions were measured and statistically analyzed.

- **Results**: Twenty-three percent of fatalities resulting from small parts over the study period involved objects that passed SPC evaluation, and over 90% of FBs between 27.9 and 30.5 mm involved in nonfatal incidents also passed SPC evaluation. Many objects involved in fatal and nonfatal injury pass because of the slanted bottom.

- **Conclusions**: Over one-fifth of injuries and fatalities to children could be prevented by reevaluating the design and standards of the SPC.

### Use of a video laryngoscope to facilitate removal of a long, sharp-pointed blade from the esophagus [^117GKCb1]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

The initial management of ingested esophageal foreign bodies involves airway assessment, determination of the requirement for and timing of therapeutic intervention, risk mitigation during removal, and identification of all indicated equipment for retrieval. Long, sharp-pointed objects lodged in the esophagus require emergent attention and should be retrieved endoscopically if perforation has not occurred. Inducing general anesthesia and rapidly securing the airway can minimize the risk of aspiration, mitigate any effects of tracheal compression, avoid exacerbating existing trauma, and provide optimal conditions for the removal of long, sharp-pointed esophageal foreign bodies.

Video laryngoscopy provides improved recognition of anatomical structures in both normal and difficult airways, enabling assessment for hypopharyngeal and glottic trauma resulting from foreign body ingestion. The indirect view of video laryngoscopy facilitates the coordinated manipulation of the airway by both the anesthesiologist and the surgeon, allowing them to visualize the anatomy together while securing the airway and removing the foreign body.

### Guideline for the management of ingested foreign bodies [^113y3ADM]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

This text is one of a series of statements discussing the utilization of gastrointestinal endoscopy in common clinical situations. The Standards of Practice Committee of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy prepared this guideline. In its preparation, a MEDLINE literature search was performed, and additional references were obtained from bibliographies of identified articles and recommendations from expert consultants. When little or no data exist from well-designed prospective trials, emphasis is given to results from large series and reports from recognized experts. Guidelines for appropriate utilization of endoscopy are based on a critical review of the available data and expert consensus. Further controlled clinical studies are needed to clarify aspects of this statement, and revision may be necessary as new data appear. Clinical consideration may justify a course of action at variance with these recommendations.

### Long-awaited evidence on back blows versus abdominal thrusts [^114M3oGL]. Resuscitation (2024). Low credibility.

This is a commentary on the study conducted by Dunne et al. from Alberta, Canada, which retrospectively analyzed data from patients with foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO) in the region. By linking the region's prehospital data with hospital data, the authors were able to report not only the FBAO relief of each intervention but also patient survival outcomes and complications associated with the interventions. By analyzing the 709 patient encounters that received BLS interventions from bystanders, paramedics, or both, and adjusting for potential confounders, the study showed that abdominal thrusts and chest compressions were associated with decreased odds of FBAO relief compared to back blows as the first intervention. The commentary summarizes the study findings and discusses the importance of the study in the context of FBAO research, which has been choked for too many years.

### Esophageal foreign bodies in the pediatric population: our first 500 cases [^112u8Lpz]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Children with esophageal foreign bodies are frequently seen by pediatric surgeons. Choking and dysphagia are common presentations; however, esophageal perforation has been reported. Historically, rigid esophagoscopy with extraction of the foreign body has been the recommended treatment. Alternatively, Foley balloon extraction is a safe and effective approach.

- **Methods**: Over a 16-year period, 555 children presented with an esophageal foreign body. Retrospective analysis of the medical record was undertaken, and statistics were analyzed using univariate analysis.

- **Results**: A total of 298 boys and 257 girls presented with a mean age of 3.24 years. Dysphagia (37%) and drooling (31%) were the most common symptoms. Foreign bodies were lodged in the superior esophagus in 73% of cases, and 88% of the objects were coins. Balloon extraction with fluoroscopy was performed in 468 children. Eighty percent of the objects were successfully removed with a mean fluoroscopy time of 2.2 minutes, while 8% were advanced into the stomach. The overall success rate was 88%, with failures necessitating rigid esophagoscopy under general anesthesia. Children younger than 1 year were the most likely to fail, with a 25% failure rate. Airway aspiration never occurred. Significant savings in patient charges were observed with this approach.

- **Conclusions**: Balloon extraction of pediatric esophageal foreign bodies is a safe and cost-effective procedure. This technique is applicable for infants, children, and adolescents. Experienced practitioners should be able to achieve a success rate greater than 80%.

### Clinical variables responsible for early and late diagnosis of foreign body aspiration in pediatrics age group [^113Ta79w]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Foreign body aspiration is an egregious medical emergency. Both adults and children have a tendency to inhale foreign bodies. The object enters the trachea and usually moves further down, lodging in one of the bronchi. Children have a tendency to swallow whatever comes into their hands, including a wide variety of objects such as coins, parts of toys, seeds, nuts, etc. When they cry, laugh, or jump with a mouth full, the foreign body can enter the airway during deep inspiration. In adults, the main cause of aspiration is attempting to swallow food while under intoxication. Common foreign bodies include unchewed food and fish bones. Foreign body aspiration is a primary cause of accidental death in children aged 12 months to 3 years. Literature suggests a sex discrepancy of 60%, with the majority of patients being male. A foreign body in the airway can lead to choking and ultimately death due to asphyxia if the diagnosis is delayed. In 2016, the National Safety Council of America reported a rate of fatal choking in children under 5 years of age of 0.43 per 100,000 in the American general population.

We aimed to analyze retrospectively and determine clinical predictors such as the history of presentation, physical, and radiological findings, which help in early diagnosis. We also intended to study the parameters leading to delayed diagnosis and to develop an algorithm for management based on our experience.

### Oxycontin [^11751vPY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Difficulty in swallowing and risk for obstruction in patients at risk for a small gastrointestinal lumen**: There have been post-marketing reports of difficulty in swallowing Oxycontin tablets. These reports included instances of choking, gagging, regurgitation, and tablets becoming lodged in the throat. It is important to instruct patients not to pre-soak, lick, or otherwise wet Oxycontin tablets before placing them in the mouth. Patients should take one tablet at a time with sufficient water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placement in the mouth.

	- There have been rare post-marketing reports of intestinal obstruction and exacerbation of diverticulitis, some requiring medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying gastrointestinal disorders, such as esophageal or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen, are at greater risk of these complications. Consider using an alternative analgesic for patients who have difficulty swallowing and those at risk of underlying gastrointestinal disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen.

- **Risks of use in patients with gastrointestinal conditions**: Oxycontin is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The oxycodone in Oxycontin may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may increase serum amylase levels. Regular evaluation of patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, is necessary to monitor for worsening symptoms.

- **Increased risk of seizures in patients with seizure disorders**: The oxycodone in Oxycontin may increase the frequency of seizures.

### Esophageal obstruction and death in a nonverbal patient [^112v44LY]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

There are more than 100,000 cases of esophageal foreign bodies in the United States each year. Most cases resolve spontaneously; however, complete esophageal obstruction is a medical emergency. Patients with developmental disabilities are at high risk because a large percentage of this population is affected by dysphagia, pica, tooth loss, or impulsive swallowing. In some cases, the diagnosis of an esophageal foreign body can be made clinically, with the typical presentation including coughing, inability to tolerate secretions, drooling, vomiting, and dysphagia. In other instances, imaging is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

- **Case report**: A nonverbal adult patient with a history of mental retardation and dysphagia presented to the emergency department (ED) following a choking episode with persistent coughing. An x-ray study of the chest showed mild opacity at the left lung base, and she was discharged with antibiotics. She returned to the ED that day with worsening symptoms suggestive of aspiration pneumonia. A computed tomography scan of the chest revealed numerous cylindrical objects in the esophagus, later identified as crayons. At least 28 crayons were removed via three endoscopies. During this time, the patient developed aspiration pneumonia, respiratory distress, and septic shock.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this**: Delayed recognition of a foreign body puts patients at risk for esophageal perforation, aspiration, airway compromise, infection, sepsis, and death. In nonverbal patients presenting with upper respiratory symptoms, it is especially important to recognize these risks for timely intervention.

### Maxillofacial and neck trauma: A damage control approach [^115cxEyP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Initial casualty assessment determines whether the airway is patent and protected, and if breathing is present and adequate. Normal speech may suggest that the airway is patent, at least for the time being. Wheezy breathing usually indicates partial airway obstruction by the tongue, and hoarseness or stridor usually suggests a laryngeal cause for airway obstruction. The oral cavity must be thoroughly cleared, visualized, and inspected under proper lighting, taking care not to extend or rotate the neck. Blood, loose and fractured teeth, foreign bodies, dirt, and mucus are meticulously removed. The midface and mandible are inspected for structural integrity, and the anterior neck is inspected for penetrating wounds. Crepitus upon palpation of the neck may suggest airway injury or communicating pneumomediastinum. Diminished breath sounds on auscultation may result from atelectasis, pneumothorax, hemothorax, or pleural effusion. Wheezing and dyspnea may imply lower airway obstruction, agitation may represent hypoxia at the tissue level, and cyanosis indicates arterial blood hypoxemia. Suprasternal, supraclavicular, or intercostal retractions may be indicative of respiratory muscle fatigue. In the severely ill or unconscious trauma patient, protective airway mechanisms may be impaired or lost, predisposing the patient to aspiration of foreign bodies, loose teeth, bone fragments, secretions, blood, and gastric contents. Clearing the airway is the first step in airway management. The chin-lift with head-tilt maneuver opens the airway but should be avoided in any patient with a potentially…

### Choking on a foreign body: A physiological study of the effectiveness of abdominal thrust manoeuvres to increase thoracic pressure [^116j8JYK]. Thorax (2017). Low credibility.

The study examined maximum peak oesophageal (P oes) and gastric (P gas) pressures for various abdominal thrusts, conducted by experimenters and subjects. For the upthrust Heimlich manoeuvre, P oes was 57 ± 17 cm H₂O, while the circumferential abdominal thrust registered 53 ± 11 cm H₂O (p = 0.7). However, the chair thrust produced a notably higher P oes, measuring 115 ± 27 cm H₂O (p = 0.008 compared with Heimlich).

The outcomes are detailed in Figure 2, illustrating oesophageal and gastric pressure responses to expulsive manoeuvres. Statistical analysis used the Mann-Whitney test, with significant findings marked with an asterisk for p-values less than 0.05. Panel (A) reveals that the maximal oesophageal pressures (P oes) were significantly greater for the chair thrust (p = 0.008), though not different among the conventional upthrust Heimlich, circumferential abdominal thrust, or self-administered autoabdominal thrust.

- **Maximal gastric pressures**: These were significantly higher in the chair thrust compared with Heimlich manoeuvres (p = 0.004). An outlier in the autoabdominal thrust data (in Panel B) aligns with participant MH, who self-administered an abdominal thrust, as outlined in case 2 (refer to online supplement).

In one case, a participant underwent three additional manoeuvres. The P oes from back slaps was 7 cm H₂O, and from chest compressions in a supine CPR position, it was 42 cm H₂O. Both values were lower than those from the Heimlich manoeuvre (64 cm H₂O) and coughing (179 cm H₂O) for that individual. Supine abdominal compressions resulted in a P oes of 86 cm H₂O, similar to abdominal thrusts.

### Fluorescite [^1121rbhG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Respiratory reactions may require intervention. Severe local tissue damage can occur with extravasation during injection. Nausea and/or vomiting may occur within minutes following injection.

- **Respiratory reactions**: Caution is to be exercised in patients with a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. An emergency tray should be available in the event of a possible reaction to Fluorescite® Injection 10%. If a potential allergy is suspected, an intradermal skin test may be performed prior to intravenous administration, i.e. 0.05 mL injected intradermally to be evaluated 30 to 60 minutes following injection. Given the sensitivity and specificity of skin testing, a negative skin test is not proof that a patient is not allergic to fluorescein.

- **Severe local tissue damage**: Care must be taken to avoid extravasation during injection as the high pH of fluorescein solution can result in severe local tissue damage. The following complications resulting from extravasation of fluorescein have been noted to occur: severe pain in the arm for several hours, sloughing of the skin, superficial phlebitis, subcutaneous granuloma, and toxic neuritis along the median curve in the antecubital area. When significant extravasation occurs, the injection should be discontinued and conservative measures to treat damaged tissue and relieve pain should be implemented [see Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6)].

- **Nausea and/or vomiting**: Nausea and/or vomiting and gastrointestinal distress occur commonly within the first few minutes of injection.

### Fish fin aspiration: An unusual type of lower airway foreign body in a Chinese adult [^111JP9AF]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

Foreign body aspiration into the lower airway is rare in adults and typically occurs in individuals of advanced age or with underlying neurological or medical conditions. The most common type of lower airway foreign body is organic substances, in particular chicken or fish bones. In many patients, a history of an acute choking event is not found, and symptoms are non-specific and may be attributed to other medical conditions. Herein, we report the unique case of an 80-year-old Chinese woman who aspirated a fish fin that was undiagnosed for three years.

### Acute aortic thrombosis following incorrect application of the Heimlich maneuver [^1165UdS1]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The Heimlich maneuver has been widely accepted as a safe and effective method of relieving life-threatening foreign-body upper airway obstruction. However, when applied incorrectly, it may result in direct trauma to the intra-abdominal viscera. Only two cases of major aortic complications have been reported, both involving thrombosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

We report two further instances of aortic thrombotic complications due to the incorrect application of the Heimlich maneuver.

- **First case**: Resulted in thrombosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
- **Second case**: The abdominal thrusts caused dislodgement of thrombus from an atherosclerotic non-aneurysmal aorta, leading to thromboembolic occlusion of both lower extremities.

In both cases, as with the two previously reported instances, there was massive reperfusion injury, which eventually proved fatal. When applied incorrectly, the Heimlich maneuver may result in direct trauma to the abdominal aorta and is an unusual cause of acute aortic thrombosis.

### The characteristics of foreign bodies aspirated by children across different continents: A comparative review [^116KERBn]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Low credibility.

Foreign body aspiration (FBA) is a common issue in pediatric emergencies, with regional variations. Factors such as various cultures and foods, parents' and physicians' inadequate experience, and lack of bronchoscopy equipment contribute to the regional variation of FBA.

The aim of this review is to more accurately represent the demographic characteristics of aspirated foreign bodies (FBs) across various continents by providing organized information based on the reviewed articles.

- **Methodology**: A search was conducted in PubMed/PubMed Central, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. From the 36 included articles, information on age, gender, bronchoscopy type, type of FB, location, history of choking, and time elapsed between aspiration and admission were extracted.

- **Results**: A total of 14,469 cases were evaluated. According to the findings, children under two accounted for more than 75% of FBAs. Nuts and seeds were the most common FBs in most countries, whereas plastic and metal objects had higher rates in Brazil, and calcified objects were more prevalent in Thailand. The right bronchus was the most frequent location, and rigid bronchoscopy was the most often utilized type of bronchoscope. In addition, a significant percentage of patients were referred to emergency rooms within the first 12–24 hours following the aspiration incident. Asian patients reported more choking history, and Europeans had fewer witnesses of FBA.

- **Conclusions**: There is a lack of standardized reporting systems and organized guidelines in pediatric FBA. To select the ideal time for endoscopies…

### Clinical variables responsible for early and late diagnosis of foreign body aspiration in pediatrics age group [^114B1ZwE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The incidence of foreign body aspiration is predominantly observed in the age group ranging from 12 months to 3 years. A foreign body in the trachea constitutes a medical emergency as it presents with respiratory distress. Obstruction of only one main or distal bronchus leads to severe cough, a choking sensation, and breathlessness. Without early intervention, it can result in collapse, consolidation, and pneumonia in the affected lung.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed 37 pediatric case records of patients who presented from January 2014 to December 2018 with foreign body aspiration. Our primary aim was to assess the parameters responsible for early and late diagnosis of foreign body aspiration. We concluded with a diagnostic algorithm for the management of foreign body aspiration based on this outcome.

- **Results**: Approximately 32.5% of the cases had a history of aspiration, 43% were referred from primary centers with a suspicion of the same, and the rest came to our tertiary care hospital directly. Those who presented within a week had complaints of wet cough, wheeze, and tachypnea. Furthermore, those who came in following a week mainly complained of a dry cough and fever. The majority of ingested foreign bodies were of a vegetative type (80%) as compared to non-vegetative.

- **Conclusion**: Unlike adults, foreign body aspiration in children is most commonly diagnosed based on history, suspicion, and clinical findings. A chest x-ray has been the primary investigation of choice, but in the majority of the cases, the x-ray was normal with only subtle changes. Early diagnosis is crucial to avoid complications.

### Social and environmental risk factors for unintentional suffocation among infants in China: A descriptive analysis [^114HTaDo]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Within the injury prevention community, it is accepted that up to 90% of childhood injuries are both predictable and preventable. Professional knowledge of suffocation first aid can greatly improve the prognosis, especially for inhalation suffocation, which prevents oxygen from getting to the lungs and brain, leading to brain damage or even death within four minutes. However, many parents in China do not know how to provide first aid on the spot, and they often panic when their children have accidents and do not give first aid treatment. In our study, we found that the majority (87.3%) of primary caregivers of the infants did not have knowledge of first aid. In Saudi Arabia, 94% of parents had low-to-moderate first aid knowledge. In Nottingham, 75% of parents knew the correct first aid for choking.

Changing community knowledge and/or behavior through educational programs has a great effect on decreasing morbidity, mortality, and cost after unintentional injuries. In the US, more than twofold shorter hospital stays and fewer full-thickness injuries were observed after community education. In California, anoxic encephalopathy is less prevalent among children who receive immediate resuscitation following the event. Therefore, it is important to educate caregivers about suffocation first aid. Pediatric health care providers should encourage parents and other caregivers to learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and choking first aid, and they should offer anticipatory, age-appropriate guidance to prevent unintentional injuries.

### Suction-type suffocation incidents in infants and toddlers [^114jk5BL]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

To describe the danger of upper airway obstruction associated with semirigid hollow objects in infants and toddlers, we conducted a study to define the frequency of such episodes and propose a model for identifying potentially hazardous characteristics of these objects.

A retrospective study was performed using data from incidents reported to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission from January 1983 to March 2000, involving children younger than 5 years. Furthermore, medical literature (Medline) was searched for similar cases, and the resulting case series was analyzed.

A total of 17 incidents were identified where a semirigid, hollow hemispherical or ellipsoidal object was described as having "cupped" the face, simultaneously covering the nose and the mouth. Of these incidents, 13 involved toys, while the remaining 4 involved two different consumer products. All incidents involved children aged 4 to 36 months. Eight incidents resulted in death, and 9 were nonfatal due to parental intervention. In all investigated cases, the infant was found with the semirigid object strongly adhering to their face. In 16 incidents, significant physical effort was reportedly required to remove the objects from the child's face.

Fatal incidents involved children aged 4 to 24 months, whereas the age range of children in nonfatal incidents was 7 to 36 months. In all but one of the fatal cases, the victim was found dead in a crib or playpen. The cross-sectional diameter of the products involved in suffocation incidents was within the range considered.

### Nonpharmacological approaches to chronic cough [^114HRCd6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Although cough is a protective reflex, it can occur without any physical need to clear the airway. In chronic cough, it can be triggered by innocuous stimuli and persist despite medical treatment. Nonpharmacological interventions, such as cough control therapy provided by speech pathologists, have gained popularity in recent years. These interventions target refractory or unexplained chronic cough, and their efficacy has been studied in randomized controlled trials.

Key elements of cough control therapy include education, anticipation, and control of the urge to cough, reducing laryngeal irritation, and psychoeducational counseling. Our understanding of the mechanisms behind the success of nonpharmacological treatment is developing. It is likely that the mechanisms of action are multifactorial across peripheral, central, and higher cortical regions. Nonpharmacological cough control therapy interventions are now included in international cough guidelines. However, the approach to service delivery is not standardized and varies between regions and countries.

### Comparison of outcomes in medical therapy vs surgical intervention of esophageal foreign bodies [^1121kY6U]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: (1) Compare the efficacy of primary medical therapy versus primary surgical intervention in patients with esophageal foreign bodies (EFBs). (2) Investigate variables that may predict successful outcomes in patients treated for EFBs.

- **Study design and setting**: This is a case series with chart review conducted at a single-institution academic tertiary care medical center.

- **Subjects and methods**: The study involved adult patients (older than 18 years) seen at the University of Michigan Emergency Department (ED) over an 8-year period with the diagnosis of EFBs, spanning from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2011 (N = 250). ED physicians decided whether to treat patients with first-line medical therapy or surgical intervention. Clinical and demographic data were extracted from medical records and summarized using descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: First-line surgical intervention, which involves flexible or rigid esophagoscopy with foreign body removal, was significantly more likely to resolve symptoms compared to medical therapy using glucagon alone or in combination with other therapies (98% vs. 28%; P < .0001). Medical therapy was more effective when administered within 12 hours of symptom onset, resulting in a 34% resolution compared to a 12% resolution when administered later (P < .01). There was no difference in complication rates between primary medical therapy and surgical intervention, both at 8%.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with EFBs frequently require consultation from otolaryngologists and gastroenterologists. In these cases, first-line surgical intervention proves superior to medical therapy and should not be bypassed in favor of a trial of medical therapy.

### Clinical and radiographic predictors of successful therapeutic bronchoscopy for the relief of malignant central airway obstruction [^111PRcjK]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

When successful, therapeutic bronchoscopy for the relief of malignant central airway obstruction (CAO) can ameliorate debilitating symptoms and positively impact quality of life; however, as this is generally performed in high-risk patients, identifying clinical predictors associated with successful therapeutic bronchoscopy is of utmost importance in procedural planning.

This study evaluates clinical and radiographic factors associated with the technical success of therapeutic bronchoscopy to relieve malignant CAO. We found the following factors are associated with higher odds of therapeutic success:

1. CT imaging demonstrating a patent airway distal to the CAO prior to intervention
2. Patent airway visualized distal to the CAO during bronchoscopy
3. Non- or former-smoking status prior to therapeutic bronchoscopy
4. Reduced time from the radiographic diagnosis of CAO to therapeutic intervention

Successful therapeutic bronchoscopy for the relief of CAO, defined as achieving an airway patency greater than 50% of the lumen, was achieved in 85.4% of cases, consistent with rates of success previously reported in the literature. A multimodality approach to relieve central airway obstruction was commonly utilized. In the successful group, 27 out of 50 (54%) patients had stent placement to establish durable patency. No patient in the unsuccessful group received a stent, as airway patency could not be established, which is essential for stent deployment. Additionally, KTP laser was used for 11 patients in the successful group and 1 patient in the unsuccessful group, primarily for hemostasis (22% vs. 2%, p = 0.004).

### Choking on a foreign body: A physiological study of the effectiveness of abdominal thrust manoeuvres to increase thoracic pressure [^1133y83v]. Thorax (2017). High credibility.

Detailed methods are available in the online supplement. Briefly, different expulsive manoeuvres were performed on and by four consenting adult physiology researchers with a median age of 56.5 years (range: 46, 74) and a body mass index (BMI) of 25.9 (range: 25, 26) kg/m². Oesophageal and gastric balloon catheters were placed to record pressures generated. Detailed statistical analysis is available in the online supplement.

- **Description of manoeuvres**:
	- **Circumferential 'horizontal' abdominal thrust**: The operator stands behind the participant, grasps their fists together, and places the thumb side of the fist over the fleshy part of the abdomen above the navel. The operator pulls sharply backwards, starting with medium force and progressively increasing force until the maximum pressure that the subject feels is acceptable is achieved.
	- **Heimlich manoeuvre**: The same procedure but with an upward direction of force.
	- **Auto 'upthrust' abdominal thrust**: The participant positions their own hands in the standard position for the abdominal manoeuvre and performs thrusts increasing to the maximal force they can tolerate.
	- **Chair thrust**: The participant positions themselves above a high-backed chair, with the chair back positioned below the upper half of the abdomen, below the ribcage. Using gravity, bodyweight, and arms for additional force, the participant allows the back of the chair to thrust up into their abdomen (see figure 1).
	- **Volitional maximal cough and sniff pressures**: The participant performed repeated maximal volitional cough and sniff manoeuvres.

### Evaluation and management of pill aspiration: Case discussion and review of the literature [^117XW5SW]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Pill aspiration represents a unique type of foreign body aspiration requiring a distinct diagnostic and therapeutic approach. In many cases, the "foreign body" itself may no longer be present, whereas the airway manifestations may persist for months to years. Limited data exist to guide management decisions. We report two cases of severe airway injury secondary to pill aspiration and provide a review of the literature. Endobronchial surveillance may be important to identify impending airway obstruction via secretions, edema, granulation tissue, or fibrotic stricture. In many cases, the airway sequelae of pill aspiration can be effectively managed with bronchoscopy.

### Extraction of hollow gastric foreign bodies by flexible upper endoscopy assisted by a through-the-scope balloon catheter for anchoring [^114Uh3eZ]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Various methods have been used to remove foreign bodies; hollow foreign bodies deserve special consideration. The main difficulty encountered in such situations is the anatomic obstacle of the lower and upper esophageal sphincters, along with a risk of perforation.

- **Objective**: We describe a unique approach by using an esophageal balloon dilator to anchor a hollow foreign body onto an endoscope, which allows for the successful extraction of such objects with minimal risk.

- **Design**: Case series.

- **Setting**: Shands Jacksonville and University of Florida/Jacksonville, Jacksonville, Florida.

- **Patients**: Two consecutive patients with hollow foreign bodies in the stomach that required removal.

- **Interventions**: A combined approach by using an endoscope and a 20-mm by 8-cm esophageal balloon dilator to remove hollow foreign bodies from the stomach.

- **Main outcome measurements**: Nonsurgical removal of hollow gastric foreign bodies.

- **Results**: Both foreign bodies were successfully removed from the stomach and extracted by mouth with this technique. There were no complications after both procedures.

- **Conclusions**: The inflated esophageal balloon that anchors a hollow foreign body onto a flexible endoscopic technique is a safe and effective alternative to previously described methods for removal of such foreign bodies in the gastric cavity. This method may be applicable to the removal of other hollow objects within the gastric lumen.

### Endoscopic management of foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract: Report on a series of 414 adult patients [^116Egfv7]. Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Ingestion of foreign bodies is a common occurrence. Few papers in the literature report experience and outcomes at tertiary centers. The aim of this paper is to report the management and outcomes in 414 patients admitted for suspected ingestion of a foreign body between May 1995 and December 1999.

- **Methods**: A plain radiographic film of the neck, chest, or abdomen was obtained in the case of radiopaque objects, and in order to rule out suspected perforation. In such cases, a computed tomography (CT) study was also performed. All patients were asked to give their informed consent, which was refused by three patients. Anesthesia was used in all cases, either conscious sedation (86.8%) or general anesthesia in the case of poor patient tolerance (13.2%). All patients underwent an endoscopic procedure within six hours of admission. A flexible scope was used in all patients, along with a wide range of endoscopic devices.

- **Results**: Foreign bodies were found in 64.5% of our patients, almost all located in the esophagus. The types of foreign bodies varied, primarily including food boluses, bones or cartilages, dental prostheses, or fish bones. In three patients (1.1%), it was impossible to endoscopically remove the foreign body, which was located in the cervical esophagus; these three patients required surgery. No complications related to the endoscopic procedure were observed; however, 30.7% of patients had an underlying esophageal disease, such as a stricture. Only eight patients required a second endoscopic procedure.

### Choking on a foreign body: A physiological study of the effectiveness of abdominal thrust manoeuvres to increase thoracic pressure [^115PS54m]. Thorax (2017). Low credibility.

The Heimlich manoeuvre is a well-known intervention for managing choking due to foreign body airway occlusion, but the evidence base for guidance on this topic is limited, and guidelines differ. We measured pressures during abdominal thrusts in healthy volunteers. The angle at which thrusts were performed (upthrust vs. circumferential) did not affect intrathoracic pressure. Self-administered abdominal thrusts produced similar pressures to those performed by another person. Chair thrusts, where the subject pushed their upper abdomen against a chair back, produced higher pressures than other manoeuvres. Both approaches should be included in basic life support teaching.

### Clinical variables responsible for early and late diagnosis of foreign body aspiration in pediatrics age group [^117KN1Je]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The incidence of foreign body aspiration has been predominantly noticed in the age group ranging from 12 months to 3 years. Foreign body aspiration in the trachea is a medical emergency as it presents with respiratory distress. Obstruction of only one main or distal bronchus leads to severe cough, a choking sensation, and breathlessness. Without early intervention, this can lead to collapse, consolidation, and pneumonia of the affected lung.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed 37 pediatric case records from January 2014 to December 2018 with foreign body aspiration. Our primary aim was to assess the parameters responsible for early and late diagnosis of foreign body aspiration. We concluded with a diagnostic algorithm for the management of foreign body aspiration based on this outcome.

- **Results**: Around 32.5% of patients presented with a history of aspiration, 43% were referred from primary centers with a suspicion of the same, and the rest came directly to our tertiary care hospital. Those who presented within a week had complaints of wet cough, wheeze, and tachypnea. Furthermore, those who presented following a week had a dry cough and fever as their main complaints. The majority of ingested foreign bodies were of a vegetative type (80%) compared to non-vegetative.

- **Conclusion**: Unlike adults, foreign body aspiration in children is most commonly diagnosed based on history, suspicion, and clinical findings. Chest X-ray has been the primary investigation of choice; however, in the majority of cases, it was normal with subtle changes. Early diagnosis is key to avoiding complications.

### A descriptive analysis: Infants presenting to the pediatric emergency department with a brief resolved unexplained event [^1122i9Ck]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Low credibility.

Infants presenting to pediatric emergency departments (EDs) following a choking episode, cyanotic event, or irregular breathing pattern are often diagnosed with a brief, resolved, unexplained event (BRUE). Social determinants of health may affect these patients; therefore, we aimed to define population demographics and determine significant demographic predictors between two cohorts: infants presenting with BRUE and those admitted to the intensive care unit.

Using data from the Pediatric Health Information System (Children's Hospital Association, Washington, DC, Lenexa, KS), this multicenter, retrospective study included children aged 0–1 year from 52 hospitals who presented with an International Classification of Diseases-10 coded primary diagnosis for BRUE/apparent life-threatening event (ALTE) between January 1, 2016, and June 30, 2021. Cohort 1 patients presented to the ED with BRUE; cohort 2 patients were admitted from the ED for BRUE. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed for both cohorts to discover possible demographic predictors.

Overall, 24,027 patients were evaluated. Patient sex did not affect admission rates (odds ratio [OR] = 1.034; 95% confidence interval, 0.982–1.089; P = 0.2051). Black race (OR = 1.252; 95% CI, 1.177–1.332; P < 0.0001) and Medicaid insurance (OR = 1.126; 95% CI, 1.065–1.19; P < 0.0001) were significantly associated with an increased risk of admission. "Other" race (OR = 0.837; 95% CI, 0.777–0.902; P < 0.0001) and commercial insurance were significantly associated with a greater likelihood.

### Effectiveness of glucagon in relieving esophageal foreign body impaction: A multicenter study [^116kv2xD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Glucagon is thought to decrease lower esophageal sphincter tone and is used as an alternative to invasive endoscopy for esophageal foreign body impaction (EFBI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of glucagon and identify characteristics associated with its success.

- **Methods**: A multicenter, retrospective study of patients receiving glucagon for EFBI at two academic emergency departments was conducted between 2006 and 2010. A control group of patients who did not receive glucagon was also evaluated. Data collection included demographics, type of foreign body, glucagon dose, resolution of impaction, incidence of vomiting, additional medication, and endoscopy required. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed as appropriate.

- **Results**: A total of 133 doses of glucagon were administered to 127 patients. Glucagon-related resolution of EFBI occurred in 18 patients (14.2%), and vomiting was observed in 16 patients (12.6%). No statistical differences between successful and unsuccessful groups were seen, except for the administration of concomitant medication (benzodiazepine or nitroglycerin), which was associated with less glucagon success, 33.3% vs 59.6%, respectively (P = .04). Eighty-four percent of patients in the unsuccessful group underwent endoscopy. Comparing those who received glucagon (n = 127) and the control group (n = 29), there was no significant difference in the resolution of EFBI, 14.2% vs 10.3%, respectively (P = .586).

- **Conclusions**: Glucagon-related resolution occurred in 14.2% of patients and was not significantly different compared with those that received no treatment.

### Choking on a foreign body: A physiological study of the effectiveness of abdominal thrust manoeuvres to increase thoracic pressure [^115zqXAK]. Thorax (2017). Low credibility.

**Discussion**: Abdominal thrusts caused a sharp rise in abdominal and thoracic pressures, exceeding or equal to those produced by these and alternative manoeuvres in previous studies. In 12 supine cadavers, mean airway pressure was 40.8 cm H₂O for chest and 26.4 cm H₂O for abdominal thrusts. In six anaesthetised and intubated healthy adult male volunteers, airway pressures from abdominal thrusts, low-chest thrusts, and mid-chest thrusts in the horizontal lateral and sitting positions were compared. Low-chest thrusts in the horizontal lateral position (34.0 cm H₂O) and mid-chest thrusts in the sitting position (46.2 cm H₂O) produced the highest pressures. In eight intubated and anaesthetised pigs, anterior chest thrusts and Heimlich manoeuvres, both performed in a seated position, produced airway pressures of 6.5 and 13.8 cm H₂O, respectively, with lateral chest thrusts in the side-lying position producing 18.0 cm H₂O. Day et al. compared alveolar pressure change for back blows (17.7 cm H₂O) and the Heimlich manoeuvre (36.7 cm H₂O).

### Airway clearance: Physiology, pharmacology, techniques, and practice [^113ULD5Y]. Respiratory Care (2007). Low credibility.

Clinicians and their patients are troubled by respiratory secretions, and standard practice calls for efforts to clear secretions from the lungs. On one hand, mucus production and cough are important for airway defense and protection of the lower respiratory tract against inhaled irritations. On the other hand, excessive mucus obstructs airways, and excessive cough has been associated with a number of complications. The objective of this conference was to review the scientific basis and clinical evidence for the use of airway clearance therapy to guide the most appropriate approach to airway clearance.

An international group of clinicians and scientists addressed the physiology of mucus production and cough, pharmacologic approaches to airway clearance, and the variety of techniques available for airway clearance. Specific issues related to airway clearance in critically ill patients, children, and the elderly were discussed. Outcome measures related to evaluating mucus clearance therapy were also presented. One of the themes repeated consistently throughout this conference was the dearth of high-level evidence related to airway clearance techniques. Appropriately powered and methodologically sound research is desperately needed in this area.

### Choking on a foreign body: A physiological study of the effectiveness of abdominal thrust manoeuvres to increase thoracic pressure [^116aGbTr]. Thorax (2017). Low credibility.

The key to diagnosing complete airway obstruction is identifying a conscious subject who, while in the process of eating, is unable to breathe or speak. Autoadministered thrusts are shown to be as physiologically effective as those administered by a first-aider in generating expulsive intrathoracic pressures, with chair thrusts proving to be the most effective. We advise that individuals with complete airway obstruction initially perform either autoadministered abdominal thrusts or a chair thrust.

- **Education and public awareness**: These manoeuvres should be more widely taught in schools and first aid courses, as well as to staff in restaurants. Additionally, they should be publicized as widely as possible, with suitable notices displayed in eating establishments.

### Pediatric airway foreign body retrieval: Surgical and anesthetic perspectives [^114qJmPt]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Airway foreign body aspiration most commonly occurs in young children and is associated with a high rate of airway distress, morbidity, and mortality. The presenting symptoms of foreign body aspiration range from none to severe airway obstruction and may often be innocuous and nonspecific. In the absence of a choking or aspiration event, the diagnosis may be delayed for weeks to months, contributing to worsening lung disease. Radiography and high-resolution CT scans may aid in the eventual diagnosis. Bronchoscopy is used to confirm the diagnosis and retrieve the object.

The safest method for removing an airway foreign body is by utilizing general anesthesia. Communication between the anesthesiologist and the surgeon is essential for optimal outcomes. The choice between the maintenance of spontaneous and controlled ventilation is often based on personal preference and does not appear to affect the procedure's outcome. Complications are related to the actual obstruction and the retrieval of the impacted object. Localized inflammation and irritation resulting from the impacted object can lead to bronchitis, tracheitis, atelectasis, and pneumonia.

### Interventions for noisy breathing in patients near to death [^112M7VwW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Noisy breathing (death rattle) occurs in 23 to 92% of people who are dying. The cause of death rattle remains unproven but is presumed to be due to an accumulation of secretions in the airways. It is managed physically by repositioning and clearing the upper airways of fluid with a mechanical sucker or pharmacologically with anticholinergic drugs.

- **Objectives**: To describe and assess the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions used to treat death rattle in patients close to death.

- **Search strategy**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), before and after studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies in adults and children with death rattle were sought through MEDLINE (1966 to 2007), EMBASE (1980 to 2007), CINAHL (1980 to 2007), the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Trials Register, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Additionally, the reference lists of all relevant trials and reports were checked, and investigators known to be researching this area were contacted for unpublished data or knowledge of the grey literature.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs, controlled before and after studies, and ITS reporting the outcome of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for treating death rattle.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data was extracted by two independent review authors, and trials were quality scored. There was insufficient data to carry out an analysis.

- **Main results**: Thirty studies were identified, of which only one study met the inclusion criteria. This small study was a randomized placebo-controlled trial.

### The minimally effective dose of sucrose for procedural pain relief in neonates: A randomized controlled trial [^112mBEnN]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Approximately 2% of neonates suffered adverse events; these all resolved spontaneously without medical intervention or with minimal caregiver intervention, such as positioning. Most adverse events occurred at one site where the highest proportion of the sickest neonates is cared for, although this is not represented in the study sample. This adverse event rate is consistent with the 2016 Cochrane sucrose review. Although researchers are becoming more vigilant in observing and reporting adverse events, it remains unclear how adverse events are reported, as chart review is considerably different from careful direct observation of every newborn infant who is receiving the intervention.

A few study limitations need mention. Pain intensity did not differ significantly between the 30- and 60-second time points. Although these time intervals have been used in multiple research studies of acute procedural pain, they are arbitrary and designed based on mean behavioral response time. Observing neonates for longer periods may demonstrate additional responses of less typical responders or other types of responses, such as physiologic or cortical responses. Although there has been significant validation and updating of the PIPP-R measure, there remains no gold standard for measuring pain in infants. This may influence the determination of the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of pain-relieving interventions. The future, which includes novel strategies for a better understanding of the developing cortical pain circuitry, will pave the way for better prevention and treatment of pain in this vulnerable population.

### Preference matters: New aspects on how foreign bodies should and could be removed from a child's airway [^113SZDrp]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Low credibility.

Foreign body aspiration in children is a potentially life-threatening event that can be diagnosed and treated by airway endoscopy. We aimed to analyze the influence of the examiner's experience and preference on the choice of the technique and the resulting complication rate.

- **Methods**: In this international study, experts in the field documented their preferred and applied technique, as well as the outcome of each case of foreign body removal. Personal data of the bronchoscopists and their medical center were collected via an online questionnaire separately from the case specifics.

- **Results**: A total of 399 foreign body removals were performed by 64 examiners. Out of these, 279 removals were performed using rigid endoscopy, and 120 procedures were carried out using flexible endoscopy. When difficulty was expected, flexible endoscopy was used significantly more often (χ²(1) = 11.06, p < 0.001). Complications occurred significantly less often when the bronchoscopist used their preferred technique (χ²(1) = 6.41, p = 0.011), had more than five years of experience (χ²(1) = 5.13, p = 0.023), or performed more than 100 removals (χ²(2) = 11.51, p = 0.003). In medical centers, complication rates significantly decreased if more than 200 bronchoscopies were performed in children compared to centers performing 50–200 bronchoscopies per year (χ²(1) = 24.56, p < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: The preference and experience of a bronchoscopist and their medical center with flexible or rigid foreign body removal distinctly affect the outcome of the procedure and cannot be neglected in the discourse on the appropriate technique.

### Predictors of radiolucent foreign body aspiration [^114Ty8j3]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Children frequently present with suspected foreign body aspiration, often exhibiting mild symptoms and/or negative radiographs, raising the question of a radiolucent foreign body aspiration.

- **Method**: A retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent bronchoscopy for suspected radiolucent foreign body aspiration from 2000 to 2010. The study collected data on demographics, history, hospital presentation, radiographic, and operative details. Pearson's correlation was used to analyze the relationship between event history, presentation, radiographic details, and bronchoscopically identified foreign bodies, with a P value < 0.01.

- **Results**: The study included 138 patients with a mean age of 2.6 years and mean weight of 15.6 kg; 68% were male. Event symptoms included: 81% witnessed events, 64% wheezing, 43% coughing, 39% choking, 6% stridor, and 0.7% lethargy. During hospital presentation, symptoms persisted in 70% of cases, with wheezing in 56%, coughing in 15%, desaturations in 11%, stridor in 7%, choking in 4%, and lethargy in 1%. A chest x-ray was performed in 92% of patients, revealing air trapping in 38% and lung collapse in 21%. Two patients underwent CT scans, with one showing lung collapse. Bronchoscopy identified foreign bodies in 93% of patients: food in 68%, plastic in 18%, non-descript in 11%, and rocks in 3%. No correlations were identified between event symptoms, hospital presentation, radiographs, and the presence of a foreign body.

- **Conclusion**: Event history, hospital presentation, and radiographs are insufficient to rule out the presence of a radiolucent foreign body. Patients with suspected radiolucent foreign body aspiration should undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy before discharge.

### Central airway obstruction: is it time to move forward [^115cKyru]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Clinical presentation**: Central airway obstruction (CAO) is much less common compared to other lower airway diseases. However, the symptoms may be identical, which may lead to misdiagnosis. Because these symptoms can be insidious, CAO may be obscured for a long time, resulting in a delayed diagnosis and worse outcomes. Clinical presentation depends on the location, extent, degree of obstruction, speed of progression, and underlying disease. Other conditions, such as the patient's general health, play an important role in progression and outcome.

The main symptoms are dyspnea and stridor, occurring in 54% of patients as the initial complaint. These manifestations are more prominent during exercise but may progress to dyspnea at rest. Dyspnea typically occurs when the lumen is reduced to 8 mm, and stridor when it reaches less than 5 mm. Cough, wheezing, diminished sputum clearance, and reinfection emerge as the severity increases. Unlike wheezing, stridor occurs predominantly during expiration and is exacerbated by hyperventilation. If the obstruction is mainly thoracic, both inspiratory and expiratory stridor will appear. Hoarseness can be heard and may signal laryngeal involvement. Less commonly, an initial presentation with acute respiratory distress is noted.

### Dojolvi [^111TbpYQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Taking Dojolvi by mouth: Use an oral syringe or measuring cup made of the materials listed above to measure the prescribed amount of Dojolvi from the bottle. Add the prescribed amount of Dojolvi to a clean bowl, cup, or container, made of the materials listed above, containing the appropriate amount of soft food or drink as instructed by your healthcare provider. Mix Dojolvi well into the soft food or liquid and swallow the mixture. Do not take Dojolvi alone to avoid stomach upset. You can store any unused Dojolvi mixture for up to 24 hours in the refrigerator. If not used within 24 hours, dispose of the Dojolvi mixture in the trash; do not pour it down the sink or save it for later. Check the items used to take Dojolvi often to ensure they are functioning properly and are not breaking down.

- **Feeding tube administration**: You can give Dojolvi by a feeding tube. Mix Dojolvi with medical food or formula before administering it by a feeding tube, y-connector, or feeding tube extension set. Only administer Dojolvi using a feeding tube made of silicone or polyurethane. Do not use a feeding tube made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), as it is a type of plastic. Do not give Dojolvi alone to avoid stomach upset and to prevent breakdown of the feeding tube. Avoid adding Dojolvi to the feeding bag because the feeding equipment may degrade over time. Use an oral syringe or measuring cup made of the materials listed above to measure the prescribed amount of Dojolvi. Add the prescribed amount of Dojolvi to a clean bowl, cup, or container, made of the materials listed above.
