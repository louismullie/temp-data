## Question

A 28-year-old woman with a known history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents with new-onset hypertension, acute kidney injury, hematuria, and proteinuria. Laboratory studies reveal thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low haptoglobin, and schistocytes on peripheral smear. The nephrology team suspects thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in the setting of lupus nephritis. The patient is hemodynamically stable but has worsening renal function and persistent thrombocytopenia.

According to KDIGO guidelines, what initial laboratory tests and risk stratification should be performed in this patient with lupus nephritis and suspected thrombotic microangiopathy, and what is the recommended management if the patient is found to be at moderate or high risk for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) while awaiting test results?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the initial laboratory tests, risk stratification, and immediate management for a 28-year-old woman with SLE, suspected lupus nephritis, and features of thrombotic microangiopathy, particularly when TTP risk is moderate or high while awaiting results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the clinical syndrome and why TMA in lupus nephritis mandates urgent action. Then, I should verify the exact KDIGO-recommended initial tests and the PLASMIC risk tool. Next, I will examine the management pathway conditional on PLASMIC risk and ADAMTS13 results, including plasma exchange, glucocorticoids, rituximab, and caplacizumab. After that, I need to consider alternative TMA etiologies if ADAMTS13 is normal, especially complement-mediated TMA and antiphospholipid syndrome. Finally, I should double-check pediatric nuances, multidisciplinary care, and what to do if results return before treatment decisions are made.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and its urgency. The constellation of new hypertension, AKI, hematuria, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, and schistocytes is classic for TMA, and in the context of SLE and suspected lupus nephritis, this demands rapid etiologic differentiation because outcomes hinge on timely, mechanism-specific therapy, with TTP carrying high mortality if untreated and complement-mediated TMA risking irreversible kidney failure if eculizumab is delayed [^2912c0d5] [^d7aa6c8a].

> Wait, let me verify the KDIGO-recommended initial tests. Multiple KDIGO sources converge on the same triad: ADAMTS13 activity with anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, and TTP risk stratification using the PLASMIC score, ideally sent immediately because results often lag and treatment cannot wait in moderate-to-high risk scenarios [^2912c0d5] [^8e8eeb73] [^49fa4b99].

> I need to check the PLASMIC components and thresholds. The PLASMIC score uses platelet count, hemolysis markers, absence of active cancer, absence of stem cell or solid organ transplant, MCV, INR, and creatinine to stratify TTP risk; in adults with suspected TMA, a PLASMIC score greater than 5 points indicates moderate-to-high risk and should trigger empiric plasma exchange and glucocorticoids while awaiting ADAMTS13 results, given the narrow therapeutic window in TTP [^49fa4b99] [^a64ddaea] [^da4b71ec].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before confirming the risk category. If PLASMIC is moderate-to-high risk, KDIGO advises starting plasma exchange and glucocorticoids immediately, without waiting for ADAMTS13, because delays increase mortality; if PLASMIC is low risk, it is reasonable to await ADAMTS13, but I should remain vigilant and reassess if the clinical picture worsens [^49fa4b99] [^a64ddaea] [^16abc909].

> Next, I should review the definitive management once ADAMTS13 returns. If ADAMTS13 activity is less than 10 percent, that confirms immune-mediated TTP in this setting, and KDIGO recommends plasma exchange plus high-dose glucocorticoids, with addition of rituximab and consideration of caplacizumab; caplacizumab is particularly impactful early to reduce exacerbations and organ injury, though I should confirm local access and bleeding risk before use [^99aa3b98] [^1288c75f] [^da4b71ec].

> But wait, what if ADAMTS13 is normal. I should double-check the alternative pathways. With normal ADAMTS13 and negative antiphospholipid antibodies, I need to evaluate for complement-mediated TMA, and if suspected, consider eculizumab promptly because plasma exchange is less effective and delays in complement blockade worsen renal outcomes; limited data in secondary aHUS show TMA resolution in about two-thirds and meaningful kidney recovery in a majority with eculizumab, supporting early use when available [^b95b4646] [^c59c9aff] [^0c803082].

> I will now examine the antiphospholipid syndrome branch. If ADAMTS13 is normal and antiphospholipid antibodies are positive, I should consider APS nephropathy and manage with anticoagulation, with plasma exchange reserved for selected cases; I need to ensure thrombosis risk is addressed and coordinate with hematology for long-term anticoagulation planning [^c5c20bce] [^067baf18].

> Let me consider pediatric nuances, even though this patient is an adult. In children, TTP is less common and plasma exchange carries higher morbidity, so KDIGO allows deferring plasma exchange for 24 to 48 hours pending ADAMTS13 if the child is clinically stable; this does not directly change adult care but underscores the principle of balancing risk, speed of testing, and clinical trajectory [^16abc909] [^eaa77d09].

> Next, I should review multidisciplinary care and systems issues. KDIGO emphasizes that TMA in lupus nephritis is best managed with hematology co-management, given the complexity of testing, procedural therapy, and targeted agents; I need to ensure early nephrology–hematology coordination, rapid access to plasma exchange, and pathways for eculizumab and caplacizumab when indicated [^63920e42] [^32b08e21].

> Hold on, I should verify what to do if results return before initiating therapy. If ADAMTS13 is already back and is less than 10 percent, I should proceed directly to plasma exchange, glucocorticoids, rituximab, and consider caplacizumab; if ADAMTS13 is normal and PLASMIC was high, I should still complete the TMA workup urgently and pivot to complement-mediated TMA or APS-directed therapy as above, rather than stopping plasma exchange abruptly if already started, until the alternative diagnosis is secured [^99aa3b98] [^a64ddaea].

> In summary, I need to ensure the following sequence: send ADAMTS13 activity with anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, and calculate PLASMIC immediately; if PLASMIC is greater than 5, start plasma exchange and glucocorticoids now; if ADAMTS13 is less than 10 percent, add rituximab and consider caplacizumab; if ADAMTS13 is normal with negative aPL, evaluate for complement-mediated TMA and consider eculizumab; if ADAMTS13 is normal with positive aPL, prioritize anticoagulation for APS nephropathy; throughout, co-manage with hematology and do not let delays in testing postpone life-saving therapy [^2912c0d5] [^49fa4b99] [^a64ddaea].

In a 28-year-old woman with SLE, suspected lupus nephritis, and TMA features, **KDIGO recommends immediate ADAMTS13 activity, anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, and antiphospholipid antibodies** [^2912c0d5] [^8e8eeb73], plus PLASMIC risk stratification [^49fa4b99]. If PLASMIC is moderate/high (> 5), **start plasma exchange and glucocorticoids now** [^a64ddaea], and add rituximab if ADAMTS13 is low (< 10%) [^99aa3b98]; if ADAMTS13 is normal and aPL are negative, consider complement-mediated TMA and eculizumab [^b95b4646]; if aPL are positive, treat APS nephropathy with anticoagulation ± plasma exchange [^c5c20bce]. Early, mechanism-targeted therapy is essential to prevent irreversible organ damage [^d7aa6c8a].

---

## Initial laboratory evaluation

KDIGO recommends the following **initial laboratory tests** for suspected TMA in lupus nephritis:

- **ADAMTS13 activity and anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies**: Low ADAMTS13 activity (< 10%) supports TTP [^99aa3b98]; normal activity suggests alternative TMA etiologies [^c59c9aff].

- **Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL)**: Positive aPL indicates APS nephropathy, which requires anticoagulation ± plasma exchange [^c5c20bce].

- **PLASMIC score**: Stratifies TTP risk; moderate/high risk (> 5 points) warrants empiric plasma exchange and glucocorticoids while awaiting results [^49fa4b99] [^a64ddaea].

---

## Risk stratification and management

| **Risk category** | **Criteria (plasmic score)** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| Moderate/high risk | > 5 points | - Immediate plasma exchange <br/> - Glucocorticoids <br/> - Add rituximab if ADAMTS13 < 10% [^99aa3b98] [^1288c75f] |
| Low risk | 0–4 points | - Await ADAMTS13 results <br/> - Manage based on results |

---

## Management based on test results

- **Low ADAMTS13 activity (< 10%)**: Confirms TTP; treat with plasma exchange, glucocorticoids, rituximab, and consider caplacizumab [^99aa3b98] [^1288c75f].

- **Normal ADAMTS13 activity and negative aPL**: Evaluate for complement-mediated TMA (e.g. aHUS); consider eculizumab [^b95b4646] [^c59c9aff].

- **Normal ADAMTS13 activity and positive aPL**: Diagnose APS nephropathy; treat with anticoagulation ± plasma exchange [^c5c20bce] [^067baf18].

---

## Clinical implications of delayed diagnosis

Delayed diagnosis and treatment of TMA in lupus nephritis can lead to **irreversible kidney injury**, dialysis dependence, and increased mortality [^d7aa6c8a]. Early, mechanism-specific therapy improves outcomes [^b95b4646].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Immediate tests**: ADAMTS13 activity, anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, aPL, and PLASMIC score [^2912c0d5] [^8e8eeb73].

- **Moderate/high PLASMIC**: Start plasma exchange and glucocorticoids now [^49fa4b99] [^a64ddaea].

- **Low ADAMTS13**: Add rituximab; consider caplacizumab [^99aa3b98] [^1288c75f].

- **Normal ADAMTS13**: Tailor to aPL status; consider eculizumab for complement-mediated TMA [^b95b4646] [^c59c9aff].

---

KDIGO emphasizes **rapid, mechanism-targeted therapy** for TMA in lupus nephritis: obtain ADAMTS13, aPL, and PLASMIC urgently, and start plasma exchange plus glucocorticoids for moderate/high PLASMIC while adding rituximab if ADAMTS13 is low; tailor further therapy to aPL and complement results to limit organ damage [^2912c0d5] [^a64ddaea] [^99aa3b98].

### Outcome of proliferative lupus nephritis with thrombotic microangiopathy; an ambispective observational single-center study [^e75b58c8]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines, including the 2018 revised International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) classification, the joint European League Against Rheumatism and European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (EULAR/ERA-EDRA) recommendations, and the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, provide varying approaches to TMA management in LN. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with TMA in lupus patients, early intervention is crucial, with plasma exchange (PLEX) and glucocorticoids recommended as initial management. However, there is limited evidence comparing different therapeutic strategies for TMA in LN.

To date, there is no clear consensus on the management of TMA in patients with LN. The 2018 revised ISN/RPS classification didn't address the vascular lesions in LN due to insufficient evidence of their prognostic and therapeutic significance. EULAR/ ERA-EDRA guidelines recommended antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) testing when TMA lesions are present in kidney biopsy raising the suspicion of APS nephropathy. KDIGO guidelines in 2021 and its update in 2024 advocate for targeted treatment based on the clinical context and comprehensive laboratory testing of aPL, a disintegrin-like metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif type 1 member 13 (ADAMTS 13) activity and anti-ADAMTS 13 antibodies, complement, and genetic studies, though many of these specialized tests face practical limitations in availability and interpretation. The high morbidity and mortality associated with TMA in lupus cohort prompts urgent evaluation and intervention. Plasma exchange (PLEX) and glucocorticoids are recommended as the initial early management of TMA in LN while awaiting results. Other options include other immunosuppression therapy targeting LN such as cyclophosphamide (CYC) or rituximab, and those targeting renal microangiopathic APS such as anticoagulation, and considering eculizumab in refractory cases.

However, there is limited evidence comparing different therapeutic strategies for TMA management in LN patients. This ambispective study aimed to assess renal outcomes in lupus patients with concomitant proliferative lupus nephritis and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA-LN), who underwent two different treatment modalities: PLEX and CYC.

KDIGO recommendation grading — The strength of a recommendation is graded as Level 1, "We recommend" or Level 2, "We suggest" (Table 5), with explicit implications for patients, clinicians, and policy. For Level 1, patients are told "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", clinicians "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and policy "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 conveys variability — patients "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", clinicians "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and policy "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". Each guideline recommendation "provides an assessment of the strength of the recommendation (Level 1 or Level 2)".

### The management of lupus nephritis as proposed by EULAR / ERA 2019 versus KDIGO 2021 [^50890c92]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

In 2019 and 2021, the European League for Rheumatism (EULAR) jointly with the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), respectively, released updated guidelines on the management of lupus nephritis (LN). The Immunology Working Group of the ERA reviewed and compared both updates. Recommendations were either consistent or differences were of negligible clinical relevance for: indication for kidney biopsy, kidney biopsy interpretation, treatment targets, hydroxychloroquine dosing, first-line initial immunosuppressive therapy for active class III, IV (± V) LN, pregnancy in LN, LN in paediatric patients and LN patients with kidney failure. Relevant differences in the recommended management relate to the recognition of lupus podocytopathies, uncertainties in steroid dosing, drug preferences in specific populations and maintenance therapy, treatment of pure class V LN, therapy of recurrent LN, evolving alternative drug options and diagnostic work-up of thrombotic microangiopathy. Altogether, both documents provide an excellent guidance to the growing complexity of LN management. This article endeavours to prevent confusion by identifying differences and clarifying discrepancies.

Complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) in lupus nephritis — kidney TMA with ADAMTS13 activity > 10% and negative antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLA) corresponds to complement-mediated TMA, and such patients ideally should be evaluated with complement studies when they are available. Complement-mediated TMA in LN does not respond well to plasma exchange or immunosuppression and may be best treated with eculizumab, with reported resolution of TMA in 68% of patients with secondary aHUS and complete kidney recovery in 4 of 5 eculizumab-treated patients in a series of 31 adults. Additional reports include a kidney recovery rate of 85% after eculizumab in patients with SLE and/or APS, kidney function improved by 25% in half of 9 patients after 4 weeks with 2 of 3 discontinuing dialysis, and complete remission of TMA after 8 doses in 6 of 11 patients with lupus nephritis. In the absence of eculizumab, plasma therapy achieved recovery of kidney function in approximately 40% of patients.

Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2024 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Lupus Nephritis — a focused update of the lupus nephritis chapter from the 2021 KDIGO glomerular diseases guideline — aims to assist clinicians caring for individuals with lupus nephritis and provides guidance related to diagnosis, treatment, and special situations. The update takes into consideration evidence from randomized controlled trials published since February 2022 and, based on the evidence, is focused on guidance related to treatment of lupus nephritis. The guideline followed an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal, and treatment approaches and guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies with appraisal of the strength of recommendations and certainty of the evidence following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and areas of future research are presented.

Regarding medical management for lupus nephritis, more specifically with respect to management of inadequate treatment response, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to undertake the following measures in patients with unsatisfactory response to therapy:

- verify adherence to treatment

- ensure adequate dosing of immunosuppressive medications by measuring plasma drug levels if applicable or available (check mycophenolic acid level if on mycophenolic acid analogs, check infusion records if on cyclophosphamide)

- perform repeat biopsy if concern for chronicity or other diagnosis (such as thrombotic microangiopathy)

- consider switching to an alternative recommended treatment regimen when there is persistent disease activity.

Methods for guideline development — recommendation structure and limitations are described as follows: Certainty of the evidence is categorized as A, B, C, D; recommendation statements are followed by Key information listing Balance of benefits and harms, Certainty of the evidence, Values and preferences, Resource use and costs, and Considerations for implementation, plus a Rationale, and each recommendation is linked to relevant SoF tables. An underlying rationale may support a practice point. Limitations include that the evidence review prioritized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as the primary source of evidence; the reviews were not exhaustive because specialty or regional databases were not searched and manual searching of journals was not performed; neither a scoping exercise with patients nor formal qualitative evidence synthesis examining patient experiences and priorities was undertaken, with only limited searches of the qualitative literature; and although resource implications were considered, formal economic evaluations were not undertaken for all topics.

Lupus nephritis — complement-mediated TMA and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) often involve ADAMTS13 activity ≥ 10% with negative aPLA and ideally warrant complement studies; in LN, complement-mediated TMA does not respond well to plasma exchange or glucocorticoids plus cyclophosphamide and may be best treated with a complement inhibitor such as eculizumab, with limited data showing resolution of TMA in 68% of secondary aHUS, complete kidney recovery in 4 of 5 eculizumab‑treated patients in a 31‑patient series, an 85% kidney recovery rate in a 20‑patient review, and in a 9‑patient report kidney function improved by 25% in half after 4 weeks with 2 of 3 discontinuing dialysis; before eculizumab, plasma exchange/infusion was the only treatment with efficacy in less than half, initiation of plasma exchange is warranted while awaiting complement studies or if access to eculizumab is limited, and plasma therapy yielded approximately 40% kidney function recovery in a 31‑patient cohort.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases was published in 2021. Since then, the pace of drug development for glomerular diseases has accelerated, due in large part to rapidly accumulating insights into disease pathogenesis from genetic and molecular studies of afflicted patients. To keep the Glomerular Diseases Guideline as current as possible, KDIGO made a commitment to the nephrology community to provide periodic updates, based on new developments for each disease. After the 2021 guideline was published, two novel drugs received regulatory approval for the management of lupus nephritis, leading to the first KDIGO guideline update. Herein, an executive summary of the most important guideline changes from the Lupus Nephritis chapter is provided as a quick reference.

Lupus nephritis — maintenance therapy recommendation specifies: Recommendation 10.2.3.2.1: We recommend that after completion of initial therapy, patients should be placed on MPAA for maintenance (1B). The rationale states that long-term, reduced-dose MPAA decrease the risk of LN relapse compared to azathioprine or no treatment and have effectiveness comparable to cyclophosphamide but with a lower risk of adverse events, while placing a lower value on adverse events associated with long-term MPAA versus no treatment. Context notes that high-intensity immunosuppression for initial treatment is given for 3–6 months and that at the end of initial therapy only about 10%–40% of patients achieve complete response as defined by clinical parameters.

Lupus nephritis — kidney transplantation versus dialysis management indicates that kidney transplantation is preferred to dialysis, with outcomes similar to other causes of kidney failure and lower mortality than for patients with lupus who remain on dialysis. Transplantation may be carried out as soon as disease is quiescent. Although lupus activity tends to decrease after kidney failure develops, patients can still flare, so periodic monitoring is required. Lupus nephritis can recur in kidney allografts, but the risk is low, and flares do not generally result in allograft loss. Patients with antiphospholipid antibodies may experience dialysis vascular access clotting or allograft thrombosis and may require prophylactic anticoagulation.

CONCLUSIONS

Early diagnosis of kidney involvement in AAV is crucial to improve short- and long-term renal outcomes in patients at risk of kidney function damage. Management should be initiated as early as possible in experienced centers following the best evidence available. The panels from ACR/VF, EULAR and KDIGO provided expert input that resulted in the generation of guidelines and recommendations that are mainly consistent and timely, and that convey the best evidence-based knowledge available. AAV-GN remains one of the most challenging presentations in patients with AAV. Evidence is lacking or is not compelling due to the difficulties in gathering prospective data in patients with severe kidney disease. Therefore, most of the divergences translate into different practices due to how available evidence is valued and how beliefs shape their application. Our intention is to help to generate a critical appraisal of these documents and stimulate discussions that can propel the research in the field forward.

DISCUSSION

Kidney involvement in SLE has significant implications for the disease management and prognosis. Several authorities, including the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and American College of Rheumatology, have published recommendations for the management of LN. The recently published update of the joint EULAR/ERA-EDTA recommendations was based on a dedicated SLR, which covered several aspects of the disease (formed in the 15 research questions) and not just the efficacy and safety of immunosuppressive agents used in the treatment of its different phases. To this end, we followed an inclusive approach during article selection, in order to capture data from observational and non-controlled studies, in topics where randomised controlled studies are absent or scarce. Importantly, because this was an update of previous recommendations published in 2012, data retrieval started from the ending date of the previous SLR, although overall LoE and GoR took into account the whole body of evidence.

Kidney biopsy remains a cornerstone in the diagnosis and management of LN, because the prognostic value of histological findings cannot be replaced by any clinical or laboratory parameter. In addition to features with well-established prognostic value (histological class, activity and chronicity indices, presence of crescents), from the review of the literature it became evident that acute or chronic lesions of the tubulointerstitial space (inflammation and fibrosis/tubular atrophy, respectively) are also associated with adverse short- and long-term outcomes. Regarding features of thrombotic microangiopathy, prognostic associations are more equivocal, despite the fact that such lesions may be present in up to one in four kidney biopsies in LN. A current revision of the 2003 ISN/RPS class, which will address these issues, is currently under way. The issue of repeat kidney biopsy, performed either per protocol or during a disease flare, was explored in several observational studies; histological transition is common, often leading to changes in treatment.

### ISTH guidelines for the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^da4b71ec]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite an increase in our understandings of pathogenesis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), the approaches for initial diagnosis and management of TTP vary significantly.

Objective

The evidence-based guidelines of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about the initial diagnosis and management of acute TTP.

Methods

In June 2018, ISTH formed a multidisciplinary panel that included hematologists, an intensive care physician, nephrologist, clinical pathologist, biostatistician, and patient representatives, as well as a methodology team from McMaster University. The panel composition was designed to minimize the potential conflicts of interests. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome framework to develop and grade their recommendations. Public comments were sought and incorporated in the final document.

Results

The panel agreed on three recommendations covering the initial diagnosis with emphasis on the importance of ADAMTS13 testing (eg, activity, anti-ADAMTS13 IgG or inhibitor) and assessment of the pretest probability of TTP by clinical assessment and/or the risk assessment models like the PLASMIC or French score. The panel noted how availability and turnaround time of ADAMTS13 test results might affect early diagnosis and management, in particular the use of caplacizumab.

Conclusions

There is a lack of high-quality evidence to support strong recommendations for the initial diagnosis and management of a suspected TTP. The panel emphasized the importance of obtaining ADAMTS13 testing in a proper clinical context. Future research should focus on how to monitor and act on ADAMTS13 levels during remission.

Lupus nephritis relapse — epidemiology and management practice point: Relapses of lupus nephritis (LN) are common, and LN flare is an important predictor of poor long-term kidney survival; LN flare rates of 10%–50% have been reported, with higher risk when complete remission is not achieved, including relapse rates of 39% and 64% after complete versus partial remission, time-to-relapse of 36 months compared to 18 months, and an HR of 6.2 for relapse when complete remission was not achieved. Practice Point 10.2.5.1 states: After a complete response, a late LN flare may be confused with CKD progression, and after a complete remission has been achieved, LN relapse should be treated with the same medications used to achieve the original response, or an alternative recommended therapy; it is generally agreed that there is no major difference between management of an LN flare and that of de novo active LN, and initial therapies are the same as outlined above. If cyclophosphamide was used previously, sustained amenorrhea occurs in up to 50% of patients aged > 32 years with a cumulative exposure of 8 g/m², and the chance of future malignancy increases after a total exposure of 36 g, so cyclophosphamide is better avoided if approaching this level. Disease activity should be verified, as proteinuria may be secondary to CKD; the same clinical criteria used to diagnose de novo LN are used to diagnose LN flares, SLE serologies (e.g., complement, anti-dsDNA) may support a flare diagnosis but need contextual interpretation, and, given immunosuppression risks, if the diagnosis remains uncertain a repeat kidney biopsy to assess disease activity versus chronic damage is important to inform treatment decisions.

The threshold level for isolated proteinuria is noted as lower than ACR 2012 LN guidelines. Biopsy cohorts show significant histologic disease even at low proteinuria: 92% of patients with < 1 g/g proteinuria had ISN/RPS class III, IV, V, or mixed histology, and De Rosa et al demonstrated ~ 85% with proteinuria < 0.5 g/d and ~ 75% with < 0.25 g/d had ISN/RPS class III, IV, or mixed histology. Because LN is frequently asymptomatic, SLE patients should be monitored every 3–6 months with creatinine, urinalysis, and UPCR, with high-risk patients requiring frequent monitoring, especially in the first 5 years of SLE diagnosis.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^300f4ee4]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) research priorities — The page outlines needs to develop therapies for LN to select the most appropriate treatment, including biologic medications targeting specific pathogenic pathways; to establish renal response criteria that reflect resolution of disease activity at the tissue level and are also predictive of long-term kidney survival and patient survival without need of kidney replacement therapy; and to establish criteria for duration of maintenance immuno-suppression and the safe withdrawal of therapy. It states that randomized controlled trials are needed to test specific questions, including the optimal therapy for patients with severe Class III/IV LN (i.e., patients presenting with severe acute kidney injury and/or markedly abnormal serum creatinine or estimated glomerular filtration rate) who have been excluded from the majority of clinical trials to date, the optimal therapy for pure Class V LN, whether antimalarials improve the responsiveness of LN to treatment and/or help maintain disease quiescence and prevent flares, the role of complement inhibition in the management of LN, the optimal or prioritized therapies for childhood LN, the efficacy and safety profiles of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) including the optimal drug exposure when used as initial or maintenance treatment of LN and the long-term implications of such treatment, and the optimal glucocorticoid-reduction protocols for LN management.

### Medical consult: aHUS, TTP? How to distinguish and what to do [^d7aa6c8a]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) caused by an autoantibody-mediated deficiency of ADAMTS13 and atypical hemolytic syndrome (aHUS) caused by alternative complement dysregulation are the most common primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs). The evaluation of a patient with TMA is a medical emergency since it is critical to quickly distinguish iTTP and aHUS from other causes of TMA. Untreated iTTP is rapidly fatal, and delays in initiating complement inhibition in aHUS increase the risk of irreversible renal failure. An ADAMTS13 activity level of less than 10% is diagnostic of iTTP in the appropriate clinical setting. In settings where rapid-turnaround ADAMTS13 testing is not available, clinical features and clinical prediction tools are useful to identify patients who should receive emergent plasma exchange. We present an evidence-based approach to the initial (first 24 hours) diagnosis and management of iTTP and review the clinical and laboratory features that can be used to identify patients with aHUS who will benefit from early C5 blockade. We also discuss the potential use of complement blockade to improve outcomes in selected patients with secondary TMA.

### The KDIGO practice guideline on glomerulonephritis: reading between the (guide) lines – application to the individual patient [^dd974ea3]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

The KDIGO guideline for glomerulonephritis is designed to assist health-care providers in treating patients with glomerular diseases. A guideline is not a set of rules but is intended to allow the practitioner to make an informed decision based on the available evidence. Due to its general nature and the variability of strength of the available studies, it is often difficult to directly apply a guideline to the care of an individual patient. This commonly relates to the limited generalizability of the evidence, i.e., does not cover every clinical scenario. To underscore this point, we have introduced within the context of the glomerulonephritis guideline cases with specific features to illustrate the constant need for clinical judgment. These vignettes are intended to demonstrate how the best treatment plans should be individualized and take into account patient preference and clinical acumen, as well as the best available evidence.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for lupus nephritis, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to define response to treatment in patients with LN as follows:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Complete response|- Reduction in proteinuria < 0.5 g/g (< 50 mg/mmol) measured as the protein-creatinine ratio from a 24-hour urine collection (proteinuria < 0.5 g/1.73 m²/day or < 300 mg/m²/day based on a 24-hour urine specimen in pediatric patients) < br > - Stabilization or improvement in kidney function (± 10–15% of baseline) < br > - Within 6–12 months of initiating therapy, but could take > 12 months|
|Primary efficacy renal response|- Protein-creatinine ratio ≤ 0.7 g/g (≤ 70 mg/mmol) < br > - EGFR that was no worse than 20% below the pre-flare value or ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² < br > - No use of rescue therapy for treatment failure|
|Partial response|- Reduction in proteinuria by at least 50% and to < 3 g/g (< 300 mg/mmol) measured as the protein-creatinine ratio from a 24-hour urine collection < br > - Stabilization or improvement in kidney function (± 10–15% of baseline) < br > - Within 6–12 months of initiating therapy|
|No kidney response|- Failure to achieve a partial or complete response within 6–12 months of initiating therapy.|

Lupus nephritis (LN) maintenance therapy rationale and belimumab continuation: The use of maintenance combined immunosuppressive therapy in Class III/IV LN to consolidate response to initial immunosuppressive treatment and prevent disease flares is supported by evidence of at least moderate certainty, with more robust data supporting the superiority of MPAA over azathioprine as maintenance therapy from clinical trials that included patients of different races and ethnicities. Information from the clinical trials using belimumab as initial therapy and then continued for 2–2.5 years as maintenance therapy suggest a lower risk for disease relapses based on post hoc analysis with low certainty of evidence.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the management of LUPUS NEPHRITIS [^2aed6e0c]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Determinants of recommendation strength and certainty — The strength of a recommendation was determined by "the balance of benefits and harms across all critical and important outcomes, the grading of the overall certainty of the evidence, patient values and preferences, resource use and costs, and considerations for implementation (Table 6)". The overall certainty of the evidence "was based on the certainty of the evidence of all critical and important outcomes, taking into account the relative importance of each outcome to the population of interest", and "was graded as A, B, C, or D (Table 3)". Regarding values and preferences, "No patients or caregivers were involved in the Work Group", and "Formal qualitative evidence synthesis on patient priorities and preferences was undertaken by the Cochrane ERT for the 2021 update, but there was limited evidence available to inform the formulation of guideline recommendations". Resource considerations are explicit: "Healthcare and non-healthcare resources, including all inputs in the treatment management pathway, were considered in grading the strength of a recommendation", including "direct healthcare costs; non-healthcare resources, such as transportation and social services; informal caregiver resources (e.g., time from the family and caregivers); and changes in productivity", and "Economic evaluations, including cost-effectiveness analysis, were not conducted for any of the guideline topics".

Lupus nephritis — Diagnosis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) emphasizes longitudinal surveillance, risk vigilance, and biopsy interpretation: Patients with SLE should be actively and regularly monitored, and a high index of suspicion should be maintained for patients of Asian, African/Caribbean, and Hispanic descent; childhood-onset SLE is associated with a higher incidence of lupus nephritis (LN) and more severe disease than adult-onset SLE. Although a proteinuria level of 500 mg/d is suggested as a threshold for further investigations, clinicians are cautioned that proteinuria severity may appear relatively "insignificant" despite severe active nephritis. Because clinical findings do not always correlate with the extent or severity of kidney involvement, a kidney biopsy is useful to confirm the diagnosis and for the assessment of activity and chronicity features that inform treatment decisions and prognosis. Kidney biopsies should be read by an experienced kidney pathologist and classified according to the International Society of Nephrology (ISN)/Renal Pathology Society (RPS) scheme; electron microscopy, where available, is helpful, and clinicians should pay attention to descriptions that distinguish potentially reversible active lesions from chronic damage not reversible by immunosuppressive medications.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^0b6265c5]. Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis initial therapy — glucocorticoid role and dose minimization: Class III or IV LN is an aggressive disease that requires prompt and effective therapy to abate ongoing injury and destruction of the kidney and nephrons, and glucocorticoids remain an integral component in initial therapy for Class III and IV LN based on their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions. Combined immunosuppressive regimens also facilitate glucocorticoid minimization, thereby reducing their adverse effects. Practice Point 10.2.3.1.1 states that a regimen of reduced-dose glucocorticoids following a short course of methylprednisolone pulses may be considered during the initial treatment of active LN when both the kidney and extrarenal disease manifestations show satisfactory improvement.

Lupus nephritis (LN) maintenance therapy — glucocorticoid tapering and discontinuation: Practice Point 10.2.3.2.2. states that glucocorticoids should be tapered to the lowest possible dose during maintenance, except when glucocorticoids are required for extrarenal lupus manifestations; discontinuation of glucocorticoids can be considered after patients have maintained a complete clinical renal response for ≥ 12 months. Prolonged glucocorticoid exposure is associated with continued and significant organ damage accrual and morbidity, and at the end of the initial phase of treatment, the goal is to have reduced most patients to a daily dose of prednisone (or equivalent) that is ≤ 7.5 mg.

Lupus nephritis preemptive flare treatment — trial evidence: A trial in the Netherlands compared early treatment in patients in complete remission whose proteinuria increased by 30 mg/d and was tapered back to baseline over 18 weeks; after a mean follow-up of < 2 years, 2 major relapses (12.5%, both LN relapses) occurred in the early treatment group, compared to 20 relapses (87%), 7 of which were major (1 kidney relapse), in conventionally managed patients. In a U.S. prospective trial, 41 patients with increases in anti-dsDNA and C3a were randomized to prednisone (30 mg/d tapered ≥ 4 weeks) or placebo; during a shorter follow-up (90 days), none of the patients given prednisone had a severe flare, but 6 placebo patients did, and 3 were kidney-related. Taken together, all of these data suggest that impending LN flares may be preventable, at least for some patients, but larger RCTs of sufficient duration are needed before this approach can be endorsed.

Lupus nephritis — initial therapy for active Class III or Class IV: We recommend that patients with active Class III or IV LN, with or without a membranous component, be treated initially with glucocorticoids plus any one of the following: mycophenolic acid analogs (MPAA) (1B); low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide (1B); belimumab and either MPAA or low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide (1B); or MPAA and a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) when kidney function is not severely impaired. This recommendation places a high value on results from clinical trials demonstrating greater efficacy for initial triple immunosuppressive regimens compared with dual immunosuppressive therapy, as well as triple immunosuppressive regimens that include belimumab or voclosporin (or tacrolimus).

### Differential diagnosis of thrombotic microangiopathy in nephrology [^ffebeace]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of TMA is complex but important to inform treatment decisions. Consensus guidelines for the differential diagnosis of TMA were updated in 2015, however real-world evidence on the current diagnosis and treatment practices has not been reported. We hypothesised that there are areas of uncertainty in the work-up of patients with TMA, leading to potential delays in establishing the final diagnosis, putting patient's lives at a higher risk.

We devised a survey with the objective of understanding current practices in the diagnosis of TMA and aHUS across Europe and the Middle East and challenges when diagnosing the cause of TMA.

### Plasma exchange and glucocorticoid dosing for patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis: a clinical practice guideline [^2b45ede4]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Questions

What is the role of plasma exchange and what is the optimal dose of glucocorticoids in the first 6 months of therapy of patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV)? This guideline was triggered by the publication of a new randomised controlled trial.

Current Practice

Existing guideline recommendations vary regarding the use of plasma exchange in AAV and lack explicit recommendations regarding the tapering regimen of glucocorticoids during induction therapy.

Recommendations

The guideline panel makes a weak recommendation against plasma exchange in patients with low or low-moderate risk of developing end stage kidney disease (ESKD), and a weak recommendation in favour of plasma exchange in patients with moderate-high or high risk of developing ESKD. For patients with pulmonary haemorrhage without renal involvement, the panel suggests not using plasma exchange (weak recommendation). The panel made a strong recommendation in favour of a reduced dose rather than standard dose regimen of glucocorticoids, which involves a more rapid taper rate and lower cumulative dose during the first six months of therapy.

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, a care giver, clinicians, content experts, and methodologists produced these recommendations using GRADE and in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines. The recommendations are based on two linked systematic reviews. The panel took an individual patient perspective in the development of recommendations.

The Evidence

The systematic review of plasma exchange identified nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled 1060 patients with AAV. Plasma exchange probably has little or no effect on mortality or disease relapse (moderate and low certainty). Plasma exchange probably reduces the one year risk of ESKD (approximately 0.1% reduction in those with low risk, 2.1% reduction in those with low-moderate risk, 4.6% reduction in those with moderate-high risk, and 16.0% reduction in those with high risk or requiring dialysis) but increases the risk of serious infections (approximately 2.7% increase in those with low risk, 4.9% increase in those with low-moderate risk, 8.5% increase in those with moderate-high risk, to 13.5% in high risk group) at 1 year (moderate to high certainty). The guideline panel agreed that most patients with low or low-moderate risk of developing ESKD would consider the harms to outweigh the benefits, while most of those with moderate-high or high risk would consider the benefits to outweigh the harms. For patients with pulmonary haemorrhage without kidney involvement, based on indirect evidence, plasma exchange may have little or no effect on death (very low certainty) but may have an important increase in serious infections at 1 year (approximately 6.8% increase, low certainty). The systematic review of different dose regimens of glucocorticoids identified two RCTs at low risk of bias with 704 and 140 patients respectively. A reduced dose regimen of glucocorticoid probably reduces the risk of serious infections by approximately 5.9% to 12.8% and probably does not increase the risk of ESKD at the follow-up of 6 months to longer than 1 year (moderate certainty for both outcomes).

Understanding The Recommendation

The recommendations were made with the understanding that patients would place a high value on reduction in ESKD and less value on avoiding serious infections. The panel concluded that most (50–90%) of fully informed patients with AAV and with low or low-moderate risk of developing ESKD with or without pulmonary haemorrhage would decline plasma exchange, whereas most patients with moderate-high or high risk or requiring dialysis with or without pulmonary haemorrhage would choose to receive plasma exchange. The panel also inferred that the majority of fully informed patients with pulmonary haemorrhage without kidney involvement would decline plasma exchange and that all or almost all (≥ 90%) fully informed patients with AAV would choose a reduced dose regimen of glucocorticoids during the first 6 months of therapy.
