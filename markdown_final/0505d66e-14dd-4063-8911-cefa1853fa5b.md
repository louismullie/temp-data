## Question

recommendations for moderate to serve median nerve compression bilateral wrists found on EMG

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for recommendations on the management of EMG-confirmed moderate to severe bilateral median nerve compression consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging severity with appropriate correlation to symptoms and function. Then, I should rule out alternative or coexisting pathologies and systemic contributors. Next, I'll determine the initial management pathway, including when to proceed directly to surgery versus a time-limited conservative trial. After that, I should plan for bilateral disease, including staged versus simultaneous release. Then, I need to select the surgical technique based on evidence and patient factors. Finally, I should define perioperative and postoperative care, and set up follow-up with outcome monitoring and contingency planning, all grounded in current guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity while aligning electrodiagnostic findings with clinical presentation and functional impact, because isolated test results without symptoms can mislead management decisions. EMG confirming moderate to severe median neuropathy at the carpal tunnel establishes clinically meaningful disease burden, and severity on EMG correlates with a higher likelihood of progressing to surgery and informs prognosis, so I should explicitly document symptom distribution, nocturnal symptoms, weakness, and thenar status, and quantify baseline function with the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire to enable objective reassessment over time [^116TArYz] [^113SciwN].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic adjuncts before over-ordering tests. I should confirm that routine MRI is not recommended for diagnosing CTS, and instead consider neuromuscular ultrasound to measure median nerve cross-sectional area if it will alter management or help with equivocal cases, noting that ultrasound CSA correlates with electrodiagnostic severity and can discriminate moderate to severe disease, while CTS-6 can be used clinically to streamline diagnosis without routine EMG or ultrasound when the presentation is classic and surgery is not yet planned [^111QDixc] [^1126FUWP] [^116L4jyU] [^115ocius].

> Hold on, I should verify bilateral considerations and functional asymmetry because treatment plans often hinge on the hand most limiting activities of daily living. Bilateral CTS is common, occurring in more than half of patients, so I need to assess symmetry of symptoms and EMG severity and prioritize the dominant or more symptomatic side in staged approaches to preserve self-care capacity during recovery [^1175cHhc].

> Next, I should review potential alternative or concomitant pathologies that could confound the picture or attenuate response to standard therapy. I need to check for proximal median nerve compression such as pronator syndrome, cervical radiculopathy, or double-crush phenomena, and screen for systemic contributors like diabetes or hypothyroidism that can influence both symptomatology and outcomes; if there is rapidly progressive weakness or thenar atrophy, I should confirm and expedite surgical evaluation given the risk of irreversible axonal loss [^115PCVVL] [^112RDizr] [^113JAnxi].

> But wait, what if demyelinating features on EMG raise concern for CIDP rather than isolated CTS, especially with prolonged distal motor latency. I should double-check that EFNS/PNS guidance recommends excluding median distal motor latency prolongation due to CTS when interpreting CIDP criteria, to avoid misclassification and ensure the compression neuropathy is addressed appropriately before pursuing immunotherapy pathways [^115DUNkV] [^1116QQao].

> I will now examine the initial management bifurcation, because the evidence differs for moderate versus severe disease. For severe EMG abnormalities with significant functional impairment, thenar weakness or atrophy, or failure of prior conservative care, direct referral for carpal tunnel release is supported by randomized trials and meta-analyses showing superior symptom relief versus nonoperative care at 3 months, with benefits persisting to 6 and 12 months, despite a higher complication rate; patient preference for definitive treatment also weighs in favor of surgery in this context [^114hSouS] [^112XWLmE] [^11461NVt].

> Let me consider a conservative trial for moderate cases, but I need to ensure it is time-limited with predefined endpoints and objective measures. I initially stated 4–6 weeks; hold on, I should verify duration: AAOS 2009 suggests switching strategies if no response within 2 to 7 weeks, whereas AAFP 2016 allows up to 4–6 months for mild to moderate disease, so for EMG-moderate cases in a surgical decision pathway, a pragmatic 4–6 week trial with reassessment using the Boston questionnaire and grip/pinch metrics is reasonable to avoid delaying definitive care if ineffective [^113SciwN].

> Next, I should review effective conservative options and their limits. Night-only neutral wrist splinting is first-line for symptom control in mild to moderate CTS, with evidence favoring neutral position and night wear over continuous wear, and escalation to daytime or MCP inclusion only if night-only fails to control symptoms; a single ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection can provide short-term relief up to about 12 weeks and may serve diagnostically, but it does not confer long-term benefit in moderate to severe disease and should not delay indicated surgery [^1115WCLk] [^11316PSU] [^115x3uDy] [^1167tghp] [^116JUMUK] [^1146QxU3].

> Wait, I should confirm injection technique and safety considerations. Blind ulnar or median approaches risk neurovascular injury given anatomic variability and nerve swelling in CTS, so real-time ultrasound guidance is preferred, and comparative data show no superiority of "above" versus "below" median nerve approaches regarding short-term outcomes, which supports choosing the safer, familiar guided technique [^113oY5FN] [^117YA45m].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adjunct modalities. I need to avoid ineffective or non-beneficial therapies per current guidelines, including oral NSAIDs, diuretics, anticonvulsants, supplements, and acupressure, and I should recognize that therapeutic ultrasound, laser therapy, shockwave therapy, and pulsed radiofrequency do not improve long-term outcomes, reserving other modalities like interferential therapy only for short-term symptom relief with attention to contraindications [^1118VFqY] [^116MtSb9] [^115TEAjW] [^1174V1ea] [^1159wJyf].

> Let me first confirm the reassessment step I mentioned earlier. I should clarify that reassessment should occur at the end of the predefined conservative window, and if there is no clinically meaningful improvement by 4–6 weeks in a moderate case being considered for surgery, I should proceed to surgical consultation to prevent prolonged nerve compression and functional decline [^113SciwN].

> Next, I should review surgical planning for bilateral disease, because functional recovery and caregiving logistics matter. A staged approach is generally preferred, operating first on the dominant or more symptomatic hand and delaying the contralateral side approximately 6–8 weeks to maintain independence in activities of daily living; simultaneous bilateral release may be considered if symptoms are symmetric, support systems are robust, occupational demands permit, and the patient prefers a single anesthetic, noting that direct comparative trials of timing strategies are lacking and decisions rely on functional practicality and shared decision-making.

> I should confirm the choice of surgical technique, integrating guideline recommendations and outcome trade-offs. Mini-open and endoscopic carpal tunnel release yield equivalent patient-reported outcomes, with some evidence that endoscopic release permits about a one-week earlier return to work and improved early grip strength but may have a slightly higher risk of nerve injury; surgeon experience and patient values should guide the selection since no technique is categorically superior across outcomes [^112AXjv2] [^114fwBwv] [^117LfBbp].

> Now, I need to ensure perioperative and postoperative care aligns with evidence to optimize recovery. Local anesthesia alone is appropriate and facilitates efficient care, including the option of office-based release in selected settings, routine postoperative immobilization should be avoided, early active finger motion should be encouraged with a graded return to activities over 2–6 weeks, and hand therapy can be added if stiffness or weakness persists beyond 4–6 weeks, with draping practices individualized per institutional protocol and sterility standards [^111W8CcV] [^114feCCz] [^113SciwN] [^1116GBFq].

> Next, I should review follow-up intervals and outcome monitoring to detect non-responders early. A practical schedule includes a wound check at 2 weeks, functional progress at 6 weeks, and outcome assessment at 3 months using the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire symptom and function scales, with expected success rates of 70–90% after release and recurrence ranging from 3–25% depending on definitions; lack of improvement by 3 months should prompt evaluation for incomplete release, persistent or proximal compression, or alternative diagnoses [^114fwBwv] [^111Mh7r9] [^113JAnxi].

> Hmm, wait a minute, before I conclude, I should reconcile imaging recommendations to avoid mixed messages. Routine MRI is not advised for diagnosing straightforward CTS, whereas in a broader chronic wrist pain workup after normal radiographs, ACR allows ultrasound or MRI as subsequent studies; in a clear CTS phenotype with EMG confirmation, neuromuscular ultrasound can add structural information, but MRI should be reserved for atypical cases or when a mass lesion is suspected [^111QDixc] [^1126FUWP] [^1117iinD].

> Summary recommendation: I need to ensure the plan reflects severity and patient goals. For EMG-confirmed moderate to severe bilateral CTS, I recommend direct surgical referral when severe electrodiagnostic abnormalities coincide with significant symptoms, functional loss, or thenar involvement, with a preference for staged bilateral release starting on the dominant or more symptomatic hand; choose mini-open or endoscopic technique based on surgeon experience and patient preference given equivalent patient-reported outcomes, and limit conservative care in moderate cases to a defined, short trial centered on night-neutral splinting and, if needed, one ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection for short-term relief, while avoiding non-beneficial modalities and reassessing promptly to prevent delays in definitive care [^112XWLmE] [^114hSouS] [^112AXjv2] [^1115WCLk] [^116JUMUK] [^1118VFqY] [^1146QxU3].

---

For moderate-to-severe bilateral median nerve compression at the wrists confirmed on EMG, **start with night-only neutral wrist splints** [^1115WCLk] [^11316PSU] and a single ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection [^117YA45m] for short-term relief [^116JUMUK]. If symptoms persist beyond 6–12 weeks, or if there is thenar atrophy or significant weakness, **proceed to open or endoscopic carpal tunnel release** [^112AXjv2] [^112XWLmE], as both are effective [^114fwBwv]. Avoid oral NSAIDs, diuretics, anticonvulsants [^1118VFqY], and biophysical therapies (ultrasound [^116MtSb9], laser, shockwave, pulsed radiofrequency) [^115TEAjW] because they **lack long-term benefit** [^115TEAjW]. Use ultrasound to assess median nerve cross-sectional area [^1126FUWP] [^116L4jyU] and guide injections; **MRI is not recommended for routine diagnosis** [^111QDixc]. Monitor symptoms and function with the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire [^113SciwN] and nerve conduction studies [^116uuAGH]; refer for surgery if there is no improvement or if function declines.

## Non-surgical management

### Wrist splinting

- **Night-only neutral wrist splints** are first-line for moderate CTS [^1115WCLk] [^1167tghp] [^11316PSU].
- **Daytime or full-time splinting** is reasonable if night-only is insufficient [^115x3uDy] [^1167tghp].
- **Neutral position** minimizes median nerve compression [^114bvt5z] [^116nAKuv].

---

### Corticosteroid injections

A **single ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection [^117YA45m] provides short-term relief** [^116JUMUK], but **injections do not provide long-term benefit** [^1146QxU3].

---

### Activity modification and ergonomics

Modify activities to reduce **repetitive wrist motions and prolonged flexion/extension** [^1115WCLk], and **ergonomic adjustments at work and home can reduce symptoms** [^113JAnxi].

---

### Physical therapy

Nerve gliding exercises may provide **short-term relief** [^115X2ZL9], and **combined orthotic/stretching programs are reasonable in mild-to-moderate CTS** [^115jUCtZ].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **moderate-to-severe CTS** when conservative measures fail or significant functional impairment is present.

---

### Indications for surgery

- **Persistent symptoms despite 6–12 weeks of conservative treatment**.
- **Thenar atrophy or significant weakness** [^116uuAGH].
- **Severe electrodiagnostic abnormalities** [^116uuAGH].

---

### Surgical techniques

**Open carpal tunnel release (OCTR)** is effective with low complication rates [^114fwBwv], while **endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR)** has similar outcomes to OCTR [^112AXjv2] with faster recovery but a higher transient nerve injury risk [^114fwBwv].

---

### Timing of surgery

Early surgery is recommended for **severe cases** or when **conservative treatment fails** [^112XWLmE].

---

## Diagnostic imaging and electrodiagnostic studies

- **Electrodiagnostic studies (NCS/EMG) confirm diagnosis and severity** [^116uuAGH].
- **Ultrasound can assess median nerve cross-sectional area [^1126FUWP] and guide injections**.
- **MRI is not recommended for routine diagnosis** [^111QDixc].

---

## Post-treatment follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should assess **symptom improvement and functional status**. Patient-reported outcomes can be tracked with the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) [^113SciwN]. Nerve conduction studies can monitor nerve function [^116uuAGH].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Conservative treatment is effective for many moderate cases; surgery is recommended for persistent symptoms. Surgery typically provides **significant symptom relief and functional improvement** [^114fwBwv], and recurrence rates after surgery are low (3–25%) [^111Mh7r9].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment** | **Indication** | **Effectiveness** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Night splinting | Moderate CTS | Short-term relief | Compliance issues |
| Corticosteroid injection | Moderate CTS | Short-term relief | No long-term benefit |
| Activity modification | Moderate CTS | Symptom reduction | Compliance issues |
| Physical therapy | Moderate CTS | Short-term relief | Limited evidence |
| Surgery (OCTR/ECTR) | Severe or persistent CTS | Long-term relief | Surgical risks |

---

Moderate-to-severe bilateral median nerve compression should be managed with **conservative measures first**, including night splinting, corticosteroid injections, activity modification, and physical therapy. If symptoms persist or worsen, **surgical intervention is recommended** [^112XWLmE].

In this study, the clinical effectiveness of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection "above" versus "below" the median nerve for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome was compared.

- **Design**: This prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial included 44 patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. The subjects were randomly assigned to two groups to receive an ultrasound-guided injection of 40 mg of triamcinolone either "above" or "below" the involved median nerve. Outcome measures were the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, visual analog scale, electrophysiological tests, and ultrasonographic measurement of the median nerve cross-sectional area at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks after the injection.

- **Results**: All outcome measures improved significantly in both groups at 6 weeks after intervention, and these improvements were preserved up to 12 weeks of follow-up (all P values < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in measured outcomes between the two groups. No adverse effects were observed.

- **Conclusions**: Both above and under median nerve ultrasound-guided steroid injection techniques were effective in reducing the symptoms, improving the function, and improving electrodiagnostic and sonographic findings of carpal tunnel syndrome. However, the amount of improvement in the outcomes did not differ between groups, implying that neither technique has superiority over the other.

Carpal tunnel decompression for carpal tunnel syndrome

Of 50 retrieved citations on carpal tunnel decompression, nine meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials were eligible for the review (fig 2; appendix 5). Publication dates ranged from 2008 to 2019, and AMSTAR scores ranged from 7 to 11 (appendices 6 and 7). Eight of the reviews compared endoscopic or limited incision with open or standard incision carpal tunnel decompression for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. Only one meta-analysis compared surgical versus non-surgical treatment.

In the single meta-analysis that synthesised four randomised controlled trials comparing surgical versus non-surgical treatment (splinting or local corticosteroid injections), surgical treatment was shown to relieve symptoms significantly better than non-surgical treatment; however, surgical treatment was associated with more complications (fig 3). No randomised controlled trials compared carpal tunnel decompression with placebo or no treatment.

- **Comparison between endoscopic versus open carpal tunnel decompression**: The results were discordant across the eight reviews. However, general findings suggested that endoscopic and open release were about as effective as each other in relieving symptoms and improving functional status. Endoscopic release may have functional benefits over the open release regarding return to work and improved grip strength. Some evidence suggested that endoscopic release increased the risk of nerve injury compared with open release. The GRADE quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high.

### Radial nerve compression: anatomical perspective and clinical consequences [^114AmhKz]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

The radial nerve (RN) can establish communicating branches with the sensory nerves of the forearm, the medial and lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerves. It also has connections with the median nerve and its branches. The posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) contributes to the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve, and the superficial branch of the radial nerve (SBRN) communicates with the palmar cutaneous branches of the median nerve.

The typical motor deficits related to RN paralysis depend on the location of the pathology. The symptoms of PIN impairment include disrupted extension of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the thumb and fingers, and the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. This condition is called "finger drop", where normal sensation is retained. Paralysis of the extensor carpi ulnaris results in radial deviation of the wrist during extension. Impairment of wrist extension resulting from RN injury is termed "wrist drop", a symptom indicating weakening of the extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi brevis. High radial nerve entrapment (HRNE), related to neuropathy at higher levels of the RN above the radial groove, can involve the triceps brachii and the anconeus, subsequently leading to impairment of elbow extension. Long-term paralysis of the supplied muscles eventually leads to their atrophy.

The RN can be compressed at multiple locations, from its origin at the brachial plexus to the ends of its terminal branches. Understanding the anatomy of these entrapments is crucial for establishing a correct diagnosis and implementing appropriate treatment. Most RN neuropathies are related to its main trunk in the arm.

### Systematic review of randomized clinical trials of surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome [^111HfxZ5]. The British Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common disorder for which several surgical treatment options are available. However, there is no consensus on the most effective method of treatment. The objective of this systematic review is to compare the efficacy of the various surgical techniques in relieving the symptoms of CTS and promoting return to work and/or activities of daily living.

- **Methods**: Computer-aided searches of Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were conducted, together with reference checking. A rating system, based on the number of studies and their methodological quality and findings, was used to determine the strength of the available evidence for the efficacy of the treatment.

- **Results**: Fourteen studies were included in the review. None of the alternatives to standard open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) seems to offer better relief of symptoms. There is conflicting evidence about whether endoscopic carpal tunnel release results in earlier return to work and/or activities of daily living.

- **Conclusion**: Standard OCTR is still the preferred method of treatment for CTS. It is just as effective as the alternatives, but is technically less demanding, thus incurring a lower risk of complications and additional costs.

### Evidence-based approach to timing of nerve surgery: A review [^115JKt6A]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

In the case of posttraumatic compressive neuropathy, consider exploration with possible release within 8 hours of symptom onset if symptoms persist and/or elevated pressure remains in the affected tunnel/canal at 2 hours after injury. Although long-term changes may develop within this time window according to the literature, clinical symptoms must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Given the lack of consensus and high-quality data, published timing recommendations should be included as part of the clinical decision-making process rather than as a sole determining factor.

In cases of compressive neuropathy secondary to cyst formation, decompression should be considered within 3 months of symptom onset if the patient's symptoms are minimal and nonprogressive. If symptoms progress rapidly and/or the patient has already incurred significant functional deficits, decompression may be performed acutely.

When treating injuries frequently associated with posttraumatic compressive neuropathy, consider the potential for compression during initial treatment planning. For example, different fixation methods in distal radius fractures have been linked to varying rates of posttraumatic carpal tunnel syndrome.

Due to the high variability of postsurgical neuropraxia, even in similar injury/repair patterns, patients with neuropathic symptoms should be closely monitored in the first several weeks postoperatively. At approximately 6 weeks, nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) may further clarify etiology and serve as a base.

### Blood flow velocity but not tendon mechanics relates to nerve function in carpal tunnel syndrome patients [^114bvt5z]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) develops from chronic compression of the median nerve. Chronic compression results in a number of vascular, structural, and functional changes to the carpal tunnel tissues, ultimately manifesting in the characteristic symptoms of CTS. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interplay of median nerve function, median nerve hemodynamics, and finger flexor tendon and subsynovial connective tissue (SSCT) mechanics in CTS patients.

Thirty-five patients were recruited following nerve conduction study for this double-blinded imaging study. Ultrasound B-mode, pulse-wave Doppler, and color Doppler images and videos were collected at the proximal carpal tunnel to quantify: (1) median nerve cross-sectional area, (2) intraneural blood flow velocity in three wrist postures (neutral (0°), flexion (15°), extension (30°)), and (3) flexor digitorum superficialis and SSCT displacement.

Results demonstrate that intraneural blood flow velocity is dependent on median nerve function and wrist posture, such that patients with mild CTS are more susceptible to the effects of non-neutral wrist postures. Tendon-SSCT mechanics do not appear to differ based on severity. This study stresses the importance of limiting exposure to non-neutral wrist postures in patients with early signs of the condition.

### Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Controversies in the diagnosis and management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^113EkxN3]. Hand (2010). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common disorder responsible for considerable patient suffering and cost to health services. Despite extensive research, controversies still exist regarding best practices in diagnosis, treatment, and service provision. Best practice supports the use of history, examination, and electro-diagnostic studies. The role of ultrasound scanning in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is yet to be proven. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appears to play a role when a rare cause of carpal tunnel syndrome is suspected and in detailed anatomical reconstruction to aid endoscopic procedures.

Treatment options can be surgical or non-surgical, with patient choice dictating the decision. For non-surgical interventions, many options have been trialed, but only steroid use, acupuncture, and splinting have shown discernible benefits. Open surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel appears to be simpler and more cost-effective than minimally invasive interventions. For patients who reject surgery, splinting, acupuncture, and steroid injection can play a role.

Recent work examining different service delivery options has shown some positive results in decreasing patient waiting times for definitive treatment. However, no formal cost-effectiveness analysis has been published, and concerns exist about the impact of a streamlined service on surgical training. This review explores the different diagnostic and treatment options for managing carpal tunnel syndrome and considers the different service delivery models.

### Local corticosteroid injection versus surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome [^115b34S3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common clinical condition characterized by signs and symptoms of median nerve irritation within the carpal tunnel in the wrist. The direct and indirect costs of CTS are significant, with surgery in the United States alone estimated at two billion US dollars. Local corticosteroid injection has been utilized as a non-surgical treatment for CTS for many years; however, its effectiveness remains debated.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of corticosteroids injected in or around the carpal tunnel for the treatment of CTS compared to surgery.

- **Search methods**: We employed standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. Our search included the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. The most recent search was conducted on May 26, 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomized trials of adults with CTS that featured at least one comparison group receiving local corticosteroid injection into the wrist and one group undergoing any surgical intervention.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We utilized standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was the improvement in symptoms up to three months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included functional improvement, improvement in symptoms beyond three months, improvement in neurophysiological parameters, improvement in imaging parameters, and enhancement in quality of life.

- **Adverse events**: We applied the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

### Management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^112RDizr]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome affects approximately 3 percent of adults in the United States. Pain and paresthesias in the distribution of the median nerve are the classic symptoms. While Tinel's sign and a positive Phalen's maneuver are classic clinical signs of the syndrome, hypalgesia and weak thumb abduction are more predictive of abnormal nerve conduction studies.

Conservative treatment options include splinting the wrist in a neutral position and ultrasound therapy. Orally administered corticosteroids can be effective for short-term management (two to four weeks), but local corticosteroid injections may improve symptoms for a longer period. A recent systematic review demonstrated that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pyridoxine, and diuretics are no more effective than placebo in relieving the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.

- **Surgical options**: If symptoms are refractory to conservative measures or if nerve conduction studies show severe entrapment, open or endoscopic carpal tunnel release may be necessary.

- **Special populations**: Carpal tunnel syndrome should be treated conservatively in pregnant women because spontaneous postpartum resolution is common.

### Progression from steroid injection to surgery in carpal tunnel syndrome patients with concurrent ulnar nerve compression: A retrospective analysis [^116TArYz]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

Steroid injections are a common treatment option in the management of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). This study assesses various prognostic factors for progression to carpal tunnel release (CTR) following a first-time steroid injection for CTS, with a specific focus on concomitant ulnar nerve compression (UNC).

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective study of 426 hands with CTS treated with a first-time steroid injection in the Long Island region of New York. The main predictor variable was UNC, measured in two analytical models of positive UNC and location of UNC (wrist or elbow). Multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted for demographic, medical, and CTS-related variables for two study outcomes occurring within one year: (1) CTR; and (2) steroid reinjection.

- **Results**: Overall progression to CTR within one year of steroid injection was 23.0%. Ulnar nerve compression was present in 16.7% of patients and was significantly associated with increased odds for CTR, but not with steroid reinjection. These results were further localized to be specific for UNC at the elbow. A moderate or severe result on electrodiagnostic studies was associated with increased odds for CTR. Increased age was associated with slightly increased odds of steroid reinjection, while a history of distal radius fracture was associated with decreased odds of steroid reinjection.

- **Conclusions**: Carpal tunnel syndrome patients with UNC may benefit from earlier definitive treatment with CTR rather than attempting steroid injections, as they are more likely to seek reintervention within one year of their initial injection.

### Splinting for carpal tunnel syndrome [^1167tghp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a compression neuropathy of the median nerve causing pain, numbness, and tingling typically in the thumb, index, and middle finger. It sometimes results in muscle wasting, diminished sensitivity, and loss of dexterity. Splinting the wrist (with or without the hand) using an orthosis is usually offered to people with mild-to-moderate findings, but its effectiveness remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of splinting for people with CTS.

- **Search methods**: On 12 December 2021, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP with no limitations. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials were included if the effect of splinting could be isolated from other treatment modalities. The comparisons included splinting versus no active treatment (or placebo), splinting versus another disease-modifying non-surgical treatment, and comparisons of different splint-wearing regimens. We excluded studies comparing splinting with surgery or one splint design with another. We excluded participants if they had previously undergone surgical release.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, assessed study risk of bias, and evaluated the certainty in the body of evidence for primary outcomes using the GRADE approach, according to standard Cochrane methodology.

### The clinical and cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid injection versus night splints for carpal tunnel syndrome (INSTINCTS trial): an open-label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial [^1175cHhc]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compression neuropathy affecting the upper limb and results from the entrapment of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. It adversely affects daily activities, limits work capacity, and impacts general health and quality of life. In a primary care population, prevalence has been reported to be 36.08 per 10,000 people, with an annual incidence of 19.12 per 10,000 for men and 35.95 per 10,000 for women.

Classically, carpal tunnel syndrome causes discomfort, paraesthesia, and numbness in the median nerve distribution. Nocturnal symptoms are often clinically significant, causing sleep disturbances, and bilateral symptoms occur in more than 50% of patients. In primary care, diagnosis is based on clinical history and examination findings, with electrophysiological diagnostic tests requested by the clinician when a clinical diagnosis cannot be determined and when surgical management is considered for severe cases.

No consensus exists for the best primary care management for mild or moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. Mainstay treatments, supported by clinical guidelines, include night-resting splints and local corticosteroid injection. In severe cases, or those that do not improve with conservative treatment, surgery is considered the treatment of choice.

Systematic review evidence cites two studies, both assessed as low quality, which suggest night splints might be more effective than no active treatment in the short term. Trials of the effectiveness of splints over other non-surgical interventions in the long term are limited.

### Splinting for carpal tunnel syndrome [^115azBzg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition where one of the two main nerves in the wrist is compressed, leading to pain in the hand, wrist, and sometimes the arm, along with numbness and tingling in the thumb, index, and long finger. Splinting is usually offered to people with mild to moderate symptoms; however, the effectiveness and duration of benefit from splinting for this condition remain unknown.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effectiveness of splinting for carpal tunnel syndrome with no treatment, placebo, or another non-surgical intervention.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (January 10, 2011), CENTRAL, NHSEED and DARE (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2012), AMED (January 1985 to January 2012), and CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to January 2012), using no time limits. We searched the reference lists of all included trials and relevant reviews for further relevant studies.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing splinting with no treatment (or a placebo) or with other non-surgical treatments were eligible for inclusion. We also included studies comparing one splint type or regimen versus another. We excluded studies comparing splinting with surgical treatment. There were no language restrictions. We included all patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome unless they had undergone surgical release.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and performed data collection and analysis.

### Prolonged distal motor latency of median nerve does not improve diagnostic accuracy for CIDP [^115DUNkV]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Compression of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel can lead to demyelinating features and result in distal motor latency (DML) prolongation, fulfilling the EFNS/PNS demyelinating criteria for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Since carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is common in the general population, the EFNS/PNS guidelines recommend excluding the DML of the median nerve when DML prolongation may be consistent with median neuropathy at the wrist from CTS.

The main aims of this study were to verify whether the inclusion of DML of the median nerve (when consistent with CTS) could improve electrophysiological diagnostic accuracy for CIDP and if the median nerve at the carpal tunnel was more prone to demyelination. We analyzed electrophysiological data from 499 patients included consecutively into the Italian CIDP Database. According to the EFNS/PNS criteria, 352 patients had a definite diagnosis, 10 a probable diagnosis, and 57 a possible diagnosis of CIDP, while 80 patients did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria. The inclusion of DML prolongation of the median nerve did not significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy for CIDP. Overall, the diagnostic class changed in 6 out of 499 patients (1.2%), and the electrodiagnostic class of CIDP changed from not fulfilling to possible in only 2 patients (2.5% of not-fulfilling patients).

In conclusion, we can infer that excluding DML prolongation of the median nerve does not increase the risk of missing a diagnosis of CIDP, thus corroborating the EFNS/PNS criteria.

### Median nerve ultrasonography in carpal tunnel syndrome: Findings from two laboratories [^117Mbv8h]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Ultrasonographic (US) enlargement of the median nerve at the wrist is known to be consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), although the effects of different measurement techniques, equipment, and patient populations remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the similarities and differences of US findings in CTS between two electromyography (EMG) laboratories. In 2006 and 2007, US measurements of the median nerve were recorded independently and statistically analyzed in patients with CTS at two EMG laboratories (Duke University, Durham, NC, USA, and Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy).

- **Findings**: Patient age, median nerve area in the forearm, and neurophysiologic score did not differ significantly between the two laboratories. The North Carolina group had a larger median nerve area at the wrist and wrist-to-forearm ratio than the Italian group, although both were elevated in reference to established values for the diagnosis of CTS. Median nerve US is less susceptible to differences between laboratories than previously thought, permitting greater generalization of findings.

### Clinical course and prognostic factors in conservatively managed carpal tunnel syndrome: A systematic review [^115q4cTh]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this systematic review was to summarize the available evidence regarding the course of symptoms and prognostic factors in patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) who are treated conservatively.

- **Data sources**: Computerized databases, reference checking, and experts in the field were utilized to identify studies for inclusion in the review.

- **Study selection**: Multiple reviewers identified studies that included adults (aged ≥ 18 years) diagnosed with CTS in either a clinical or population setting. The studies observed the course of CTS over at least a 6-week period in patients receiving no treatment or usual care, which included conservative (nonsurgical) treatments. The design involved longitudinal cohort studies with either prospective or retrospective data collection. There were no language restrictions, and all research was reported beyond just the abstract form.

- **Data extraction**: Methodological bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. A high risk of bias, predominantly relating to study attrition, confounding, and/or statistical analysis and reporting, was judged to be present in eight studies. Designs showed wide variability concerning the characteristics of the included population, definition of CTS, assessment of prognostic factors, types of interventions provided, and types of outcome measures applied. This variability prevented the production of pooled estimates.

- **Data synthesis**: A negative outcome at 3 years' follow-up of conservatively treated participants ranged from 23% to 89%. Four included studies observed the rate of surgical intervention following conservative management.

### Applying evidence to inform carpal tunnel syndrome care [^114qMfRZ]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the most common problems treated by hand surgeons. As our understanding of the condition has improved and the focus on quality and evidence-based care has evolved, the management of CTS has shifted as well. Although, for many patients, the diagnosis and treatment plan are relatively straightforward, understanding how to decide which diagnostics are appropriate, how to avoid complications — especially in high-risk patients — and even which surgical option to offer remains a challenge. As CTS research efforts broaden and available evidence grows, understanding the different research findings in order to implement the evidence into practice is critical for all surgeons. In this article, we approach commonly encountered challenges in CTS management and take a methodological viewpoint to guide evidence-based practice.

### Comparative assessment of seven surgical procedures in carpal tunnel syndrome: a network meta-analysis empowering physician-patient decision-making [^116kqf9k]. Neurosurgical Review (2025).

One of the most prevalent peripheral nerve entrapment syndromes is carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). A recent meta-analysis found that the prevalence of CTS was 14.1% out of 53 million subjects. Females aged 40–60 years are commonly affected with CTS, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:2–5. Also, the incidence rates in the US range from 0.5% to 1.0%. Numbness, paresthesias, discomfort, thenar muscle atrophy, and functional deficiencies including pinch/grip weakness may be experienced by those who are affected. The transverse carpal ligament (TCL) is thought to cause localized compression of the median nerve, which results in the clinical symptoms of CTS. Carpal tunnel release (CTR), corticosteroid injection, and immobilization are appropriate alternatives for managing CTS.

From non-surgical to surgical therapy, there are currently various therapeutic approaches accessible for the diagnosis and treatment of CTS. These approaches have been taken from different angles and with diverse methodologies as there are anatomical variations of the median nerve that may influence symptoms during the operation. Resolving the median nerve's compression condition is the main goal of the surgical procedure. The clinical presentation and physical examination serve as the basis for the diagnosis, which can be verified by electrophysiological testing, particularly electroneuromyography (ENMG), which measures sensory and motor delay as well as conduction abnormalities.

### Non-surgical treatment (other than steroid injection) for carpal tunnel syndrome [^1176Gg4e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Non-surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is frequently offered to those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, the effectiveness and duration of benefit from these treatments remain unknown.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of non-surgical treatment (other than steroid injection) for carpal tunnel syndrome versus placebo or other non-surgical control interventions in improving clinical outcomes.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group specialized register (searched March 2002), MEDLINE (searched January 1966 to February 7, 2001), EMBASE (searched January 1980 to March 2002), CINAHL (searched January 1983 to December 2001), AMED (searched 1984 to January 2002), Contents (January 1993 to March 2002), PEDro, and reference lists of articles.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized studies in any language of participants with a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome who had not previously undergone surgical release were considered. We included all non-surgical treatments apart from local steroid injections. The primary outcome measure was improvement in clinical symptoms at least three months following the end of treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three reviewers independently selected the trials to be included. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Studies were assessed for their overall quality. Relative risks and weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the primary and secondary outcomes in each trial.

### Prolonged distal motor latency of median nerve does not improve diagnostic accuracy for CIDP [^1116QQao]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common nerve entrapment neuropathy worldwide. It results from compression of the median nerve in the narrow passage from the forearm to the hand, formed by the flexor retinaculum and wrist bones. CTS has a prevalence of 50 cases per 1000 people, predominantly affecting females and typically presenting in the fifth or sixth decade of life. The diagnosis of CTS is based on the clinical presentation of relevant symptoms and is supported by electrophysiological findings due to median nerve entrapment at the wrist. Distal motor latency (DML) prolongation, along with sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) slowing or absence of sensory action potential (SAP), is the hallmark of the electrophysiological diagnosis.

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is the most common acquired chronic inflammatory neuropathy, with a prevalence ranging from 0.8 to 8.9 cases per 100,000 people. Diagnosis of CIDP relies on clinical signs and symptoms, confirmed by electrophysiological tests demonstrating peripheral nerve demyelination according to the European Federation of Neurological Societies and Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) criteria. Supportive criteria can assist in the diagnosis.

DML prolongation of ≥ 50% above the upper limit of normal (ULN) is a major EFNS/PNS electrophysiological criterion for diagnosing CIDP. However, compression or entrapment itself, such as in CTS, can present demyelinating features and result in DML prolongation that fulfills EFNS/PNS demyelinating criteria. Accordingly, the EFNS/PNS guidelines recommend excluding the possibility of median nerve entrapment in such cases to avoid diagnostic inaccuracies.

### Surgical treatment options for carpal tunnel syndrome [^115UFacY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common disorder for which several surgical treatment options are available. However, there is no consensus on the most effective method of treatment.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy of various surgical techniques in relieving symptoms and promoting return to work and/or activities of daily living. Additionally, to compare the occurrence of side effects and complications in patients suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome.

- **Search strategy**: We conducted computer-aided searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2000), MEDLINE (searched January 1966-March 2000), and EMBASE (searched January 1988-February 2000), and tracked references in bibliographies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing various surgical techniques for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Study selection, assessment of methodological quality, and data abstraction were performed by two reviewers independently of each other.

- **Main results**: Sixteen studies were included in the review. The methodological quality of the trials was fair to good. However, the application of allocation concealment was mentioned explicitly in only two trials. Many studies failed to present the results in sufficient detail to enable statistical pooling. Pooling was also impeded by the vast variety of outcome measures that were applied in the various studies. None of the existing alternatives to standard open carpal tunnel release seem to offer better relief from symptoms in the short- or long-term.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome [^117LfBbp]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compressive neuropathy of the upper extremity. As a result of median nerve compression, the patient reports pain, weakness, and paresthesias in the hand and digits. The etiology of this condition is multifactorial; anatomic, systemic, and occupational factors have all been implicated.

The diagnosis is based on the patient history and physical examination and is confirmed by electrodiagnostic testing. Treatment methods range from observation and splinting to cortisone injection and splinting, and ultimately to surgical intervention. Both nonsurgical and surgical management provide symptom relief in most patients. The results of open and endoscopic surgery are essentially equivalent at three months; the superiority of one technique over the other has yet to be established.

### Static wrist position associated with least median nerve compression: Sonographic evaluation [^116nAKuv]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the wrist angle that produces the least compression of the median nerve and to evaluate the usefulness of sonography in determining the optimal position.

Seventeen wrists of 17 healthy volunteers underwent dynamic, high-frequency (8 MHz), high-resolution sonography with the wrist splinted at various positions: 15 degrees of flexion, neutral position, and 15 degrees and 30 degrees of extension. The morphologic changes of the median nerve were evaluated with the wrist positioned at these various angles.

The results indicated that the neutral position caused significantly lower compression of the median nerve compared to the other positions. However, in some cases, the lowest pressure was observed when the wrist was fixed at 15 degrees of flexion or 15 degrees of extension. As median nerve compression may decrease the anteroposterior diameter, increase the transverse diameter, and decrease the cross-sectional area, greater anteroposterior diameter, lower flattening ratio (transverse diameter/anteroposterior diameter), and greater cross-sectional area were considered to indicate lower median nerve compression.

The conclusion drawn from this study is that the neutral position of the wrist is generally the best position with the least median nerve compression in most individuals. However, the optimal position may vary from person to person. Sonographic examination can assist in determining the splint position that results in the lowest median nerve compression.

### Clinical and electrodiagnostic testing of carpal tunnel syndrome: A narrative review [^115BUVpv]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a pressure-induced neuropathy that causes sensorimotor disturbances of the median nerve, impairing functional ability. A clear history that elicits relevant personal and work exposures, along with the nature of symptoms, can lead to a high probability of a correct diagnosis. Hand diagrams and diagnostic questionnaires provide structure to this process.

A variety of provocative tests have been described, exhibiting variable accuracy. Phalen's wrist flexion and the carpal compression tests have the highest overall accuracy, while Tinel's nerve percussion test is more specific to axonal damage that may result from moderate to severe CTS. Sensory evaluation — such as light touch, vibration, or perception thresholds — can detect early sensory changes. In contrast, 2-point discrimination changes and thenar atrophy indicate loss of nerve fibers occurring with more severe disease.

Electrodiagnosis can encompass a variety of tests and is commonly used to assess the presence and severity of neuropathic changes and to rule out alternative diagnoses that overlap with CTS in presentation. The pathophysiologic changes occurring with different stages of nerve compression must be considered when interpreting diagnostic test results and predicting response to physical therapy management.

### Anatomical basis of ulnar approach in carpal tunnel injection [^113oY5FN]. Pain Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Local steroid injection may be an effective conservative treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome; however, the use of a blind injection technique can increase the chance of median nerve or ulnar artery injury due to median nerve swelling or the close proximity of the median nerve and ulnar artery around the distal wrist crease.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study is to investigate the relative location of the median nerve and ulnar artery to the palmaris longus (PL) tendon around the wrist in carpal tunnel syndrome.

- **Study design**: An observational study.

- **Setting**: A university outpatient interventional pain management practice in the Republic of Korea.

- **Methods**: Thirty hands of 15 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and 30 hands of 15 healthy subjects were studied. Ultrasonography was performed to determine the relative relationship of the ulnar artery and median nerve to the PL tendon around the wrist.

- **Results**: There were statistically significant differences both in the distance from the medial margin of the PL to the medial end of the median nerve and the distance from the medial end of the median nerve to the lateral end of the ulnar artery at all levels of scanning between the two groups.

- **Limitations**: Limitations include the inclusion of a small number of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.

- **Conclusion**: It is important to recognize the risk of blind local steroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome, which is most likely a result of swelling and/or flattening of the median nerve around the distal wrist crease. A real-time, ultrasound-guided local steroid injection is recommended to mitigate this risk.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: Diagnosis and management [^116uuAGH]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome, the most common entrapment neuropathy of the upper extremity, is caused by compression of the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel. Classically, patients with the condition experience pain and paresthesias in the distribution of the median nerve, which includes the palmar aspect of the thumb, index and middle fingers, and radial half of the ring finger. Additional clues include positive physical examination findings, such as the flick sign, Phalen maneuver, and median nerve compression test. Although patients with typical symptoms and signs of carpal tunnel syndrome do not need additional testing, ultrasonography and electrodiagnostic studies are useful to confirm the diagnosis in atypical cases and rule out other causes. If surgical decompression is planned, electrodiagnostic studies should be obtained to determine severity and surgical prognosis.

Conservative treatment may be offered initially to patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. Options include splinting, corticosteroids, physical therapy, therapeutic ultrasound, and yoga. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, and vitamin B6 are not effective therapies. Local corticosteroid injection can provide relief for more than one month and delay the need for surgery at one year. Patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome or whose symptoms have not improved after four to six months of conservative therapy should be offered surgical decompression. Endoscopic and open techniques are equally effective, but patients return to work an average of one week earlier with endoscopic surgery.

### Diagnosis and management of carpal tunnel syndrome during pregnancy [^1111G9MA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) represents a constellation of symptoms that can occur as a result of compression of the median nerve as it traverses through a constrained space at the level of the wrist. It is the most common compressive mononeuropathy in the human body. Patients frequently present with similar history and physical examination findings, most commonly consisting of numbness of the hand that is worse at nighttime. Although CTS is one of the more common conditions seen by hand, orthopedic, or plastic surgeons, patients often first report symptoms to their primary or obstetric care clinician. In this review, we describe the pathophysiology of CTS in pregnant patients, summarize the best methods for diagnosing this condition, and review the recommended treatment options. This review provides a practical strategy that can be used by both primary care and obstetric care clinicians in diagnosing and treating pregnant patients with CTS.

### Local corticosteroid injection versus placebo for carpal tunnel syndrome [^116JUMUK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a very common clinical condition characterized by signs and symptoms of irritation of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel in the wrist. The direct and indirect costs of CTS are substantial, with estimated costs of two billion US dollars for CTS surgery in the United States in 1995 alone. Local corticosteroid injection has been used as a non-surgical treatment for CTS for many years, but its effectiveness remains debated.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of corticosteroids injected in or around the carpal tunnel for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome compared to no treatment or a placebo injection.

- **Search methods**: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The searches were conducted on 7 June 2020 and 26 May 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomized trials of adults with CTS that included at least one comparison group receiving a local injection of corticosteroid (LCI) into the wrist and one group that received a placebo or no treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was improvement in symptoms at up to three months of follow-up. Our secondary outcomes included functional improvement, improvement in symptoms at greater than three months of follow-up, improvement in neurophysiological parameters, improvement in imaging parameters, requirement for carpal tunnel surgery, and improvement in quality of life. Adverse events were also assessed using GRADE to determine the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

### Local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome [^114eCNns]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a clinical syndrome characterized by signs and symptoms of irritation of the median nerve at the wrist's carpal tunnel level. Local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome has been studied, but its effectiveness and duration of benefit remain unknown.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of local steroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome versus placebo injection or other non-surgical interventions in improving clinical outcomes and to determine the length of symptom relief.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group register (searched June 2002), MEDLINE (searched January 1966 to May 2002), EMBASE (searched January 1980 to May 2002), and CINAHL (searched January 1982 to May 2002).

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized or quasi-randomized studies of participants with carpal tunnel syndrome treated with local corticosteroid injection. The primary outcome measure was clinical improvement.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three reviewers independently selected the trials to be included and rated them for overall quality. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each trial, and summary relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated.

- **Main results**: We identified nine randomized controlled trials; four were excluded. One trial demonstrated clinical improvement of carpal tunnel syndrome at one month following local corticosteroid compared to placebo injection (relative risk 3.83 (95% confidence interval)).

### Splinting vs surgery in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome: a randomized controlled trial [^114hSouS]. JAMA (2002). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) can be treated with nonsurgical or surgical options, yet there is no consensus on the most effective method of treatment.

- **Objective**: To compare the short-term and long-term efficacy of splinting and surgery for relieving the symptoms of CTS.

- **Design, Setting, and Patients**: A randomized controlled trial was conducted from October 1998 to April 2000 at 13 neurological outpatient clinics in the Netherlands. A total of 176 patients with clinically and electrophysiologically confirmed idiopathic CTS were assigned to either wrist splinting during the night for at least 6 weeks (89 patients) or open carpal tunnel release (87 patients). A total of 147 patients (84%) completed the final follow-up assessment 18 months after randomization.

- **Main Outcome Measures**: General improvement, number of nights waking up due to symptoms, and severity of symptoms.

- **Results**: In the intention-to-treat analyses, surgery was more effective than splinting on all outcome measures. The success rates (based on general improvement) after 3 months were 80% for the surgery group (62/78 patients) compared to 54% for the splinting group (46/86 patients), which is a difference of 26% (95% confidence interval, 12%-40%; p < 0.001). After 18 months, the success rates increased to 90% for the surgery group (61/68 patients) compared to 75% for the splinting group (59/79 patients), which is a difference of 15% (95% CI, 3%-27%; p = 0.02). However, by that time, 41% of patients (32/79) in the splint group had also received the surgery treatment.

- **Conclusion**: Treatment with open carpal tunnel release surgery resulted in superior outcomes compared to splinting.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome [^112XWLmE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist. Surgery is considered when symptoms persist despite the use of non-surgical treatments. It is unclear whether surgery produces a better outcome than non-surgical therapy. This review updates a Cochrane review initially published in 2008.

- **Objectives**: To assess the evidence regarding the benefits and harms of carpal tunnel release compared with non-surgical treatment in the short term (3 months).

- **Search methods**: In this update, we included studies from the previous version of this review and searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP until 18 November 2022. We also checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing any surgical technique with any non-surgical therapies for CTS.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: The 14 included studies randomized 1231 participants (1293 wrists). Eighty-four percent of participants were women. The mean age ranged from 32 to 53 years, and the mean duration of symptoms ranged from 31 weeks to 3.5 years. Trial sizes varied from 22 to 176 participants. The studies compared surgery with splinting, corticosteroid injection, splinting and corticosteroid injection, platelet-rich plasma injection, manual therapy, multimodal non-operative treatment, and unspecified medical treatment.

### Treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome [^113SciwN]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

In September 2008, the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons approved a clinical practice guideline on the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome, which was subsequently endorsed by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

The guideline makes nine specific recommendations:

- **Nonsurgical treatment options**: A course of nonsurgical treatment is an option for patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome.

- **Early surgery considerations**: Early surgery is an option with clinical evidence of median nerve denervation or when the patient elects.

- **Treatment failure responses**: Another nonsurgical treatment or surgery is suggested when the treatment fails to resolve symptoms within 2 to 7 weeks.

- **Lack of evidence for comorbidities**: Sufficient evidence is not available to provide specific treatment recommendations for carpal tunnel syndrome associated with conditions such as diabetes mellitus and coexistent cervical radiculopathy.

- **Pre-surgery options**: Local steroid injection or splinting is suggested before considering surgery. Oral steroids or ultrasound are options as well.

- **Surgical recommendations**: Carpal tunnel release is recommended as a treatment, whereas heat therapy is not among the options to be used. Surgical treatment by complete division of the flexor retinaculum is recommended. Routine use of skin nerve preservation and epineurotomy is not suggested when carpal tunnel release is performed.

- **Preoperative and postoperative considerations**: Prescribing preoperative antibiotics for carpal tunnel surgery is an option. It is suggested that the wrist not be immobilized postoperatively after routine carpal tunnel surgery.

It is suggested that instruments such as the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire be used for further management and assessment.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome [^11461NVt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome results from entrapment of the median nerve in the wrist. Common symptoms include tingling, numbness, and pain in the hand that may radiate to the forearm or shoulder. Most symptomatic cases are treated non-surgically.

The objective is to compare the efficacy of surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome with non-surgical treatment.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (January 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2008), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2008), and LILACS (January 1982 to January 2008). We checked bibliographies in papers and contacted authors for information about other published or unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing any surgical and any non-surgical therapies.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of the trials.

- **Main results**: In this update, we found four randomized controlled trials involving 317 participants in total. Three of them, including 295 participants — 148 allocated to surgery and 147 to non-surgical treatment — reported information on our primary outcome (improvement at three months of follow-up). The pooled estimate favored surgery (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.46). Two trials, including 245 participants, described the outcome at six-month follow-up, also favoring surgery (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.39). Two trials reported clinical improvement at one-year follow-up. They included 198 patients favoring surgery (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to…

### Pronator syndrome and other nerve compressions that mimic carpal tunnel syndrome [^115PCVVL]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this clinical commentary is to provide a comprehensive review of compressive neuropathies that may mimic carpal tunnel syndrome, provide the clinician with information to differentially diagnose these median nerve compression sites, and provide an evidence-based opinion regarding conservative intervention techniques for the various compression syndromes. While rare in comparison to carpal tunnel syndrome, pronator syndrome and anterior interosseous nerve syndrome are proximal median nerve compressions that may be suspected if a patient with carpal tunnel syndrome fails to respond to conservative or surgical intervention. Differential diagnosis is based largely on the symptoms, patterns of paresthesia, and specific patterns of muscle weakness.

Due to the relative rarity of pronator syndrome and anterior interosseous nerve syndrome, few controlled studies exist to determine the most effective treatment techniques. Based on sound anatomical and biomechanical considerations, anecdotal experience, and available research, treatment strategies for pronator syndrome and anterior interosseous nerve syndrome compression neuropathies can be divided into four major categories:

1. **Rest/immobilization**: This involves providing rest to the affected area and immobilizing it to prevent further strain.
2. **Modalities**: This includes using various therapeutic modalities to alleviate symptoms.
3. **Nerve gliding**: Techniques aimed at promoting nerve flexibility and reducing symptoms.
4. **Nonconservative treatment**: Options that may include surgical interventions when conservative measures are ineffective.

### Management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^115BFqpv]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) has developed Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for the management of carpal tunnel syndrome. Evidence-based information, combined with the clinical expertise of physicians, was utilized to develop these criteria to improve patient care and achieve the best outcomes while considering the nuances necessary for clinical decision-making.

To provide the evidence foundation for this AUC, the AAOS Evidence-Based Medicine Unit supplied the writing and voting panels with the 2016 AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline titled "Management of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline". The Management of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome AUC clinical patient scenarios were derived from typical indications of patients with suspected carpal tunnel syndrome in clinical practice, as well as from evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and supporting literature to determine the appropriateness of treatments.

The writing panel, a group of clinicians specializing in this AUC topic, developed 135 patient scenarios and six treatments. Subsequently, a separate, multidisciplinary voting panel, comprised of specialists and non-specialists, rated the appropriateness of treatment for each patient scenario using a 9-point scale, classifying treatments as Appropriate (median rating, 7 to 9), May Be Appropriate (median rating, 4 to 6), or Rarely Appropriate (median rating, 1 to 3).

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: Carpal tunnel syndrome [^117PvsvK]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for carpal tunnel syndrome, particularly concerning post-treatment assessment, the AHUEPT/AOPT 2019 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of the following tests for assessing clinical change in patients following carpal tunnel release surgery: the Purdue Pegboard test, the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function test, and the Nine-Hole Peg test.

### Radial nerve compression: anatomical perspective and clinical consequences [^1161UNrw]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

No reliable electrodiagnostic findings can help to establish a single diagnosis of RTS because there is no motor denervation. The syndrome is not detectable by pathophysiological or electrodiagnostic tests. There are no observable abnormalities in electromyography or nerve conduction tests in RTS. However, electromyography is considered helpful for ruling out cervical radiculopathy and detecting denervation or abnormalities in the motor units.

Owing to the difficulties in diagnosing RTS, including inconclusive electrodiagnostic studies and problems with the anatomical aspect of the syndrome, Loh et al. proposed the "rule of nine test". The proximal surface of the forearm is covered with a square divided into nine equal, smaller squares comprising three columns and three rows. Depending on the position of the radial nerve bifurcation, the PIN in the radial tunnel should be located under the proximal two or three squares of the lateral column (Fig. 5). In all squares, a tenderness test should be performed to identify the true origin of the symptoms and exclude other closely related pathologies such as lateral epicondylitis.

- **Figure details**: Course of the radial and median nerves in the nine zones, RN radial nerve, MN median nerve.

The outcome of surgical decompression for RTS is unpredictable; 67% of patients who underwent release surgery had good long-term results (minimal or no discomfort), 15% had fair results (symptoms improved but with moderate pain limiting activities), and 18% had poor results (pain did not allow normal activities to be resumed). Concomitant compressive neuropathies make the prognosis more uncertain.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management [^113JAnxi]. The Lancet. Neurology (2016).

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome worldwide. The clinical symptoms and physical examination findings in patients with this syndrome are widely recognized, and various treatments exist, including non-surgical and surgical options. Despite these advantages, there is a paucity of evidence about the best approaches for assessing carpal tunnel syndrome and guiding treatment decisions. More objective methods for assessment, including electrodiagnostic testing and nerve imaging, provide additional information about the extent of axonal involvement and structural change, but their exact benefit to patients is unknown.

Although the best means of integrating clinical, functional, and anatomical information for selecting treatment choices has not yet been identified, patients can be diagnosed quickly and respond well to treatment. The high prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome, its effects on quality of life, and the cost that the disease burden generates to health systems make it important to identify the research priorities that will be resolved in clinical trials.

### Meta-synthesis of carpal tunnel syndrome treatment options: Developing consolidated clinical treatment recommendations to improve practice [^111m8iMc]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) treatment contains ambiguities across and within disciplines. This meta-synthesis of professional guidelines consolidates clinical treatment recommendations for CTS treatment and classifies them by strength of evidence. We conducted a search of Google, Google Scholar, and PubMed for published clinical treatment recommendations for CTS. A systematic hand search was completed to identify additional professional organizations with published recommendations.

We extracted any mentioned treatment from all sources but developed our final consolidated clinical treatment recommendations only from select rigorous guidelines based on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) criteria for trustworthy guidelines. We translated rating systems of the primary guidelines into a universal rating system to classify recommendations for consolidated clinical treatment recommendations.

Our search yielded 30 sources that mentioned a total of 55 CTS treatments. Six of the sources met the IOM inclusion criteria. These primary guidelines provided recommendations for 46 of the 55 treatments, which were consolidated into 12 broad treatment categories. Surgery, positioning, and steroids were strongly supported. Conservative treatments provided by rehabilitation professionals were conditionally supported. Pharmaceuticals, supplements, and alternative treatments were not generally supported.

CTS is a complex condition with a wide variety of treatments provided by a multitude of disciplines. Our consolidated clinical treatment recommendations offer a comprehensive outline of available treatments.

### Outcomes of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome treatment - A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1133pwrK]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the predominant compressive neuropathy among adults worldwide. However, evidence regarding treatment alternatives and their outcomes, especially with bilateral carpus involvement, is inconclusive. To analyze the clinical and surgical outcomes of bilateral CTS treatment using the visual analog scale (VAS) and Boston questionnaire, a systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines.

After evaluating 129 articles from different databases, nine papers with low bias risk were included in the study. These studies were assessed for methodological quality, both in scale and degree, ensuring bias identification and independence of data extraction. Eligible articles were those in Portuguese, Spanish, and English, with no publication time limit. The outcomes assessed were the standardized mean differences (SMDs) on the symptom severity scale (SSS), functional state scale (FSS), and VAS.

- **Clinical treatment outcomes**: A positive effect was observed on the SSS (SMD: 0.53), FSS (SMD: 0.47), and VAS (SMD decrease: 2.52) at the one-month follow-up.

- **Surgical treatment outcomes**: A positive effect was observed on the SSS (SMDs: 1.97 for endoscopic and 1.55 for open surgery), FSS (SMDs: 1.52 for endoscopic and 1.77 for open surgery), and VAS (SMDs: 2.19 for endoscopic and 2.59 for open surgery) at the one-month follow-up.

Significant improvements in VAS, SSS, and FSS were observed at the three-month follow-up. Evidence in both clinical and surgical treatments demonstrates their effectiveness, as they potentially improve symptom severity and functional outcomes.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: Physical therapy or surgery [^112g8AFC]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome causes pain, numbness, and weakness in the wrist and hand. Nearly 50% of all work-related injuries are linked to carpal tunnel syndrome, making individuals with this condition more likely to miss work. Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome can be treated with either physical therapy or surgery. Although surgery may be considered when symptoms are severe, more than a third of patients do not return to work within 8 weeks after the operation. Given the potential side effects and risks associated with surgery, patients often inquire if they might try physical therapy first. An article in the March 2017 issue of JOSPT assesses the effectiveness of therapy and surgery in treating carpal tunnel syndrome.

- **Search strategy and study selection**: The following databases were searched: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and SportDiscus on September 13, 2016, and repeated on January 3, 2020 (refer to the search strategy). Included full-text articles were:
	1. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing different postoperative splinting protocols in DWG excision patients.
	2. Any other RCT, observational study, or case series specifying a postoperative care protocol for DWG excision patients.

	- **Articles were excluded if they demonstrated any of the following**: an entirely pediatric population, nonsurgically managed DWG, case studies, and non-English articles. All outcomes were considered, including grip strength, range of motion, pain, quality of life, and recurrence rates.

- **Data abstraction and collection**: Studies were screened by three independent reviewers. Reviewers conducted a pilot screen of the titles and abstracts of the first 50 articles to practice applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once consistency was established, title and abstract screening was completed, and authors proceeded with full-text review of the identified studies. In the case of disagreement, the senior author was consulted. Interrater agreement for both review phases was calculated using an unweighted kappa statistic.

### Ultrasound measurements of the median nerve at the distal wrist crease correlate with electrodiagnostic studies [^116L4jyU]. Hand (2023). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common nerve entrapment neuropathy and is commonly evaluated using electrodiagnostic studies (EDSs). Ultrasound (US) has emerged as a potentially easier and more comfortable alternative to EDSs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether measurements of the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve via US correlate with the severity rating of CTS based on EDSs.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of patients aged 18 years or older who underwent US and EDSs of the median nerve for CTS was performed. Sensory nerve action potential, distal motor latency, and compound muscle action potential were measured, and severity was graded on American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine guidelines. Cross-sectional area of the median nerve was measured via US at the wrist crease.

- **Results**: There was a significant association between increasing CSA and increasing EDS severity (P < .0001). The mean CSA for normal, mild, moderate, and severe CTS was 7.48 ± 2.00, 10.36 ± 2.53, 12.01 ± 3.64, and 14.34 ± 4.77 mm², respectively. The area under the curve demonstrated the ability of median nerve CSA to discriminate between normal and abnormal EDSs with an optimal cutoff CSA of ≥ 10 mm², as well as the ability to discriminate between mild CTS and moderate to severe CTS at a cutoff CSA of greater than or equal to 12 mm². The results of this study show that US measurements of the median nerve at the distal wrist crease discriminate between normal and abnormal EDSs, and between mild CTS and moderate to severe CTS effectively.

### Local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome [^114Rf2yq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a clinical syndrome characterized by signs and symptoms of irritation of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel in the wrist. The effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome has been studied but remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of local corticosteroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome versus placebo injection or other non-surgical interventions.

- **Search strategy**: We conducted searches in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (searched May 2006), MEDLINE (searched January 1966 to May 2006), EMBASE (searched January 1980 to May 2006), and CINAHL (searched January 1982 to May 2006).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized studies were considered.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three authors independently selected the trials and assessed their overall quality. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each trial, along with summary relative risks and 95% confidence intervals.

- **Main results**: We included 12 studies involving a total of 671 participants. Two high-quality randomized controlled trials with a combined total of 141 participants showed clinical improvement in carpal tunnel syndrome at one month or less following local corticosteroid injection compared to placebo injection (relative risk 2.58 with 95% confidence intervals of 1.72 to 3.87). One trial compared local corticosteroid injection to oral corticosteroid, and at 12 weeks post-treatment, there was significantly more improvement in the injection group (mean difference -7.10 with 95% confidence intervals of -11.68 to -2.52).

### Carpal tunnel syndrome: A review of the recent literature [^111Mh7r9]. The Open Orthopaedics Journal (2012). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on carpal tunnel syndrome:

- **Definition**: CTS is a condition characterized by symptomatic compressive neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist.

- **Pathophysiology**: CTS is caused by compression and traction of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, either due to idiopathic causes or secondary to fibrous hypertrophy of the synovial flexor sheath or due to repetitive movements of the wrist.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence and incidence of CTS in the United States are 7.8% and 2.3 per 100 person-years, respectively.

- **Disease course**: The combination of increased pressure in the tunnel, median nerve microcirculation injury, median nerve connective tissue compression, and synovial tissue hypertrophy results in altered function of the nerve, demyelination, and degeneration of the nerve at the site of compression and beyond. These events cause paresthesias, weakness, and loss of function in the distal distribution of the median nerve (thumb, index, middle finger, and the radial side of the ring finger) and even outside the distribution of the median nerve.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Carpal tunnel release is effective in 70–90% of patients. The recurrence rate after carpal tunnel release varies from 3–25%.
