## Question

Mechanisms of acute pancreatitis in hepatocellular carcinoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the mechanisms by which acute pancreatitis occurs in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, including how to think about causality, diagnostic workup, and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline epidemiology and pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify the HCC-specific mechanisms that plausibly trigger pancreatitis. Next, I will examine indirect contributors and confounders that can mimic or amplify pancreatitis risk in HCC. After that, I need to check the strength of evidence and distinguish association from causation. Finally, I will outline a pragmatic diagnostic approach and management considerations, making sure to flag areas of uncertainty and where guidelines can guide testing and treatment decisions.

> Let me first confirm the baseline context of acute pancreatitis so I don't jump to conclusions. Acute pancreatitis is most commonly due to gallstones and alcohol, with other causes including hypertriglyceridemia, drugs, trauma, infection, and autoimmune disease; the core pathophysiology involves premature intrapancreatic enzyme activation, acinar injury, and a systemic inflammatory response that can progress to organ failure, which frames how we interpret atypical triggers in HCC patients [^113fmCbj] [^1152nrCA].

> Now, I will examine the most direct HCC-related mechanism: ischemic pancreatitis from transarterial embolization. Wait, let me verify the frequency and severity. Non-target embolization during TACE/TAE can occlude pancreaticoduodenal collaterals or rarely the dorsal pancreatic artery, producing ischemic pancreatitis; although uncommon, it is a recognized complication in NCCN guidance and has been reported as fatal in case literature, so I should treat this as a plausible and clinically important mechanism in HCC patients undergoing embolization [^112zUQUV] [^1127RPmc].

> Next, I should review immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated pancreatitis, because many HCC patients receive PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Hold on, I should verify incidence and management. Immune-mediated pancreatitis is rare but documented; when suspected, serum amylase and lipase should be checked and treatment is with corticosteroids or other immunosuppression with close monitoring, and guidelines emphasize vigilance for irAEs in cirrhosis where baseline liver disease can confound the picture, so I need to ensure I don't misattribute enzyme elevations to hepatic injury alone [^113CVhyC] [^114RUj22].

> I will now consider drug-induced pancreatitis from systemic HCC therapies. Let me check the label data. Sorafenib has been associated with clinical pancreatitis in a small number of patients in the SHARP trial and subsequent labeling, and incretin-based agents like liraglutide and sitagliptin carry pancreatitis warnings with postmarketing reports, so in HCC patients who also have diabetes or are on combination regimens, medication attribution must be weighed carefully after excluding more common causes [^114r9qSf] [^116ynGDX] [^113j5uTC] [^113gRmvv].

> But wait, what if the pancreatitis is actually biliary obstruction from HCC-related biliary disease masquerading as pancreatitis. HCC can compress or infiltrate the biliary tree, causing cholestasis and secondary biliary pancreatitis; endoscopic interventions for malignant biliary obstruction carry their own pancreatitis risk, and post-ERCP pancreatitis rates may be higher in advanced liver disease, so I should double-check for biliary dilation on imaging and consider MRCP/EUS before ERCP when appropriate to mitigate procedural risk [^112kiP78] [^112z8aXn] [^114P5sJe].

> Next, I should review indirect contributors that lower the threshold for pancreatitis in HCC. Cirrhosis-related coagulopathy and portal hypertension can worsen pancreatic microcirculatory disturbances, and obesity and metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, which are common in HCC cohorts, independently increase pancreatitis risk. Hypertriglyceridemia, whether metabolic or drug-induced, can also precipitate pancreatitis, so I need to check fasting triglycerides when gallstones and alcohol are absent [^117SD3Pe] [^111xYw48].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. Much of the HCC–pancreatitis link is mechanistically plausible and supported by case reports, small series, and guideline acknowledgments, but high-quality epidemiologic data quantifying risk are limited. Pancreatitis is not a hallmark of HCC per se, and most cases likely reflect iatrogenic, drug-related, or biliary mechanisms rather than a direct oncogenic effect of HCC on the pancreas, so I should frame this as association with identifiable triggers rather than a primary paraneoplastic phenomenon [^112zUQUV] [^113CVhyC] [^112UsrTQ].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic approach is disciplined. I should confirm acute pancreatitis with two of three criteria — characteristic pain, lipase or amylase greater than three times the upper limit of normal, or imaging findings — and then systematically exclude common causes before attributing to HCC-specific mechanisms; in patients over 40 with no clear etiology, I should consider pancreatic tumor as a cause and, if gallstones are not present, obtain fasting triglycerides; MRCP or EUS can help detect occult choledocholithiasis or biliary obstruction and should precede diagnostic ERCP when feasible [^111wfzKF] [^112MeiVc] [^111xYw48] [^114P5sJe] [^116FJwKS].

> Let me think about management implications specific to HCC. If immune-mediated pancreatitis is suspected, I should promptly start corticosteroids and taper slowly after control, with close monitoring for recurrence. If drug-induced pancreatitis is likely, the offending agent should be held. If ischemic pancreatitis is suspected after embolization, supportive care and early recognition are key. And if biliary pancreatitis is present, timely biliary decompression is indicated, ideally after stabilizing the patient and using the least invasive route, consistent with acute pancreatitis and malignant biliary obstruction guidance [^112k4hjq] [^113CVhyC].

> Finally, I should double-check preventive and risk-mitigation steps in HCC care that intersect with pancreatitis risk. Superselective TACE targeting tumor feeders and post-procedural pancreatic enzyme monitoring can reduce unrecognized ischemic pancreatitis, and in patients with cirrhosis undergoing biliary interventions, careful patient selection and prophylaxis strategies may mitigate post-ERCP pancreatitis; when multiple risk factors coexist, individualized risk–benefit discussions are warranted before initiating or continuing therapies with known pancreatic toxicity signals [^1127RPmc] [^112z8aXn] [^112UsrTQ].

Acute pancreatitis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare and most often **iatrogenic** — particularly after TACE/TAE [^112zUQUV] due to non-target embolization [^112zUQUV] or ischemia [^1127RPmc] — or due to **immune checkpoint inhibitors** [^113CVhyC] via immune-mediated injury. Other mechanisms include biliary obstruction from tumor compression or infiltration [^112kiP78], hypertriglyceridemia from systemic therapy, and direct tumor invasion or metastasis to the pancreas. Management centers on supportive care, stopping the offending therapy [^115JdttD], and treating complications; prognosis depends on severity [^114yiCYe] and underlying liver function [^112zUQUV].

---

## Iatrogenic mechanisms

### Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and transarterial embolization (TAE)

- **Non-target embolization**: Embolic material can inadvertently occlude pancreatic arteries (e.g. dorsal pancreatic artery), causing ischemic pancreatitis [^112zUQUV] [^1127RPmc].

- **Post-embolization syndrome**: Transient pancreatitis-like symptoms (abdominal pain, elevated enzymes) are common after TACE/TAE and can mimic or precipitate true pancreatitis [^112zUQUV].

- **Direct pancreatic injury**: Catheter manipulation or embolic reflux can cause direct pancreatic trauma or ischemia [^1127RPmc].

---

### Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)

Immune-mediated injury from ICIs (e.g. nivolumab, pembrolizumab) can cause **immune-mediated pancreatitis**, typically managed with corticosteroids [^113CVhyC]. The **incidence is low** but clinically significant, requiring prompt recognition and immunosuppression [^113CVhyC].

---

## Tumor-related mechanisms

### Biliary obstruction

Biliary obstruction from **direct tumor invasion** of the biliary tree or compression of the common bile duct can cause reflux of bile acids into the pancreatic duct, triggering pancreatitis [^notfound]. Obstruction-related **cholestasis** increases biliary pressure and reflux, further aggravating pancreatic inflammation [^notfound].

---

### Hypertriglyceridemia

Hypertriglyceridemia may be induced by systemic therapies or metabolic derangements in HCC and can precipitate **triglyceride-induced pancreatitis** [^111xYw48].

---

### Direct tumor invasion or metastasis

Direct tumor invasion or metastasis can involve the pancreas, causing **parenchymal inflammation** and structural disruption.

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Diagnostic approach**: Acute pancreatitis in HCC is diagnosed using standard criteria (clinical symptoms, elevated pancreatic enzymes, imaging) [^111wfzKF], with careful exclusion of other causes (gallstones, alcohol, hypertriglyceridemia) [^111xYw48].

- **Management**: Supportive care (fluid resuscitation, analgesia, nutritional support) [^114yiCYe], cessation of offending therapy (e.g. ICIs), and targeted treatment of complications (e.g. biliary drainage for obstruction) are essential [^112k4hjq].

- **Prognosis**: Severity and outcomes depend on the underlying liver function, tumor burden, and timeliness of intervention [^112zUQUV].

---

Acute pancreatitis in HCC is uncommon and usually **secondary to treatment** or tumor-related complications. Recognizing these mechanisms enables early diagnosis and targeted management, improving outcomes.

### The etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma and consequences for treatment [^116a2tLP]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have liver cirrhosis, which develops following long periods of chronic liver disease. Cirrhosis is characterized by a decrease in hepatocyte proliferation, indicating an exhaustion of the regenerative capacity of the liver, and results in an increase in fibrous tissue and a destruction of liver cells, which may ultimately lead to the development of cancerous nodules. Half of all cases of HCC are associated with hepatitis B virus infection, with a further 25% associated with hepatitis C virus. Other risk factors for developing HCC include alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, intake of aflatoxin-contaminated food, diabetes, and obesity. There are multiple factors involved in the etiology of HCC, all of which have a direct impact on patient characteristics and disease course, and although a causative agent can often be identified, HCC remains an extremely complex condition associated with a poor prognosis. Additionally, the geographic variation in etiology means that information from different countries is needed in order to optimize surveillance methods and develop effective chemoprevention strategies. Unfortunately, there are still many gaps in our current understanding, and further research efforts are needed to fully elucidate the diverse mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of HCC and offer optimal prevention strategies for those at risk.

### The association of coffee intake with liver cancer risk is mediated by biomarkers of inflammation and hepatocellular injury: data from the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition [^114mg69t]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

The potential hepatoprotective effects of coffee may represent another main mechanism behind its inverse relation with HCC risk. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between abnormally high liver enzyme concentrations and cancer incidence and mortality. Coffee consumption has been consistently associated with improved serum enzyme concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. In particular, our data point to the role of AST and GGT as the 2 biomarkers that explain the highest proportion of the inverse association between coffee intake and HCC risk. In clinical practice, augmentation in AST concentrations has been used to indicate the presence of hepatocellular-predominant disorders, whereas increases in GGT have been related to cholestatic-predominant diseases; therefore, coffee seems to be implicated in both of these pathologies. In addition, AST and GGT have been related to inflammation and oxidative stress. Thus, AST acts as an important mediator of inflammatory processes and nonspecific liver injury. Elevated AST concentrations have been reported in diseases that affect organs other than the liver, such as myocardial infarction, acute pancreatitis, acute renal disease, and musculoskeletal diseases. GGT is used as a sensitive indicator of hepatic inflammation, fatty liver disease, and hepatitis; most recently, it has been implicated in oxidative stress associated with glutathione metabolism. Interestingly, our data show that a high coffee intake is associated with lower concentrations of a liver-specific mitochondrial enzyme — GLDH — and, thereby, with a lower risk of HCC. GLDH is particularly indicative of toxic parenchymal liver injury; thereby, our findings may add to previous evidence showing that coffee is associated with liver damage progression irrespective of the etiology.

### Treatment of microcirculatory disturbances in acute pancreatitis: where are we now? [^113CLriA]. Pancreas (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute pancreatitis is a serious inflammatory condition. Research has shown an increase in the number of pancreatitis-associated hospitalizations, with a marked decline in the mortality rates down to 0.79% in patients with acute pancreatitis and 0.26% in patients with exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis. Up to one-third of patients develop pancreatic tissue necrosis, with a mortality rate of 30%. One of the mechanisms is the disturbances in pancreatic microcirculation due to the release of endothelin, a long-acting vasoconstrictor. The development of pancreatitis causes the release of other inflammatory mediators, which reduce blood flow in the microcirculation. The activation of intracellular trypsinogen initiates a cascade of mechanisms in pancreatitis. There is no specific treatment for acute pancreatitis. Protease inhibitors are not effective in treating severe acute pancreatitis. There is an important role of low-molecular-weight heparin in attenuating necrosis and restoring perfusion of the pancreas. Other drugs used are endothelin receptor antagonists, antagonist of interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 receptors, α-tocopherol, tumor necrosis factor-α and platelet-activating factor inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid, and local intra-arterial injection of lidocaine. The prophylactic use of antibiotics is not recommended. The treatment outcome of acute pancreatitis is still unsatisfactory.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to MRCP/EUS, ACG 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain MRCP or EUS to screen for the presence of common bile duct stones before ERCP in patients with a suspected common bile duct stone without cholangitis and/or jaundice. Avoid performing diagnostic ERCP in this scenario.

### How alcohol induces human acute alcoholic pancreatitis-problem solved? [^115TcpG2]. The American Journal of Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

It has been a puzzle why only a minority of heavy alcohol drinkers develop acute alcoholic pancreatitis. In this review, the sparse data available from published studies were collected and, based on them, a hypothesis was formed. Long-term high alcohol consumption results in lowered cholecystokinin and cholinergic stimulus of the pancreas, and causes concentration and acidification of pancreatic fluid, predisposing to protein secretion. Early during the withdrawal period when returning to a normal or high-fat nonalcoholic diet, there is a relative hyperstimulation of the pancreas, a well-established mechanism that results in experimental acute pancreatitis. Lower, physiological stimulation is enough to start acute pancreatitis, when the secretions cause temporary obstruction in the duct system; the stimulation against temporary obstruction is also well-known to result in experimental acute pancreatitis. The magnitude of alcohol-induced deficits in acinar cell defense mechanisms then finally determines the onset of pancreatitis.

Discussion and conclusions

Identifying the cause of acute pancreatitis can be somewhat challenging especially when trying to identify a certain drug as the causative agent. Drugs are responsible for approximately 0.1–2% of acute pancreatitis incidents with most information about drug-induced pancreatitis being collected from case reports and case series which means that true incidence can be even higher. There is no one main mechanism behind drug-induced acute pancreatitis, but several potential mechanisms are currently based on theories. Of the proposed mechanisms include: pancreatic duct constriction with localized angioedema and arteriolar thrombosis, cytotoxic and metabolic effects, and hypersensitivity reactions. As well as drugs with side effects of hypertriglyceridemia and chronic hypercalcemia that are considered risk factors for acute pancreatitis. The diagnosis of drug-induced acute pancreatitis requires a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and ruling out all other etiologies. Etiologies that were ruled out in this case comprise all possible causes of pancreatitis: gallstones, biliary sludge and microlithiasis, alcohol, smoking, hypertriglyceridemia, scorpion venom, post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), hypercalcemia, steroids intake, malignancy, infection, trauma, vascular disease. Based on American College of Gastroenterology guidelines, consideration for genetic testing for hereditary pancreatitis is based on expert opinion and warranted for pancreatic cancer patients with a personal history of at least 2 attacks of acute pancreatitis of unknown etiology, a family history of pancreatitis, or early-age onset chronic pancreatitis; therefore, the decision was made by the primary and gastroenterology teams on the case not to forgo with genetic testing to rule out hereditary pancreatitis. Immunoglobulin G4 level was 24 mg/dL (reference range: 1–100 mg/dL) which ruled out autoimmune pancreatitis. The evidence found to implicate a certain drug to the development of acute pancreatitis is often inadequate especially when the mechanism is unknown. Badalov N. et al. proposed a classification system of drug-induced acute pancreatitis. This system was based on the number of case reports found in the literature, the available rechallenge data, latency period and ability to exclude other causes of acute pancreatitis. After reviewing summary of drug induced acute pancreatitis based on drug class, we found that ampicillin and penicillin are considered class IV (single case report published, but neither a rechallenge nor a consistent latency period documented). If the pancreatitis resolves after discontinuation of the drug, suspicion for drug-induced pancreatitis increases. A firm diagnosis can be reasonably established with a rechallenge of the offending drug that results in the recurrence of pancreatitis symptoms. Rechallenge was not done in this case. Very few cases, less than 5 total cases, were documented in the literature regarding ampicillin, penicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid induced acute pancreatitis with true mechanism still being unidentified. Table 2 shows the comparison between our patient's case with published data in the literature.

### Heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma: from mechanisms to clinical implications [^117J7kjH]. Cancer Gene Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Based on GLOBOCAN's 2020 report, liver cancer accounted for 830180 deaths globally and accounts for 4.7% of the total cancer cases worldwide. Of all the total cancer cases, liver cancer is the 6th most common cancer with an age-standardized rate (ASR) of 8.6 whereas it is the 3rd most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Asia constitutes around 73% of the liver cancer cases prevailing in the last 5 years, followed by Western and Northern Africa (9.4%), Europe (8.7%), and Northern America (5.2%). A retrospective study based on observing the survival years of 32,556 cases confirmed the overall survival rates of less than 8% for both males and females. In Australia, 2424 liver cancer-related deaths were estimated in 2022 with a 5-year survival of just 22%. Furthermore, the incidence and mortality rates are two to three times higher in men as compared to women. The incidence of liver cancer in the USA has more than tripled since 1980. Additionally, the incidence of liver cancer is projected to rise significantly by more than 55% with an estimated 1.3 million deaths globally by 2040. The rising trend of liver cancer incidence and its associated mortality poses a great healthcare burden and calls for attention.

### Adult bile duct strictures: role of MR imaging and MR cholangiopancreatography in characterization [^117E7UkT]. Radiographics (2014). Low credibility.

Bile duct strictures in adults are secondary to a wide spectrum of benign and malignant pathologic conditions. Benign causes of bile duct strictures include iatrogenic causes, acute or chronic pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis, liver transplantation, recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, Mirizzi syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome cholangiopathy, and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Malignant causes include cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and periampullary carcinomas. Rare causes include biliary inflammatory pseudotumor, gallbladder carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, metastases to bile ducts, and extrinsic bile duct compression secondary to periportal or peripancreatic lymphadenopathy. Contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with MR cholangiopancreatography is extremely helpful in the noninvasive evaluation of patients with obstructive jaundice, an obstructive pattern of liver function, or incidentally detected biliary duct dilatation. Some of these conditions may show characteristic findings at MR imaging-MR cholangiopancreatography that help in making a definitive diagnosis. Although endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with tissue biopsy or surgery is needed for the definitive diagnosis of many of these strictures, certain MR imaging characteristics of the narrowed segment (eg, thickened wall, long-segment involvement, asymmetry, indistinct outer margin, luminal irregularity, hyperenhancement relative to the liver parenchyma) may favor a malignant cause. Awareness of the various causes of bile duct strictures in adults and familiarity with their appearances at MR imaging-MR cholangiopancreatography are important for accurate diagnosis and optimal patient management.

### Chronic pancreatitis [^114BRvcH]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic pancreatitis:

- **Definition**: Chronic pancreatitis is a clinical syndrome involving inflammation, fibrosis, and loss of acinar and islet cells of the pancreas.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis typically involves multiple risk modifiers that interact to produce pancreatic disease, including bile duct obstruction (pancreatic tumors, chronic strictures), exogenous toxins (alcohol, smoking), metabolic disturbances (hyperlipidemia, hypercalcemia), as well as autoimmune disease and genetic disease.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of chronic pancreatitis ranges from 5 to 12 cases per 100,000 person-years, while its prevalence is estimated at 50 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Destruction of normal pancreatic tissue leads to the clinical manifestations of chronic abdominal pain, exocrine insufficiency (compromised digestion, absorption, and metabolism of nutrients), and endocrine insufficiency (pancreatogenic diabetes).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Patients with chronic pancreatitis have increased mortality as compared with age and sex-matched controls (HR 5.0, 95% CI 4.8–5.2).

### Predictive value of albumin-bilirubin grade for intravenous immunoglobulin resistance in a large cohort of patients with Kawasaki disease: a prospective study [^1136zQUX]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Recently, a parameter known as the ALBI grade [0.66×log 10 TBil -0.085×ALB] provides information on ALB and TBil, reflecting systemic inflammatory response and/or the degree of liver damage. ALBI has been proposed as a powerful prognostic indicator of poor outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatitis virus infection, and acute pancreatitis. Additionally, this parameter positively correlates with inflammatory markers. However, the usefulness of ALBI as a predictor of prognosis has not been evaluated in patients with KD. Thus, in this cohort, we prospectively assessed the predictive ability of ALBI for IVIG resistance in patients with KD and whether ALBI has more predictive value or accuracy than either ALB or TBil alone in predicting IVIG resistance.

### Recruitment and retention strategies for the diabetes RElated to acute pancreatitis and its mechanisms study: from the type 1 diabetes in acute pancreatitis consortium [^116oiiuv]. Pancreas (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Recruitment and retention of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) in clinical studies can be challenging. While some obstacles are similar to other clinical conditions, some are unique to AP. Identifying potential barriers early and developing targeted solutions can help optimize recruitment and retention in AP studies. Such pre-emptive and detailed planning can help prospective, longitudinal studies focus on exocrine and endocrine complications of AP in accurately measuring outcomes. This article highlights the challenges in recruitment and retention strategies in AP studies and reviews available resources to create opportunities to address them. We describe the multifaceted approach used by the Recruitment and Retention Committee of the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium, which builds upon earlier experiences to develop a recruitment and retention plan for the DREAM (Diabetes RElated to Acute pancreatitis and its Mechanisms) study.

### Clinical significance of soluble form of HLA class I molecule in Japanese patients with pancreatic cancer [^115Dny5Z]. Human Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

In recent studies a soluble form of human leukocyte antigen class I (sHLA-I) has been found in blood, urine, ascitic fluid, and various other tissues. Research has been focused on the role of sHLA-I in the induction of immunotolerance in organ transplantation. To examine the role of sHLA-I in the immune system of patients with malignancy, we examined serum sHLA-I levels in patients with pancreatic, biliary, hepatic malignancy, and other diseases. We examined sHLA-I levels in the sera of patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 19), benign biliary disease and chronic pancreatitis (n = 20), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 51), gallbladder cancer (n = 6), cholangiocellular carcinoma (n = 6), and in normal controls (n = 22), using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In patients with pancreatic cancer we also analyzed the relationship between sHLA-I and CA19–9, and the specificity and sensitivity of sHLA-I. When patients with acute or chronic hepatitis were excluded from analysis, the mean sHLA-I level in patients with pancreatic cancer was significantly higher than that of normal controls (p < 0.01) and patients with benign disease (p < 0.01), hepatocellular carcinoma (p < 0.01), gallbladder cancer (p < 0.05), and cholangiocarcinoma (p < 0.05). We determined a serum sHLA-I cutoff level for normal controls of 2000 ng/ml; serum levels of sHLA-I were higher than the cutoff in ten patients with pancreatic cancer, and serum levels of CA19–9 were lower than 37 IU/l in 9 of 14 patients; sensitivity and specificity were 88.2% and 85.5%, respectively. Serum levels of sHLA-I in pancreatic cancer patients were higher than in the other diseases, although we found that pancreatic cancer cell lines did not produce the sHLA-I. The evaluation of serum sHLA-I levels could have clinical significance in pancreatic cancer.

Table 4
Demographics and clinical characteristics of patients with pancreatic tumor-induced AP

In the ampulla group, there were 6 villous tubular adenomas and 7 adenocarcinomas. Liver metastasis was observed in 1 case and biliary duct was involved in two cases. There were 3 cases (23.1%) in stage IV, 1 case (7.7%) in stage IIB and 3 cases (23.1%) in stage IB. In the biliary group, there were 12 adenocarcinomas, 1 high-grade neoplasia with canceration and 1 villous adenoma with canceration. Vascular invasion was observed in 2 cases. Single organ metastases included pancreas (1 case), duodenum (1 case) and liver (2 cases). And there were 2 cases (14.3%) in stage IV, 3 cases (21.4%) in stage III, 6 cases (42.9%) in stage II (3 case stage IIB and 3 case stage IIA) and 1 case (7.1%) in stage IB.

Totally, 32% cases were IV stage, 22% cases were III stage, 17% cases were II stage (7 case IIB and 10 case IIA) and 21% cases were I stage (18 case IB and 3 case IA). The differences among the three groups were statistically significant (p = 0.000).

### Acute pancreatitis with an emphasis on infection [^112bbasE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease that is mild and self-limiting in about 80% of cases. However, severe necrotizing disease still has a mortality of up to 30%. Differentiated multimodal treatment concepts are needed for these patients, including a multidisciplinary team (intensivists, gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists, and surgeons). The primary therapy is supportive. Patients with infected pancreatic necrosis who are septic undergo interventional or surgical treatment, ideally not before the fourth week after onset of symptoms. This article reviews the pathophysiologic mechanisms of acute pancreatitis and describes clinical pathways for diagnosis and management based on the current literature and guidelines.

### Inflammation-induced expression and secretion of microRNA 122 leads to reduced blood levels of kidney-derived erythropoietin and anemia [^111gMqxB]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Anemia is associated commonly with acute and chronic inflammation, but the mechanisms of their interaction are not clear. We investigated whether microRNA 122 (MIR122), which is generated in the liver and is secreted into the blood, is involved in the development of anemia associated with inflammation.

Methods

We characterized the primary transcript of the human liver-specific MIR122 using Northern blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and 3' and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends analyses. We studied regulation of MIR122 in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (Huh7 and HepG2) as well as in C57BL/6 and mice with disruption of the tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) gene. Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by bioluminescence imaging or immunofluorescence. Inflammation in mice was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or by cerulein injections. Mice were given 4 successive injections of LPS, leading to inflammation-induced anemia. Steatohepatitis was induced with a choline-deficient, high-fat diet. Hemolytic anemia was stimulated by phenylhydrazine injection. MIR122 was inhibited in mice by tail-vein injection of an oligonucleotide antagonist of MIR122. MicroRNA and messenger RNA levels were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Results

The primary transcript of MIR122 spanned 5 kb, comprising 3 exons; the third encodes MIR122. Within the MIR122 promoter region we identified a nuclear factor-κB binding site and showed that RELA (NF-κB p65 subunit), as well as activators of NF-κB (TNF and LPS), increased promoter activity of MIR122. Administration of LPS to mice induced secretion of MIR122 into blood, which required TNF. Secreted MIR122 reached the kidney and reduced expression of erythropoietin (Epo), which we identified as a MIR122 target gene. Injection of mice with an oligonucleotide antagonist of MIR122 increased blood levels of EPO, reticulocytes, and hemoglobin. We found an inverse relationship between blood levels of MIR122 and EPO in mice with acute pancreatitis or steatohepatitis, and also in patients with acute inflammation.

Conclusion

In mice, we found that LPS-induced inflammation increases blood levels of MIR122, which reduces expression of Epo in the kidney; this is a mechanism of inflammation-induced anemia. Strategies to block MIR122 in patients with inflammation could reduce the development or progression of anemia.

### Acute viral hepatitis E complicated with acute pancreatitis in an immunocompetent adult [^11483Fta]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Acute viral hepatitis has been associated with several extrahepatic complications. Fulminant liver failure secondary to acute viral hepatitis may be complicated by acute pancreatitis. However, in the setting of benign viral hepatitis, in the absence of liver failure, association of pancreatitis is uncommon, that too in an otherwise immunocompetent individual. The exact mechanism of hepatitis-related pancreatitis remains elusive. Proposed mechanisms include immune-mediated injury against infected pancreatic acinar cells, oedema of the ampulla of Vater and release of lysosomal enzymes from the liver. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed in any case of viral hepatitis with severe abdominal pain to recognise acute pancreatitis as a possible complication, which may increase both morbidity and mortality if unrecognised. Herein, we report a case of a young man presenting with acute viral hepatitis due to hepatitis E infection, complicated by acute pancreatitis.

DIRECT CHOLANGIOGRAPHY

PRECAUTION

In the presence of acute pancreatitis, direct cholangiography, if necessary, should be employed with caution, injecting no more than 5 mL to 10 mL without undue pressure.

ADVERSE REACTION

Adverse reactions may often be attributed to injection pressure or excessive volume of the medium, resulting in overdistention. Such pressure may produce a sensation of epigastric fullness, followed by moderate pain in the back or right upper abdominal quadrant, which will subside when injection is stopped.

Hepatobiliary reflux of the medium may cause a pancholangitis or hepatitis which is usually transitory. Retrograde spread of the infection may produce liver abscess or septicemia. Pancreatic duct reflux may cause a transitory increase in serum amylase for a period of 6 to 18 hours without ill effects. Rarely it may cause pancreatitis.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The solution should be warmed to body temperature before administration. The injection is made slowly without undue pressure, taking great care to avoid introducing bubbles.

Operative — If no resistance is encountered, from 10 mL to 15 mL of a 25 percent to 50 percent solution is injected or instilled into the cystic duct or common bile duct, as indicated. In patients with obstructive jaundice, 40 mL to 50 mL of the medium may be injected directly into the gallbladder after aspiration of its contents.

Postexploratory or completion T tube cholangiography may also be performed after exploration of the common bile duct.

Postoperative — Delayed cholangiograms are usually made from the fifth to the tenth postoperative day prior to removal of the T tube.

In case of a dilated ductal tract, a larger volume (up to 100 mL) of radiopaque medium may be required for complete filling and visualization.

PERCUTANEOUS TRANSHEPATIC CHOLANGIOGRAPHY

Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is recommended for carefully selected patients for the differential diagnosis of jaundice due to extrahepatic biliary obstruction or parenchymal disease. The procedure is only employed where oral or intravenous cholangiography and other procedures have failed to provide the necessary information. In obstructive cases, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is used to determine the cause and site of the obstruction to help plan surgery. The technique may also be of value in avoiding laparotomy in poor risk jaundice patients since failure to enter a duct suggest hepatocellular disease. Careful attention to technique is essential for the success and safety of the procedure. The procedure is usually performed under local anesthesia following analgesic premedication (eg, 100 mg meperidine intramuscularly).

### Liraglutide [^113j5uTC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a 26-week placebo-controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with a 26-week open-label extension, 21.2% of liraglutide injection-treated patients (mean age 14.6 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus, had hypoglycemia with a blood glucose < 54 mg/dL with or without symptoms (335 events per 1000 patient years). No severe hypoglycemic episodes occurred in the liraglutide injection treatment group (severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions).

Papillary thyroid carcinoma:

In adult glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there were 7 reported cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma in patients treated with liraglutide injection and 1 case in a comparator-treated patient (1.5 vs. 0.5 cases per 1000 patient- years). Most of these papillary thyroid carcinomas were < 1 cm in greatest diameter and were diagnosed in surgical pathology specimens after thyroidectomy prompted by findings on protocol-specified screening with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound.

Pancreatitis

In glycemic control trials of liraglutide injection, there have been 13 cases of pancreatitis among liraglutide injection -treated patients and 1 case in a comparator (glimepiride) treated patient (2.7 vs. 0.5 cases per 1000 patient-years). Nine of the 13 cases with liraglutide injection were reported as acute pancreatitis and four were reported as chronic pancreatitis. In one case in a liraglutide injection-treated patient, pancreatitis, with necrosis, was observed and led to death; however clinical causality could not be established. Some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [^114LGGh8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been the most rapidly increasing cancer since 1980. The rate of death from HCC increased by 43% (from 7.2 to 10.3 deaths per 100 000 population) between 2000 and 2016. With a 5-year survival of 18%, HCC is the second most lethal malignant neoplasm after pancreatic cancer. In North America, among patients with HCC, the primary risk factors include alcohol (37% of patients), hepatitis C virus (HCV; 31% of patients), hepatitis B (HBV; 9% of patients), and other causes, including metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) (23% of patients). However, with the implementation of universal HBV vaccination in newborns in many countries, HCV treatment programs worldwide, and increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity, the epidemiology of HCC is shifting away from viral hepatitis to metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis. Due to uncertainty about the benefits of universal HCC screening or surveillance, it is not recommended in patients with noncirrhotic MASLD. However, currently, up to 30% of patients with MASLD-related HCC do not have cirrhosis. With the increasing prevalence, it is projected that MASLD will soon become the leading cause of HCC in the US, which has implications for how physicians and health care systems should prioritize surveillance of patients with MASLD. Nevertheless, universally screening all patients with MASLD would be challenging, due to a lack of adequate imaging resources. A risk stratification model may allow those at highest risk for HCC to receive the most effective screening.

### Outcomes and risk factors for cancer patients undergoing endoscopic intervention of malignant biliary obstruction [^111HvZbq]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Malignant biliary obstruction is a frequent complication in patients with advanced tumor diseases. Both central hepatic metastases and hilar lymph node metastases of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal cancers, but also tumors of the pancreatic head often result in a biliary compression.

Obstructive jaundice is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, intact bilirubin excretion is mandatory for the administration of many chemotherapeutical and targeted agents.

Only limited data exist concerning the role of jaundice in patients with metastatic disease. In a retrospective study published in 1994, median survival in patients with jaundice due to metastatic colorectal cancer was approximately 3–5 months. However, taking into consideration the increasing number of therapeutic agents available for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, more therapeutic options are available after improvement of biliary drainage, resulting in prolonged survival in patients. Furthermore, in tumors being considered as chemorefractory such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), normalization of cholestasis parameters is mandatory to initiate systemic targeted treatment, such as sorafenib.

In patients with pancreatic carcinoma, biliary obstruction occurs in approximately 70–90% of all cases, possibly leading to a deterioration of the patients' general condition due to cholangitis, malabsorption or liver failure. Although surgical bypass has demonstrated a low rate of recurrent jaundice, the surgical procedure itself carries a significant risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been the preferred method for patients with malignant biliary obstruction since the late 1980s. Studies showed an equivalent success rate and decreased morbidity and mortality for this method in comparison with percutaneous or surgical approaches. Yet, in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer, immediate resection of the tumor without a previous ERC is the preferred option.

Placement of a plastic or metal stent has been shown to be an effective method in improving biliary flow. Common complications include cholangitis and stent occlusion, whereas pancreatitis is only rarely observed post-ERCP. The optimal type of stent (plastic or metal) is still a matter of debate. Plastic stents have been used as a standard method for biliary drainage; however, regular stent exchange is necessary every 3–4 months in order to prevent stent obstruction due to biliary sludge. Thus, metal stents are preferred in patients with an expected survival of more than 3 to 4 months.

### Bidirectional relationship between acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer [^112HdNbG]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The burdens of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and acute pancreatitis are increasing globally. We reviewed current literature on whether acute pancreatitis is a causal factor for PDAC and examined clinical manifestations of PDAC-associated acute pancreatitis.

Recent Findings

Recent findings detail the timing of acute pancreatitis before and after PDAC occurrence, further solidifying the evidence for PDAC-associated acute pancreatitis and for acute pancreatitis as a causal risk factor for PDAC. The risk of PDAC remains elevated above the general population in patients with distant history of acute pancreatitis. PDAC risk also increases with recurrent acute pancreatitis episodes, independent of smoking and alcohol. Mechanisms linking acute pancreatitis to PDAC include inflammation and neutrophil infiltration, which can be attenuated by suppressing inflammation and/or epigenetic modulation, thus slowing the progression of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia. Clinical presentation and management of acute pancreatitis in the context of PDAC are discussed, including challenges acute pancreatitis poses in the diagnosis and treatment of PDAC, and novel interventions for PDAC-associated acute pancreatitis.

Summary

PDAC risk may be reduced with improved acute pancreatitis prevention and treatment, such as antiinflammatories or epigenetic modulators. Increased acute pancreatitis and PDAC burden warrant more research on better diagnosis and management of PDAC-associated acute pancreatitis.

Alcoholic hepatitis corticosteroid treatment algorithm details that patients are first assessed for eligibility with Maddrey Discriminant Function ≥ 32 (or possibly MELD > 20), obtaining abdominal ultrasound to exclude other causes of jaundice and screening for infection with chest x-ray, blood, urine and ascites cultures. Assess for contraindications to treatment including uncontrolled infections, acute kidney injury with serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL, uncontrolled upper gastrointestinal bleeding, concomitant diseases including HBV (hepatitis B virus), HCV, DILI (drug-induced liver injury), HCC, acute pancreatitis, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), TB (tuberculosis), and multiorgan failure or shock. For the Eligible for Treatment branch, start prednisolone 40mg daily or equivalent with or without IV N-acetylcysteine and target an enteral nutrition goal of ≥ 21 kcal/kg. Use Lille model after 7 days of treatment. For Response to Treatment, if Lille < 0.45, continue prednisolone for 28 days total and support life-long abstinence from alcohol; for Non-Response to Treatment, if Lille ≥ 0.45, stop prednisolone. For the Ineligible for Treatment branch, consider referral for early LT or palliative care, as clinically appropriate.

### Effectiveness, safety, and factors associated with the clinical success of endoscopic biliary drainage for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a retrospective multicenter study [^112z8aXn]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Total complication rates reportedly range from 0% to 21.7% in HCC stricture, and 5.3% to 47.8% in other malignant strictures. The complication rate was 2.8% in the present study (hyperamylasemia in 2, gall bladder hemorrhaging in 1), which was similar to the rates in other studies. The rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) was reported to be 18.6% for cases of HCC stricture and 0%-38.4% for cases of other malignant stricture. Adler et al. reported that patients with Child–Pugh class C had a higher risk of PEP than others. However, whether or not the risk of PEP in patients with liver cirrhosis is high is controversial. In our study, although there were no cases of post-ERCP pancreatitis, the number of patients was small, so a larger prospective trial is required to resolve this issue.

In our study, Child–Pugh class C was significantly associated with clinical failure. The clinical success rate was 86.7% in cases of class A/B but only 62.5% in class C. In a previous report, the 1-year cumulative survival rates were 45% (Child C), 80% (Child B) and 95% (Child A). Patients with Child–Pugh class C have a poor prognosis because of liver failure, so biliary drainage tends to be less effective in these patients than in others. However, on comparing the survival rates between the clinical success and clinical failure cases among patients with Child–Pugh class C, the survival duration in the clinical success cases was longer than that in the clinical failure cases (2.8 months vs. 0.93 months, p = 0.0235). In our study, HCC treatment after ERCP was significantly associated with a long survival. In addition, among patients without HCC treatment after ERCP, the median survival duration was significantly longer in patients with clinical success than in those with clinical failure. HCC treatment after ERCP is sometimes difficult in patients who cannot achieve clinical success through endoscopic therapy. Therefore, clinical success with endoscopic therapy is thought to contribute to a long prognosis, both indirectly and directly.

### Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol (tri Femynor) [^111QnDnP]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.2 Liver Disease

Impaired Liver Function

Do not use Tri Femynor in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Tri Femynor if jaundice develops.

Liver Tumors

Tri Femynor is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.

5.3 High Blood Pressure

Tri Femynor is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Tri Femynor if blood pressure rises significantly.

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.

5.4 Gallbladder Disease

Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis.

5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects

Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Tri Femynor. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance.

Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.

Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.

5.6 Headache

If a woman taking Tri Femynor develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Tri Femynor if indicated.

Consider discontinuation of Tri Femynor in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).

### Chronic inflammation, immune escape, and oncogenesis in the liver: a unique neighborhood for novel intersections [^114yjsA4]. Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Sustained hepatic inflammation, driven by alcohol consumption, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and/or chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), results in damage to parenchyma, oxidative stress, and compensatory regeneration/proliferation. There is substantial evidence linking these inflammation-associated events with the increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Although acute liver inflammation can play a vital and beneficial role in response to liver damage or acute infection, the effects of chronic liver inflammation, including liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, are sufficient in a fraction of individuals to initiate the process of transformation and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. This review highlights immune-dependent mechanisms that may be associated with hepatocellular oncogenesis, including critical transformative events/pathways in the context of chronic inflammation and subverted tolerogenesis.

### Heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma: from mechanisms to clinical implications [^11119F6i]. Cancer Gene Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary liver cancer originates within the liver and, depending on the cellular type and pathological morphology, it can be hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CAA), angiosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, and hepatoblastoma. Whereas, secondary liver cancer refers to those metastasized to the liver from other sites of the body such as colorectal cancer or pancreatic cancer. Among all, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer, contributing to 90% of the total liver cancer cases. It originates from hepatocytes with a doubling time of 4–5 months. HCC predominantly occurs in the background of chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis B and C viral infections, metabolic (dysfunction) -associated fatty liver diseases (MAFLD, previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD), and cirrhosis. Other commonly seen risk factors for HCC include aflatoxin exposure, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Over the past years, MAFLD has become an increasingly important cause of HCC. In addition to these causative agents, several intrinsic factors such as genetic mutations, tumor microenvironment, clonal evolution of cancer cells and epigenetic changes also contribute to the development of HCC. Regardless of etiological factors, non-resolving liver inflammation is a key predisposing factor for the development of primary liver cancer, in that approximately 90% of HCC cases are associated with chronic inflammation leading to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and ultimately HCC (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Schematic representation of multi-stage HCC development from common etiological factors.

HCC is notorious for its rapid progression and poor survival rates, which are often attributed to the presence of heterogeneous subpopulations of cancer cells in the tumor. While there are multiple treatments available for HCC, their effectiveness is limited due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease. In this review, we will delve into the factors inducing tumoral heterogeneity in HCC and the associated underlying mechanisms, and propose novel pre-clinical models that can be used to best study HCC heterogeneity, with the ultimate goal of exploring novel approaches that can be used to tackle tumor heterogeneity.

### Epidemiology and clinical presentation of hepatocellular carcinoma [^1165hhKb]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common internal malignancies worldwide. Until recently, it has occurred relatively rarely in the West. Now, however, it appears to be rising in incidence in the United States and other developed western countries. The most frequent underlying factors causing HCC are chronic viral hepatitis and cirrhosis. Common clinical features include abdominal pain and worsening of hepatic synthetic function. More recently, however, patients with asymptomatic tumors are being diagnosed because of more frequent screening and improvements in imaging techniques. Early detection of HCC is a key factor in improving outcomes of therapies. There is growing evidence that HCC may be prevented with strategies aimed at preventing or treating viral hepatitis.

### Grey Turner's sign in acute necrotizing pancreatitis [^113X8apR]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

A 32-year-old male presented to Emergency Department with history of severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, recurrent vomiting of 3 days duration, and shortness of breath. The patient was managed initially elsewhere with intravenous fluids and broad spectrum antibiotics. On examination patient had tachycardia (pulse rate 150 bpm), tachypnea (respiratory rate 38/min) and a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. Examination of the abdomen revealed generalized distention of the abdomen with erythema in the left flank (Fig. 1) suggestive of Grey Turner's sign. The area was tender to touch and had raised local temperature. Bowel sounds were absent. Serum amylase and lipase were elevated and contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen performed on day 5 revealed non enhancing pancreas (> 50% necrosis, computed tomography severity index 10/10) and extra-pancreatic necrosis tracking down both the pararenal spaces into the pelvis (Fig. 2 A, B). The site where the Grey Turner's sign was seen exactly correlated with the site of extrapancreatic necrosis on imaging. The patient was shifted to the Intensive Care Unit, started on intravenous fluids, antibiotics, analgesics and put on mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxemia. Despite 48 h of intensive therapy, the patient continued to worsen with elevated total leukocyte count and high-grade fever. Therefore, a pigtail was inserted into the lesser sac collection which drained hemorrhagic fluid (Fig. 3). Despite all efforts, the patient went into refractory shock and could not be revived.

Grey Turner's sign was described by a British surgeon for the first time in 1920 in a patient of acute pancreatitis. This sign is nonspecific for acute pancreatitis and has been described in retroperitoneal hemorrhage secondary to hepatocellular carcinoma, trauma, perirenal hematoma, and portal hypertension. The Grey-Turner's sign is produced by spread of the pancreatic inflammation from the anterior pararenal space between the posterior renal fascia and subsequently to the lateral edge of the quadratus lumborum muscle. The skin signs of acute pancreatitis are rare, but, if present, they confer a poor prognosis, as in our case.

Acute pancreatitis, including a fatal case, has been reported in four patients with CTCL and in six patients with non-CTCL cancers treated with bexarotene capsules; the cases were associated with marked elevations of fasting serum triglycerides, the lowest being 770 mg/dL in one patient. One patient with advanced non-CTCL cancer died of pancreatitis. Interrupt bexarotene capsules and evaluate if pancreatitis is suspected. Patients with CTCL who have risk factors for pancreatitis (e.g., prior pancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated with pancreatic toxicity) may be at greater risk for pancreatitis associated with bexarotene capsules [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.3 Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure

Bexarotene caused elevations in liver chemistry tests (LFTs) in 5% (AST), 2% (ALT), and 0% (bilirubin) in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m2/day. In contrast, with an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m2/day of bexarotene capsules, the incidence of LFT elevations was higher at 7% (SGOT/AST), 9% (SGPT/ALT), and 6% (bilirubin). Two patients developed cholestasis, including one patient who died of liver failure. In clinical trials, elevated LFTs resolved within one month in 80% of patients following a decrease in dose or discontinuation of therapy. Obtain baseline LFTs and monitor LFTs after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, at least every eight weeks thereafter during treatment. Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene capsules if test results exceed three times the upper limit of normal values for AST, ALT, or bilirubin.

### Mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma progression [^116ecV7J]. World Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hepatocellular carcinoma:

- **Definition**: HCC is a disease occurring due to malignant transformation of normal hepatocytes within the liver parenchyma.
- **Pathophysiology**: The risk factors that induce malignant transformation of normal hepatocytes include chronic infections of HBV and/or HCV, aflatoxin toxin, cirrhosis, or consumption of large amounts of alcohol. Underlying liver cirrhosis is present in about 80–90% of patients.
- **Epidemiology**: HCC accounts for 75–85% of all liver malignancies. In the US, the incidence of HCC is estimated at 7.7 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations relate to local mass effect (abdominal pain, distension, loss of appetite, palpable masses), hepatic dysfunction (jaundice, ascites, gastrointestinal bleeding, splenomegaly, and encephalopathy), and constitutional effects of malignancy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Multiple treatment modalities exist; however, only orthotopic liver transplantation or surgical resection is curative. The overall prognosis for HCC in the US is poor with a 2-year survival < 50% and a 5-year survival of only 10%.

### Comprehensive DNA methylation analysis of tissue of origin of plasma cell-free DNA by methylated CpG tandem amplification and sequencing (MCTA-seq) [^116utAA6]. Clinical Epigenetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Comprehensive analysis of the tissue of origin of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) remains insufficient. A genome-scale DNA methylation method for this analysis is of both biological and clinical interest.

Methods

We used the methylated CpG tandem amplification and sequencing (MCTA-Seq), which is a genome-scale DNA methylation method, for analyzing cfDNA. We performed MCTA-Seq to pair plasma cfDNA and white blood cell genomic DNA from 14 healthy individuals for comparative analysis, with eight tissues being analyzed for identifying tissue-specific markers. The relative contributions of multiple tissues to cfDNA were calculated for plasma cfDNA obtained from healthy adults (n = 25), cholelithiasis patients (n = 13), liver cirrhosis patients (n = 17), hepatocellular carcinoma patients (n = 30), and acute pancreatitis patients (n = 8).

Results

We identified a total of 146 tissue-specific hypermethylation markers. Simulation analysis showed that MCTA-Seq can accurately measure DNA fractions contributed by multiple tissues to cfDNA. We demonstrated that the liver is the major non-hematopoietic tissue contributing to plasma cfDNA in healthy adults. The method also detected increases in the liver-derived DNA in the blood from patients with liver diseases, which correlate with an increase in the liver enzyme level. Furthermore, the results indicated that blood cells make a major contribution to the elevation of cfDNA levels in acute pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Finally, we characterized a novel set of tissue-specific hypermethylation markers for cfDNA detection, which are located within the intragenic regions of tissue-specific highly expressed genes.

Conclusions

We have used MCTA-Seq for simultaneously measuring cfDNA fractions contributed by multiple tissues. Applying this approach to healthy adults and liver and pancreas disease patients revealed the tissue of origin of cfDNA. The approach and the identified markers should facilitate assessing the cfDNA dynamics in a variety of human diseases.

### Theories, mechanisms, and models of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis [^1117uKrL]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Alcoholic chronic pancreatitis is a severe, disabling, chronic inflammatory condition of the pancreas that is seen in fewer than 5% of alcoholics. The severity and unpredictability of this condition has lead to several theories on the mechanism causing chronic pancreatitis based on careful clinical observation. Hypothetical mechanisms were applied to various animal models. Finally, following multiple lines of evidence, there is a convergence of thought and development of some new models that are quite instructive. Taken together, chronic alcohol consumption by rats results in multiple effects on the pancreas that increase the risk of acute pancreatitis, including ongoing acinar cell injury that lowers the threshold for hyperstimulation-induced acute pancreatitis, neurohormonal injury, and adaptation that results in acinar cell hyperstimulation, increased susceptibility to viral mediated acute pancreatitis, and possibly other factors. After acute pancreatitis initiates the inflammatory process, the chronic inflammation and fibrosis of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis are driven by diet, the acinar cell stress response to continued alcohol that may be potentiated by toxic alcohol metabolites, hypoxia, hyperstimulation, and partial duct obstruction; plus the effects of proinflammatory immunocytes and cytokines; and by stellate cell-mediated fibrosis driven by anti-inflammatory cytokines, alcohol, and alcohol metabolites. The factors determining which alcoholic will develop alcoholic chronic pancreatitis likely involve genetic factors, dietary factors, and susceptibility to pancreatic injury through several mechanisms ranging from trauma to gallstones to viruses.

### Acute lung injury in acute pancreatitis – awaiting the big leap [^1116wxwX]. Respiratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Acute lung injury is a severe complication to acute pancreatitis and a significant health problem associated with a considerable mortality. Underlying mechanisms are complex and poorly understood, although recent insights have identified several inflammatory profiles and cellular components involved to varying degrees during different phases of pancreatitis exacerbation and acute lung injury. This review aims to highlight the current understanding of the inflammatory and cellular components involved in and responsible for the associations of acute pancreatitis and acute lung injury, with the hope of thereby providing an increased understanding of the underlying mechanisms. In addition, novel experimental models of modulating the pancreatitis-associated acute lung injury are presented, interventions that may be of potential future clinical value.

### Management of hepatocellular carcinoma [^114k5Em6]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rapidly evolving field. Advances in liver surgery and transplantation mean that curative treatment can be offered to patients with HCC in compensated livers who are diagnosed early or to those who are within transplant criteria. Explanted livers have provided a growing understanding of the underlying mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis and diagnostic modalities. Several locoregional therapies are also available. For advanced tumors, molecular targeted therapies are yielding promising results. Because of the heterogeneity of the patients and the disease, many questions are waiting for answers through well-designed, adequately powered, and bias-free multicenter, controlled, randomized trials.

### Clinical difficulties in the differentiation of autoimmune pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma [^1123MBth]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a newly described entity with characteristic clinical, histologic, and morphologic changes, in which autoimmune mechanisms are involved in pathogenesis. However, difficulties can arise in the differentiation of AIP from pancreatic carcinoma. The aims of this study were to clarify clinical and radiologic features of AIP to elucidate areas of diagnostic confusion.

Methods

Clinical, serologic, and radiologic findings were evaluated in 17 patients with AIP.

Results

All 17 patients were initially suspected to have pancreatic carcinoma. The patients were predominantly elderly men who frequently presented with jaundice but without features of acute pancreatitis. Elevation of serum gamma-globulin and IgG along with the presence of autoantibodies were usually evident, whereas serum tumor markers were elevated in 54% of cases. Stenosis of the bile duct was detected in 94% of cases. Diffuse enlargement of the pancreas and irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct were radiologically characteristic; however, segmental swelling and narrowing were detected in seven and two patients, respectively. In segmental cases, neither atrophy of the distal pancreas nor marked upstream dilation of the distal main pancreatic duct was observed. Angiographic abnormalities occurred in 54% of cases. Serologic and radiologic abnormalities showed considerable improvement with steroid therapy.

Conclusions

Frequent stenosis of the bile duct, elevation of serum tumor markers, segmental pancreatic enlargement or narrowing of the main pancreatic duct, and angiographic abnormalities can cause confusion in the differential diagnosis of AIP and pancreatic carcinoma.

### High-dose intravenous vitamin C reduce C-reactive protein levels, fluid retention, and APACHE II scores in patients with moderately severe acute pancreatitis: a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study [^116aFieC]. Annals of Intensive Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The study HDIVC was published by Bing Zhao and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Ann Intensive Care. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute pancreatitis. In the HDIVC study, the trial question was: what is the effect of high-dose intravenous vitamin C in patients with moderate-to-severe acute pancreatitis? In the HDIVC study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the HDIVC study, the population was: 212 patients (72 female, 140 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with moderate-to-severe acute pancreatitis. The key exclusion criteria were acute pancreatitis secondary to malignant tumor or ERCP; poorly controlled chronic organ failure; sepsis; autoimmune diseases or persistent immunosuppressive state; kidney stones; allergy to study drugs; pregnancy or lactation. In the HDIVC study, the interventions were: n = 109 high-dose vitamin C (200 mg/kg/day IV for 7 days) n = 103 placebo (normal saline for 7 days). In the HDIVC study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from all causes at day 28 (2.8% vs. 3.9%; OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.15 to 3.21). In the HDIVC study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median reduction in CRP levels in moderately severe pancreatitis at day 3 (72 mg/L vs. 46 mg/L; MD 26, 95% CI 8.86 to 43.14) Significant decrease in median fluid retention in moderately severe pancreatitis at day 3 (949 mL vs. 1656 mL; MD -707, 95% CI -1303.39 to -110.61). In the HDIVC study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in crystalluria. In the HDIVC study, the conclusion was: in patients with moderate-to-severe acute pancreatitis, high-dose vitamin C was not superior to placebo with respect to death from all causes at day 28.

### Hepato-pancreato-biliary emergencies for the acute care surgeon: etiology, diagnosis and treatment [^114E98Rb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with grade III cholangitis require admission to the intensive care unit for physiologic support, in addition to general medical treatment. Urgent endoscopic, percutaneous or surgical biliary drainage must also be performed. Considering that these patients are often physiologically unstable, the most rapid and least invasive procedure should be selected (operative intervention should be the last resort given the high associated mortality). Once the cholangitis has resolved, definitive treatment of the etiology (i.e. laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis, resection for cancer) is indicated.

### Acute pancreatitis induces intrapancreatic tumor necrosis factor gene expression… [^112XdEmU]. JAMA Network (1995). Excellent credibility.

Objective: To examine the intrapancreatic production of tumor necrosis factor α and define its cell of origin during acute pancreatitis. Design: Acute necrotizing pancreatitis was induced in adult male mice by administering cerulein. Animals were killed at 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours, with the severity of pancreatitis established by blind histologic grading and serum amylase, lipase, and TNF levels. The expression of TNF messenger RNA within the pancreas was established by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Intrapancreatic TNF protein was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, and immunohistochemical methods. Results: Acute pancreatitis was manifest within 1 hour of the first cerulein injection and increased in severity through 8 hours.

There was no constitutive expression of TNF messenger RNA within the pancreas, but transcripts were induced within 30 minutes following the onset of pancreatitis, increasing through 4 hours. Intrapancreatic and serum TNF peptide levels became detectable at 1 hour and increased over 6 hours, with intrapancreatic levels rising faster and attaining concentrations three times higher than time-matched serum levels. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated the progressive infiltration of macrophages into the pancreas that stained heavily for TNF. Conclusions: Tumor necrosis factor gene expression is induced locally during acute pancreatitis, resulting in large amounts of intrapancreatic TNF with levels consistently higher than those found in the serum. The overall rise in both tissue and serum TNF concentrations correlates directly with the severity of pancreatic damage and inflammation.

The infiltrating macrophage appears to contribute most to this process. Norman JG, Fink GW, Franz MG. Acute Pancreatitis Induces Intrapancreatic Tumor Necrosis Factor Gene Expression. Arch Surg. 1995; 130: 966–970.

### High incidence of hepatitis B infection-associated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the southeast Asian patients with portal vein thrombosis [^1154e7fd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

1. Background

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is considered a rare clinical and pathological entity. Thrombus formation usually begins in the portal vein and sometimes extends to other branches of the portal system such as splenic vein or mesenteric vein. The involved blood vessels can be partially or totally occluded resulting in increased portal venous outflow resistance from narrowing or obstructed blood vessel lumens. As thrombosis usually occurs gradually giving time for the development of cavernous transformation as a result of periportal collateralization around the occluded portal vein, most patients are asymptomatic and do not seek medical attention. However, obvious signs of portal hypertension such as splenomegaly, ascites, and massive hemorrhage from esophageal and gastric varices could also be found. In the acute setting of moderate to severe thrombus occlusion, abdominal pain may be the striking presentation.

The prevalence of PVT is not well-defined due to its rarity and initial asymptomatic nature. Nevertheless, transient occlusion of the portal system is increasingly being recognized during the diagnostic course of various acute and chronic abdominal problems such as appendicitis, cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, and other intra-abdominal infections by ultrasonography. A proportion of patients with portal hypertension were also found coincidentally to have a thrombus in the portal system. In a study of 701 hospitalized patients with cirrhosis who underwent routine ultrasound screening, PVT could be identified in 11% of the cases. The largest series was a retrospective review of 23,796 autopsies which revealed the prevalence of PVT of 1%.

Since PVT is an uncommon and under-recognized disorder and its true prevalence is not presently established, it was of much interest to conduct a study to explore the frequency, clinical presentations, and risk factors of PVT at one of the largest hospitals in Southeast Asia. During a 10-year period, we were able to find 194 PVT cases and the majority of them presented with a classical sign of portal hypertension and advanced symptoms. Interestingly, the identifiable risk factors appeared to be mostly associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection which is prevalent in this region. The fact that HBV-associated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are the predominant risks for PVT is strikingly different from the major risk factors in the Western reports. Other diseases that have rarely been described were also discovered in this series including Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome, systemic lymphangiomatosis, and abdominal tuberculosis.

### Gastrointestinal complications of obesity [^117SD3Pe]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Obesity usually is associated with morbidity related to diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. However, there are many gastrointestinal and hepatic diseases for which obesity is the direct cause (eg, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) or is a significant risk factor, such as reflux esophagitis and gallstones. When obesity is a risk factor, it may interact with other mechanisms and result in earlier presentation or complicated diseases. There are increased odds ratios or relative risks of several gastrointestinal complications of obesity: gastroesophageal reflux disease, erosive esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal adenocarcinoma, erosive gastritis, gastric cancer, diarrhea, colonic diverticular disease, polyps, cancer, liver disease including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, gallstones, acute pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer. Gastroenterologists are uniquely poised to participate in the multidisciplinary management of obesity as physicians caring for people with obesity-related diseases, in addition to their expertise in nutrition and endoscopic interventions.

### New insights into acute pancreatitis [^1152nrCA]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

The incidence of acute pancreatitis continues to increase worldwide, and it is one of the most common gastrointestinal causes for hospital admission in the USA. In the past decade, substantial advancements have been made in our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of acute pancreatitis. Studies have elucidated mechanisms of calcium-mediated acinar cell injury and death and the importance of store-operated calcium entry channels and mitochondrial permeability transition pores. The cytoprotective role of the unfolded protein response and autophagy in preventing sustained endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis and necrosis has also been characterized, as has the central role of unsaturated fatty acids in causing pancreatic organ failure. Characterization of these pathways has led to the identification of potential molecular targets for future therapeutic trials. At the patient level, two classification systems have been developed to classify the severity of acute pancreatitis into prognostically meaningful groups, and several landmark clinical trials have informed management strategies in areas of nutritional support and interventions for infected pancreatic necrosis that have resulted in important changes to acute pancreatitis management paradigms. In this Review, we provide a summary of recent advances in acute pancreatitis with a special emphasis on pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical management of the disorder.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^112zUQUV]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma — adverse events and portal vein thrombosis (PVT) considerations with TACE/TAE include common complications, a low reported treatment-related mortality rate, and selective-use safety in PVT. Complications common to TAE and TACE include non-target embolization, liver failure, pancreatitis, and cholecystitis, and reported rates of treatment-related mortality are usually well under 5%; a transient post-embolization syndrome with fever, abdominal pain, and intestinal ileus is relatively common. A retrospective study found PVT and Child–Pugh (C-P) Class C were significant predictors of poor prognosis after TACE, yet TACE has since been shown to be safe and feasible in highly selected patients with HCC and PVT, and a meta-analysis (5 prospective studies with 600 patients) showed that TACE may improve survival compared to control treatments; therefore, the panel considers TACE to be safe in highly selected patients with HCC and PVT.

### Acute pancreatitis recurrences augment long-term pancreatic cancer risk [^111hjJ3m]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The PDAC risk increased with the number of AP episodes implying that repeated bouts of acute inflammation further promote carcinogenesis. The PDAC risk was comparable in patients with and without gallstone and not influenced by the etiology of AP (smoking or heavy alcohol intake), suggesting that the higher PDAC risk in AP is largely because of AP and not because of risk factors such as smoking which are known to increase PDAC risk. The number of cases of PDAC in the cohort by Sadr-Azodi et al in all groups after year 4 is extremely small and therefore precludes a definitive or meaningful interpretation. Even in our cohort despite its very large size, the number of PDAC cases in years 6–10 is rather small but much higher than in the study by Sadr-Azodi. Despite this limitation, there was a statistically significant increase in PDAC risk in patients with gallstone pancreatitis for up to 10 years after AP, and this risk was similar in magnitude to that following nongallstone AP again suggesting that AP regardless of etiology increases long-term PDAC risk.

The present data support and advance the narrative from murine and cell culture models that acute inflammatory changes because of AP lead to molecular/cellular changes that promote carcinogenesis and are distinct from those related to CP-associated chronic inflammation and fibrosis. In several murine models, inflammation promotes cancer progression, and blocking this inflammation abrogates the carcinogenic effects. In other murine models, AP induced acinar to ductal metaplasia with oncogenic k-ras mutations. Activating oncogenic k-ras in pancreatic acinar cells during embryogenesis leads to pancreatic cancer initiation. The effects of AP in pancreatic carcinogenesis are accelerated in the presence of preexisting oncogenic k-ras mutations. Several other biomolecular mechanisms by which AP might promote PDAC have been described, again in cell cultures and animal models. Our findings, linking recurrent AP to PDAC, make these molecular findings more relevant because potential mechanisms for the role of acute inflammation in human pancreatic carcinogenesis are likely to provide impetus for further investigation of the involved molecular pathways.

### Spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma… [^115cUSm4]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Transarterial embolization is effective in controlling bleeding from ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma in the acute phase. The serum bilirubin level, shock on hospital admission, and prerupture disease state are important prognostic factors to predict survival in the acute phase. For definitive treatment, staged liver resection after attaining hemostasis is better than 1-stage emergency liver resection. The mechanism of spontaneous rupture is still not exactly known. 26 Hypotheses include rapid growth of the tumor and necrosis, 26 rupture by splitting the overlying nontumorous liver parenchyma or erosion of a vessel, 7, 27, 28 increased intratumor pressure with the occlusion of hepatic veins by tumor thrombi or invasion, 5, 6, 8 and coagulopathy. 8 Recently, Zhu et al29, 30 postulated that spontaneous rupture of HCC may be related to vascular dysfunction.

The vascular dysfunction results from degeneration of elastin and degradation of type IV collagen, rendering the blood vessels stiff and weak and causing them to split easily when the vascular load increases from hypertension or minor trauma. Large and peripherally located tumors are more prone to rupture. 5, 17, 27, 31 Diagnosing ruptured HCC can be difficult, particularly in patients without a history of cirrhosis or HCC. 32, 33 The development of imaging studies improved the rate of preoperative diagnosis. However, 20% to 33% of the diagnoses are still made only during an emergency exploratory laparotomy. 13, 19. The liver has a dual blood supply from the hepatic artery and the portal vein. In the normal liver, the portal vein supplies 70% of the total hepatic perfusion, and the hepatic artery supplies the rest. However, HCC derives its blood supply almost exclusively from the hepatic artery. In ruptured HCC, HAL has a hemostatic success rate of 68% to 100%.

6, 8, 10 It also reduces blood flow to the tumor and results in tumor regression. Their rationale is that ruptured HCC is due to the sudden obstruction of the outflow of blood from the tumor growth. Once HCC invades the venous drainage system, the spread of the tumor will be very rapid. The resection rate during emergency is between 12. 5% to 31%. One-stage emergency liver resection carries an in-hospital mortality of 16. 5% to 100%.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma predicts in-hospital mortality from acute variceal hemorrhage among patients with cirrhosis [^112GNRmn]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common complication among patients with cirrhosis. Data are limited on the impact of HCC on in-hospital mortality from acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH) in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

National in-hospital sample (1998 to 2007) was used to analyze admissions with AVH in cirrhotics to study impact of concomitant HCC on the in-hospital mortality.

Results

Of 27,442 admissions with cirrhosis and AVH, 540 had HCC. Admissions with HCC differed from those without HCC for age, sex, race, hospital characteristics, and complications of cirrhosis. A total of 2633 (9.6%) patients died during average hospital stay of 6 days with higher in-hospital mortality among admissions with HCC compared with without HCC (19% vs. 9%; P < 0.0001). On logistic regression analysis, in-hospital mortality decreased by about 9%/y during 1998 to 2007 [odds ratio, 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.92)]. Receipt of endoscopic treatment was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality. After adjusting for all variables including calendar year and endoscopic treatment, HCC independently predicted in-hospital mortality from AVH: odds ratio, 2.15 (95% confidence interval, 1.67–2.77). Logistic regression model using clinically important variables predicted in-hospital mortality with area under the receiver operating characteristics of 0.80 with strong predictors being presence of HCC, hepatorenal syndrome, hypovolemic shock, sepsis, portosystemic encephalopathy, and use of Sengstaken Blakemore tube.

Conclusions

HCC predicts in-hospital mortality from AVH in patients with cirrhosis. Studies are needed to examine and understand mechanisms of these findings to further develop better modalities of management of AVH in patients with cirrhosis and HCC.

### Evaluating the rates of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer among GLP-1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111sYeFC]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4.1 Potential Mechanisms and Reported Rates in the Literature

Incretins have been suspected to relate to pancreatitis, especially as T2DM is associated with the development of acute and chronic pancreatitis. Although the mechanism of action is not yet elucidated, warnings and precautions of pancreatitis are included in the prescribing information for GLP‐1 RAs. Preliminary studies have found that GLP‐1 elicits a beta‐cell preserving effect, and these sustained proliferative actions may cause unintentional exocrine and endocrine effects (e.g. pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer). Acute pancreatitis, specifically fatal haemorrhagic and necrotising types, has been noted, but the causal relationship between GLP‐1 RAs and pancreatitis/pancreatic carcinoma is not yet confirmed. GLP‐1 RAs, thus, are not recommended to be prescribed for patients with a history of pancreatitis and should be discontinued if pancreatitis symptoms develop. However, recent literature has suggested that GLP‐1 RAs can be used in patients with a history of acute pancreatitis, albeit on an individualised basis where the glycaemic, cardiovascular, and weight loss benefits outweigh the risks. A retrospective review of 161 patients with a history of acute pancreatitis at a mean follow‐up of 28.2 months found a total of 16 (9.9%) secondary episodes, of which 6 (37.5%) were attributed to the GLP‐1 RA. The 9.9% rate is lower than a pooled recurrent pancreatitis rate by Li et al. of 21% (95% CI: 18%–24%) and a pooled incidence rate calculated by Gagyi et al. of 5.26 per 100 person‐years (CI: 3.99–6.94).

### Molecular mechanisms of pancreatic injury [^112Edkgm]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite being a subject of much scientific scrutiny, the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis is still not well understood. This article reviews recent advances in our understanding of acute pancreatitis.

Recent Findings

Zymogen activation, observed within acini early during acute pancreatitis for a long time, was shown to be sufficient to induce acute pancreatitis. Another key early event, NFκB activation, has previously been shown to induce acute pancreatitis. The relationship between these two key early steps is beginning to be clarified. Mechanisms of zymogen activation - pathologic calcium signaling, pH changes, colocalization and autophagy, and of NFκB activation have been investigated intensively along with potential therapeutic targets both upstream and downstream of these key events. Additional key findings have been elucidation of the role of bioenergetics and the dual role of oxidative stress in acute pancreatitis, recognition of endoplasmic reticulum stress as an early step and the status of duct cells as important entities in pancreatic injury.

Summary

Current findings have provided further insight into the roles and mechanisms of zymogen activation and inflammatory pathways in pancreatic injury. Future studies, which will be of great importance in identifying therapeutic targets, are being undertaken to establish the relative contributions of these pathways during acute pancreatitis.

### Clinical presentation and natural course of hepatocellular carcinoma [^117USiHB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

The natural history of hepatocellular carcinoma has evolved considerably over past decades. Patient presentation is highly dependent on the severity of underlying hepatic function, although many patients are now diagnosed by screening programmes prior to the development of symptoms. Growth and maturation of hepatocellular carcinoma is variable and involves a complex network of hepatic vasculature. Staging systems have been developed to predict disease progression and survival and continue to undergo investigation.

### ACG clinical guideline: chronic pancreatitis [^115TFJfE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Mechanistic definition of chronic pancreatitis — The guideline contrasts limitations of the traditional clinicopathologic framework with a newer approach and states that the traditional framework "results in years of delay between symptom onset and diagnosis and usually fails to identify or address the underlying etiology, cannot predict the clinical course, cannot direct preventive treatments that change disease trajectory, and remains limited to symptomatic supportive care and replacement of lost gland function". It notes, "In 2016, a new Mechanistic Definition of CP was published, and later adopted by the major pancreas societies as the preferred definition worldwide", and that this definition "describes CP as a pathological fibroinflammatory syndrome of the pancreas in individuals with genetic, environmental, and/or other risk factors who develop persistent pathological responses to parenchymal injury or stress" and is "linked to a progressive model" for risk factors, biomarkers, features, and variables across the lifetime. Within this framework, it is "important to recognize the difference between pancreatic dysfunction, pancreatitis-related disorders, and pancreatic disease", where "The term dysfunction is a dynamic term that describes a variation in the action of an entity that deviates from normal in a negative way", "A medical disorder indicates disruption of the normal functions of specialized cells or systems resulting in abnormal signs, symptoms, biomarkers, and/or responses", and "A disease is an abnormal condition in a living animal that is defined by consensus criteria" including abnormal signs/symptoms, biomarkers, and pathologic features. Examples include that pancreatic dysfunction may be due to a CFTR mutation, and a pancreatitis-related disorder may arise from ductal cell protein dysfunction, which can precipitate "an episode of acute pancreatitis". It further states that pancreatic diseases include "acute pancreatitis, recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP), CP, and complex syndromes that affect the pancreas such as cystic fibrosis", and diagnosis may be made when clinical, functional, and morphologic features meet consensus criteria. The text adds that precision medicine "seeks to use targeted therapy to prevent the condition from progressing to a clinicopathologic-defined disease", but "new studies are needed" and currently "a paucity of studies exists specifically using the new Mechanistic Definition of CP".

### Pathophysiological mechanisms of acute pancreatitis define inflammatory markers of clinical prognosis [^1157Jyqh]. Pancreas (2015). Low credibility.

Development of acute pancreatitis illustrates the need to understand the basic mechanisms of disease progression to drive the exploration of therapeutic options. Cytokines play a major role in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis as underlying systemic inflammatory response, tissue damage, and organ dysfunction. However, little is known about circulating concentrations of these inflammatory markers and their real impact on clinical practice. Experimental studies have suggested that the prognosis for acute pancreatitis depends on the degree of pancreatic necrosis and the intensity of multisystem organ failure generated by the systemic inflammatory response. This suggests an intricate balance between localized tissue damage with proinflammatory cytokine production and a systemic anti-inflammatory response that restricts the inappropriate movement of proinflammatory agents into the circulation. Implication of such mediators suggests that interruption or blunting of an inappropriate immune response has the potential to improve outcome. A detailed understanding of pathophysiological processes and immunological aspects in patients with acute pancreatitis is the basis for the development of therapeutic strategies that will provide significant reductions in morbidity and mortality.

### Critical thresholds: key to unlocking the door to the prevention and specific treatments for acute pancreatitis [^114VWqvp]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP), an acute inflammatory disorder of the exocrine pancreas, is one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases encountered in emergency departments with no specific treatments. Laboratory-based research has formed the cornerstone of endeavours to decipher the pathophysiology of AP, because of the limitations of such study in human beings. While this has provided us with substantial understanding, we cannot answer several pressing questions. These are: (a) Why is it that only a minority of individuals with gallstones, or who drink alcohol excessively, or are exposed to other causative factors develop AP? (b) Why do only some develop more severe manifestations of AP with necrosis and/or organ failure? (c) Why have we been unable to find an effective therapeutic for AP? This manuscript provides a state-of-the-art review of our current understanding of the pathophysiology of AP providing insights into the unanswered clinical questions. We describe multiple protective factors operating in most people, and multiple stressors that in a minority induce AP, independently or together, via amplification loops. We present testable hypotheses aimed at halting progression of severity for the development of effective treatments for this common unpredictable disease.

### Mechanisms of alcoholic pancreatitis. proceedings of a conference. Chicago, Illinois, USA, November 2002 [^111MjXud]. Pancreas (2003). Low credibility.

Long-term, heavy alcohol consumption is associated with both acute and chronic pancreatitis. Progression of pancreatitis may lead to multiple comorbidities including maldigestion, diabetes, and pancreatic cancer. Understanding the underlying molecular, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms by which alcohol ingestion leads to the development of pancreatitis may help to develop strategies for the treatment and prevention of the disease. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the Office of Rare Diseases of National Institutes of Health sponsored a satellite symposium on "Mechanisms of Alcoholic Pancreatitis" at the annual meeting of the American Pancreatic Association, Chicago, IL, November 2002. For this symposium, 8 speakers were invited to address the following issues: (1) epidemiology of alcoholic pancreatitis; (2) pathophysiology of alcoholic pancreatitis; (3) animal models of alcoholic pancreatitis — roles of cholecystokinin (CCK) and viral infections; (4) alcohol and zymogen activation in the pancreatic acinar cell; (5) role of alcohol metabolism in alcoholic pancreatitis; (6) pancreatic stellate cell activation in alcoholic pancreatitis; and (7) genetic predisposition to alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. It was concluded that alcohol abuse is a major contributory factor to the development of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. The injurious effects of ethanol on the pancreas may be mediated through (1) sensitization of acinar cells to CCK-induced premature activation of zymogens; (2) potentiation of the effect of CCK on the activation of transcription factors, nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activating protein-1 (AP-1); (3) generation of toxic metabolites such as acetaldehyde and fatty acid ethyl esters; (4) sensitization of the pancreas to the toxic effects of coxsackievirus B3; and (5) activation of pancreatic stellate cells by acetaldehyde and oxidative stress and subsequent increased production of collagen and other matrix proteins.

### Acute pancreatitis in type 2 diabetes treated with exenatide or sitagliptin: a retrospective observational pharmacy claims analysis [^113iizym]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Data capture for patients included may not have been complete if there were secondary insurance policies that were not administered through Medco or if the patients paid for their medical costs out of pocket. There were likely to have been coding inaccuracies, which are an inherent limitation of claims data. Important to this analysis, the incidence of pancreatitis in this population may be overestimated because providers may have used the acute pancreatitis code when evaluating patients for "rule-out" pancreatitis. However, it is likely that these inaccuracies would affect the diabetic treatment group patients equally. Patients > 63 years of age were excluded because of incomplete data. Our analyses did not include adjustment for medication dose or adherence, and we were not able to confirm that patients were actually taking medications for which claims were filed. We were also unable to investigate the interaction between exenatide and sitagliptin and risk factors for acute pancreatitis because of small numbers. The possibility of asymptomatic chronic pancreatitis and the potential for pancreatic carcinoma with long-term use, as suggested by some experts, was not investigated in this study. A few animal studies have shown incretinomimetic drugs to cause exocrine pancreatic duct hyperplasia that may eventually lead to acute or chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic carcinoma.

Despite these limitations, these data provide valuable information for practicing clinicians weighing potential reported benefits versus risks, including the FDA warning of increased pancreatitis. Although this retrospective analysis cannot rule out with certainty that an association between exenatide, sitagliptin, and acute pancreatitis exists, it appears that exenatide and sitagliptin may not be associated with a large increased risk of acute pancreatitis.

Treatment with the incretin-based therapies appears to be increasing, and there are several new agents that have come to market or may come soon. These agents are attractive in that they may allow treatment intensification while body weight is controlled through mechanisms associated with a low rate of hypoglycemia. Our findings did not reveal any increased risk of acute pancreatitis with exenatide and sitagliptin, but this retrospective study cannot rule out with certainty the existence of such an association.

### Clinical insights into drug-associated pancreatic injury [^112UsrTQ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Drug-induced pancreatitis is one of the top three causes of acute pancreatitis. A drug exposure is traditionally determined to be the cause of pancreatitis only after other possible and common causes of pancreatitis have been excluded.

Recent Findings

In this review, we challenge this traditional notion of drug-induced pancreatitis as a diagnosis of exclusion. Instead, we propose to shift the paradigm of conceptualizing what we term drug-associated pancreatic injury (DAPI); as a continuum of pancreatic injury that can be concomitant with other risk factors. The aims of this targeted review are to harness recent literature to build a foundation for conceptualizing DAPI, to highlight specific drugs associated with DAPI, and to describe a framework for future studies of DAPI.

Summary

Our hope is that probing and characterizing the mechanisms underlying the various types of DAPI will lead to safer use of the DAPI-inducing drugs by minimizing the adverse event of pancreatitis.

### Acute pancreatitis [^113fmCbj]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute pancreatitis:

- **Definition**: Acute pancreatitis is a disease characterized by acute inflammation of the pancreas.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute pancreatitis is most frequently due to gallstones (40%) and alcohol (30%). Other minor causes include ERCP (5–10%), surgical complications (5–10%), drugs (< 5%), hypertriglyceridemia (2–5%), trauma (< 1%), infection (< 1%) and autoimmunity (< 1%).
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of acute pancreatitis ranges from 13 to 45 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: In patients with acute pancreatitis, localized tissue damage causes activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to a systemic inflammatory response that can progress to multiple organ failure and early mortality. The compensatory release of anti-inflammatory mediators plays a role in causing increased susceptibility to septic complications, such as infected pancreatic necrosis, and contributes to late mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Mortality associated with acute pancreatitis is approximately 1–5%, and the recurrence rate is approximately 20%.

### Is previous exposure to hepatitis B a risk factor for pancreatic cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma? [^117DgMrL]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Goals

We evaluated whether prior infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) influences the development of pancreatic cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Background

Prior infection with HBV may predispose patients to developing pancreatic cancer or HCC.

Study

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data from an integrated health care system. We identified all patients who had HBV testing over a 13-year period. These patients were divided into 1 of 3 cohorts based on HBV status: negative infection (n = 28,719), previous exposure (n = 5141), or active infection (n = 404). Pancreatic cancer and HCC data were obtained from pathology reports in the health system's cancer registry.

Results

In a multivariable model, age [hazards ratio (HR), 1.08; confidence interval (CI), 1.06–1.09; P < 0.001)] and presence of diabetes (HR, 1.88; CI, 1.27–2.80; P = 0.002) were identified to have significant influence on pancreatic cancer development, whereas previous HBV exposure did not have a significant influence (HR, 1.41; CI, 0.88–2.27; P = 0.16). In a separate multivariable model, male sex (HR, 2.05; CI, 1.35–3.11; P < 0.001), age (HR, 1.08; CI, 1.06–1.09; P < 0.001), being hepatitis C positive (HR, 5.40; CI, 3.51–8.33; P < 0.001), and presence of cirrhosis (HR, 27.84; CI, 17.43–44.46, P < 0.001) were all significant predictors of HCC. However, previous HBV exposure was not associated with HCC development (HR, 1.03; CI, 0.68–1.56; P = 0.88).

Conclusions

Data from this study indicate that previous HBV exposure is not a risk factor for the development of either pancreatic cancer or HCC.

Objectives

Acute pancreatitis may be the first presentation of pancreatic carcinoma (PaCa). The present study was designed to identify clinical findings suggestive of PaCa in patients with nonalcoholic nongallstone-related (NANG) acute pancreatitis and evaluate accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound for diagnosing PaCa in this setting.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of 332 consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic ultrasound-fine-needle aspiration after acute pancreatitis. Patients with gallstones or common bile duct stones, who were heavy or binge alcohol drinkers, or who had post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis were excluded.

Results

Among 218 patients with NANG acute pancreatitis, 38 patients had PaCa. Age more than 50 years (P = 0.008), history of smoking (P < 0.001), weight loss of 10 lb or greater (P = 0.003), serum bilirubin levels of higher than 2 mg/dL (P = 0.035) or serum alkaline phosphatase level of higher than 165 U/mL (in patients with normal serum bilirubin levels) (P = 0.003), and radiological findings of an identifiable pancreatic mass (P = 0.001) or distal pancreatic atrophy (P = 0.006) had significant association with an underlying PaCa on multivariate analysis. Of the 38 patients with PaCa in this cohort, 37 had 2 or more of these findings. Endoscopic ultrasound-fine-needle aspiration had 99.5% accuracy (98.6, 100%) for diagnosing carcinoma in this clinical setting.

Conclusions

The clinical criteria defined previously potentially can help select patients with NANG acute pancreatitis with a higher likelihood of an underlying pancreatic neoplasm for further imaging.

### Acute pancreatitis [^114pmV2v]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

The pathophysiologic concept of acute pancreatitis focuses on early events inside acinar cells such as activation of trypsin. Despite significant progress in the understanding of molecular events in experimental pancreatitis, knowledge of these mechanisms has not yet been translated into therapeutic strategies useful in humans. A single morphologic or laboratory marker reliably predicting the individual course of acute pancreatitis still awaits discovery. The clinical outcome of acute pancreatitis is dependent on the presence of necrosis and systemic complications. The extent of the systemic inflammatory response to local pancreatitis seems to be the rate-limiting step. Several mechanisms shed light on the interconnectivity between intra-acinar protease activation and immunoregulatory processes. Deciphering these cell biologic connections has already had an impact on the clinical management of patients and the identification of prognostic markers in human disease. However, further investigations of pancreatic pathophysiology are needed to initiate novel therapeutic strategies.

### Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol (Previfem) [^114E1Uoh]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

5.2 Liver Disease

Impaired Liver Function

Do not use Previfem®or Tri-Previfem®in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Previfem®or Tri-Previfem®if jaundice develops.

Liver Tumors

Previfem®and Tri-Previfem®are contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.

5.3 High Blood Pressure

Previfem®and Tri-Previfem®are contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Previfem®and Tri-Previfem®if blood pressure rises significantly.

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.

5.4 Gallbladder Disease

Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis.

5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects

Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Previfem®or Tri-Previfem®. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance.

Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.

Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.

Key concepts — diagnosis, etiology, and natural history in chronic pancreatitis: pancreatic function testing is an important means of diagnosing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; however, its role in establishing the diagnosis of CP is complementary; in patients with clinical features of CP, a comprehensive review of all risk factors should be performed, which provides information on mechanisms, identifies fixed and modifiable risk factors, potential targets for therapies, and prognostic information; identification of the disorder(s) underlying pancreatic inflammation is important in predicting progression to CP; the development of DM in CP is most likely related to duration of disease, although other etiologic factors such as BMI and smoking status may incur an increased risk; there is a lack of evidence to suggest that performing screening examinations on patients with CP to detect pancreatic malignancy is beneficial.

### Fatal ischemic acute pancreatitis complicating trans-catheter arterial embolization of small hepatocellular carcinoma: do the risks outweigh the benefits? [^1127RPmc]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an accepted indication for liver transplantation (LT). Pre-LT adjuvant ablation treatments to prevent tumour progression and drop out from the waiting list have been increasingly adopted at most transplant centers. Trans-catheter arterial chemo-embolization (TACE) is frequently used, but the procedure can be difficult and severe complications may arise. Among them, acute ischemic pancreatitis occasionally occurs and may clinically mimic a post-embolization syndrome. Fatal outcomes of this complication have been reported exceptionally but never in patients awaiting LT. The present case raises concern about the widespread application of TACE and highlights the need for a critical evaluation of the risks and benefits to patients with monofocal small HCC who are scheduled for LT. Superselective embolization of the tumour-feeding artery and systematic monitoring of serum pancreatic enzymes after this radiological procedure are recommended.

### Workup and management of immune-mediated hepatobiliary pancreatic toxicities that develop during immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment [^113CVhyC]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of a wide range of cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma. Workup and management of immune-mediated hepatitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis that develops during immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment can be challenging. Immune-mediated hepatitis can be particularly challenging if patients have underlying viral hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis. Patients with positive hepatitis B virus DNA should be referred to a hepatologist for antiviral therapy prior to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. With untreated hepatitis C virus (HCV) and elevated liver enzymes, a liver biopsy should be obtained to differentiate between HCV infection and immune-mediated hepatitis due to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. If autoimmune serologies are negative, then this supports a case of immune-mediated hepatitis secondary to anti-PD-1 therapy, rather than autoimmune hepatitis. In this case, an empiric steroid therapy is reasonable; however, if the patient does not respond to steroid therapy in 3–5days, then liver biopsy should be pursued. The incidence of immune checkpoint-induced pancreatitis is low, but when it does occur, diagnosis is not straightforward. Although routine monitoring of pancreatic enzymes is not generally recommended, when pancreatitis is suspected, serum levels of amylase and lipase should be checked. Once confirmed, a steroid or other immunosuppressant (if steroids are contraindicated) should be administered along with close monitoring, and a slow tapering dosage once the pancreatitis is under control. Patients should then be monitored for recurrent pancreatitis. Finally, immune therapy-related cholangitis involves elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase and, once diagnosed, is managed in the same way as immune-mediated hepatitis. KEY POINTS: Immune-mediated hepatitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis are found in patients receiving or who have previously received immune checkpoint inhibitors. To work up immune-mediated hepatitis, viral, and autoimmune serologies, liver imaging will help to differentiate immune-mediated hepatitis from hepatitis of other etiology. Hepatology consult may be considered in patients with a history of chronic liver disease who developed hepatitis during immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. Liver biopsy should be considered to clarify the diagnosis for case in which the hepatitis is refractory to steroid or immunosuppressant treatment. Immune-mediated pancreatitis is treated with steroid or other immunosuppressant with a slow tapering and should be monitored for recurrence.
