## Question

What causes air in the liver

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of "air in the liver" and how to differentiate and manage them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise terminology and anatomical localization on imaging. Then, I should categorize the major etiologies: portal venous gas, pneumobilia, and direct hepatic parenchymal or vascular air. Next, I will detail each category with mechanisms, common causes, and red flags. After that, I need to distinguish mimics and iatrogenic or expected post-procedural air. Finally, I will outline diagnostic strategies and management principles tailored to the underlying cause, ensuring I verify imaging patterns and procedural histories carefully.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misclassify the finding. "Air in the liver" on cross-sectional imaging typically refers to portal venous gas (aeroportia), pneumobilia (air in the biliary tree), or less commonly parenchymal gas from abscesses or direct venous embolism; recognizing these compartments and their imaging patterns is critical for triage and management [^115iPAW7] [^113Svcac].

> Now, I will categorize the major causes, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify that each bucket truly reflects the pathophysiology and imaging patterns described in the literature. The principal categories are portal venous gas from bowel or mesenteric processes, pneumobilia from biliary-enteric communications or sphincter incompetence, and direct parenchymal/vascular air from gas-forming infections, interventions, or venous embolism, with an additional fourth category of mimics and expected post-procedural air that can confound interpretation [^115iPAW7] [^114W1jfM] [^113Svcac].

> For portal venous gas, I need to ensure I remember that it tracks peripherally with a branching pattern to the subcapsular periphery and is classically linked to bowel ischemia or necrosis. However, wait, I should double-check the evolving spectrum — non-ischemic causes now account for a substantial share, including inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, sepsis, and iatrogenic sources such as umbilical venous catheterization or endoscopic procedures, and the mortality has decreased as non-ischemic etiologies are recognized earlier [^115iPAW7] [^114oBhBT] [^114hUp2k].

> Mechanistically, I will now examine how gas reaches the portal system. Gas can dissect through a compromised bowel wall (pneumatosis intestinalis) into mesenteric veins and then the portal venous branches, or it can arise from gas-forming bacteria during intra-abdominal sepsis. Transient portal venous gas can also follow umbilical venous catheter manipulation and, in some postoperative or post-CPR contexts, reflects mesenteric hypoperfusion and ischemia, so I should confirm clinical context before labeling it catastrophic [^117J9WPQ] [^111hjbo5] [^113XxYPa] [^114vEf5N].

> For pneumobilia, let me consider the central, gravity-dependent distribution following the direction of bile flow. I should confirm the classic causes — biliary-enteric surgical anastomoses, sphincter of Oddi incompetence, and spontaneous biliary-enteric fistulas including cholecystoenteric and choledochoduodenal fistulas. Post-ERCP air is often expected and can persist for weeks to months, but in non-post-surgical, non-ERCP patients, new pneumobilia warrants evaluation for a fistulous communication [^114W1jfM] [^11166WTC] [^117Ug22U].

> I should also review complications linked to pneumobilia. Stones eroding through the gallbladder wall can create a cholecystoenteric fistula and lead to gallstone ileus or even Bouveret's syndrome, and patients may have recurrent cholangitis. Thus, when I see pneumobilia without a clear iatrogenic cause, I need to check for obstruction and fistula, ideally with MRCP or careful endoscopic evaluation if feasible [^1116YZQx] [^11166WTC].

> Direct hepatic parenchymal or vascular air is less common but important. Emphysematous cholecystitis can extend gas into the liver parenchyma and even produce pneumoperitoneum or retroperitoneal gas via fascial planes; gas-forming liver abscesses can also contain air; venous air embolism during liver surgery or ERCP, while rare, can be life-threatening and requires immediate recognition and supportive care; let me verify that the imaging in such cases often shows parenchymal or perihepatic gas collections rather than purely portal or biliary patterns [^117TZic2] [^117LQEto] [^114iFFi6] [^1178vWd2].

> But wait, what if the "air" is actually a mimic or an expected post-procedural finding? Post-ERCP pneumobilia is common and benign. Intrahepatic gas after tumor ablation or embolization is anticipated. Femoral venous catheters can introduce hepatic venous gas that mimics portal or biliary air. In the ICU, multiplanar reconstructions help distinguish catheter-related hepatic venous gas from true portal venous gas or pneumobilia. In neonates, umbilical venous catheter–related portal venous gas is typically transient and resolves without intervention, so I should confirm device position and timing before escalating care [^117Ug22U] [^113Svcac] [^116ZKVCC] [^113XxYPa].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and key discriminators. On CT, portal venous gas appears as peripheral, branching lucencies tracking to the capsule, whereas pneumobilia tends to be central and follows the bile ducts; clinical correlation is essential — hemodynamic instability, peritoneal signs, and lactate elevation push toward ischemia, whereas a known sphincterotomy or Roux-en-Y favors expected pneumobilia; in the NICU, bedside ultrasound can detect portal venous gas and differentiate it from pneumobilia by distribution and Doppler features; when NEC is suspected, PVG supports the diagnosis but quantity does not guide severity, so I must integrate clinical status [^115iPAW7] [^114W1jfM] [^114oBhBT].

> Hold on, I should verify the imaging modality nuances. Multiplanar reformatted CT is decisive for localizing gas to portal veins, biliary ducts, or hepatic veins and for identifying the underlying cause such as bowel wall changes, mesenteric venous gas, abscess, or fistula. Ultrasound can rapidly detect PVG and guide neonatal management. Post-procedural studies should be interpreted with awareness of expected air, contrast layering, and stent positions to avoid overcalling complications [^115iPAW7] [^114oBhBT] [^117Ug22U].

> Management hinges on etiology, so I need to ensure I'm aligning treatment with the cause. For portal venous gas due to bowel ischemia, urgent surgical consultation and exploration are indicated when clinical and imaging features suggest necrosis; conversely, stable patients with non-ischemic portal venous gas may be managed conservatively with supportive care and source control; for pneumobilia from a fistula, definitive management addresses the fistula and stones; for emphysematous cholecystitis or gas-forming abscess, timely broad-spectrum antibiotics and source control (cholecystectomy or drainage) are critical; for venous air embolism, immediate supportive measures include Trendelenburg positioning, 100% oxygen, hemodynamic support, and hyperbaric oxygen when available, with procedural prevention strategies during liver surgery and ERCP to minimize risk [^115qTvHj] [^114hUp2k] [^117TZic2] [^1178vWd2] [^114AzYsX].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. Air in the liver is a radiologic sign, not a diagnosis. Distinguishing portal venous gas from pneumobilia and from parenchymal/vascular air using CT patterns and clinical context is the critical first step. The spectrum has shifted toward more non-ischemic causes of portal venous gas, but ischemia remains the most dangerous and must be excluded urgently. Expected post-procedural air should be recognized to avoid unnecessary interventions. And management is cause-specific, ranging from emergent laparotomy to conservative care or targeted endoscopic/surgical therapy [^115iPAW7] [^113Svcac] [^114W1jfM].

---

Air in the liver, or hepatic gas, arises from **three main mechanisms**: (1) **iatrogenic** sources such as surgery, ERCP, or TACE; (2) **infectious** causes like gas-forming bacteria in abscesses or emphysematous cholecystitis; and (3) **ischemic** processes such as mesenteric ischemia causing portal venous gas [^113Svcac] [^114W1jfM] [^117J9WPQ]. Imaging reliably distinguishes these entities: **portal venous gas** appears as peripheral, branching lucencies, whereas **pneumobilia** is central and follows the biliary tree [^115iPAW7]. Management is cause-specific, ranging from observation for benign iatrogenic gas to urgent surgery for ischemia or source control for infection [^115qTvHj].

---

## Iatrogenic causes

Iatrogenic causes are the **most common** source of hepatic gas and are typically benign:

- **Surgical interventions**: Laparoscopic or open liver surgery, hepaticojejunostomy, or choledochojejunostomy can introduce air into the biliary tree or portal venous system [^113Svcac] [^111vys2H].

- **Endoscopic procedures**: ERCP with sphincterotomy or balloon dilation can cause pneumobilia via biliary-enteric fistula or sphincter incompetence [^114W1jfM] [^117Ug22U].

- **Interventional radiology**: TACE, TIPS, or percutaneous biliary interventions may introduce air into hepatic vessels or biliary tree [^113Svcac].

---

## Infectious causes

Infectious etiologies produce gas via **gas-forming bacteria**:

- **Emphysematous cholecystitis**: Clostridial infection of the gallbladder with gas in the wall and lumen; gas may extend into the liver [^111L7oXC] [^117TZic2].

- **Hepatic abscesses**: Gas-forming organisms (e.g. Klebsiella, Clostridium) can produce parenchymal gas [^113Svcac].

- **Necrotizing infections**: Gas gangrene or necrotizing fasciitis involving the hepatobiliary region can seed hepatic gas [^notfound].

---

## Ischemic causes

Ischemia permits gas to dissect into the portal venous system, producing **portal venous gas (PVG)** — historically ominous but now recognized to have a broader differential:

- **Mesenteric ischemia**: Bowel infarction with gas dissecting into portal veins is the classic cause of PVG [^115iPAW7] [^112wxYrb].

- **Bowel obstruction**: Increased intraluminal pressure can force gas through the mucosa into the portal system [^111hjbo5].

- **Postoperative states**: PVG may occur after bowel surgery without ischemia, often resolving spontaneously [^117EyGXu].

---

## Imaging characteristics

Imaging is **essential** to localize and characterize hepatic gas:

| **Type of gas** | **Imaging features** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Portal venous gas | Peripheral, branching lucencies following portal venous flow | - Suggests ischemia or increased intraluminal pressure <br/> - But can be benign postoperative |
| Pneumobilia | Central, tubular lucencies following biliary tree | - Suggests biliary-enteric fistula or sphincter incompetence <br/> - Often benign post-ERCP |
| Parenchymal gas | Irregular, clustered lucencies within liver parenchyma | Suggests abscess or necrotizing infection |

---

## Clinical significance and management

Clinical significance and management **depend on the cause**:

- **Iatrogenic gas**: Usually benign; observe and reassure [^117Ug22U].

- **Infectious gas**: Urgent antibiotics and source control (drainage or surgery) [^117TZic2].

- **Ischemic gas**: Emergent surgical exploration for bowel infarction or obstruction [^115qTvHj].

Air in the liver reflects iatrogenic, infectious, or ischemic processes; **accurate imaging** and clinical correlation guide **targeted management**.

### Ruptured splenic abscess: a cause of pneumoperitoneum in a patient with AIDS [^1132DPTn]. Emergency Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

We encountered a case of pneumoperitoneum caused by a gas-forming splenic abscess in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Plain abdominal films and computed tomography demonstrated a large amount of free air. Pneumoperitoneum was eventually shown to represent gas liberated from fermentation by gas-forming organisms within the splenic abscess. Gas-containing necrotic tissue from the ruptured spleen mimicked the spillage of feces from colon perforation. The authors emphasize that a ruptured abscess should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in an immunocompromised patient.

Risk factors

Risk factors like previous biliary interventions, hepatobiliary surgery, portosystemic shunts, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage, liver abscess, blunt trauma to the liver, gastric ulcer, bilio-venous fistula, Billroth II or Roux-en-Y, should alert the endoscopist for possible air embolism during or after ERCP if they notice any signs or symptoms. Sphincterotomy during ERCP can disrupt the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier and it can result in shunts between the veins in duodenal wall and intestinal cavity. In patients with blunt hepatic trauma causing bile leak and lacerated hepatic veins, air/CO 2 insufflation during ERCP can potentially cause gas to enter into the IVC from the lacerated hepatic veins, although this is extremely rare in clinical practice. Air embolism can travel into the right ventricle from the IVC and to the lungs leading to impaired gas exchange and cardiac failure. Budd-Chiari syndrome causes chronic inflammation from biliary strictures which potentially leads to bilio-venous fistula. The risk of air embolism is increased during ERCP with preexisting bilio-venous fistula from air insufflation and sphincterotomy. Also, in patients with difficult cannulation during ERCP for obstructive jaundice who undergo percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) are more prone to bilio-venous fistula which could be a risk factor for air embolism. Cholangitis from biliary stones can lead to focal weakening of bile duct wall and adhesions with adjacent structures and are more prone to develop bilio-venous fistula, a high risk for air embolism. According to Afreen et al, the incidence of air embolism is more in ERCP involving stent removal with replacement and cholangioscopy. Cholangioscopy is sometimes used when there are equivocal ERCP findings to evaluate the extent of cholangiocarcinoma before surgery, biliary stones not identified by routine cholangiography, treatment of difficult bile duct stones and for evaluation of indeterminate biliary strictures. Biliary stones and strictures cause inflammation which could lead to bilio-venous fistula and hence they are more prone to air embolism during cholangioscopy.

### Imaging the postoperative patient: long-term complications of gastrointestinal surgery [^117J9WPQ]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Multiplanar reformatted images may prove decisive in achieving correct diagnosis of a closed-loop obstruction.

CT findings of strangulated obstruction include wall thickening, altered pattern of enhancement of the bowel wall, dilated mesenteric veins, mesenteric edema, ascites, pneumatosis intestinalis, pneumatosis portalis and pneumoperitoneum.

The most common CT finding in bowel ischemia, although nonspecific, is bowel wall thickening. It is caused by mural edema (low attenuation before contrast administration), hemorrhage (high attenuation before contrast administration) and/or superinfection of the ischemic bowel wall. If unenhanced CT is not performed prior to contrast-enhanced CT, the ability to differentiate between intramural hemorrhage and hyperemia and/or hyperperfusion is impaired.

On contrast-enhanced CT, a highly specific but less sensitive finding is absent or diminished parietal contrast enhancement. In some cases, prolonged enhancement due to delayed return of the venous blood, with subsequent slowing of the arterial supply, can also be seen.

As ischemia advances, venules in the mesentery become engorged with blood. Mesenteric fat stranding due to edema and/or ascites is also a nonspecific CT finding in acute bowel ischemia (Figs. 4 and 5). In a recent prospective study, fluid in the mesentery adjacent to abnormal (thickened, dilated or both) bowel loops was the individual sign most frequently associated with strangulation (88%) and had an extremely high negative predictive value.

Fig. 5
Patient with strangulated obstruction. Engorged mesenteric veins (arrows) associated with mesenteric edema (star) and free fluid (arrowhead) are seen

When bowel wall thinning rather than thickening occurs, transmural small-bowel infarction has probably already ensued. In this setting, it is also more likely for pneumatosis intestinalis, pneumatosis portalis and pneumoperitoneum to develop (Fig. 6). Pneumatosis intestinalis is caused by dissection of luminal gas into the bowel wall across the compromised mucosa. Portomesenteric venous gas is due to the propagation of that gas to the mesenteric venous system, towards the liver. Free intraperitoneal air represents perforation of the gangrenous bowel loop.

### Low pneumoperitoneum pressure reduces gas embolism during laparoscopic liver resection: a randomized controlled trial [^114AzYsX]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

History of abdominal surgery, preoperative anticipation of possible intraoperative venous injury, and liver cirrhosishave been reported to affect the occurrence of gas embolism during LLR; hence, these 3 factors were stratified and included in the prespecified subgroup analyses. In addition, the risk of gas embolism may increase during the surgical transection of lesions proximal to major vessels. The relationship between hepatic lesions and major vessels relates to the difficulty of the procedure. Compared with anterolateral liver segment resection, posterosuperior segment resection requires more time for the dissection of the short hepatic vein and right hepatic vein to control the inflow, and is associated with an increased risk of gas embolism. Our center adopted the Pringle maneuver to encircle the hepatoduodenal ligament for inflow occlusion. After hepatoduodenal ligament clamping, the cardiac index decreases, but the reflex produced by clamping increases systemic vascular resistance which may generate an increase in MAP. The Pringle method can rapidly reduce the blood flow and pressure of the hepatic vein and IVC. The risk of gas embolism is then increased by a low CVP and lower pressure of the hepatic veins, particularly when the blood inflow is restored, which mobilizes gas bubbles trapped in any opened vein. Unclamping of the hepatic pedicle is associated with a decrease in blood pressure due to the deactivation of the reflex produced by clamping, as well as by ischemia-reperfusion effects. Based on the mentioned reality, the space-occupying liver lesion location, liver resection difficulty, and hepatic inflow occlusion use were further included in post hoc subgroup analyses to characterize the effects of PP on the incidence of severe gas embolism in different populations (Fig. 3).

### Comparison of segmentation-based attenuation correction methods for PET / MRI: evaluation of bone and liver standardized uptake value with oncologic PET / CT data [^111yjmEc]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

For attenuation correction (AC) in PET/MRI systems, segmentation-based methods are most often used. However, the standardized uptake value (SUV) of lesions in the bone and liver, which have higher attenuation coefficients than other organs, can be underestimated, potentially leading to misinterpretation of clinical cases. Errors in SUV estimation are also dependent on the segmentation schemes used in the segmentation-based AC. In this study, this potential bias in SUV estimation using 4 different segmentation-based AC methods was evaluated for the PET/CT data of cancer patients with bone and liver lesions.

Methods

Forty patients who had spine or liver lesions and underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT participated (18 women and 22 men; 20 spine lesions and 20 liver lesions; mean age (± SD), 60.5 ± 11.4 y; mean body weight, 57.7 ± 10.4 kg). The patient body region was extracted from the CT image and categorized into 5 tissue groups (air, lungs, fat, water, and bone) using Hounsfield unit thresholds, which were determined from the CT histogram. Four segmentation-based AC methods (SLA [soft-tissue/lung/air], WFLA [water/fat/lung/air], SLAB [soft-tissue/lung/air/bone], and WFLAB [water/fat/lung/air/bone]) were compared with CT-based AC. The mean attenuation coefficient for each group was calculated from 40 CT images and assigned to the attenuation maps. PET sinograms were reconstructed using segmentation- and CT-based AC maps, and mean SUV in the lesions was compared.

Results

Mean attenuation coefficients for air, lungs, fat, water, and bone were 0.0058, 0.0349, 0.0895, 0.0987, and 0.1178 cm(-1), respectively. In the spine lesions, the SUVs were underestimated by 16.4% ± 8.5% (SLA AC) and 14.7% ± 7.5% (WFLA AC) but not to a statistically significant extent for SLAB and WFLAB AC relative to CT AC. In the liver lesions, the SUVs were underestimated by 11.1% ± 2.6%, 8.1% ± 3.0%, 6.8% ± 3.8%, and 4.1% ± 3.8% with SLA, SLAB, WFLA, and WFLAB AC, respectively.

Conclusion

Without bone segmentation, the SUVs of spine lesions were considerably underestimated; however, the bias was acceptable with bone segmentation. In liver lesions, the segmentation-based AC methods yielded a negative bias in SUV; however, inclusion of the bone and fat segments reduced the SUV bias. The results of this study will be useful for understanding organ-dependent bias in SUV between PET/CT and PET/MRI.

### Trends in cancer incidence and potential associated factors in China [^116AT4v4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

For 5 of 32 cancers (stomach, liver, larynx, bone, and nose and sinuses), the AIRs significantly decreased in both females and males from 1983–1987 to 2013–2017 (Table 2). For instance, in males, AIRS decreased from 46.49 per 100 000 person-years to 27.08 (AAPC = −1.74%; 95% CI, −1.94% to −1.43%) for stomach cancer, and from 33.67 per 100 000 person-years to 24.53 (AAPC = −0.83%; 95% CI, −1.17% to −0.01%) for liver cancer. In females, these rates decreased from 19.34 per 100 000 person-years to 11.52 (AAPC = −1.67%; 95% CI, −1.96% to −1.07%) for stomach cancer and from 11.42 per 100 000 person-years to 8.12 (AAPC = −1.18%; 95% CI, −1.36% to −0.77%) for liver cancer. During 2018–2022 to 2028–2032, the AIRs of larynx, liver, stomach, and nose and sinuses cancers were expected to keep decreasing (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1).

### Pentazocine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride (pentazocine and naloxone) [^111m5GoZ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Porphyria

Particular caution should be exercised in administering pentazocine to patients with porphyria since it may provoke an acute attack in susceptible individuals.

Cardiovascular Disease

Pentazocine can elevate blood pressure, possibly through the release of endogenous catecholamines. Particular caution should be exercised in conditions where alterations in vascular resistance and blood pressure might be particularly undesirable, such as in the acute phase of myocardial infarction.

Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets should be used with caution in patients with myocardial infarction who have nausea or vomiting.

Imp aired Renal or Hepatic Function

Decreased metabolism of pentazocine by the liver in extensive liver disease may predispose to accentuation of side effects. Although laboratory tests have not indicated that pentazocine causes or increases renal or hepatic impairment, the drug should be administered with caution to patients with such impairment.

Biliary Surge ry

Narcotic drug products are generally considered to elevate biliary tract pressure for varying periods following their administration. Some evidence suggests that pentazocine may differ from other marketed narcotics in this respect (i.e., it causes little or no elevation in biliary tract pressures). The clinical significance of these findings, however, is not yet known.

### Air pollution and its impact on cancer incidence, cancer care and cancer outcomes [^116AF49L]. BMJ Oncology (2025). High credibility.

GI malignancies

Small particles readily absorbed in the lungs following inhalation can be delivered through the bloodstream, then get deposited in other body tissues including the gut.PM reaching the bronchioles and alveolar spaces may be phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, then sequestered and trapped in the airway by a protective mucus layer. The trapped particles are propelled by cilia through the oropharynx and into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract through mucociliary clearance. Mucociliary transport of PM inhaled in the lungs and then cleared into the upper GI tract has been demonstrated in human studies of non-smokers.

A systematic review and meta-analysis by Pritchett et al assessed whether exposure to outdoor PM was associated with GI cancers. The results from the meta-analysis indicate that PM exposure may be associated with mortality or incidence for some GI cancers, particularly colorectal and liver. Fu et al found a strong association between PM exposure and increased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, identifying 10 eligible studies across multiple countries and regions in North America and Asia. It revealed an association between PM and increased risk of CRC and mortality. The elevated risks of CRC associated with PM were different across countries and regions. Incidence and mortality risks were noted to be higher in North America than in Asia.

### Hepatic gas: widening spectrum of causes detected at CT and US in the interventional era [^113Svcac]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

The spectrum of causes of hepatic gas detected at computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US) is widening. There are many iatrogenic and noniatrogenic causes of hepatic parenchymal, biliary, hepatic venous, and portal venous gas. Hepatic gas may be an indicator of serious acute disease (infarct, infection, abscess, bowel inflammation, or trauma). In other clinical scenarios, it may be an expected finding related to therapeutic interventions (such as surgery; hepatic artery embolization for a tumor or for active bleeding in acute trauma cases; percutaneous tumor ablation performed with radiofrequency, cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation, or ethanol). In some cases, hepatic gas is an incidental finding of no clinical significance. Familiarity with the expanding list of newer intervention-related causes of hepatic gas detected at CT and US, knowledge of the patient's clinical history, and a careful search for associated clues on images are all factors that may allow the radiologist to better determine the clinical relevance of this finding.

### Association of metabolic signatures of air pollution with MASLD: observational and mendelian randomization study [^111GKE6Y]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Air pollution is a significant public health issue and an important risk factor for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), though the underlying mechanisms of this association are unknown. Herein, we aimed to identify metabolic signatures associated with exposure to ambient air pollution and to explore their associations with the risk of MASLD.

Methods

We utilized data from the UK Biobank cohort. Annual mean concentrations of PM 2.5, PM 10, NO 2 and NO x were assessed for each participant using bilinear interpolation. The elastic net regression model was used to identify metabolites associated with four air pollutants and to construct metabolic signatures. Associations between air pollutants, metabolic signatures and MASLD were analyzed using Cox models. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to examine potential causality. Mediation analysis was employed to examine the role of metabolic signatures in the association between air pollutants and MASLD.

Results

A total of 244,842 participants from the UK Biobank were included in this analysis. We identified 87, 65, 76, and 71 metabolites as metabolic signatures of PM 2.5, PM 10, NO 2, and NO x, respectively. Metabolic signatures were associated with risk of MASLD, with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of 1.10 (1.06–1.14), 1.06 (1.02–1.10), 1.24 (1.20–1.29) and 1.14 (1.10–1.19), respectively. The four pollutants were associated with increased risk of MASLD, with HRs (95% CIs) of 1.03 (1.01–1.05), 1.02 (1.01–1.04), 1.01 (1.01–1.02) and 1.01 (1.00–1.01), respectively. MR analysis indicated an association between PM 2.5, NO 2 and NO x -related metabolic signatures and MASLD. Metabolic signatures mediated the association of PM 2.5, PM 10, NO 2 and NO x with MASLD.

Conclusion

PM 2.5, PM 10, NO 2 and NO x -related metabolic signatures appear to be associated with MASLD. These signatures mediated the increased risk of MASLD associated with PM 2.5, PM 10, NO 2 and NO x.

Impact and Implications

Air pollution is a significant public health issue and an important risk factor for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), however, the mechanism by which air pollution affects MASLD remains unclear. Our study used integrated serological metabolic data of 251 metabolites from a large-scale cohort study to demonstrate that metabolic signatures play a crucial role in the elevated risk of MASLD caused by air pollution. These results are relevant to patients and policymakers because they suggest that air pollution-related metabolic signatures are not only potentially associated with MASLD but also involved in mediating the process by which PM 2.5, PM 10, NO 2, and NO x increase the risk of MASLD. Focusing on changes in air pollution-related metabolic signatures may offer a new perspective for preventing air pollution-induced MASLD and serve as protective measures to address this emerging public health challenge.

### Organ-specific effects of oxygen and carbogen gas inhalation on tissue longitudinal relaxation times [^1154wccG]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Molecular oxygen has been previously shown to shorten longitudinal relaxation time (T1) in the spleen and renal cortex, but not in the liver or fat. In this study, the magnitude and temporal evolution of this effect were investigated. Medical air, oxygen, and carbogen (95% oxygen/5% CO2) were administered sequentially in 16 healthy volunteers. T1 maps were acquired using spoiled gradient echo sequences (TR = 3.5 ms, TE = 0.9 ms, alpha = 2 degrees/8 degrees/17 degrees) with six acquisitions on air, 12 on oxygen, 12 on carbogen, and six to 12 back on air. Mean T1 values and change in relaxation rate were compared between each phase of gas inhalation in the liver, spleen, skeletal muscle, renal cortex, and fat by one-way analysis of variance. Oxygen-induced T1-shortening occurred in the liver in fasted subjects (P < 0.001) but not in non-fasted subjects (P = 0.244). T1-shortening in spleen and renal cortex (both P < 0.001) were greater than previously reported. Carbogen induced conflicting responses in different organs, suggesting a complex relationship with organ vasculature. Shortening of tissue T1 by oxygen is more pronounced and more complex than previously recognized. The effect may be useful as a biomarker of arterial flow and oxygen delivery to vascular beds.

### Adverse events associated with ERCP [^1178vWd2]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

Air embolism during ERCP — risk factors, recognition, and management — is described as a rare but potentially devastating adverse event caused by direct communication with the vasculature and an external pressure gradient allowing air into the circulation; mechanisms include trauma or inflammation of the bile ducts from contrast administration, insufflation, or from the endoscope or ERCP accessories, and it has been associated with direct cholangioscopy. Venous air embolism presents with air in the portal vein and can be managed conservatively with IV antibiotics and decompression via nasogastric tube, although portal vein gas can also be seen with perforation and intestinal ischemia and should be evaluated in context. Systemic air embolism, including intracardiac and intracerebral air embolism, is highly lethal and should be considered with sudden hypotension or hypoxia on repositioning or new neurologic symptoms after the procedure; if suspected, the patient should be endotracheally intubated, ventilated with 100% oxygen, and positioned in Trendelenburg and left lateral decubitus to minimize cerebral air transit and encourage air egress from the right ventricular outflow.

### Spontaneous intracardiac microcavitations in a patient with a colonic carcinoma [^113w2K3m]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

The port entry, therefore, must be detected. In our case, it seemed to be the colonic adenoma. Scarce literature underlines the plausibility for our theory and is sequentially presented here to explain the bubbles' journey from the port of entry to the cardiac cavities.

The first stage is the way to the portal venous system, the venous drainage of the colonic cancer described. Hepatic portal venous gas, is a rare finding, but is described in a variety of intestinal pathologies such as infections, ulcers or ileus. Li et al describe hepatic portal gas in a patient with colonic cancer, suggesting that neoplastic pathologies can also serve as a port of entry.

The transition of the bubbles from the portal venous system to the cardiac cavities must have been facilitated by the metastases: air usually can be cleared from all organs within minutes to hours, as shown in a study after cardiac surgery. The liver also seems to effectively clear hepatic portal gas.

However, portosystemic and hepatopulmonary shunting is known to occur during radioembolisation of hepatic metastases with particles of 20–60 μm diameters. The shunt fraction of the microparticles varies between 1% and 10%, depending on the angiogenetic characteristics within the neoplasia. These particles are about the same size as the microbubbles described.

Neoplastic angiogenesis can lead to malformations, making portosystemic shunting possible. In an assessment of angiogenesis in colonic cancer, the vessels were irregular, widely branched and of highly variable calibre, assuming that the angiogenesis of the metastases are the same, portacaval and therefore porto-cardiac shunting is highly possible.

For our patient, we could not find any other source of the microbubbles but the colonic neoplasia.

Causes of vitamin D deficiency — factors summarized in Table 6 include decreased vitamin D synthesis (skin pigmentation; physical agents blocking ultraviolet radiation [UVR] exposure such as sunscreen, clothing, and shade), geographic influences (latitude, season, air pollution, cloud cover, altitude), decreased maternal vitamin D stores and exclusive breastfeeding, malabsorption conditions (celiac disease, pancreatic insufficiency [cystic fibrosis], biliary obstruction [biliary atresia]), and decreased synthesis or increased degradation of 25(OH)-D from chronic liver disease and drugs such as rifampicin, isoniazid, and anticonvulsants.

### All about portal vein: a pictorial display to anatomy, variants and physiopathology [^115iPAW7]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Portal venous gas

Portal venous gas (aeroportia) was traditionally considered a life-threatening sign thought to be a finding almost exclusive of advanced mesenteric ischemia. Nowadays, other recognized causes of portal venous gas include inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, bowel distention, intra-abdominal sepsis, trauma, iatrogenic, and idiopathic causes. Imaging findings on CT relates to a linear, branching pattern, or ovoid areas with gas attenuation, within the main PV or its branches (Fig. 20). As aeroportia needs to be distinguished from pneumobilia (gas in bile ducts), it has to be taken into account the pattern of gas distribution: peripheral in portal venous gas, even reaching the sub-capsular areas, and central in pneumobilia, following the direction of the portal venous flow and biliary drainage, respectively.

Fig. 20
Portal venous gas. MPR images from portal venous phase CT shows air branching pattern fulfilling some segments of peripheral right PV branches

Portal hypertension

Clinically significant PH is defined as a portal venous pressure above 10 mmHg, and it is associated with an increased risk of developing varices and variceal bleeding.

When pressure increases, PVS rearranges, and one of the first signs is the increase of veins caliber: PV (> 13 mm), SMV, and splenic vein (> 10 mm). One should note that no significant venous dilatation might be present in PH in case of compensatory portosystemic collateral pathways. In the initial stages of PH increased diameter and tortuosity of hepatic artery and its branches may also be seen, as a result of hepatic venous inflow disturbance. Along with these findings, splenomegaly (Fig. 21) is frequently present, considered when splenic bipolar diameter is increased (> 130 mm in males and > 120 mm in females). In more advanced cases, ascites may occur as a result of decompensated PH. PVS calcification has a strong association with long standing PH, regardless of the underlying etiology (Fig. 21). Causes of PH can be easily identified, and categorized according to its relation to the hepatic sinusoids: pre-sinusoidal [e.g. PV thrombosis, extrinsic compression of PV (Fig. 22 a), tumor invasion (Fig. 22 b)]; sinusoidal (e.g. cirrhosis, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome — previously known as hepatic veno-oclusive disease); and post-sinusoidal (e.g. Budd-Chiari syndrome).

### The exposome and liver disease-how environmental factors affect liver health [^111PjRWM]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Moreover, epidemiological studies have recently shown that long-term exposure to ambient pollution (a source of metals and PM) can trigger MAFLD in humans. Vulnerability to the development of liver diseases can be increased in males, in obese individuals, and in consumers of a high-fat diet, alcohol, or tobacco. Several air pollutants are incriminated, including PM but also NO 2 and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). NO 2 can indeed react with antioxidant molecules (decreasing their levels) and lipids, leading to a lower defence against pro-oxidants. NO 2 -associated oxidative stress can lead to bron-choconstriction in the lungs but also to remote effects on other organs such as the heart or the immune system, whose functions are significantly reduced. Regarding PAHs, epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that the activation of AhR leads to an inflammatory phenotype accompanied by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition which, in the case of exposure to a high-fat diet, translates into fibrosis. Such an effect is not observed with single exposures alone (high-fat diet or PAHs). This highlights the importance of considering the exposome and integrating the effects of multiple stressors on the development of MAFLD.

### Case of pneumatosis intestinalis and hepatic portal venous gas following a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy [^117EyGXu]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG) in most cases signifies either mechanical migration of air into the portal system due to bowel ischaemia (pneumatosis intestinalis) or portal sepsis due to gas-forming organisms. Successful management of portal sepsis involves early identification of the condition, intensive resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics and a laparotomy for possible bowel ischaemia. In this report, we discuss the case of a patient with pneumatosis intestinalis and HPVG after an elective laparoscopic right hemicolectomy. After an initial slow recovery, on postoperative day seven, the patient had profuse diarrhoea and confusion, and was hyponatraemic. A CT scan revealed pneumatosis intestinalis and HPVG. A laparotomy showed no obvious cause for HPVG and there was no ischaemic bowel. She was managed with intensive care, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics and total-parenteral nutrition. She has made a good recovery. This case highlights the presenting features, differential diagnoses, and management of pneumatosis intestinalis and HPVG.

### Traffic-related air pollution associations with cytokeratin-18, a marker of hepatocellular apoptosis, in an overweight and obese paediatric population [^117R9Ssh]. Pediatric Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Traffic-related air pollution causes fatty liver, inflammation and fibrosis in animal models, but there have been few studies in humans.

Objectives

To test the hypothesis that traffic-related air pollution causes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and increased markers for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); and that NAFLD increases liver susceptibility to increased NASH risk.

Methods

Data collected prospectively from 74 overweight or obese children were obtained from the Yale Pediatric Obesity Clinic. Traffic-related air pollution was characterized as vehicle traffic volume on major roads within a 1 km residential buffer, and as residential nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) exposure. Outcomes were hepatic fat fraction (HFF) measured by magnetic resonance imaging, liver enzymes using standard assays and plasma cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) by immunosorbent assays.

Results

Significant non-linear relationships with air pollution and CK-18 were found. Plasma CK-18 at follow-up increased from approximately 150 U/L to almost 200 U/L as residential traffic volume increased from 220 000 vehicle-km to 330 000 vehicle-km, after adjustment for baseline CK-18, age and gender. Among patients with NAFLD at baseline, CK-18 increased from 140 U/L to 200 U/L (a 1.5 standard deviation increase in CK-18) as NO 2 increased from 8 to 10 ppb.

Conclusions

Traffic-related air pollution was associated with CK-18. Effects were larger in children with pre-existing NAFLD at study entry.

### Air pollution exposure associates with increased risk of neonatal jaundice [^116ByMqM]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

To validate the liver-associated route, we examined the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γ-Glutamyl transferase (GGT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 300 newborns (independent of the 25,782 newborns). ALT, AST and GGT can cause abnormal liver function. These 300 newborns had very high total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels in blood (as gold standard for jaundice diagnosis), and they were hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit. Among these severely jaundiced newborns, 129 were exposed to more polluted air (AQI > 100), and the other 171 were exposed to less polluted air (AQI < 100). Supplementary Table 7 shows that the ALT and GGT levels were higher in newborns exposed to more serious air pollution (AQI > 100), although the difference was not statistically significant likely due to small sample size. Moreover, newborns exposed to poor air quality had a much higher AST level than those breathing cleaner air (88.68 ± 67.48 versus 62.85 ± 33.56 U per L, P = 0.014). The scatter plot in Supplementary Fig. 7 further shows that among the 300 newborns, the peak bilirubin level grew as the AQI (including all pollutants) increased. These results suggested a significant association between air pollution exposure, neonatal liver functions, and neonatal jaundice.

This study estimated the impact of neonatal and maternal air pollution exposure on the neonatal jaundice risk, and provided evidence for the association to resolve concerns about causal inference. We synthesized the available evidence to quantitate the neonatal jaundice risk associated with PM 2.5, SO 2 and CO including exposure time and average concentration. Our analyses control individual-level differences in maternal pregnancy-induced outcomes like gestational diabetes mellitus, air temperature and relative humidity as confounding factors, and lessen the concern about the confounding. While newborns were in the ward and therefore had little exposure to outdoor sunlight, mothers were exposed to different levels of sunlight during pregnancy, which could confound the air pollution effects for maternal exposure. In addition to environmental factors, mother's socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics may play significant roles in neonatal jaundice risk. In future work, we plan to integrate more data, to investigate the associations.

### Increased susceptibility to liver damage from pneumoperitoneum in a murine model of biliary atresia [^111cEnCn]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

We hypothesized that livers with biliary atresia (BA) are more susceptible to the harmful effects of a high-pressure CO(2) pneumoperitoneum (PP) than healthy livers.

Methods

A murine model of BA was used in this experiment. Mice were divided into 6 groups: (1) control Balb/c; (2) control Balb/c, CO(2)-PP; (3) control BA; (4) BA-sham; (5) BA, CO(2)-PP; and (6) BA, air-PP. Mice from groups 2, 5, and 6 underwent an 8-mm Hg-PP for 60 minutes. Liver samples were collected for histology, colorimetry, and flow cytometry analysis 18 to 24 hours after the procedure. Markers of apoptosis were investigated as indicators of acute cell damage.

Results

We observed a statistically significant higher rate of apoptosis in livers with BA exposed to a prolonged CO(2)-PP or air-PP compared with control groups. There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2, or between groups 5 and 6.

Conclusions

In this animal model, we have shown that livers with BA are more susceptible than healthy livers to injury by a prolonged PP. This injury was caused by both CO(2) and air-PP, implying that it is the direct result of pressure. These results may have implications for the success of minimally invasive Kasai procedures.

### Assessing the global impact of ambient air pollution on cancer incidence and mortality: a comprehensive meta-analysis [^113TZtoM]. JCO Global Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

PM 2.5 and PM 10 exposure was significantly associated with breast cancer mortality, synonymous with other meta-analysis findings. Similarly, a significant association between PM 2.5 and liver cancer mortality was established in the present analysis. PM 2.5 can trigger oxidative stress, inflammation, and genotoxic effects and expedite liver inflammation and steatosis, which contributes to the initiation and advancement of liver cancer.

Our meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that exposure to air pollution is significantly associated with cancer incidence and mortality and substantially attributed to PM 2.5. Efforts to mitigate exposure to air pollution can be contemplated on multiple levels, encompassing individual, community, industrial, and broader regional scales. Across various higher-income and select middle-income nations, implementing multiple interventions spanning extended periods has enhanced outdoor air quality and, subsequently, positive impacts on health. Individuals can contribute to environmental well-being by opting for public transportation, cycling, or walking whenever feasible. In addition, using energy-efficient electrical appliances and refraining from burning leaves, garbage, and other materials are effective measures at the personal level. Initiatives to involve communities in tackling air quality include air quality monitoring and conducting environmental or health evaluations in cooperation with stakeholders from professional or policy realms. Adopting an airshed perspective in the management of air quality, involving consideration of a geographic area characterized by a distinct air mass, shared topography, meteorologic conditions, and climate, is found to be beneficial for improving air quality. Enacting laws to establish air quality standards is crucial in mitigating the effects of air pollution on both the public and the environment. Air quality regulations must adhere to a strong governance framework grounded in scientific insights with well-established criteria for accountability, monitoring, and transparency in implementation. While there have been indications of the potential effects on cancer survival after diagnosis, additional research is needed to assess the influence of reducing outdoor air pollution exposure at the patient level on survival outcomes. The meta-analysis results could contribute to community cancer prevention and diagnosis and help inform stakeholders and policymakers in decision making.

### Portomesenteric venous gas and pneumatosis intestinalis secondary to mesenteric ischaemia [^112wxYrb]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Description

We describe a case of a 61-year-old Caucasian man who presented to the emergency department because of severe periumbilical pain associated with nausea and vomiting. On examination, there was gross distension with generalised tenderness, more prominent in the left iliac fossa. The patient was afebrile and parameters were stable.

Coronal and axial CT images showed extensive branching radiolucency extending to within 2 cm of the liver capsule, which is characteristic of portal venous gas (PVG) and differentiates it from pneumobilia (figure 1). Gas was also present throughout the superior mesenteric vein and its tributaries (closed arrow, figure 2 B). A large portion of the small bowel wall showed band-like intramural gas (open arrow figure 2 A), in keeping with pneumatosis intestinalis (PI).

### Echocardiography-guided interventions [^1115p6z3]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2009). Medium credibility.

Echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis — technique and entry site selection: Two-dimensional and Doppler studies are performed to assess the size, distribution, and hemodynamic impact of the effusion and to identify the ideal entry site and needle trajectory for pericardiocentesis. The ideal site of needle entry is the point at which the largest fluid collection is closest to the body surface and from which a straight needle trajectory avoids vital structures. Because ultrasound does not penetrate air, the lungs are effectively avoided, and safety is ensured by using sheathed needles and withdrawing the steel needle upon entering the fluid space. The left chest wall is often the location selected for entry, whereas the subcostal route involves a longer path to reach the fluid, passes anterior to the liver capsule, and is directed toward the right chambers of the heart.

### Portal vein gas in emergency surgery [^115qTvHj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Portal vein gas is a diagnostic sign which indicates a serious intra-abdominal pathology requiring emergency surgery in the majority of patients. Benign hepatic portal vein gas due to less dangerous disease can be treated conservatively after exclusion of intra-abdominal catastrophe. Correlation between clinical and diagnostic findings is important to set the management plan.

### Lung glutathione adaptive responses to cigarette smoke exposure [^111wmpRS]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The lung is unique since it is exposed to high ambient oxygen levels and a constantly changing atmospheric environment. The lung is exposed on a daily basis to a wide range of oxidants ranging from ozone, smog, diesel exhaust, dust particles and cigarette smoke (CS). In comparison to all other forms of inhaled oxidants, CS may be one of the most prevalent and preventable oxidant exposures, with nearly 1 billion smokers worldwide. CS contains at least 4,800 different chemicals with over 10 14 radicals per puff that can cause DNA, protein, and lipid oxidation among many other effects. Fortunately, the lung has developed adaptive mechanisms to defend itself against inhaled oxidants.

CS is the primary cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with as much as 90% of COPD patients having been smokers at one point in their lifetime. However, a conundrum exists in that not all smokers go on to develop COPD. It has been estimated that only about 25% of smokers develop COPD, typically later in life. The fact that 75% of smokers do not develop COPD points to strong defense mechanisms to handle the increased oxidant burden that smoking puts on the lung. Furthermore, the effects of CS are not limited only to the lung. CS has been implicated in several cardiovascular diseases, liver diseases as well cancer.

One of the primary lung defenses against CS is the epithelial lining fluid (ELF). The ELF is a thin continuous fluid that hydrates the epithelial cells throughout the airways. The ELF is comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of mucus, cells, proteins, and low molecular weight antioxidants. At its most basic, the ELF provides a physical barrier against many inhaled oxidants and an important component of host defense against pathogens. In addition to being able to act as a physical barrier, there are high concentrations of antioxidants within the ELF that act to detoxify exogenous or endogenous oxidants. One of these antioxidants is glutathione (GSH) which is concentrated in the ELF 10–100 times more than in the plasma. GSH is a tripeptide comprised of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine and is synthesized and utilized in every organ throughout the body. γ-Glutamylcysteine ligase (GCL) is the rate limiting enzyme involved in GSH synthesis and its expression has been shown to be induced in response to CS. GSH can react with a wide range of molecules, making it an effective antioxidant at detoxifying many of the diverse reactive electrophilic components of CS.

### Gas embolism during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: diagnosis and management [^112tDUsA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology

Gas embolism can be venous, paradoxical or arterial and the pathophysiology is described in Fig. 1. Physiological intrapulmonary right to left shunts, retrograde flow via superior vena cava into the cerebral veins, and passage of air via pulmonary veins into the left atrium can lead to paradoxical air embolism. Large venous gas embolism can cause fatal cerebral artery gas embolism even in the absence of intracardiac defects. Spencer et al demonstrated that the size of the bubble, surface tension, and vascular pressure influence the passage of emboli across the lungs. Also, the partial pressure of gas inside the bubble determines the rate of dissolution in the blood. They also showed that equivalent doses of oxygen or carbon dioxide did not cross the lungs compared with nitrogen because of differences in partial pressure and surface tension.

Figure 1
Pathophysiology of air embolism

PFO, patent foramen ovale; ASD, atrial septal defect.

In endoscopy, air insufflation under pressure into an exposed vessel (gastric ulcer) can lead to air embolism. Maximum flow rates during endoscopy without resistance for purified water is 100 mL/min and for air it is 2000 mL/min. Lowdon et al described a case report of air embolism in a patient who had previously undergone Kasai procedure (hepatoportoenterostomy) for biliary atresia. The authors concluded that air embolism developed by the entry of air into the hepatic veins below the enterostomy site.

The various proposed mechanisms for air embolism from ERCP include endoscope-induced mechanical irritation of the bile duct wall, air entry into the bilio-venous shunts, transgression of air into adjacent veins from inflammation of the mucosa, and muscular wall, leakage of air into the portal or hepatic venous system from the bile duct secondary to pressure in the biliary system via contrast injection, removal of bile duct stents, mechanical irritation of the bile duct from bile duct stones, preexistent bilio-venous fistula, and communication via sphincterotomy to the portal vein (Fig. 1). Portal vein cannulation can also occur from laceration of small portal vein or trauma to papilla and is more common in pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients, likely from neo-angiogenesis or aberrant vessels.

### Prenatal smoke exposure induces persistentmethylation and increases nicotine metabolism in the liver of neonatal and adult male offspring [^114GVBey]. Epigenetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Animals & smoke exposure

C57BL/6 J mice (48 females and 48 males) were obtained from Harlan (Horst, The Netherlands) at 6 weeks of age and housed under standard conditions, with food and water provided ad libitum and at a 12-h light/dark cycle. The experimental setup was approved by the local committee on animal experimentation (DEC6589 B & C; University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands) and governmental and international guidelines on animal experimentation.

Mainstream cigarette smoke was generated by a Teague10 smoking machine (Tobacco and Health Research Institute of the University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA). Over a period of 7 days, 20 randomly selected primiparous female mice were adjusted to cigarette smoke by stepwise increasing the number of smoked cigarettes (3R4 cigarettes; 2.45 mg nicotine/cigarette) from two to five per smoking session. On adjustment day 5, after the end of the smoking session, all female mice were injected with pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG, 1.25 i.u.) to stimulate ovulation, and on day 7 with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, 1.25 i.u.) to induce ovulation. Subsequently, female mice were housed overnight at a 1:1 mating ratio with males. Mating was confirmed by the presence of a vaginal plug the following morning.

Throughout gestation, female mice were housed in groups and exposed to air or whole-body smoking sessions twice a day, 7 days per week. After delivery, dams and their offspring were no longer exposed to cigarette smoke. Dams were separately housed, with their offspring.

A total of 48 foetuses (24 males and 24 females) from 5 smoke-exposed dams and 4 control dams were collected at embryonic stage 17.5 (E17.5) and dams were euthanized under anaesthesia. A total of 42 pups at postnatal day 3 (D3) were randomly selected from prenatally smoke exposed (11 male, 8 female) and control (11 male, 12 female) groups for collection of the liver. Another 34 pups were randomly selected from 20 smoke-exposed (6 male, 6 female) and 19 control (10 male, 12 female) mice that were exposed to air in the Teague10 from 8 weeks of age for the following 12 weeks (adulthood) until euthanized for collection of the liver. The livers were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further use.

### Air pollution exposure and cardiometabolic risk [^112cxbo4]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

In a nationwide cross-sectional analysis in the USA in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (n = 269 705) there was a positive association between ambient PM 2·5 exposure and the odds of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (adjusted OR 1·24 per 10 μg/m 3 increase, 95% CI 1·15–1·33) among hospitalised patients. Despite the PM 2·5 exposure levels being much higher than those in the USA and Europe, similar results were also demonstrated using nationwide data from China.

Air pollution exposure during pregnancy and diabetes

A recent meta-analysis investigated the association between exposure to PM 2·5 and gestational diabetes at various stages of pregnancy. For the full pregnancy, the pooled relative risk (RR) was 1·074 (95% CI 1·001–1·152). Moreover, during the first and second trimesters, RRs of 1·015 (1·000–1·031) and 1∙021 (1·006–1·035), respectively, were observed. However, no significant association was found between preconception exposure to PM 2·5 and gestational diabetes (1·013, 0·990–1·038). In another study from Taiwan that explored the potential effect-modifying capacity of PM 2·5 exposure on development of type 2 diabetes in women with and without gestational diabetes, the odds ratio of diabetes per interquartile range increase in PM 2·5 was 1·31 (1·22–1·41), with the risks of developing type 2 diabetes with exposure to increased PM 2·5 levels being significantly higher in the gestational diabetes group than the non-gestational diabetes group. Despite this evidence, there are still substantial knowledge gaps that require further investigations to explore the ramifications of PM 2·5 exposure during different gestational periods and the potential long-term cardiometabolic effects.

### Retroperitoneal abscess with concomitant hepatic portal venous gas and rectal perforation: a rare triad of complications of acute appendicitis. A case report [^111hjbo5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatic portal venous gas and acute appendicitis

The presence of air bubbles in the extrahepatic and/or intrahepatic portal venous system is primarily a radiological finding that is detected by performing an abdominal CT scan for various reasons. Despite portal venous gas is generally a late feature of advanced intestinal necrosis with an increased mortality, there are various other clinical conditions that may also cause portal venous gas formation, i.e. inflammatory bowel disease, biliary tract infections, cardiac and liver transplantation, acute pancreatitis, and blunt abdominal trauma. It is assumed that gas may enter the portal venous system by an intestinal mucosal damage and increased intraluminal pressure, or gas-forming bacteria may translocate through the bowel wall during abdominal sepsis. While bowel necrosis was the predominant reason for portal venous gas formation, non-ischemic reasons have become more frequent during recent decades. Due to the latter reasons, overall morbidity decreased from 75% to 39%.

Portal venous gas formation due to perforated appendicitis has been previously reported in two cases. In our patient, portal venous gas formation could potentially be induced by both, perforated appendicitis and rectal perforation, respectively. However, it was assumed that rectal perforation was a secondary complication of the retroperitoneal abscess which occurred as a sequelae of perforated appendicitis.

Rectal perforation and acute appendicitis

Rectal perforation and necrosis represents an extremely rare event after retroperitoneal abscess formation. So far, only one case of rectal necrosis and simultaneous pelvic abscess as a consequence of perforated appendicitis was published in 1968 by Gostev. In our patient, it remains somewhat unclear, which was the pathophysiology of rectal perforation. Ischemia, pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease, and manipulation as the commonest reasons could be excluded. Thus, impacted stool due to abscess-related impaired bowel motility caused a so-called stercoral perforation.

### Gallstones top to toe: what the radiologist needs to know [^1116YZQx]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Extra-biliary complications

Gallstones can also cause pathology outside of the biliary system. The most common cause, although rare, is a cholecystoenteric fistula. Chronic irritation from a large gallstone can erode through the gallbladder wall with fistulisation into small bowel. This can be seen on imaging with air seen within the gallbladder or biliary tree (pneumobilia).

When a gallstone passes through the fistula into the small bowel, this can result in intestinal obstruction, either proximal or more commonly distal. The most common place for distal small bowel obstruction and gallstone ileum is at the level of ileocecal valve as this is the narrowest point; however, gallstone ileus can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. The diagnosis is suggested on abdominal X-ray by the presence of pneumobilia in the right upper quadrant with dilated loops of bowel consistent with bowel obstruction. Gallstone ileus is more accurately diagnosed with CT which may show pneumobilia or may directly demonstrate the presence of a cholecystoenteric fistula and associated bowel obstruction (Fig. 21).

Fig. 21
Coronal (a) and axial (b) contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrating multiple dilated loops of small bowel. There is a 3-cm peripherally hyperattenuating obstructing gallstone in the left flank (arrow 1). There is an extensive inflammatory process in the gallbladder bed with air in the gallbladder (arrow 2) consistent with a cholecystoenteric fistula. Appearances are consistent with a bowel obstruction secondary to a gallstone ileus

Bouveret's syndrome is a particular eponymous syndrome in which a stone obstructs the upper GI tract proximally at the level of duodenum or gastric outlet. Patients typically present with copious vomiting owing to the proximal level of obstruction. There may be little or no small bowel dilatation; in particular, the X-ray abdomen may be completely normal which can falsely reassure. Imaging will demonstrate evidence of gastric outlet or duodenal obstruction related to a gallstone in the upper GI tract (Fig. 22).

PM 2.5 -induced stress responses in the digestive system and diseases

Inflammatory stress responses and dysregulated energy metabolism in major inflammatory metabolic organs/tissues have been identified as the driving force of PM 2.5 -caused pathogenesis. Increasing evidence showed that inhalation exposure to environmentally relevant PM 2.5 induces integrated inflammatory stress responses in the digestive system that contribute to the progression of complex diseases. Among the organs/tissues of the digestive tract, the liver, pancreas and small intestine are particularly susceptible to PM 2.5 exposure in promoting pathological stress responses and metabolic or digestive diseases (figure 1).

### Increased needle visibility in ultrasound-guided percutaneous liver biopsy by an echogenic sheath: a proof of concept study in a human cadaver [^113gaLmj]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this pilot study, we have evaluated a new echogenic sheath in a human cadaver liver and phantom model. Qualitative assessment showed that sheath 3 consistently outranked the control needle. In addition, at an insertion angle of 30° the radiologists expressed more confidence in taking a biopsy with the echogenic sheaths than with the control needle. Quantitative assessment showed favorable intensity profiles for the prototypes, especially for sheath 3. In the phantom experiment, the effect of a sheath was significant. Sheaths 2 and 3 showed significantly better echogenic intensity profiles than the control needle for all angles and depths.

Needle visibility was ranked higher at 60° than at 30°, contradicting literature that describes decreased needle visibility as needle angles increases. The same ranking is observed for the sheaths, even though they are designed to maintain good visibility, regardless of the insertion angle. A possible explanation for our result could be found in the alignment of the needle compared to the transducer in the 30° condition. Because the angle was less steep and we desired to visualize the shaft as well, the tip might have been depicted more in the periphery of the image and less central relative to the central beam of the transducer. Perhaps this had led to a relative lower ranking by the radiologist, as they are used to a more centralized depiction of the needle tip.

Visualization of the needles became suboptimal in deeper insertions or when the background was more echogenic, which is in line with other studies. Though the cadaver liver in our study did not have an abundance of fatty tissue (steatosis), we did encounter areas with air and highly echogenic wall structures surrounding the liver. This aspect accounts for the largest limitation of this study. Even though a cadaver is considered an appropriate preclinical model for new surgical innovations, this may be different for innovations studied by ultrasonography. As seen in this study, we encountered several areas with air present around the liver. This was also confirmed by some of the radiologists who mentioned that parts of the cadaver liver had a considerably different appearance from an in vivo human liver. Even after careful selection of areas with homogeneous liver tissue, the presence of air in the liver could have had an influence on needle echogenicity, by for instance air bubbles getting caught in the needle trajectory.

### Pulseless electrical activity arrest due to air embolism during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: a case report and review of the literature [^112t5pJa]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

While most gastroenterologists are aware of the more common complications of endoscopy such as bleeding, infection and perforation, air embolism remains an under-recognised and difficult to diagnose problem due to its varying modes of presentation. This is the case of a 55-year-old man with right upper quadrant pain and imaging notable for cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis, who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). During the ERCP, and shortly after a sphincterotomy was performed, he became hypotensive and hypoxic, quickly decompensating into pulseless electrical activity. While advanced cardiac life support was initiated, the patient passed away. Autopsy revealed air in the pulmonary artery suggestive of a pulmonary embolism. While air embolism remains a rare complication of upper endoscopy, increased awareness and prompt recognition of signs that may point to this diagnosis may potentially save lives by allowing for earlier possible interventions.

### Emphysematous cholecystitis presenting as gas-forming liver abscess and pneumoperitoneum in a dialysis patient: a case report and review of the literature [^111L7oXC]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Emphysematous cholecystitis (EC) is a rare life-threatening form of acute cholecystitis representing between 1 and 3% of acute cholecystitis presenting mainly in male patients aged 50–70 years, and mostly occurring in patients with diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressed and peripheral vascular disease.

EC has been characterized clinically by the imaging with gas in the gallbladder lumen, the gallbladder wall and adjacent structure, and elsewhere in the biliary tracts in the absence of an abnormal communication with the gastrointestinal tract.

The gas may disseminate to subcutaneous tissue, as well as to the peritoneal and retroperitoneal cavity. The combination of emphysematous cholecystitis, liver abscess and pneumoperitoneum are rarely seen. Dialysis patients rarely develop such complications according to the review of the literature from Pubmed.

Subhepatic abscess involved associated with emphysematous cholecystitis is rare.

Emphysematous cholecystitis occurring in association with a pneumoperitoneum is relatively rare. A review of the literature from pubmed revealed 18 other cases of this combination and this is the first reported case occurring during dialysis.

Herein we present a dialysis case with clinical image composed of emphysematous cholecystitis, liver abscess and pneumoperitoneum.

### Ultrasonography for the diagnosis of intraperitoneal free air in chest-abdominal-pelvic blunt trauma and critical acute abdominal pain… [^1141V1PJ]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Ultrasonography findings showing intraperitoneal free air on the ventral surface of the left lobe of the liver, the shadows of which are easily movable with compression of the probe. The white and black arrows show IPFA originating just under the line of the peritoneum and a high-echoic shadow with multiple mirror images beside the gallbladder, a bulky homogeneous high-echoic shadow on the intraperitoneal free fluid on the right lobe of the liver, a bulky homogeneous shadow, and a small shadow on the surface of the liver. Ultrasonography findings showing air in the gastrointestinal tract mimicking intraperitoneal free air, which can be easily differentiated from IPFA because it never overlaps the ventral surface of the liver.

A and B, Ultrasonography findings show that the contrast between the shadow of the rib and liver is also mimicking intraperitoneal free air, which can be easily differentiated. More recently, it has routinely been used to demonstrate the presence of intestinal diseases, such as obstruction and ischemia. A US diagnosis of IPFA was made if a high-echoic spot or area with a high-echoic tail and a mirror image ventral space of the lateral segment of the left lobe of the liver and an anterolateral space of the right lobe, which can easily move and change its image due to compression, was detected. Air in the lung can be differentiated from IPFA by differentiating the layer of the high-echoic line of the pleura and peritoneum and by observing its relationship with respiration.

Air in the gastrointestinal tract can be easily differentiated from IPFA by identifying air that never overlaps the ventral surface of the liver. Although air in the large intestine in Chilaiditi syndrome may be presented on the ventral surface of the liver, it can be easily differentiated from IPFA by noting the continuity between the intracolonic air and air on the liver surface, by differentiating the layer of the high-echoic line of intracolonic air from the peritoneum, and by the form of the air image that is made by the colonic haustra.

Preventing intraoperative hypothermia

Maintaining body temperature > 36 °C has been recommended to reduce both cardiac and non-cardiac complications. One meta-analysis of 67 trials has shown that mild hypothermia was associated with increased SSI and blood loss. There is a lack of studies relating specifically to liver surgery. One meta-analysis of 23 trials comparing warming systems suggested that circulating water-based systems offer better warming than forced air systems although a recent retrospective study (n = 50) has used a multimodal approach to temperature management during surgery with good temperature control. A systematic review of 22 studies has suggested heating insufflated gases in laparoscopic abdominal surgery to maintain body temperature but patient outcomes were not improved. Liver cooling techniques have been used to minimize ischemia reperfusion injury to the liver, but temperature changes in the whole body in such procedures have not been reported.

Summary and recommendation: Perioperative normothermia using multimodal temperature management (including circulating water garments or forced warm air) should be maintained during open and minimally invasive liver surgery.

Evidence level: Moderate.

Grade of recommendation: Strong.

### Air pollution exposure and cardiometabolic risk [^1122iFWx]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Environmental underpinnings of type 2 diabetes

Type 2 diabetes is not a single disease, but rather a group of conditions broadly categorised by a single diagnostic criterion — hyperglycaemia. Subtypes of type 2 diabetes that are phenotypically and genetically distinct have been noted, with differential susceptibility to target organ complications such as cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Phenotypic manifestations of type 2 diabetes can include individuals with excess visceral adiposity, lean individuals, and individuals with predominant liver and skeletal muscle deposition of fat. This phenotypic diversity complicates genetic attribution of type 2 diabetes, as each feature might have differential genetic susceptibility, and also complicates the interpretation of environmental studies, including those on air pollution. The preponderance of studies nevertheless suggests a major contribution of the environment in shaping susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, defined by glycaemic criteria, and its complications. External factors in the built and natural environment, lifestyle and behaviours, social environment, chemical exposures, and internal factors (such as the microbiome, stress, and sleep duration), which collectively constitute the exposome, have also been shown to affect susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. –

### Massive pneumoretroperitoneum arising from emphysematous cholecystitis: a case report and the literature review [^114XpGqm]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Extra-luminal gas complicated with EC has been conventionally considered to derive from gallbladder perforation. Whenever presented with EC, pneumoretroperitoneum might occur following gallbladder perforation with anaerobic infection. In the present case, macroscopic gallbladder perforation was not clarified in intraoperative findings. However, the resected gallbladder revealed gangrenous cholecystitis with destruction of the wall, which supported the presence of microperforation of the gallbladder or infectious spread of an anaerobe in the subserosal layer. This theory is supported by cases of pneumoperitoneum without perforation of the gallbladder in EC. A literature review identified 16 cases of EC with pneumoperitoneum. However, the finding of macroscopic perforation of the gallbladder was found in only eight cases. Hence, pneumoperitoneum derived from EC may occur regardless of macroscopic gallbladder perforation. As for pneumoretroperitoneum, Orland et al. reported a case of EC complicated with retroperitoneal gas instead of gallbladder perforation. Therefore, EC should be considered as a possible cause of pneumoretroperitoneum, even without perforation of the gallbladder.

Pneumoperitoneum and pneumoretroperitoneum as complications, which represent extended infections, seem to be obviously more severe condition compared with EC localized in the gallbladder. Gill et al. divided EC radiographically into three stages according to the distribution of air within the gallbladder and/or the biliary system as follows: Stage1 –air in the gallbladder lumen, Stage2 –air in the gallbladder wall, and Stage3 –air in the pericholecystic tissue. Accordingly, the present case corresponded to the stage3. Some studies have indicated that the spread of gangrene does not always relate to a poorer prognosis. In the present case, massive gas might have reflected on the progression of infection because the intraoperative findings showed wide-spreading gangrene of retroperitoneum and the postoperative course indicated a severe general condition. Therefore, pneumoperitoneum and pneumoretroperitoneum should be regarded as life-threatening and an extensive infectious form of EC. Further examination of EC is required and the relationship between pneumoretroperitoneum and its prognosis should be discussed in the future.

### Treatment of pressure ulcers: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^115Pr8UK]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pressure ulcer interventions — benefits and harms: Air-fluidized beds reduce pressure ulcer size; protein or amino acid supplementation improves wound healing (most often reported as decreased ulcer size); hydrocolloid dressings improve wound healing; radiant heat dressings result in faster wound healing rate; platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) improves wound healing; and electrical stimulation accelerates wound healing. Reported harms include skin irritation, inflammation, tissue damage and maceration from dressings and topical therapies, elevated liver enzyme levels associated with oxandrolone, skin irritation from electrical stimulation, and surgical complications such as dehiscence, reoperation due to recurrence, or surgical flap failure, with evidence of harms or no harms reported for other interventions.

### Exposure to fine airborne particulate matters induces hepatic fibrosis in murine models [^112xVgJW]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Hepatic fibrosis, featured by the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix in liver tissue, is associated with metabolic disease and cancer. Inhalation exposure to airborne particulate matter in fine ranges (PM2.5) correlates with pulmonary dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome. In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of PM2.5 exposure on hepatic fibrogenesis.

Methods

Both inhalation exposure of mice and in vitro exposure of specialized cells to PM2.5 were performed to elucidate the effect of PM2.5 exposure on hepatic fibrosis. Histological examinations, gene expression analyses, and genetic animal models were utilized to determine the effect and mechanism by which PM2.5 exposure promotes hepatic fibrosis.

Results

Inhalation exposure to concentrated ambient PM2.5 induces hepatic fibrosis in mice under the normal chow or high-fat diet. Mice after PM2.5 exposure displayed increased expression of collagens in liver tissues. Exposure to PM2.5 led to activation of the transforming growth factor β-SMAD3 signaling, suppression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, and expression of collagens in hepatic stellate cells. NADPH oxidase plays a critical role in PM2.5-induced liver fibrogenesis.

Conclusions

Exposure to PM2.5 exerts discernible effects on promoting hepatic fibrogenesis. NADPH oxidase mediates the effects of PM2.5 exposure on promoting hepatic fibrosis.

### Catamenial pneumothorax with partial liver herniation due to diaphragmatic laceration: a case report and literature review [^112p4nyr]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Catamenial pneumothorax is generally uncommon, with an incidence of less than 3–6% in women with spontaneous pneumothorax. As few cases of catamenial pneumothorax with diaphragmatic defect and liver herniation have been reported, this case report may be useful for understanding the cause and treatment. This case highlights the importance of the approach for liver hernia in patients with catamenial pneumothorax and endometriosis.

Case Presentation

We report a case of catamenial pneumothorax in a 43-year-old woman with diaphragmatic partial liver hernia who was treated with thoracoscopic surgery. She was diagnosed with a right pneumothorax at menstruation onset. Chest computed tomography showed a nodule protruding above the right diaphragm. We performed thoracoscopic surgery to treat the persistent air leak and biopsied the nodule on the right diaphragm. There were blueberry spots on the diaphragm; the nodule was found to be the herniated liver. The diaphragmatic defect was sutured. Histological examination of the tissue near the partial prolapsed liver revealed endometrial tissue.

Conclusions

It is speculated that ectopic endometrial tissue in the diaphragm will periodically necrose to become a diaphragmatic tear, which is a pathway for air to enter the thoracic cavity and eventually a herniated liver. Thoracoscopic surgery should be considered in patients with catamenial pneumothorax when a diaphragmatic lesion is suspected.

### Environmental PM-triggered stress responses in digestive diseases [^1125VULR]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Airborne particulate matter in fine and ultrafine ranges (aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 µm, PM 2.5) is a primary air pollutant that poses a serious threat to public health. Accumulating evidence has pointed to a close association between inhalation exposure to PM 2.5 and increased morbidity and mortality associated with modern human complex diseases. The adverse health effect of inhalation exposure to PM 2.5 pollutants is systemic, involving multiple organs, different cell types and various molecular mediators. Organelle damages and oxidative stress appear to play a major role in the cytotoxic effects of PM 2.5 by mediating stress response pathways related to inflammation, metabolic alteration and cell death programmes. The organs or tissues in the digestive tract, such as the liver, pancreas and small intestines, are susceptible to PM 2.5 exposure. This review underscores PM 2.5 -induced inflammatory stress responses and their involvement in digestive diseases caused by PM 2.5 exposure.

### Choledochoduodenal fistula: an unusual case of pneumobilia [^11166WTC]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Pneumobilia is the finding of air in the biliary tree. Most cases are iatrogenic in origin, especially after sphincterotomy and after hepaticojejunostomy or choledochojejunostomy. In patients without such history, the presence of pneumobilia needs further investigation. Most patients are likely to have an enterobiliary fistula. Although patients may be asymptomatic, possible complications include gallstone ileus, Bouveret syndrome or recurrent episodes of cholangitis. We present a case of a 38-year-old man presenting with obstructive jaundice and pneumobilia in whom choledochoduodenal fistula was diagnosed at endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. A description of different types of choledochoduodenal fistulas and management recommendations are also provided.

### Emphysematous cholecystitis presenting as gas-forming liver abscess and pneumoperitoneum in a dialysis patient: a case report and review of the literature [^117TZic2]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Emphysematous cholecystitis is a rare variant of acute cholecystitis with a high mortality rate. The combination of emphysematous cholecystitis, liver abscess and pneumoperitoneum are even rarer. Herein we present a case of emphysematous cholecystitis in a senile diabetic lady who had worsening hemodynamics while undergoing hemodialysis.

Case Presentation

A 64-year-old woman with history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and end stage renal disease with regular hemodialysis presented to the emergency department with a 1-day history of sudden onset of lassitude and hypotension during hemodialysis. The result of a computed tomography (CT)-scan revealed air encircling the gallbladder, liver parenchymal and minimal pneumoperitoneal and liver abscess with no cholelithiasis. The patient had received empirical antibiotics with piperacillin-tazobactam 2.25 g intravenous route every 6 h for 14 days and cholecystectomy with surgical debridement and lead an uneventful postoperative hospital course. Escherichia coli was demonstrated as well as blood culture and peritoneal fluid culture.

Conclusion

In a senile diabetic and dialysis patient, we should take emphysematous cholecystitis into consideration once vague abdominal pain occurrs. Empirical antibiotic therapy and adequate surgical intervention should take place as soon as possible.

### Dextrose, sodium chloride, sodium lactate, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride (dextrose in lactated Ringer's) [^114MVDgi]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

This solution should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia, renal insufficiency, urinary tract obstruction, or impending or frank cardiac decompensation.

Extraordinary electrolytes losses such as may occur during protracted nasogastric suction, vomiting, diarrhea or gastrointestinal fistula drainage may necessitate additional electrolyte supplementation.

Additional essential electrolytes, minerals and vitamins should be supplied as needed.

Sodium-containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin, or to other salt-retaining patients.

Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium or potassium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.

The osmolarity of 5% Dextrose in Lactated Ringer's Injection is 530 mOsmol/liter (calc). Administration of substantially hypertonic solutions may cause venous irritation, including phlebitis.

Solutions containing calcium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly when accompanied by renal disease. Parenteral calcium should be administered with extreme caution to patients receiving digitalis preparations.

Solutions containing lactate should be used with caution. Excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.

The conversion of lactate to bicarbonate is markedly delayed in the presence of tissue anoxia and reduced capacity of the liver to metabolize lactate. This may occur under conditions such as metabolic acidosis associated with circulatory insufficiency, extracorporeal circulation, hypothermia, glycogen storage disease, liver dysfunction, respiratory alkalosis, shock or cardiac decompensation.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with overt or known subclinical diabetes mellitus, or carbohydrate intolerance for any reason.

To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed, the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration, and periodically during administration.

Do not connect flexible plastic containers in series in order to avoid air embolism due to possible residual air contained in the primary container.

If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. If administration is not controlled by a pumping device, refrain from applying excessive pressure (greater than 300mmHg) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting. Such handling could result in breakage of the container.

This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.

Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation following air embolism during orthotropic liver transplantation: is this just a coincidence? [^1115kWqb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The first human orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) was performed in 1963. Despite the development of technology in the medical field, hepatic transplantation remains a difficult surgery and carries a risk of significant complications. One possible, although rare, but potentially fatal complication that occurs during orthotopic liver transplantation is venous air embolism (VAE). It could be defined as the presence of air or carbon dioxide in the inferior vena cava and right atrium, which leads to the obstruction of blood flow through the heart. Another well-known condition is coagulopathy, which is caused by liver disease and hemostatic changes during surgery and can lead to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). However, we do not truly know if these two serious conditions are connected and whether one leads into another by any means. In other words, the prevalence of DIC following venous air embolism remains unclear. In this report, we describe how VAE was potentially followed by DIC during orthotopic liver transplantation, leading to a fatal outcome.

### Association between umbilical venous catheter ‒ related hepatic complications and tip position in neonates: a retrospective ultrasound-based analysis [^113XxYPa]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Air in the portal venous system

Air in the portal venous system was detected in 13 of the 23 patients with hepatic complications (6.3%, 13/206). The catheter tip was positioned in the Central Group in 8 cases (61.5%) and in the Non-Central Group in 5 cases, including 4 cases within the DV Subgroup. Ultrasound imaging typically reveals linear or band‒like echogenicities of varying lengths within the portal venous system, often accompanied by posterior acoustic shadowing or reverberation artifacts (Fig. 1). Importantly, there was no clinical evidence of necrotizing enterocolitis in these patients. Follow‒up ultrasound examinations conducted within one week of UVC insertion revealed complete resolution of the gas within 4 to 5 days.

Portal venous thrombosis

Portal venous thrombosis was identified in 4 patients (1.9%, 4/206). The catheter tip was positioned in the Central Group in 1 case (25%) and in the Non-Central Group in 3 cases (75%), including 2 cases within the DV Subgroup. Therefore, non-central tip positions, particularly those in the DV Subgroup, may increase the risk of portal venous thrombosis.

Ultrasound findings revealed irregular echogenic material attached to the catheter, with blood flow signal showing either filling defects or complete absence. Thrombosis was confirmed after catheter removal. Follow‒up abdominal ultrasound at one week revealed that the hepatic had regained its regular condition, without signs of portal hypertension.

### Massive pneumoretroperitoneum arising from emphysematous cholecystitis: a case report and the literature review [^113KJZaW]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Progression of EC can cause the spread of gas to the hepatoduodenal ligament or escape into the peritoneal cavity. From an anatomical viewpoint, retroperitoneum, hepatoduodenal ligament, and pericholecystic tissue are connected by fascial planes. Such a connection between the pericholecystic tissue and retroperitoneum allows air to escape from the gallbladder when the gas pressure increases in weak connective tissues, and this may explain the pathway in which cholecystic air, produced due to anaerobic bacterial infection, reaches the retroperitoneum. Pneumoperitoneum arising from EC itself is very rare. Pneumoretroperitoneum associated with EC is extremely rare. Previous reports have identified only one case of pneumoretroperitoneum due to EC. However, this case presented a little subserosal gas around the hepatoduodenal ligament and pancreas head. A large amount of pneumoretroperitoneum complicated with EC has not yet been reported, except for the present case.

### Air pollution exposure associates with increased risk of neonatal jaundice [^114SkN3j]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

The above analysis suggests that neonatal exposure to air pollution might significantly increase the neonatal jaundice risk. Possible causal mechanisms are presented below.

Sunlight is effective in breaking down bilirubin levels of newborns –. However, newborns stayed in the wards and were not exposed to outdoor sunlight, as confirmed by examining the relationship between air pollution exposure and jaundice by stratified analysis of TOA solar irradiance (see Methods, Supplementary Table 8).

The biological mechanism underpinning the association concerns how breathed air pollutants affect jaundice through multiple routes. There is scientific evidence that air pollutants enter the bloodstream where they possibly interact with the organs including liver tissue to produce pathological effects. Breathed PM 2.5 might change the levels and activities of P450 enzyme of human cytochrome, which plays an important role in the bilirubin metabolism in newborns. Through affecting the P450 enzyme, breathed PM 2.5 can cause serum bilirubin aggregation and thus raise the bilirubin levels of newborns. Also, air pollutants may affect the metabolism of the bilirubin through damaging the liver function. Studies in experimental models and humans presented the accumulation in the blood and liver following pulmonary exposure to a broader size range of nanoparticles, with translocation markedly greater when sufficiently small, such as for particles < 10 nm diameter. PM 2.5 has direct adverse effects on the liver function. SO 2 is a systemic oxidative damage agent, and it may cause toxicological damage to multiple organs like brain, lung, heart and liver of animals. CO might hinder metabolic and transport function of the placentaand concentrate more in the fetus than in the motherafter crossing the placental barrier. Moreover, CO also leads to acute hepatic dysfunctionand thus affects the function.

### Evaluation for liver transplantation in adults: 2013 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^111v91Jd]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) in liver transplantation (LT) candidates — screening, evaluation, and MELD exception policy are detailed as follows: Current Organ Procurement Transplant Network/UNOS policy assigns a MELD exception score of 22 for patients with portal hypertension, intrapulmonary shunting, and a room air PaO2 < 60 mmHg, with a 10% mortality equivalent increase in points every 3 months if the PaO2 remains < 60 mmHg. Screening of LT candidates by pulse oximetry is indicated to detect HPS patients with a PaO2 < 70 mmHg, using a threshold value of SpO2 < 96% at sea level to trigger complete evaluation, and preoperative evaluation should include room air arterial blood gas, transthoracic contrast echocardiography, and exclusion of alternate causes by chest x-ray, pulmonary function tests, and chest computed tomography. Arterial response to administration of 100% oxygen may be used to gauge perioperative oxygenation ability but does not appear to influence outcome, and the guideline states that the presence of severe HPS is associated with increased mortality and affected individuals should undergo expedited LT evaluation (1-B).

### Air pollution and its impact on cancer incidence, cancer care and cancer outcomes [^111THUjk]. BMJ Oncology (2025). High credibility.

A comprehensive systematic reviewstudied the association between air pollution and liver cancer. A total of 13 cohort studies were obtained with 10 961 717 participants. PM2.5 was the most frequently examined pollutant, then followed by NO2 and NO x. PM2.5 was associated with liver cancer mortality. There was no association with other air pollutants. So, et al.examined the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and liver cancer incidence in a pooled six European cohorts over a mean follow-up of 18 years. It identified relevant sources by analysing specific elements of PM2.5. There were detected associations between long-term exposure to NO2, PM2.5 and black carbon and liver cancer incidence. Strongest associations were found for sulphur and vanadium components of PM2.5.

Although there have been case–control studies that showed a positive association between burning biomass fuels and GI cancers, specifically oesophageal cancerand gastric cancer, the Golestan Cohort Studyis the first large population-based prospective study that provided strong evidence on the higher risk of developing colon, oesophageal and gastric cancers with use of biomass fuels for household cooking and heating. The study, which followed up 50 045 participants for more than 10 years, also found out that use of kerosene for household cooking and heating is associated with a higher risk of developing oesophageal cancer. The study adds to the evidence that increased cancer risk among individuals who are exposed to the indoor combustion of biomass and kerosene fuels may extend beyond the respiratory system and affect several sites of the gastrointestinal tract. The exact mechanisms that increase these risks are still not known. However, one possibility might be through local and systemic exposure of digestive organs to the carcinogenic compounds present in the emissions from combustion of solid fuels and kerosene.

### Pneumatosis intestinalis and hepatic portal venous gas after CPR [^114vEf5N]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Pneumatosis intestinalis and hepatic portal venous gas are usually associated with severe intra-abdominal pathologies. As diagnostic technologies advanced, a number of variant etiologies have been identified. We report 2 cases in which pneumatosis intestinalis and hepatic portal venous gas developed after prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The pathogenic mechanism was most probably bowel infarction caused by poor mesenteric perfusion during and after CPR. Limited cardiac output during prolonged resuscitation and severe vasoconstriction after large doses of epinephrine and vasopressors might both contribute to the compromised mesenteric perfusion. The risk seems especially high for old patients with severe atherosclerosis. Once it happens, the prognosis is extremely poor. In patients of cardiac arrests receiving prolonged CPR, catastrophic complications like this should be considered in the postresuscitation phase, especially those with multiple risk factors like old age, severe atherosclerosis, and use of large doses of vasoconstrictors.

### The impact of air pollution on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a global ecological analysis of incidence and mortality trends by human development index (1990–2019) [^1127xtB9]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the growing interest in the relationship between air pollution exposure and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), no ecological study has investigated this association. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining the relationship between air pollution exposure and NAFLD burden, with a focus on the role of the Human Development Index (HDI) of countries from 1990 to 2019.

Methods

We gathered data on NAFLD incidence and mortality from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019, as well as air pollution exposure data obtained from the World Bank database. A mixed-effects regression model was employed to examine the associations, adjusting for potential confounders. A total of 189 countries were included in the analysis.

Results

The global incidence rate of NAFLD was 559.95 per 100,000 people, with a mortality rate of 1.93 per 100,000. Countries with greater exposure to NO2, ozone, and PM2.5 had significantly higher NAFLD incidence (Regression Estimate per 1 SD increase (RESD) in NO2[SE] = 8.82[1.15], P-value < 0.001; RESD ozone[SE] = 17.97[1.37], P-value < 0.001; RESD PM2.5[SE] = 35.09[2.57], P-value < 0.001) and lower death rates (RESD NO2[SE] = -0.14[0.01], P-value < 0.001; RESD ozone[SE] = -0.22[0.02], P-value < 0.001; RESD PM2.5[SE] = -0.20[0.03], P-value < 0.001), particularly in countries with higher HDI. However, low-HDI countries exhibited no significant relationship between air pollution and NAFLD incidence while showing a significant positive correlation between pollutant exposure and NAFLD mortality.

Conclusion

While air pollution is linked to higher NAFLD incidence globally, its relationship with mortality varies, particularly in low-HDI countries. These results suggest a need for region-specific approaches, considering the ecological context.

### The exposome and liver disease-how environmental factors affect liver health [^115y7JMM]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction to the exposome

Although, there have been substantial advances over the past few decades in our understanding of the contribution of genetics to human diseases, the role of exposures to different environmental stressors has remained elusive. In a seminal article in 2005, Chris Wild elaborated a new concept, the exposome, which he defined as the totality of exposures from conception to death. The aim of the proposal was to integrate, in a single framework, different types of exposures including chemical, physical, biological, and psycho-social stressors, and to take into consideration the temporal dimension. Within this definition, the exposome can be viewed as the complement of the genome and can be used to improve our understanding of disease determinants. Since the initial definition, different contributions have been made to further develop the concept and to delineate the approaches that support its practical implementation. Much of the focus has been on developing analytical tools to characterise the exposome. Also, a significant effort has been devoted to better link the exposome to health, in particular through the integration of chemical, biological and computational approaches. Exposomics can be defined as the study of the exposome, which relies on the application of internal and external exposure assessment methods. Recently, exposomics has been further integrated with the other omics, leading to the concept of functional exposomics, which has been defined as the biological translation of the exposome and its multiple exposures and the characterisation of mechanisms of action, much as functional genomics refers to the functional expression of the genome.

### Effects of air embolism size and location on porcine hepatic microcirculation in machine perfusion [^1174KBEJ]. Liver Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

The handling of donor organs frequently introduces air into the microvasculature, but little is known about the extent of the damage caused as a function of the embolism size and distribution. Here we introduced embolisms of different sizes into the portal vein, the hepatic artery, or both during the flushing stage of porcine liver procurement. The outcomes were evaluated during 3 hours of machine perfusion and were compared to the outcomes of livers with no embolisms. Dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCEUS) was used to assess the perfusion quality, and it demonstrated that embolisms tended to flow mostly into the left lobe, occasionally into the right lobe, and rarely into the caudate lobe. Major embolisms could disrupt the flow entirely, whereas minor embolisms resulted in reduced or heterogeneous flow. Embolisms occasionally migrated to different regions of the same lobe and, regardless of their size, caused a general deterioration in the flow over time. Histological damage resulted primarily when both vessels of the liver were compromised, whereas bile production was diminished in livers that had arterial embolisms. Air embolisms produced a dose-dependent increase in vascular resistance and a decline in oxygen consumption. This is the first article to quantify the impact of air embolisms on microcirculation in an experimental model, and it demonstrates that air embolisms have the capacity to degrade the integrity of donor organs. The extent of organ damage is strongly dependent on the size and distribution of air embolisms. The diagnosis of embolism severity can be safely and easily made with DCEUS.

### The exposome and liver disease-how environmental factors affect liver health [^115spF3G]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Since the initial development of the exposome concept, much effort has been devoted to the characterisation of the exposome through analytical, epidemiological, and toxicological/mechanistic studies. There is now an urgent need to link the exposome to human diseases and to include exposomics in the characterisation of environment-linked pathologies together with genomics and other omics. Liver diseases are particularly well suited for such studies since major functions of the liver include the detection, detoxification, and elimination of xenobiotics, as well as inflammatory responses. It is well known that several liver diseases are associated with i) addictive behaviours such as alcohol consumption, smoking, and to a certain extent dietary imbalance and obesity, ii) viral and parasitic infections, and iii) exposure to toxins and occupational chemicals. Recent studies indicate that environmental exposures are also significantly associated with liver diseases, and these include air pollution (particulate matter and volatile chemicals), contaminants such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, bisphenol A and per-and poly-fluorinated substances, and physical stressors such as radiation. Furthermore, microbial metabolites and the "gut-liver" axis play a major role in liver diseases. Exposomics is poised to play a major role in the field of liver pathology. Methodological advances such as the exposomics-metabolomics framework, the determination of risk factors' genomic and epigenomic signatures, and cross-species biological pathway analysis should further delineate the impact of the exposome on the liver, opening the way for improved prevention, as well as the identification of new biomarkers of exposure and effects, and additional therapeutic targets.

### Pneumoperitoneum following percutaneous biliary intervention: not necessarily a cause for alarm [^116E9HXo]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) is a well-established technique for assessing and treating obstructive jaundice. Plastic and self-expanding metal stents can be deployed as an alternative when ERCP is not feasible or hilar strictures require an antegrade approach. Complication rates of percutaneous procedures are low, and are usually related to bile leakage or hemorrhage; pneumoperitoneum following PTC is rare and is usually taken to indicate bowel perforation. We describe two cases of pneumoperitoneum without peritonitis following PTC and stenting, both of which resolved spontaneously with conservative management. The literature is reviewed and possible causes discussed.

### Pneumobilia: benign or life-threatening [^114W1jfM]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Pneumobilia, or air within the biliary tree of the liver, suggests an abnormal communication between the biliary tract and the intestines, or infection by gas-forming bacteria. Pneumobilia usually can be distinguished from air in the portal venous system by its appearance on computed tomography (CT) scan. The most common conditions associated with pneumobilia include: 1) a biliary-enteric surgical anastamosis, 2) an incompetent sphincter of Oddi, or 3) a spontaneous biliary-enteric fistula. Three cases of pneumobilia associated with its most common causes are presented and further differential diagnostic possibilities as well as the implications of this finding on patient management are discussed.

### Microcirculation and excretory function of the liver under conditions of carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum [^116Diyg8]. Surgical Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

To date, the effects of increased abdominal pressure, as given during carbon dioxide (CO(2)) pneumoperitoneum, on hepatic microcirculation and biliary excretion are unknown.

Methods

Using a custom-made peritoneal cavity chamber, we performed intravital microscopy of the left liver lobe under conditions of CO(2) pneumoperitoneum in a rat model. In addition, biliary excretion was assessed.

Results

The establishment of a CO(2) pneumoperitoneum of 4 or 8 mmHg resulted in sinusoidal perfusion failure that was more pronounced in the periportal regions than in the midzonal and pericentral regions of the liver acinus. Biliary excretion was considerably reduced at an intraabdominal pressure of 8 mmHg. Leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions increased significantly in both hepatic sinusoids and postsinusoidal venules.

Conclusion

Alterations in hepatic microcirculation and liver function must be taken into consideration in any kind of laparoscopic surgery and may be of particular clinical relevance in patients with liver pathology.

### Environmental PM-triggered stress responses in digestive diseases [^117RB5yU]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

A variety of studies have confirmed that PM 2.5 -triggered ROS or oxidative stress is the root of inflammatory stress responses and tissue injuries, and the reduction of nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a master regulator of anti-oxidative stress response, is heavily involved in air pollution-associated complex diseases. Interestingly, AMPK activators, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) (eg, oleanolic acid) and melatonin can mitigate PM 2.5 -caused oxidative stress as well as hepatic inflammation, fibrosis and liver injuries in animal models. Additionally, a meta-analysis of epidemiological evidence suggested that exposure to airborne PM 2.5 pollution increased the risk of gastrointestinal cancers. The impact of PM 2.5 on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been observed in East Asia, Europe and USA. Ambient PM 2.5 pollution was associated with increased mortality in patients with HCC.PM 2.5 -induced NASH activities may be associated with the progression of HCC under air pollution; however, the mechanistic basis by which PM 2.5 pollutant is involved in HCC remains to be elucidated.

PM 2.5 -induced stress responses in the pancreas

The association between exposure to PM 2.5 and type 1 or T2D mellitus has been confirmed in population studies. Exposure to PM 2.5 reduced pancreatic homogenate glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), increased methane dicarboxylic aldehyde and decreased pancreas glucose transporter 2 expression in a rat model of gestational diabetes mellitus.PM 2.5 -induced oxidative response and inflammation in the pancreas are responsible for the increased risk of pancreatic impairment and glycaemic consequences under PM 2.5 exposure. In a mouse model of streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes, PM 2.5 promoted pancreatic β cell damage by stimulating interleukin 1β (IL1β) and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) production in macrophages and β cells.PM 2.5 exposure can also attenuate insulin secretion from β cells in a dose-dependent manner.

### The anatomical compartments and their connections as demonstrated by ectopic air [^114jrXyM]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

How does retroperitoneal air/gas reach the extraperitoneal abdominal and pelvic spaces?

Superiorly, the left retromesenteric plane and the PS extend to the dome of the diaphragm, where they connect with the left subdiaphramatic extraperitoneal space (Fig. 10b). On the right the retromesenteric plane extends at the level of the right inferior coronary ligament and the bare area of the liver, and communicates with the liver hilum through the subperitoneal space of the hepatoduodenal ligament (Fig. 11). Inferiorly, the combined interfascial plane continues in the pelvis along the anterolateral margins of the psoas muscle, contiguous with the pelvic retroperitoneal perivesical and presacral spaces. The PPS is in continuity with properitoneal space (Fig. 9).

Fig. 11
Duodenal perforation complicating ERCP in a 75-year-old woman. Sagittal reformatted (a) and axial (b) contrast-enhanced CT scan demonstrates the right superior extension of the interfascial plane. The multilaminated retroperitoneum is open towards the upper abdominal extraperitoneal space: the bare area of the liver, and communicates with liver hilum through the subperitoneal space of the hepatoduodenal ligament

These paths are also based on the continuity of the transversalis fascia (as the outer border of the retroperitoneal and peritoneal cavities) with the parietal endopelvic fascia, lining the abdominopelvic cavity and outlining a conduit for air/gas spread (Fig. 12).

Fig. 12

Thus, air in the retroperitoneum can spread across the midline in the APS and via the anterior interfascial retromesenteric plane, and get off to the pelvic extraperitoneal space through the properitoneal fat and by the combined interfascial plane.

### Emphysematous cholecystitis presenting as gas-forming liver abscess and pneumoperitoneum in a dialysis patient: a case report and review of the literature [^111eYXSz]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, emphysematous cholecystitis is a rare form of cholecystitis especially in dialysis patients which could be fatal if delayed in diagnosis and progress to pneumoperitoneal and liver abscess. In a senile diabetic and dialysis patient, we should take emphysematous cholecystitis into consideration once vague abdominal pain and hypotension occurs in a patient underwent hemodialysis. Empirical antibiotic therapy and adequate surgical intervention should take place as soon as possible.

### Assessing the global impact of ambient air pollution on cancer incidence and mortality: a comprehensive meta-analysis [^114Utxjm]. JCO Global Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

The composition of air pollution and levels of exposure can exhibit substantial variation, contingent on factors such as the season, the weather conditions, and the variety of pollution sources. Among all the pollutants, fine particulate matter (< 2.5 μm) significantly affects human health. Lozano et alfound that airborne particulate matter 2.5 μm or less in diameter (PM 2.5) in the air contributes to an estimated 2 million premature deaths each year, positioning it as the 13th leading cause of mortality worldwide. Earlier studies have reported a positive association between ambient air pollution and cancers of the pancreas, urinary bladder, breast, prostate, and liver. - The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies outdoor air pollution and airborne particulate matter of 2.5 µm or less (PM 2.5) as a group 1 carcinogen contributing to human lung cancer. In addition, there exists weak evidence for urinary bladder, breast, childhood leukemia, liver, pancreatic, kidney, cervical, and brain cancer sites. However, there is no evidence for head and neck, bone cancer, soft tissue tumor, corpus uteri, ovary, prostate, and thyroid cancers.

While past research has extensively investigated the connection between air pollution and lung cancer globally, - there is still limited evidence on the association between air pollution and the incidence of nonlung cancer. This study aims to fill that gap by examining the association between exposure to major ambient air pollutants and the incidence and mortality of lung cancer and some nonlung cancers.

### Environmental PM-triggered stress responses in digestive diseases [^1142Yxeu]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Epidemiological studies and biomedical research have consistently linked real-world airborne pollutants to the increase of mortality and morbidity associated with modern human complex diseases. In particular, environmental airborne particulate matter in fine and ultrafine ranges (aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 µm, PM 2.5) is strongly associated with the development of air pollution-associated systemic diseases (figure 1). There exist linear dose-risk relationships between PM 2.5 concentrations and the occurrence of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, as a 3% increase in cardiovascular disease incidence or a 1% increase in diabetes prevalence was observed in populations under 10 µg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 exposure. This relationship remained consistent even for countries within the guidelines for US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) PM 2.5 exposure limits, such as Europe and USA. Chronic PM 2.5 exposure increases the danger of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases to an even greater degree and effects may be more pronounced in susceptible populations such as older adults, lower socioeconomic status and individuals with pre-existing conditions. Short-term exposure to polluted air at levels generally considered 'acceptable' may impair mental ability in elderly people in the USA.

Figure 1
The systemic effects of inhalation exposure to PM 2.5. The diseases caused by PM 2.5 pollution in different systems are shown. CAD, coronary artery disease; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; NASH, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

In most cases, airborne PM 2.5 is a complex mixture of particles and gases from gasoline and diesel engines, mixed with dust from wear of road surfaces and tires. Airborne PM 2.5 particles have an incremental capacity to penetrate the distal airway units and the systemic circulation. Under inhalation exposure to PM 2.5, fine PM 2.5 nanoparticles can reach the terminal bronchioles, pass through the air–blood barrier and enter the blood circulation (figure 1). Both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in vivo real-time visualisation of PM 2.5 -simulating fluorescent dyed nanoparticles revealed the deposition of PM 2.5 particles in the extrapulmonary organs. While ultrafine PM particles, such as PM 0.2, have a more uniform deposition pattern in acinar regions through endocytosis or diffusion, ambient PM 2.5 particles of various sizes can enter into the gastrointestinal tract and the lymphatic system and be retained in the liver and kidney. One of the possible mechanisms through which PM 2.5 is retained in extrapulmonary organs/tissues is internalisation of particles by macrophages.

### Deep learning-based denoising image reconstruction of body magnetic resonance imaging in children [^117FhCxz]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Quantitative image assessment

Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the liver and spleen and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the liver and spleen in comparison to spinal musculature were calculated to assess quantitative image quality.

SNR is calculated as the ratio of signal intensity (SI) of the organ parenchyma to the standard deviation (SD) of the signal intensity of the background – SD air. CNR is defined as the difference in signal contribution (SI) of the tissue of interest and a reference tissue, divided by SD air.

Measurements were made within circular regions of interest (ROI) of diameters ranging from 9.1 mm to 10.6 mm (area ranging from 65 mm 2 to 89 mm 2) within the liver and spleen parenchyma omitting the vasculature and within the air next to the body. If technically possible, the ROIs in the liver, spleen, and air were positioned in the same line on the x -axis. To determine the CNR, autochthonous spinal muscles were chosen as tissue of reference. The ROI was positioned at the identical location of the organ, muscle, and air on the T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. The example of ROI placement is given in Fig. 1.

### Portal vein gas in emergency surgery [^114hUp2k]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Results

Two hundreds and seventy-five patients with gas in the portal venous system were reported. The commonest cause for portal vein gas was bowel ischemia and mesenteric vascular pathology (61.44%). This was followed by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (16.26%), obstruction and dilatation (9.03%), sepsis (6.6%), iatrogenic injury and trauma (3.01%) and cancer (1.8%). Idiopathic portal vein gas was also reported in1.8%. Men and women affected equally. Majority of the patients are elderly and affected by most serious cause, the mesenteric vascular pathology. Diagnostic approach is based on the clinical suspicion and investigations such as CT scan which represents the standard test. The management depends on the underlying cause. Better outcome is reported because of advances in diagnostic facilities, the intensive care setting and less invasive operative technique such as laparoscopy.

Aetiology

The most important cause for PVG is bowel ischemia, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract GIT (see figure 1), obstruction and dilatation, gastro-intestinal leak, infection, diffuse peritonitis and sepsis (see figure 2). It may follow GIT cancer, gastric ulcer, hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, cystic fibrosis and acute appendicitis. PVG is also reported following perforated and non perforated diverticulitis, oesophageal and colonic carcinoma. Inflammation of the GIT such as necrotizing enterocolitis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are also reported in literatures. It is also reported following surgical procedures such as pancreaticoduodenectomy. Vascular causes include septic thrombophlebitis of the superior mesenteric vein, superior mesenteric artery syndrome, and hemodialysis.

Respiratory tract infection, abdominal trauma, diagnostic and therapeutic gastrointestinal procedures, resuscitation procedures, drugs and caustics ingestion are rare causes for PVG, while it is idiopathic in certain cases (see additional file 1).

### Unusual pediatric lung infections: imaging findings [^112NprFW]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Amoebiasis

Amoebiasis is caused by the parasitic amoeba Entamoeba histolytica. Amoebiasis is a common parasitic disease in tropical and developing areas, such as Central and South America, Africa, and the Indian Subcontinent, due to lower levels of sanitation, hygiene, and socio-economic status. More recently, with wide-spread global tourism, amoebiasis is becoming a globalized disease. Entamoeba histolytica has two life cycles, one as an infectious trophozoite and the second as a cyst that can survive for months in harsh environments outside the host's body. The most common route of infection is by ingestion of a mature cyst through contaminated food, water, hands, or sexual contact. Trophozoites release from the cyst in the small intestine and multiply in the lumen of the intestine. Some inhabit the intestinal lumen causing noninvasive infection that enables further spread of the disease, while others invade the intestinal mucosa and cause gastrointestinal disease, or further enter blood vessels and infect extraintestinal organs such as the liver, brain, and lungs.

Extraintestinal amoebiasis varies from the most frequent amoebic liver abscess to pulmonary amoebiasis, cardiac infection, or even brain infection. Most extraintestinal amoebiasis begins in the form of an amoebic liver abscess and spreads directly to adjacent organs. Hematogenous spread without hepatic involvement is also possible. Typical symptoms of pulmonary amoebiasis include fever, productive cough, fatigue, and dyspnea. The characteristic imaging feature of pulmonary amoebiasis is abscess formation. When a lung abscess (amoeboma) is formed and connects to the bronchial tree, there is the production of characteristic brown-colored sputum, often clinically referred to as "anchovy sauce sputum".

Chest radiography is the first-line radiologic imaging that can raise suspicion of pulmonary amoebiasis when lung abscess is found. The amoebic abscess is characteristically amorphous in shape, with thick irregular walls, with or without an air-fluid level (Fig. 8). Before the formation of the amoebic abscess, consolidation within the lung and pleural effusion is seen. In a country where amoeba is endemic, the differential diagnosis for thoracic abscess should include amoebic origin, especially in the presence of characteristic imaging features.

### Exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease [^117Mjne4]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Accumulating animal studies have demonstrated the harmful contribution of ambient air pollution (AP) to metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), but corresponding epidemiological evidence is limited. We examined the associations between long-term AP exposure and MAFLD prevalence in a Chinese population.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional study of 90,086 participants recruited in China from 2018 to 2019. MAFLD was assessed based on radiologically diagnosed hepatic steatosis and the presence of overweight/obese status, diabetes mellitus, or metabolic dysregulation. Residence-specific levels of air pollutants, including particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of ≤ 1 μm (PM 1), ≤ 2.5 μm (PM 2.5), and ≤ 10 μm (PM 10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), were estimated by validated spatiotemporal models. We used logistic regression models to examine the AP-MAFLD associations and further evaluated potential effect modifications by demographics, lifestyle, central obesity, and diabetes status.

Results

Increased exposure levels to all 4 air pollutants were significantly associated with increased odds of MAFLD, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.13 (95% CI 1.10–1.17), 1.29 (1.25–1.34), 1.11 (1.09–1.14), and 1.15 (1.12–1.17) for each 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM 1, PM 2.5, PM 10, and NO 2, respectively. Further stratified analyses revealed that individuals who are male, alcohol drinkers, and current and previous smokers, those who consume a high-fat diet, and those with central obesity experience more significant adverse effects from AP exposure than other individuals.

Conclusions

This study provides evidence that long-term exposure to ambient PM 1, PM 2.5, PM 10, and NO 2 may increase the odds of MAFLD in the real world. These effects may be exacerbated by unhealthy lifestyle habits and central obesity.

Lay Summary

We conducted an epidemiological study on the potential effect of ambient air pollution on the risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) in approximately 90 thousand adults in China. We found that long-term exposure to ambient air pollution may increase the odds of MAFLD, especially in individuals who are male, smokers, and alcohol drinkers, those who consume a high-fat diet, and those with central obesity.

### Intraoperative air leak test to prevent bile leak after right posterior sectionectomy with En bloc diaphragm resection for metastatic teratoma [^115ES3r5]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The intraoperative air cholangiogram, or "air leak test" (ALT), at the time of hepatectomy can significantly reduce the rates of bile leak and symptomatic fluid collection after high-risk procedures.1, 2 Because a bile leak in the setting of an en bloc diaphragm resection and mesh reconstruction would be a particularly dreaded complication, this video shows the technique for resection, reconstruction, and ALT.

Presentation

The video presents the case of a 29-year-old woman who had metastatic teratoma with an 8×7-cm liver metastasis in segment 7 and diaphragm invasion to the level of the right hepatic vein.

Operation

The authors performed a formal right posterior sectionectomy with en bloc diaphragm resection. The 12×8-cm diaphragmatic defect was reconstructed using biologic mesh (Surgimend, Integra LifeSciences, Plainsboro, NJ). An intraoperative ALT (air injection into the cystic duct with finger compression of the distal bile duct) identified several areas of bubbles from biliary radicles on the cut surface of the liver, which were ligated with 4–0 polypropylene. The ALT was repeated until no bubbles remained. Because no evidence of bubbles was observed, no surgical drain was needed. The patient did well postoperatively with no complications.

Conclusion

In cases of combined liver and diaphragmatic resection, prevention of bile leak, with subsequent contamination of the diaphragm repair and even the thoracic cavity, is particularly vital. An easily replicated intraoperative air leak test can mitigate the risk of bile leak and organ-space infection, as well as associated sequelae on quality of life, return to intended oncologic therapy, and oncologic outcomes.

### Femoral venous catheter: a misleading cause of gas in the liver [^116ZKVCC]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The presence of a femoral venous catheter could be associated with gas presence in the hepatic veins. This entity should be recognized to avoid a misdiagnosis of gas presence in the portal veins or in the biliary tract. Objectives are to assess: 1) the incidence of gas presence in the hepatic veins in intensive care unit patients explored by abdominal computed tomography scan; 2) the rate of gas presence in the liver in intensive care unit patients with a catheter inserted in the femoral vein; and 3) the specific imaging features.

Design

A retrospective study in a medical intensive care unit in a teaching hospital in France.

Measurements

All consecutive abdominal computed tomography scans performed in intensive care unit patients between 2008 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed independently by an intensivist and a radiologist. Presence of gas in the liver was noticed and its location was specified using multiplanar reconstruction.

Main Results

We analyzed 235 computed tomography scans (performed in 207 patients). Gas was identified in the liver on 10.2% of computed tomography scans. Gas was located in the hepatic veins in 12 cases (50%), in the biliary tract in ten cases (41.7%), and in the portal veins in two cases (8.3%). All patients with gas in the hepatic veins had a femoral venous catheter. Characteristics of gas location within the hepatic veins on computed tomography scan axial views were not different from those of gas located in the biliary tract or in the portal venous system. Gas was present in the hepatic veins in 12 of 83 (14.5%) of the computed tomography scans with a femoral venous catheter and was associated with gas presence in other vessels of the inferior vena cava system in five of 12 (41.7%) cases.

Conclusions

Gas located in the hepatic veins related to femoral venous catheter is a frequent cause of gas in the liver in intensive care unit patients. This imaging feature could be misleading. Multiplanar reconstruction should be performed to differentiate this aspect from those of gas in the biliary tract or in the portal venous system.

### Implementation of bowel ultrasound practice for the diagnosis and management of necrotising enterocolitis [^114oBhBT]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

Portal venous gas

PVG is seen as echogenic foci within the portal venous system or in a branched pattern within the distal liver parenchyma, corresponding with portal venous branch vessels (figure 12). It may be seen moving distally within the central vessels on cine clips. On spectral Doppler waveforms, it is seen as sharp bidirectional spikes superimposed on the underlying waveform.

Figure 12
Shadowing hyperechoic foci within the right portal vein consistent with portal venous gas (arrows).

PVG is caused by intramural gas extending to the mesenteric venous system and passing into the portal venous system. As this is transient, it has a low sensitivity but high specificity for diagnosing definite NEC. The amount of PVG does not directly correlate with the amount of pneumatosis. Therefore, although presence can establish the diagnosis of NEC, it is of limited value in terms of clinical management beyond this. Specifically, PVG does not have a strong association with overall outcomes and has not been found to be a predictor of surgical necessity. Treatment should be determined by clinical findings as non-surgical management may be sufficient.

Pitfalls: umbilical venous catheter manipulation can cause iatrogenic PVG; however, this can usually be determined based on history. Pneumobilia, or air within the bile ducts, can appear similar, however should be more centrally located than PVG and is uncommon in the neonatal period.

An overview for quick clinical reference of the key findings and their relative significance are summarised in box 3.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation following air embolism during orthotropic liver transplantation: is this just a coincidence? [^112vzJ3q]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

During orthotopic liver transplantation, venous air embolism may occur due to iatrogenic injury of the inferior vena cava. However, venous air embolism followed by coagulopathy is a rare event. In this case report, we discuss a possible connection between venous air embolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Case Presentation

A 37-year-old male patient with chronic hepatitis B- and C-induced liver cirrhosis was admitted for orthotopic liver transplantation. During the dissection phase of the surgery, arterial blood pressure, heart rate, saturation and end-tidal carbon dioxide levels suddenly decreased, indicating the occurrence of venous air embolism. After stabilizing the patient's condition, various coagulation issues started developing. Venous air embolism-induced coagulopathy was handled by administering transfusions of various blood products. However, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate leading to a complete asystole.

Conclusions

This is a rare case of venous air embolism-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation. The real connection remains unclear as disseminated intravascular coagulation for end-stage liver disease patients can be induced by various causes during different stages of liver transplantation. Certainly, both venous air embolism and coagulopathy were significant and led to an unfavorable outcome. Further studies are needed to better understand the possible mechanisms and correlation between these two life-threatening complications.

### Severe emphysematous pyelonephritis mimicking intestinal obstruction [^114NyW5K]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Emphysematous pyelonephritis is a severe necrotizing infection characterized by the presence of gas and/or fluid in the renal parenchyma, collecting system, or perirenal tissues. Emphysematous pyelonephritis with approximately 15 cm air-fluid level, diffused ureteral involvement, and the accumulation of gas in liver and peritoneal cavity is very rare. Here, we reported a severe emphysematous pyelonephritis with multiple huge air-fluid level mimicking intestinal obstruction and with the accumulation of gas in liver and ureter in computed tomography imaging. The patient was successfully managed by percutaneous nephrostomy combined with medical treatment.

### Cross-sectional imaging of common and unusual complications after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^117Ug22U]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

After ERCP the presence of air in the biliary tree is an expected, common finding. Intra- and extrahepatic pneumobilia is visible in the majority of patients studied with CT within a few weeks from the procedure and may persist for months or years in patients who underwent sphincterotomy (Fig. 2). Shortly after ERCP retained CM is commonly seen in the biliary tree and gallbladder, often with a characteristic stratified appearance (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Normal findings observed hours after operative ERCP in a 75-year-old male investigated with unenhanced CT (c, d) to verify correct placement of a plastic biliary stent, including dependent contrast medium (arrows) and air (arrowheads) in the intrahepatic bile ducts. In a different patient, a 44-year-old female patient suffering from acute post-procedural pain, contrast-enhanced CT (a, b) 2 days after ERCP excluded signs of acute complications and showed stratified iodinated contrast medium (*), bile and air (thin arrow) in the gallbladder

Multiplanar CT reformations (Figs. 2 and 3) provide high-resolution visualisation of biliary endoprostheses, whether of plastic or metallic reticular "mesh" material, and of their anatomical relationships. When interpreting post-procedural studies, the stent type should be reported along with the integrity, patency and position including proximal and distal extremities.

Acute reversible duodenitis following ERCP. A 78-year-old male with common bile duct (CBD) carcinoma causing concentric stenosis of the proximal choledochus suffered from acute diffuse abdominal pain without peritonitis 24 h after ERCP including cytological brushing and positioning of a 10-French plastic biliary stent. Urgent contrast-enhanced CT (a, b) showed a correctly placed biliary stent, appearance of moderate ascites (*) and of marked circumferential thickening of the duodenum from the Vaterian papilla to the Treitz angle, with enhancing mucosa and hypoattenuating oedematous submucosa (" target sign ", thin arrows), and minimal associated inflammatory changes in the periduodenal fat. Imaging findings, laboratory data and the subsequent course excluded iatrogenic pancreatitis, haemorrhage and DP. Three weeks later, the plastic biliary stent was removed and replaced with a self-expanding metal stent (SEMS). Follow-up CT (d) showed imaging resolution of both biliary obstruction and acute duodenal inflammatory changes [partly reprinted from Ref. 20]

### Major pancreatic resections: normal postoperative findings and complications [^111vys2H]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Pneumobilia-pneumowirsung

Air can be seen in both the biliary tract and lumen of the main pancreatic duct. Pneumobilia is far more common (67–80% of cases) and typically is much more evident in the left biliary tree (Fig. 8 a). The presence of air can be exploited to identify the pancreatic or biliary anastomosis (Fig. 8 b).

Fig. 8
Pneumobilia and pneumowirsung (a, b). a There is a fair amount of air in the main and in left bile ducts (black arrow). The hepaticojejunostomy (white arrow) and anastomotic jejunal loop (j) are visualised. b The pancreas (p), anastomotic jejunal loop (s) and pancreaticojejunostomy (white arrow) are visualised. The main pancreatic duct is mildly dilated with an air bubble within (black arrow)

Perivascular cuffing

Perivascular cuffing is a soft-tissue stranding in the mesenteric fat that can occur within the surgical bed and surrounding the caeliac axis and its branches and the superior mesenteric artery. This cuffing is due to an inflammatory reaction and can be observed in up to 60% of patients. It can potentially be extremely focal and mass-like in appearance (Fig. 9). However, in patients with negative surgical margins, in the first postoperative period this finding should not be mistaken for residual disease or local recurrence.

Fig. 9
Perivascular cuffing. a, b) Axial CT images show a thickening (white arrows in a and b) of the fat tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric vessels in a and caeliac trunk in b. This stranding can be very focal and mass-like. In a, a postoperative reactive thickening of the anterior left pararenal fascia and a fluid collection on the same side (*) are visible

### Environmental PM-triggered stress responses in digestive diseases [^111pgk5H]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Airborne particulate matter in fine and ultrafine ranges (aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm, PM 2.5) is a primary air pollutant that poses a serious threat to public health. Accumulating evidence has pointed to a close association between inhalation exposure to PM 2.5 and increased morbidity and mortality associated with modern human complex diseases. The adverse health effect of inhalation exposure to PM 2.5 pollutants is systemic, involving multiple organs, different cell types and various molecular mediators. Organelle damages and oxidative stress appear to play a major role in the cytotoxic effects of PM 2.5 by mediating stress response pathways related to inflammation, metabolic alteration and cell death programmes. The organs or tissues in the digestive tract, such as the liver, pancreas and small intestines, are susceptible to PM 2.5 exposure. This review underscores PM 2.5 -induced inflammatory stress responses and their involvement in digestive diseases caused by PM 2.5 exposure.

### Catamenial pneumothorax with partial liver herniation due to diaphragmatic laceration: a case report and literature review [^113xMgt1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Catamenial pneumothorax is generally uncommon, with an incidence of less than 3–6% in women with spontaneous pneumothorax. As few cases of catamenial pneumothorax with diaphragmatic defect and liver herniation have been reported, this case report may be useful for understanding the cause and treatment. This case highlights the importance of the approach for liver hernia in patients with catamenial pneumothorax and endometriosis.

Case presentation

We report a case of catamenial pneumothorax in a 43-year-old woman with diaphragmatic partial liver hernia who was treated with thoracoscopic surgery. She was diagnosed with a right pneumothorax at menstruation onset. Chest computed tomography showed a nodule protruding above the right diaphragm. We performed thoracoscopic surgery to treat the persistent air leak and biopsied the nodule on the right diaphragm. There were blueberry spots on the diaphragm; the nodule was found to be the herniated liver. The diaphragmatic defect was sutured. Histological examination of the tissue near the partial prolapsed liver revealed endometrial tissue.

Conclusions

It is speculated that ectopic endometrial tissue in the diaphragm will periodically necrose to become a diaphragmatic tear, which is a pathway for air to enter the thoracic cavity and eventually a herniated liver. Thoracoscopic surgery should be considered in patients with catamenial pneumothorax when a diaphragmatic lesion is suspected.

PFO in Patients Undergoing Liver Transplantation

Paradoxical embolism is a well‐described phenomenon in the setting of liver transplantation. The presence of a PFO has been implicated in both air embolism and thromboembolism during or immediately following surgery. 43, 44 There is concern that a PFO may be a conduit for air embolism from placement of central lines, veno‐venous bypass, caval clamping, or inadequate flushing of the harvested transplant. The possibility of PFO‐mediated paradoxical embolism has stimulated interest among transplant centers in treating PFO with device closure before liver transplant surgery. This application has not been supported by randomized clinical trial data. Retrospective studies of liver transplant patients with existing PFO did not demonstrate improvement in length of stay in the intensive care unit, postoperative oxygen requirements, nor 30‐day mortality when compared with similar patients without PFO. 45, 46 Cerebrovascular accidents were not observed in either group. The conclusion was that the presence of a PFO does not adversely impact clinical outcomes after liver transplant surgery and that routine PFO closure should not be recommended for patients before surgery.

### The exposome and liver disease-how environmental factors affect liver health [^111BCTY3]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Since the initial development of the exposome concept, much effort has been devoted to the characterisation of the exposome through analytical, epidemiological, and toxicological/mechanistic studies. There is now an urgent need to link the exposome to human diseases and to include exposomics in the characterisation of environment-linked pathologies together with genomics and other omics. Liver diseases are particularly well suited for such studies since major functions of the liver include the detection, detoxification, and elimination of xenobiotics, as well as inflammatory responses. It is well known that several liver diseases are associated with i) addictive behaviours such as alcohol consumption, smoking, and to a certain extent dietary imbalance and obesity, ii) viral and parasitic infections, and iii) exposure to toxins and occupational chemicals. Recent studies indicate that environmental exposures are also significantly associated with liver diseases, and these include air pollution (particulate matter and volatile chemicals), contaminants such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, bisphenol A and per-and poly-fluorinated substances, and physical stressors such as radiation. Furthermore, microbial metabolites and the "gut-liver" axis play a major role in liver diseases. Exposomics is poised to play a major role in the field of liver pathology. Methodological advances such as the exposomics-metabolomics framework, the determination of risk factors' genomic and epigenomic signatures, and cross-species biological pathway analysis should further delineate the impact of the exposome on the liver, opening the way for improved prevention, as well as the identification of new biomarkers of exposure and effects, and additional therapeutic targets.

### Autoimmune regulator AIRE: evidence for genetic differences between autoimmune hepatitis And hepatitis as part of the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 [^112vkztB]. Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The mechanisms driving the immune-mediated destruction of hepatic tissues in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are unknown. Recently the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), a gene associated with the development of the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (APS-1), was cloned. About 15% to 20% of APS-1 patients develop hepatitis. However, the role of AIRE mutations in AIH, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is not known. To address this issue patients with AIH (n = 94), PSC (n = 60), and PBC (n = 30) were analyzed for the presence of mutations in exons 6, 8, and 10 of AIRE by single stranded conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis. Autoantibody patterns of patients with defects in AIRE were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. Heterozygous mutations of AIRE were identified in 3 patients: a patient with PBC and a patient with AIH type 1 carried a R257X mutation, and a patient with AIH type 2, diabetes mellitus type 1 (IDDM), thyroid disease, and atrophic gastritis carried a G305S mutation in the first PHD ring finger domain of the AIRE protein. None of the 3 patients with a defective AIRE allele showed autoantibodies, which are known to associate with APS-1. These findings show a differential genetic association of autoimmune liver diseases and hepatitis in APS-1. The subgroup of patients with heterozygous mutations in AIRE does not represent patients with an incomplete APS-1 syndrome. However, the Aire gene defect showed that genes involved in the induction of immunologic tolerance provide candidates for etiologic factors in autoimmune liver diseases.

### Venous air embolism and intracardiac thrombus after pressurized fibrin glue during liver surgery [^114iFFi6]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

After segmental liver resection, a fibrin glue aerosol was used to stop diffuse bleeding from the liver resection site. Immediately after pressurized administration, severe hypotension and bradycardia occurred, requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation and inotropic support. Transoesophageal echocardiography demonstrated air in both ventricles deriving from the inferior vena cava; contractility of both ventricles was markedly reduced. In addition, a 3 cm floating thrombus was detected in the right ventricle. This case demonstrates that sprayed fibrin glue can cause life-threatening air embolism and intracardiac thrombus formation in liver surgery.

### Long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter and liver enzymes in adults: a cross-sectional study in Taiwan [^115Pttqr]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Animal experiments indicate that exposure to particulate matter (PM) can induce hepatotoxic effects but epidemiological evidence is scarce. We aimed to investigate the associations between long-term exposure to PM air pollution and liver enzymes, which are biomarkers widely used for liver function assessment.

Methods

A cross-sectional analysis was performed among 351852 adult participants (mean age: 40.1years) who participated in a standard medical screening programme in Taiwan. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels were measured. A satellite-based spatio-temporal model was used to estimate the concentrations of ambient fine particles (PM with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5µm, PM 2.5) at each participant's address. Linear and logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations between PM 2.5 and the liver enzymes with adjustment for a wide range of potential confounders.

Results

After adjustment for confounders, every 10µg/m 3 increment in 2-year average PM 2.5 concentration was associated with 0.02%(95% CI: -0.04% to 0.08%), 0.61% (95% CI: 0.51% to 0.70%) and 1.60% (95% CI: 1.50% to 1.70%) increases in AST, ALT and GGT levels, respectively. Consistently, the odds ratios of having elevated liver enzymes (> 40IU/L) per 10µg/m 3 PM 2.5 increment were 1.06 (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.09), 1.09 (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.10) and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.11) for AST, ALT and GGT, respectively.

Conclusions

Long-term exposure to PM 2.5 was associated with increased levels of liver enzymes, especially ALT and GGT. More studies are needed to confirm our findings and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

### Spatial metabolomics and its application in the liver [^113N6FDm]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

In secondary ion mass spectrometry, a focused primary ion beam is fired at the tissue under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Gold, gallium, bismuth, and fullerene (C 60) cations are used as primary ions. Applying these over the tissue induces the generation and sputtering of secondary ions. Secondary ion mass spectrometry offers the best spatial resolution (nanometer) capabilities that can reach subcellular distributions; however, the high-energy beam may induce molecular fragmentation, making this technique more commonly used to study low molecular weight or inorganic species.

DESI is the so-called ambient ionization technique, meaning that no sample preparation is required, and ions are formed at atmospheric conditions. During DESI, an electrically charged solvent stream is sprayed at the tissue surface while the X-Y stage, holding the sample, moves. Ions are desorbed from the surface and enter the mass spectrometer through the inlet capillary. DESI has the advantage of being a "soft" ionization method; therefore, intact molecules can be readily analyzed. The pixel-to-pixel resolution achieved using DESI is typically 50–200 µm. However, higher spatial resolution is achievable with newer designs and/or over-sampling methodologies.

### The exposome and liver disease-how environmental factors affect liver health [^111Uoxv1]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Initial studies of the exposome have been primarily methodological and global, recent work has been more disease-oriented, e.g. targeting the exposome relevant for cancer, – lung diseaseor liver disorders. These developments have been supported by the integration of exposomics within omics approaches and subsequently the characterisation of the mechanistic links between various stressors and disease-relevant biological pathways. These disease-oriented health studies enable a more realistic evaluation of the most relevant determinants and allow for gene-environment interaction studies. Importantly, these developments contribute to bringing the exposome concept to the clinic and should support an improved understanding of disease determinants and ultimately improved prevention.

In the present review, we have analysed studies linking a variety of exposures to different liver diseases. Most of these studies did not use a non-targeted large-scale exposomics approach, yet they were included in order to enable a more comprehensive assessment of environmental determinants of liver diseases. We will first describe different biological pathways relevant to liver diseases, then we will discuss the implication of exposome components in different liver diseases, including metabolic, infectious, cholestatic diseases and cancer, highlighting specific or shared mechanistic aspects as well as clinical implications. In the conclusion, we identify the most promising approaches and tools to further develop this rapidly growing field.

### Impact of adaptive image receive coil technology for liver MR imaging at 3.0 tesla: intraindividual comparison with use of conventional coil [^113EJL7B]. European Journal of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

A newly developed Adaptive Image Receive (AIR) coil is designed to be more flexible to conform to the human body habitus, and may improve image quality by reducing the distance between the coil element and the imaging subject. This study evaluated the AIR coil's usefulness for liver MR imaging at 3.0 T in comparison with that of a conventional coil retrospectively.

Method

The study population comprised 50 consecutive patients, who underwent follow-up liver MR examinations with a 3.0-T MR system using both an AIR coil and a conventional coil to evaluate hepatocellular carcinoma. Three-dimensional fat-suppressed T1-weighted gradient-echo images before and after injection of an MRI contrast agent, T2-weighted single-shot fast spin-echo (SSFSE) images, and diffusion-weighted (DW) images obtained with the AIR coil were compared with corresponding images obtained with the conventional coil. One radiologist measured signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while two other radiologists used a 3-point scale to independently assess subjective image noise, artifacts, signal uniformity, and overall image quality.

Results

SNRs for the AIR coil were significantly higher than those for the conventional coil (P < .05). Subjective image noise for the AIR coil on pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted and DW images was lower than for the conventional coil for both readers (P < .05). Overall image quality on pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted and DW images for the AIR coil was better than that for the conventional coil for at least one reader (P < .05).

Conclusions

In comparison with the conventional coil, AIR coil improved SNR and image quality of liver MR imaging.
