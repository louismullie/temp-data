## Question

is clonazepam okay once daily

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether clonazepam can be taken once daily, and under what circumstances that is appropriate and safe. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam and whether its half-life supports once-daily dosing. Then, I should verify which indications have evidence or labeling that explicitly allow once-daily administration. Next, I will examine indications that typically require divided dosing and why. After that, I need to consider dose, duration, and dependence risks, especially with daily use. Finally, I should review special populations, drug interactions, and tapering principles to synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic foundation for once-daily dosing. Clonazepam has an elimination half-life of roughly 30–40 hours, with peak plasma concentrations achieved 1–4 hours after oral administration, and its kinetics are dose-independent across the usual range, which theoretically supports once-daily administration for some indications by maintaining relatively stable concentrations over 24 hours [^11222S7o] [^111Ag5dz].

> Now, I should verify which labeled or guideline-supported indications explicitly allow once-daily dosing. For insomnia, dosing of 0.25–0.5 mg at bedtime is recommended, which is inherently once daily and aligns with its long half-life to sustain sleep through the night [^116MpvLq] [^112MPyTM]. For REM sleep behavior disorder, expert guidance supports 0.25–1.0 mg at bedtime, again a once-nightly regimen that leverages sustained overnight effect while minimizing daytime sedation, though clinicians should screen for and monitor sleep-disordered breathing and falls risk, especially in older adults [^116jRPAb] [^115vkeVv]. For burning mouth syndrome, dosing ranges of 0.25–2 mg daily are described, which can be implemented as a single daily dose in many patients, though clinical response and tolerability should guide exact scheduling [^111roaQz] [^113nCPex]. For tardive dyskinesia, starting at 0.5 mg daily with maintenance up to 1–4 mg daily is reasonable as a once-daily regimen in many cases, with careful monitoring for sedation and paradoxical reactions [^112ZvS98]. For sleepwalking, 0.5–2 mg at bedtime is used, again fitting a once-daily nighttime strategy [^116rTupX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some indications still warrant divided dosing despite the long half-life. For panic disorder, the FDA-labeled starting dose is 0.25 mg twice daily with a typical target of 0.5 mg twice daily, reflecting both pharmacodynamic considerations and the need to blunt daytime symptom peaks; while some clinicians consolidate to once daily in select cases, this is not the standard labeled approach and should be reserved for carefully selected patients with close monitoring [^111e8N3e] [^113zvo5E]. For seizure disorders, initial dosing is 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses, with maintenance commonly divided to balance efficacy and adverse effects; once-daily regimens are generally not favored for epilepsy control because of peak–trough variability and breakthrough events, though individualization is possible in select contexts [^117WwEc2] [^115cd3m2].

> I need to ensure I address dose, duration, and dependence risk when considering daily use. Even at low doses, daily clonazepam can lead to clinically significant physical dependence within weeks to months, and the risk rises with higher doses and longer duration; thus, if daily therapy is used, it should be at the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary period with a planned reassessment and taper strategy to mitigate withdrawal and rebound phenomena [^117W3bay] [^112mN5d2]. Wait, let me verify the dose-risk framing: clinical consensus estimates consider ≤ 0.5 mg clonazepam/day as a low daily dose in diazepam-equivalent terms, which helps contextualize risk but does not negate dependence risk with chronic daily exposure [^111HaPj4].

> Next, I should review special populations and drug–drug interactions that modify once-daily safety. In older adults, clonazepam is on the Beers list due to increased sensitivity, prolonged sedation, cognitive effects, and fall risk; if used, start very low, go slow, and favor the lowest effective once-nightly dose for indications like RBD or insomnia, with explicit fall-prevention counseling and monitoring [^116jRPAb] [^116YPY5z]. In hepatic impairment, clonazepam's metabolism may be slowed, so caution and dose reduction are prudent; lorazepam may be preferred when hepatic dysfunction is significant because it lacks active metabolites and is not oxidatively metabolized [^117Nqcwy]. Concomitant opioids markedly increase the risk of profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death; if co-prescribed is unavoidable, limit doses and durations to the minimum and monitor closely, recognizing that many guidelines discourage co-prescribing altogether [^116i2r8F] [^117W3bay].

> I will now examine tapering principles, because once-daily regimens often still lead to dependence with chronic use. Discontinuation should be gradual to reduce the risk of withdrawal seizures, rebound anxiety or insomnia, and protracted symptoms; typical strategies reduce total daily dose by about 5–10% every 2–4 weeks, with slower pacing as needed, and patients should be counseled that symptoms can persist beyond drug elimination and may require supportive interventions during the taper [^113ih89W] [^113YCSLt]. Hold on, I should verify the minimum monitoring cadence: guidelines recommend reassessing risks and benefits at least every 3 months for patients on benzodiazepines, which is especially important if daily dosing continues beyond the short term [^116RJjo9].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a divided-dose regimen for panic disorder — can we consolidate to once daily safely? Let me reconsider: while pharmacokinetics may permit once-daily administration, clinical trials for panic disorder used divided dosing and showed optimal effect at 1 mg/day total. Consolidating to once daily may be feasible in select, stable patients, but it risks daytime breakthrough symptoms and should be done cautiously with shared decision-making and close follow-up, ideally after stabilization on an evidence-based maintenance dose [^113zvo5E] [^113bMoAQ].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, clonazepam can be taken once daily for certain indications — most clearly insomnia, REM sleep behavior disorder, burning mouth syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, and sleepwalking — where nighttime dosing leverages its long half-life while minimizing daytime impairment. However, for panic disorder and epilepsy, divided dosing remains standard, and any shift to once daily should be individualized with careful monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects [^116MpvLq] [^116jRPAb] [^111roaQz] [^112ZvS98] [^116rTupX] [^111e8N3e] [^117WwEc2]. I should double-check that daily use, even at low doses, carries dependence and withdrawal risks that necessitate the lowest effective dose, the shortest necessary duration, and a planned taper strategy, with enhanced caution in older adults, those with hepatic impairment, and anyone using CNS depressants such as opioids [^111HaPj4] [^117W3bay] [^116YPY5z] [^117Nqcwy] [^116i2r8F].

---

In select cases, **once-daily clonazepam is acceptable** when the indication, dose, and patient factors support it — notably for insomnia [^116MpvLq], REM sleep behavior disorder [^116jRPAb], and some anxiety or movement disorders [^112ZvS98] — but it is not standard for seizure disorders, which typically require divided dosing [^117WwEc2]. Once-daily use increases the risk of dependence and withdrawal [^111HaPj4]; therefore, use the lowest effective dose, avoid abrupt discontinuation, and monitor closely for sedation, cognitive effects, and misuse [^111uGba9] [^117W3bay]. For seizures or panic disorder, divided dosing remains preferred [^117WwEc2] [^111e8N3e]; once-daily use should be reserved for specific indications and patients with close clinical oversight.

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations for once-daily dosing

Clonazepam has a **long half-life (30–40 hours)** [^11222S7o] and high protein binding (~85%), supporting once-daily dosing in some contexts by maintaining stable plasma levels and sustained therapeutic effect [^111Ag5dz]. However, its CNS effects (sedation, cognitive impairment) can persist into the next day, especially at higher doses or in sensitive patients [^117WtDvJ].

---

## Clinical indications supporting once-daily dosing

Several conditions are commonly managed with **once-daily clonazepam**, typically at bedtime to leverage nighttime sedation and minimize daytime impairment:

| **Indication** | **Typical once-daily dose** | **Clinical rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Insomnia | 0.25–0.5 mg qHS [^116MpvLq] | Sedation aids sleep onset/maintenance [^notfound] |
| REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) | 0.25–1 mg qHS [^116jRPAb] | Reduces dream enactment; bedtime dosing aligns with pathophysiology [^115vkeVv] |
| Burning mouth syndrome | 0.25–2 mg daily [^111roaQz] | Single daily dose can be effective and well tolerated [^notfound] |
| Tardive dyskinesia | 0.5–4 mg daily [^112ZvS98] | Once-daily dosing may suffice for symptom control [^notfound] |
| Social anxiety disorder | 0.5–2 mg daily [^1123KBzb] | Once-daily dosing may be effective in some patients |

---

## Clinical indications requiring divided dosing

Some conditions require divided dosing to maintain therapeutic levels and minimize adverse effects:

- **Seizure disorders**: Initial 1.5 mg/day in 3 divided doses; maintenance 1.5–20 mg/day in 3 divided doses [^117WwEc2] [^115cd3m2].
- **Panic disorder**: 0.25 mg BID initially, titrated to 0.5 mg BID; divided dosing reduces daytime breakthrough anxiety [^111e8N3e] [^113zvo5E].
- **Lennox-Gastaut syndrome**: 1.5–20 mg/day in 3 divided doses [^114og7BE] [^116U34RY].

---

## Risks and benefits of once-daily dosing

### Benefits

Benefits include **improved adherence** with simpler once-daily regimens [^notfound] and reduced daytime sedation when dosed at bedtime. Steady-state levels from the long half-life can also provide sustained symptom control [^notfound].

---

### Risks

- **Dependence and withdrawal**: Daily use increases risk; abrupt cessation can cause severe withdrawal, including seizures [^111HaPj4] [^111uGba9].
- **Cognitive impairment**: Persistent sedation and memory problems, especially with prolonged use [^115aNnxW].
- **Respiratory depression**: Risk increases with CNS depressants (e.g. opioids, alcohol) [^116i2r8F].
- **Paradoxical reactions**: Anxiety, agitation, aggression, especially in children and elderly [^112kGLBd].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing once-daily dosing

- **Age**: Older adults are more sensitive to sedation and cognitive effects; start low, go slow [^116YPY5z].
- **Comorbidities**: Use caution in liver disease, respiratory disorders, and psychiatric conditions [^112EdZe7].
- **Concomitant medications**: Avoid with opioids, alcohol, and other CNS depressants due to additive effects [^116i2r8F].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Short-term use**: Limit to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration; reassess regularly [^112cwr2w].
- **Tapering**: Gradual taper required after prolonged use to avoid withdrawal [^113ih89W].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess efficacy, adverse effects, and misuse risk [^116RJjo9].

---

## Summary of evidence

Once-daily clonazepam can be appropriate for select indications (insomnia, RBD, burning mouth syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, social anxiety) when the dose is low, the duration is short, and the patient is monitored closely. For seizure disorders and panic disorder, **divided dosing is preferred** to maintain therapeutic levels and minimize adverse effects [^117WwEc2] [^111e8N3e]. Clinicians should weigh the risks of dependence, cognitive impairment, and respiratory depression against the benefits, and use the lowest effective dose with a clear taper plan [^117W3bay] [^112LBvns].

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1127AFf2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Issues related to switching to a longer-acting BZD are of particular concern in older adults, who may be at greater risk of medication-related harm because of age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, such as reduced clearance of certain sedative–hypnotic medications and increased sensitivity to CNS effects. Older adults' decreased hepatic metabolism changes how the body processes and responds to medications, causing them to stay in the body longer and increasing the risk of adverse effects. Chronic BZD use is also a concern for older adults as they are likely to be prescribed multiple medications, increasing their risk of morbidity and mortality from polypharmacy. In a recent scoping review of several international CPGs for BZD tapering, the two guidelines that did not recommend switching to a longer-acting BZD were focused on older adults. The CGC agreed that switching to a longer-acting BZD for tapering is less likely to be appropriate for older adults.

Some patients with SUD may report nonmedical use of prescribed BZDs or use of nonprescribed BZDs, which can make determining their daily BZD dose difficult. The CGC recommends that clinicians refer these patients for assessment of potential SUD. Unless contraindicated, these patients should typically be transitioned to a long-acting agent due to the uncertainty regarding the strength of the BZDs they are taking.

Guidelines that recommend transitioning to a longer-acting BZD most commonly endorse switching to diazepam or clonazepam, though a few suggest chlordiazepoxide. However, all of these medications are metabolized in the liver and have active metabolites and, thus, should not be used in patients with significant hepatic impairment. Instead, lorazepam — which is not impacted by hepatic function and does not have active metabolites — is a better agent to use in these patients. As discussed previously, conversion to diazepam equivalents is not straightforward and depends on patient factors such as age, metabolism, and other medications (see Appendix B for estimated BZD dose equivalents).

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

Recommendations for Considerations for Tapering Benzodiazepines

Clinicians should ideally assess the risks and benefits of ongoing BZD prescribing at least every 3 months for each patient taking BZD medications (see Tables 2 and 3; Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). a At a minimum, clinicians should assess the risks and benefits with each new BZD prescription or BZD prescription renewal (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). b Clinicians should review the information in the relevant prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) as part of the risk–benefit assessment (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Table 2
Potential Benefits and Risks of Continued BZD Use and BZD Tapering

A list of some of the potential benefits and risks to BZD use and tapering when considering whether to taper the medication. Clinicians should consider the likelihood of each benefit and risk for the individual patient. The narrative notes risk/hazard ratios available in the published literature

*Including compassionate use for end of life or palliative care

† Including risks associated with counterfeit BZDs from the illicit drug market, such as contamination with HPSOs (e.g. fentanyl) and novel synthetic substances

Table 3
Risk of Clinically Significant BZD Withdrawal

This table summarizes estimates of risk of experiencing clinically significant withdrawal depending on the dose, duration, and frequency of BZD use. This table is based on clinical consensus of the CGC. It is intended to provide general guidance and should not replace clinical judgment

*Many factors influence the risk of physical dependence and BZD withdrawal syndrome, including but not limited to age, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, other substance use, and prior history of withdrawal

† A low daily dose is estimated as 10 mg diazepam equivalents or less (e.g. ≤ 0.5 mg clonazepam, ≤ 2 mg lorazepam, ≤ 1 mg alprazolam). See Appendix B for BZD dose equivalents

FINAL THOUGHTS

Many of the topics discussed in this Guideline lacked controlled studies. Our systematic review found no trials comparing BZD tapering strategies or other important aspects of managing patients who are taking prescribed BZDs and likely to have developed physical dependence. Further research into best practices for BZD tapering strategies that support patient safety and optimal outcomes is urgently needed.

### Clonazepam repurposing inpatients through conventional RCT and N-of-1 trials: an experimental strategy for orphan disease development [^112UjMg6]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study

Patients with pathogenic variants in ARID1B were recruited via the CSS expertise centre of the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), Leiden, the Netherlands. The schedule of assessments is listed in online supplemental table S1. The randomisation code was generated by a study-independent CHDR statistician. In this two-way crossover, placebo-controlled, randomised study, each study period or occasion was 22 days, and a 3-week washout separated each study period or occasion (figure 1A). The starting dose (i.e. 0.01 mg/kg daily) was decided with several physicians with experience in prescribing clonazepam to children, in an attempt to minimise the chance on sedative effects. This dose is half the minimum starting dosage of the administration of clonazepam for anxiety in children (i.e. 0.02 mg/kg daily). Study drug clonazepam or placebo was administered to the subjects as follows: day 1–3: starting dose was 0.005 mg/kg, two times per day (max. 0.5 mg); day 4–6: 0.01 mg/kg, two times per day (max. 0.5 mg); day 7–22: 0.015 mg/kg, two times per day (max. 0.5 mg). Patients received a single starting dose of 0.005 mg/kg (max. 0.5 mg) at their first visit and were subsequently monitored for 5 hours for safety and tolerability, PK and PD effects. If the dose on day 1 was well tolerated, patients took the same dose before bedtime and continued the regimen as described. If side effects related to the treatment were observed, dose was reduced to half of the current dose for 3 days. Thereafter, the original dose at which the side effects first occurred was restarted. If side effects re-emerged, patients remained on the lower dose. In case of clinically significant side effects at the lower dose, patients were excluded.

### Clonazepam [^112kGLBd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General:

Worsening of Seizures:

When used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, clonazepam may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal). This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and clonazepam may produce absence status.

Loss of Effect:

In some studies, up to 30% of patients who initially responded have shown a loss of anticonvulsant activity, often within 3 months of administration. In some cases, dosage adjustment may reestablish efficacy.

Laboratory Testing During Long-Term Therapy:

Periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during long-term therapy with clonazepam.

Psychiatric and Paradoxical Reactions:

Paradoxical reactions, such as agitation, irritability, aggression, anxiety, anger, nightmares, hallucinations, and psychoses are known to occur when using benzodiazepines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric). Should this occur, the use of the drug should be discontinued gradually (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence). Paradoxical reactions are more likely to occur in children and in the elderly.

Caution in Renally Impaired Patients:

Metabolites of clonazepam are excreted by the kidneys; to avoid their excess accumulation, caution should be exercised in the administration of the drug to patients with impaired renal function.

Hypersalivation:

Clonazepam may produce an increase in salivation. This should be considered before giving the drug to patients who have difficulty handling secretions.

Respiratory Depression:

Clonazepam may cause respiratory depression and should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea).

Porphyria:

Clonazepam may have a porphyrogenic effect and should be used with care in patients with porphyria.

Information for Patients:

A Clonazepam Tablets Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time clonazepam is dispensed, as required by law. Patients should be instructed to take clonazepam only as prescribed. Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe clonazepam:

Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids:

Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if clonazepam is used with opioids and not to use such drugs concomitantly unless supervised by a health care provider (see WARNINGS: Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

### Clonazepam (Klonopin) [^1123KBzb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The dosage of clonazepam PO for treatment of social anxiety disorder in adults is:

- **Start at**: 0.25 mg PO BID
- **Maintenance**: 0.5–2 mg PO daily

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116yr6a2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — risk–benefit rationale and duration guidance: In 2020, the FDA updated the required Boxed Warning for BZD medications to describe the risks of physical dependence, withdrawal, and BZD use disorder. Long-term BZD use is often associated with more risks than benefits, with risks including oversedation, cognitive impairment, falls, motor vehicle accidents, and fatal and nonfatal overdose. Short-term BZD use is associated with decreased anxiety and insomnia, with duration of use typically recommended to not exceed 4 weeks, and therapeutic effects diminished within days to weeks.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115Zjn3Z]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — short-duration use and short-taper option: Although many patients who have been taking BZDs for a short period of time (e.g., less than a month) are able to discontinue the medication without a taper, clinicians can consider a short taper, and a short taper may be indicated if clinicians have concerns for clinically significant withdrawal or patients express concerns about discontinuing the medication.

### A critical review of the pharmacological treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder in adults: time for more and larger randomized placebo-controlled trials [^112XnJjc]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Two retrospective studies by Ferri et al. (2013a, b) were eligible for inclusion, but as the authors did not report the exact number of clinical responders, this data could not be included in Tables 2 and S1. Ferri et al. (2013a) first compared the PSGs of 13 iRBD patients before and after they took 0.5–1 mg clonazepam for an average duration of 2.6 ± 1.1 years. The primary outcome was the RBD severity scale (RBDSS), which rates RBD severity based on the DEB recorded by PSG, along with the RWA and CGI. No differences were found longitudinally in these patients, indicating that long-term clonazepam administration did not reduce clinical RBD severity. In a second study, Ferri et al. (2013b) retrospectively compared the same outcome measures in a group of 15 iRBD patients assessed before and after taking 0.125–1 mg clonazepam for 2.8 ± 1.6 years. Again, clonazepam was not found to significantly reduce objective or subjective RBD severity. These studies put the presumed magnitude of the clinical effectiveness of clonazepam in doubt. A limitation across these studies is that the data was retrospectively analyzed and that no control intervention was administered to compare the treatment effects against.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116V8uvF]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) has partnered with nine other medical societies and professional associations representing a wide range of clinical settings and patient populations to provide guidance on evidence-based strategies for tapering benzodiazepine (BZD) medication across a variety of settings.

Methods

The guideline was developed following modified GRADE methodology and clinical consensus process. The process included a systematic literature review as well as several targeted supplemental searches. The clinical practice guideline was revised based on external stakeholder review.

Recommendations

Key takeaways included the following: Clinicians should engage in ongoing risk-benefit assessment of BZD use/tapering, clinicians should utilize shared decision-making strategies in collaboration with patients, clinicians should not discontinue BZDs abruptly in patients who are likely to be physically dependent and at risk of withdrawal, clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each patient and adjust tapering based on patient response, and clinicians should offer patients adjunctive psychosocial interventions to support successful tapering.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116FJAqX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal risk and determining physical dependence: when discontinuation is appropriate, clinicians "need to first determine if patients are likely to be physically dependent on the medication, and therefore at risk of withdrawal". The risk of severe withdrawal has "been recognized since the 1960 s", and factors increasing risk include "use of shorter acting BZD, higher dose, and longer duration of treatment". Many patients using BZDs for a short time "(e.g., less than a month)" may stop without withdrawal, but those using low doses for an intermediate time "(e.g., 6 weeks)" may not be dependent. For alprazolam, which has "a very short half-life, rapid onset of action, and no active metabolites", dependence can occur more rapidly; therefore, "a taper may be appropriate" even for daily use of short duration "(e.g., 2–4 weeks)". If dependence is uncertain, clinicians "should elicit information from patients" about concerns and preferences, and strict thresholds are difficult because risk is influenced by multiple patient and drug factors.

### Clonazepam repurposing inpatients through conventional RCT and N-of-1 trials: an experimental strategy for orphan disease development [^1118GRrG]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

N-of-1 design

Parents who spontaneously indicated they wanted to continue clonazepam treatment were included in an N-of-1 follow-up protocol. The N-of-1 trials were performed before unblinding and no data of the crossover study were available. This trial was composed of two phases (figure 1B).

Phase I: dose titration (variable duration, max. 6 weeks)

The objective of the open-label titration phase was to identify the minimum effective dosage. The open-label titration phase started with a daily dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day in two doses. After 4–7 days, the effects were evaluated and compared with results of the conventional RCT, and the dose was adjusted based on parental feedback, with a maximum dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day. Once parents were satisfied with the effect, this dose was maintained for at least 7 days. After this, the titration phase ended, and the dose was tapered off by 0.01 mg/kg every 3 days. During this phase, individual primary outcome treatment goals were set in consultation with parents using weighed Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) with six defined levels per goal (see online supplemental table S5)and a paper copy was given to parents.

Phase II: a single crossover trial consisting of three treatment periods: placebo, double blind and clonazepam

Phase II lasted 14 weeks and started with an open-label placebo period of 4 weeks. Subsequently, a double-blinded period was started until week 10. During this period, new study medication was started every 2 weeks. This study medication was prepared and provided by our pharmacy. The pharmacist determined randomly when the switch to clonazepam was made during the double-blinded period. This double-blinded period was followed by an open-label period of 4 weeks of clonazepam (figure 1B). There was only one crossover from placebo to clonazepam; therefore, no washout period was required. Regular contact with parents, teacher or mentor by the physician occurred every 2 weeks by phone to evaluate progress in achieving previously established goals. Each goal was scored individually during phase II; from these separate scores, a single aggregated T score was produced using a standardised formula. Treatment goals were classified in the domains defined by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health-Children and Youth version. Additionally, parents were asked to complete the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) questionnaire every 2 weeks and the ABC questionnaire, as used in the conventional RCT study.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111UY244]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering guideline — scope and exclusions states that the Guideline focuses on whether and how to taper benzodiazepine (BZD) medications, including assessing risks and benefits, partnering with patients, level of care, and tapering strategies with withdrawal management. It pertains to patients taking BZDs regularly and at risk of physical dependence and withdrawal, and addresses population-specific considerations including co-prescribed BZDs and opioids, SUD, other psychiatric disorders, older adults, and pregnant and lactating patients. It is not applicable to patients who are prescribed BZDs but are not taking them regularly, nor to those prescribed BZDs for a short period of time (e.g., for under 2 weeks for the management of agitation, acute anxiety, or alcohol withdrawal); non-BZD medications acting on GABA receptors and children and adolescents (i.e., < 18 years old) are beyond the scope.

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^116xHLB8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines are often prescribed for a variety of indications, including anxiety and sleep disorders. Although available clinical guidelines generally recommend avoiding the use of benzodiazepines for more than 4 weeks, long-term use is common.

The effectiveness of benzodiazepine medications may decrease over time as tolerance develops, but risks persist or, in the case of physical dependence and withdrawal, increase over time. While there are some limited indications for longer-term use, such as treatment-resistant anxiety or certain sleep disorders, particularly those associated with abnormal movement, for many patients, the risks may quickly begin to outweigh the benefits.

Tapering benzodiazepines can be very challenging, and clinicians across specialties often struggle to help patients reduce the dose or discontinue benzodiazepines without compromising the patient's wellness or quality of life. It can be particularly difficult in the primary care setting, which has limited capacity for ongoing patient monitoring or providing additional support, such as case management or behavioral treatment. Lack of clear guidance on when to consider tapering and how to approach it has only compounded this issue, limiting some clinicians' willingness to take on this challenge. Far too often, these combined factors have led to inertia, with patients maintained on benzodiazepine medications long after they stop providing a clinical benefit or begin contributing to harm.

Suicidal Behavior and Ideation:

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including clonazepam, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.

Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% Cl:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43% compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).
The use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing clonazepam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS).
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue clonazepam or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS).

### Clonazepam for treatment of sleep disturbances associated with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder [^114MZYdy]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Clonazepam is widely used for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related sleep disturbances despite very limited published data supporting its use for this indication.

Objective

We conducted a pilot-controlled trial to provide more data on this clinical practice and lay the foundation for more definitive studies.

Methods

The study was designed as a randomized, single-blind (ie, patient only), placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial involving administration of clonazepam 1 mg at bedtime for one week followed by 2 mg at bedtime for one week. The following week served as a washout period before the alternate treatment was begun. Patients completed sleep diaries each morning upon awakening throughout the study. Parameters included quantity of sleep, quality of sleep, frequency and intensity of difficulty falling or staying asleep, and frequency and intensity of recurrent distressing dreams.

Results

Six patients with combat-related PTSD participated in the study. There were no statistically significant differences between clonazepam and placebo for any measure, although clonazepam therapy resulted in mild to moderate numeric improvements in difficulty falling or staying asleep. Adverse effects of clonazepam were generally mild and essentially indiscernible from those attributed to placebo. Only one patient elected to receive further treatment with clonazepam at the conclusion of the trial.

Conclusions

Clonazepam therapy was largely ineffective in improving sleep disturbances, particularly nightmares, associated with combat-related PTSD. The small sample size was a significant limitation of this study, but the prospective design and single-blind, placebo-control parameters were strengths. Further studies are needed to further define the role of this widespread clinical practice.

Pharmacodynamics

The precise mechanism by which clonazepam exerts its antiseizure and antipanic effects is unknown, although it is believed to be related to its ability to enhance the activity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.

Pharmacokinetics

Clonazepam is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of clonazepam is about 90%. Maximum plasma concentrations of clonazepam are reached within 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. Clonazepam is approximately 85% bound to plasma proteins. Clonazepam is highly metabolized, with less than 2% unchanged clonazepam being excreted in the urine. Biotransformation occurs mainly by reduction of the 7-nitro group to the 4-amino derivative. This derivative can be acetylated, hydroxylated and glucuronidated. Cytochrome P-450 including CYP3A, may play an important role in clonazepam reduction and oxidation. The elimination half-life of clonazepam is typically 30 to 40 hours. Clonazepam pharmacokinetics are dose-independent throughout the dosing range. There is no evidence that clonazepam induces its own metabolism or that of other drugs in humans.

Pharmacokinetics in Demographic Subpopulations and in Disease States

Controlled studies examining the influence of gender and age on clonazepam pharmacokinetics have not been conducted, nor have the effects of renal or liver disease on clonazepam pharmacokinetics been studied. Because clonazepam undergoes hepatic metabolism, it is possible that liver disease will impair clonazepam elimination. Thus, caution should be exercised when administering clonazepam to these patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

In children, clearance values of 0.42 ± 0.32 mL/min/kg (ages 2–18 years) and 0.88 ± 0.4 mL/min/kg (ages 7–12 years) were reported; these values decreased with increasing body weight. Ketogenic diet in children does not affect clonazepam concentrations.

Who should not take clonazepam tablets?

Do not take clonazepam tablets if you:

are allergic to benzodiazepines
have significant liver disease
have an eye disease called acute narrow angle glaucoma

Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if you have any of the problems listed above.

Before you take clonazepam tablets, tell your healthcare provider if you:

have liver or kidney problems
have lung problems (respiratory disease)
have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior
have any other medical problems
are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.
Taking clonazepam tablets late in pregnancy may cause your baby to have symptoms of sedation (breathing problems, sluggishness, low muscle tone), and/or withdrawal symptoms (jitteriness, irritability, restlessness, shaking, excessive crying, feeding problems).
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant or think you are pregnant during treatment with clonazepam tablets.
If you become pregnant while taking clonazepam tablets, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry. You can register by calling 1–888–233–2334. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy.
are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Clonazepam can pass into breast milk.
Breastfeeding during treatment with clonazepam tablets may cause your baby to have sleepiness, feeding problems, and decreased weight gain.
Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby while you take clonazepam tablets.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112mN5d2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — heterogeneity and withdrawal risk indicates that although factors that increase the risk of withdrawal are known, no established way to accurately predict which patients may have more difficulty with the taper currently exists. Many patients who have been taking BZDs for less than a month, particularly at low doses, are unlikely to be physically dependent and typically able to discontinue the medication without a taper; however, physical dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients, making it not always clear whether a patient is at risk of withdrawal. Depending on the specific BZD medication and patient characteristics, some patients who have been taking prescribed BZDs daily or near daily for less than a month may benefit from tapering. The recommendations in this Guideline provide flexibility and encourage close patient monitoring to account for the heterogeneity of patient responses, and the CGC noted that patient support is a key factor in the success of a taper. It can be helpful for clinicians and patients to discuss what to expect with the taper, how to manage withdrawal symptoms, and how to contact clinicians before the next scheduled visit to help patients feel more confident and in control.

### Benzodiazepines: risks and benefits. A reconsideration [^115m6BNC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Over the last decade there have been further developments in our knowledge of the risks and benefits of benzodiazepines, and of the risks and benefits of alternatives to benzodiazepines. Representatives drawn from the Psychopharmacology Special Interest Group of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the British Association for Psychopharmacology together examined these developments, and have provided this joint statement with recommendations for clinical practice. The working group was mindful of widespread concerns about benzodiazepines and related anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs. The group believes that whenever benzodiazepines are prescribed, the potential for dependence or other harmful effects must be considered. However, the group also believes that the risks of dependence associated with long-term use should be balanced against the benefits that in many cases follow from the short or intermittent use of benzodiazepines and the risk of the underlying conditions for which treatment is being provided.

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^112LBvns]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The new Joint Clinical Practice Guideline on Benzodiazepine Tapering published in this special issue can assist clinicians with overcoming the dilemmas and uncertainties that have hindered benzodiazepine tapering (when clinically appropriate to do so). This guideline was developed through a partnership of experts from 10 professional societies representing a broad spectrum of specialties that are commonly involved in prescribing or supporting tapering of benzodiazepines: family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry, neurology, geriatrics, addiction medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatric pharmacy, and medical toxicology. The Guideline emphasizes the importance of a patient-centered process with shared decision making and the goal of maximizing benefits while minimizing harm to each person's health and well-being.

The Guideline recommends regular reassessment of each patient, considering both the risks and benefits of ongoing benzodiazepine therapy as well as those associated with benzodiazepine tapering. Tapering is recommended when the overall risks outweigh the benefits of continued benzodiazepine therapy for the individual. The Guideline also notes that clinicians should generally consider tapering of long-term benzodiazepines in older adults, unless there are compelling reasons for continuation. When benzodiazepine tapering is indicated, the Guideline emphasizes the importance of starting low and going slow (e.g. beginning with a 5–10% reduction in total daily dose every 2–4 weeks), monitoring patients for signs and symptoms of withdrawal or other negative taper-associated effects following each dose reduction, and adjusting the tapering pace based on each patient's response (i.e. as tolerated by an individual patient).

### Clonazepam [^116i2r8F]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids:

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe clonazepam concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when clonazepam is used with opioids (see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction:

The use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Abuse).

Before prescribing clonazepam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of clonazepam, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of clonazepam along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

### Clonazepam monotherapy for treating people with newly diagnosed epilepsy [^115ecDcL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide, with an age-adjusted prevalence of 4 to 8 per 1000 population and an age-adjusted incidence of 44 per 100,000 person-years in developed countries. Monotherapy represents the best therapeutic option in people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2019, Issue 11.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of oral clonazepam used as monotherapy for newly diagnosed epilepsy, compared with placebo or a different anti-seizure medication.

Search Methods

For the latest update of this review we searched the following databases on 14 September 2021: the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 13 September 2021). CRS Web includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Specialized Registers of Cochrane Review Groups, including Epilepsy.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs or quasi-RCTs comparing oral clonazepam used as monotherapy treatment versus placebo or a different anti-seizure medication (active comparator) in people of any age with newly diagnosed epilepsy, defined according to the clinical practical definition proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE).

Data Collection and Analysis

The following outcomes were considered: proportion of participants seizure-free at one, three, six, 12, and 24 months after randomization; proportion of responders (those with at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency from baseline to end of treatment); proportion of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the treatment period or leading to discontinuation during the treatment period; proportion of dropouts/withdrawals due to side effects, lack of efficacy or other reasons; and improvement in quality of life, as assessed by validated and reliable rating scales. Two review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts to assess the eligibility of publications identified by the searches. We independently extracted data from trial reports and cross-checked them for accuracy. Any disagreements between the two authors regarding data extraction were resolved by discussion and consensus. We scrutinized trials and evaluated the methodological quality of all included studies. We used GRADE assessment criteria to evaluate the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

Two randomized controlled trials had already been included in the previous version of the review, with a total of 115 participants. One study compared clonazepam to carbamazepine as monotherapy for participants with newly diagnosed psychomotor epilepsy (a condition corresponding to what is now termed mesial temporal lobe epilepsy). One study (published as an abstract) compared clonazepam to ethosuximide as monotherapy for children with absence seizures. Based on the available data and the details on methodology provided, we judged both studies as being at unclear or high risk of bias for the domains assessed (apart from the selective reporting (reporting bias) domain - we judged one study as being at low risk of bias and the other study at high risk of bias). In the study comparing clonazepam to carbamazepine, no difference was found between the groups regarding the proportion of participants who were seizure-free at one month after randomization (risk ratio (RR) 1.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 3.94; 30 participants; very low-certainty evidence), three months after randomization (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.29; 26 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and six months after randomization (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.73; 9 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No statistical difference was found between clonazepam and carbamazepine in terms of proportion of participants with TEAEs leading to discontinuation (RR 2.61, 95% CI 0.80 to 8.52; 36 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and in terms of dropouts/withdrawals due to side effects, lack of efficacy or other reasons (RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.02; 36 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not provide any information on our other prespecified outcomes of interest. The study comparing clonazepam to ethosuximide did not provide any data on efficacy. The proportion of dropouts/withdrawal was higher in the group receiving clonazepam compared to the group receiving ethosuximide (RR 3.63, 95% CI 1.12 to 11.74; 79 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No information on other outcomes of interest was provided in this study.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find any new studies since the last version of this review. There is only limited and very low-certainty evidence from randomized controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of clonazepam used in monotherapy for the treatment of epilepsy. No difference in efficacy and tolerability was found in a small trial comparing clonazepam to carbamazepine for the treatment of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Clonazepam was less well tolerated than ethosuximide in a trial of children with absence seizures, however no comparative data on efficacy were provided. There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of clonazepam as monotherapy treatment for epilepsy.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^117MFd39]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering implementation — level of care and follow-up: Tapering initiated in an inpatient or residential medically managed level of care may be continued in a less intensive level of care once it is safe to do so. When tapering with very long-acting agents, discharge planning should include an outpatient follow-up appointment, ideally within 7 days. Clinicians should assess patients for ongoing signs or symptoms related to discontinuation of the BZD, including re-emergence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed, and should consider medications and/or behavioral interventions to address ongoing signs or symptoms related to discontinuation of the BZD.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Clonazepam is available as a tablet. The tablets should be administered with water by swallowing the tablet whole.

Seizure Disorders:

The use of multiple anticonvulsants may result in an increase of CNS depressant adverse effects. This should be considered before adding clonazepam to an existing anticonvulsant regimen.

Adults:

The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.

Pediatric Patients:

Clonazepam is administered orally. In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses. Dosage should be increased by no more than 0.25 to 0.5 mg every third day until a daily maintenance dose of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg of body weight has been reached, unless seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increase. Whenever possible, the daily dose should be divided into three equal doses. If doses are not equally divided, the largest dose should be given before retiring.

Geriatric Patients:

There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam in seizure disorder patients 65 years of age and older. In general, elderly patients should be started on low doses of clonazepam and observed closely (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

### Clonazepam [^1173s2e7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More among Clonazepam-Treated Patients:

Table 3 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred during acute therapy of panic disorder from a pool of two 6- to 9-week trials. Events reported in 1% or more of patients treated with clonazepam (doses ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/day) and for which the incidence was greater than that in placebo-treated patients are included.

The prescriber should be aware that the figures in Table 3 cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence in the population studied.

Commonly Observed Adverse Events:

Treatment-Emergent Depressive Symptoms:

In the pool of two short-term placebo-controlled trials, adverse events classified under the preferred term "depression" were reported in 7% of clonazepam-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients, without any clear pattern of dose relatedness. In these same trials, adverse events classified under the preferred term "depression" were reported as leading to discontinuation in 4% of clonazepam-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients. While these findings are noteworthy, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) data collected in these trials revealed a larger decline in HAM-D scores in the clonazepam group than the placebo group suggesting that clonazepam-treated patients were not experiencing a worsening or emergence of clinical depression.

Clonazepam Tablets

for oral use

What is the most important information I should know about clonazepam tablets?

Clonazepam tablets are benzodiazepine medicine. Taking benzodiazepines with opioid medicines, alcohol, or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (including street drugs) can cause severe drowsiness, breathing problems (respiratory depression), coma, and death. Get emergency help right away if any of the following happens:
shallow or slowed breathing
breathing stops (which may lead to the heart stopping)
excessive sleepiness (sedation)
Do not drive or operate heavy machinery until you know how taking clonazepamtablets and opioids affects you.
Risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction. There is a risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction with benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, which can lead to overdose and serious side effects including coma and death.
Serious side effects including coma and death have happened in people who have abused or misused benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets. These serious side effects may also include delirium, paranoia, suicidal thoughts or actions, seizures, and difficulty breathing. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these serious side effects.
You can develop an addiction even if you take clonazepam tablets as prescribed by your healthcare provider.
Take clonazepam tablets exactly as your healthcare provider prescribed.
Do not share your clonazepamtablets with other people.
Keep clonazepam tablets in a safe place and away from children.
Physical dependence and withdrawal reactions. Clonazepam tablets can cause physical dependence and withdrawal reactions.
Do not suddenly stop taking clonazepam tablets. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious and life-threatening side effects, including, unusual movements, responses, or expressions, seizures, sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes, depression, seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear, an extreme increase in activity or talking, losing touch with reality, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these symptoms.
Some people who suddenly stop benzodiazepines have symptoms that can last for several weeks to more than 12 months, including, anxiety, trouble remembering, learning, or concentrating, depression, problems sleeping, feeling like insects are crawling under your skin, weakness, shaking, muscle twitching, burning or prickling feeling in your hands, arms, legs or feet, and ringing in your ears.
Physical dependence is not the same as drug addiction. Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the differences between physical dependence and drug addiction.
Do not take more clonazepam tablets than prescribed or take clonazepam tablets for longer than prescribed.
Clonazepam tablets can make you sleepy or dizzy and can slow your thinking and motor skills. This may get better over time.
Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how clonazepam tablets affect you.
Clonazepam tablets may cause problems with your coordination, especially when you are walking or picking things up.
Do not drink alcohol or take other drugs that may make you sleepy or dizzy while taking clonazepam tablets until you talk to your healthcare provider. When taken with alcohol or drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness, clonazepam tablets may make your sleepiness or dizziness worse.
Like other antiepileptic drugs, clonazepam tablets may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500.
Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you:

Selection of longer-acting benzodiazepines during transition reports that guidelines recommending a transition most commonly endorse switching to diazepam or clonazepam, with a few suggesting chlordiazepoxide; because all of these are metabolized in the liver and have active metabolites, they should not be used in patients with significant hepatic impairment; instead, lorazepam — which is not impacted by hepatic function and does not have active metabolites — is a better agent in these patients; conversion to diazepam equivalents is not straightforward and depends on patient factors such as age, metabolism, and other medications.

Dose equivalencies for clonazepam will not hold for all patients and must be individualized according to the patient's response, and adequate dosing of clonazepam will control sedative withdrawal symptoms including increased heart rate, sweating, and hand tremor. Benzodiazepines should be tapered over a period of weeks or months with taper duration based on agent of choice, dose, frequency and duration of use, comorbid physical or mental health conditions, and treatment setting; in patients who are not hospitalized, the medication should not be tapered any more rapidly than 25 percent per week, and as the taper nears the end it may be necessary to taper more slowly if anxiety or insomnia develop, with these symptoms continuing for many months, and comorbid conditions should be monitored throughout withdrawal to inform the taper schedule. If withdrawal symptoms increase, medication dosage should be stabilized or even increased for a period of days, and signs and symptoms of sedative withdrawal may last beyond the period of acute withdrawal, may take months or years to resolve, and should be treated with evidence-based interventions. If the patient is experiencing both sedative and opioid withdrawal, provide methadone or buprenorphine to stabilize withdrawal from opioids before tapering the dose of the sedative, and if the patient has been using multiple sedative substances or a sedative and alcohol, withdrawal should be handled by using an equivalent or longer-acting agent than the longest-acting agent used by the patient.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116sm4oV]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) pharmacologic management in older and neurodegenerative populations — clonazepam, melatonin, and rivastigmine — includes safety and dosing considerations. Concerning side effects of clonazepam include morning sedation, gait imbalance/falls, depression, and cognitive disturbances, and clonazepam can also exacerbate sleep-disordered breathing; among patients with secondary RBD and DLB or PD, clonazepam is often used in lower doses, starting at 0.25 mg, and dose requirements may decrease with aging, for example from 1.0 mg at age 55 years to 0.5 mg at age 70 years. Melatonin is an intriguing option for older patients (> 50 years old) because it is only mildly sedating, with dosing starting with 3 mg and increasing by 3-mg increments to 15 mg. Rivastigmine is typically administered by transdermal patch with dosing that starts at 4.6 mg applied every 24 hours and can increase to 13.3 mg daily, and adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea, bradycardia, and possible excessive daytime sleepiness in secondary RBD.

Clinical Trials:

Panic Disorder:

The effectiveness of clonazepam in the treatment of panic disorder was demonstrated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients who had a primary diagnosis of panic disorder (DSM-IIIR) with or without agoraphobia. In these studies, clonazepam was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo in treating panic disorder on change from baseline in panic attack frequency, the Clinician's Global Impression Severity of Illness Score and the Clinician's Global Impression Improvement Score.

Study 1 was a 9-week, fixed-dose study involving clonazepam doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/day or placebo. This study was conducted in four phases: a 1-week placebo lead-in, a 3-week upward titration, a 6-week fixed dose, and a 7-week discontinuance phase. A significant difference from placebo was observed consistently only for the 1 mg/day group. The difference between the 1 mg dose group and placebo in reduction from baseline in the number of full panic attacks was approximately 1 panic attack per week. At endpoint, 74% of patients receiving clonazepam 1 mg/day were free of full panic attacks, compared to 56% of placebo-treated patients.

Study 2 was a 6-week, flexible-dose study involving clonazepam in a dose range of 0.5 to 4 mg/day or placebo. This study was conducted in three phases: a 1-week placebo lead-in, a 6-week optimal-dose, and a 6-week discontinuance phase. The mean clonazepam dose during the optimal dosing period was 2.3 mg/day. The difference between clonazepam and placebo in reduction from baseline in the number of full panic attacks was approximately 1 panic attack per week. At endpoint, 62% of patients receiving clonazepam were free of full panic attacks, compared to 37% of placebo-treated patients.

Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of race or gender.

Introduction

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the management of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in adults.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and assign strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. The task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Good Practice Statement

The following good practice statement is based on expert consensus, and its implementation is necessary for the appropriate and effective management of patients with RBD: It is critically important to help patients maintain a safe sleeping environment to prevent potentially injurious nocturnal behaviors. In particular, the removal of bedside weapons, or objects that could inflict injury if thrown or wielded against a bed partner, is of paramount importance. Sharp furniture like nightstands should be moved away or their edges and headboard should be padded. To reduce the risk of injurious falls, a soft carpet, rug, or mat should be placed next to the bed. Patients with severe, uncontrolled RBD should be recommended to sleep separately from their partners, or at the minimum, to place a pillow between themselves and their partners.

Recommendations

The following recommendations, with medications listed in alphabetical order, are a guide for clinicians in choosing a specific treatment for RBD in adults. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength ("strong" or "conditional"). A "strong" recommendation (ie, "We recommend… ") is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A "conditional" recommendation (ie, "We suggest… ") is one that requires that the clinician use clinical knowledge and experience and strongly consider the patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action.

Adult patients with isolated RBD.

1. The AASM suggests that clinicians use clonazepam (vs no treatment) for the treatment of isolated RBD in adults. (CONDITIONAL).

2. * The AASM suggests that clinicians use immediate-release melatonin (vs no treatment) for the treatment of isolated RBD in adults. (CONDITIONAL).

3. * The AASM suggests that clinicians use pramipexole (vs no treatment) for the treatment of isolated RBD in adults. (CONDITIONAL).

4. The AASM suggests that clinicians use transdermal rivastigmine (vs no treatment) for the treatment of isolated RBD in adults with mild cognitive impairment. (CONDITIONAL).

Adult patients with secondary RBD due to medical condition.

5. * The AASM suggests that clinicians use clonazepam (vs no treatment) for the treatment of secondary RBD due to medical condition in adults. (CONDITIONAL).

6. * The AASM suggests that clinicians use immediate-release melatonin (vs no treatment) for the treatment of secondary RBD due to medical condition in adults. (CONDITIONAL).

7. The AASM suggests that clinicians use transdermal rivastigmine (vs no treatment) for the treatment of secondary RBD due to medical condition (Parkinson disease) in adults. (CONDITIONAL).

8. * The AASM suggests that clinicians not use deep brain stimulation (DBS; vs no treatment) for the treatment of secondary RBD due to medical condition in adults. (CONDITIONAL).

Adult patients with drug-induced RBD.

9. * The AASM suggests that clinicians use drug discontinuation (vs drug continuation) for the treatment of drug-induced RBD in adults. (CONDITIONAL).

* The Recommendations section of this paper includes remarks that provide additional context to guide clinicians with implementation of this recommendation.

Clonazepam for isolated RBD — mechanism, effects, dosing, and caution: As a long-acting benzodiazepine, clonazepam promotes GABAergic inhibition by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening. Clonazepam reduces dream enactment, with only minimal reduction in REM sleep motor tone on PSG, and most patients initially respond well to low doses (0.25–1.0 mg) administered at bedtime; higher doses may be considered in the absence of response if well tolerated. Clonazepam is listed on the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria list of potentially inappropriate medications in older adults.

GABA A Receptor-Binding Drugs: Benzodiazepines (Diazepam or Clonazepam)

Diazepam or clonazepam provide transient help to most patients, but the high doses sometimes required cannot be tolerated because of somnolence, mood changes, and fatigue, especially in the elderly, while chronic use frequently leads to dependency. It is preferable, therefore, to start with low doses of diazepam, 5 mg BID, and if well tolerated increase it to 15 mg daily or up to 10 mg BID adding a third dose as needed. One should try to avoid higher doses, such as up to 50–60 mg daily, as had been used by some practitioners before the availability of immunotherapies. Clonazepam 0.5–5 mg is as effective and sometimes preferable to diazepam. Alprazolam, lorazepam, and temazepam are also used. Diazepam is especially effective in status spasticus, preferably given IV in severe and long-lasting spasms or in a rectal form. We are in the process of exploring in a pilot trial whether the intranasal diazepam spray (Valtoco) approved for seizure clustersis as beneficial and preferable in these cases because of easy self-administration and better tolerance.

### Clonazepam add-on therapy for refractory epilepsy in adults and children [^1124G94t]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy affects about 50 million people worldwide, nearly a quarter of whom have drug-refractory epilepsy. People with drug-refractory epilepsy have increased risks of premature death, injuries, psychosocial dysfunction, and a reduced quality of life.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of clonazepam when used as an add-on therapy for adults and children with refractory focal onset or generalised onset epileptic seizures, when compared with placebo or another antiepileptic agent.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 14 September 2017: Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE (Ovid 1946 to 14 September 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).

Selection Criteria

Double-blind randomised controlled studies of add-on clonazepam in people with refractory focal or generalised onset seizures, with a minimum treatment period of eight weeks. The studies could be of parallel or cross-over design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted relevant data, and assessed trial quality. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

No double-blind randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from double-blind randomised controlled trials for or against the use of clonazepam as an add-on therapy for adults and children with refractory focal or generalised onset epileptic seizures.

### High-potency benzodiazepines: recent clinical results [^113g5BCM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

As high-potency benzodiazepines, essentially alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam, have been used to treat anxiety disorders for almost 2 decades, most efficacy and safety data appeared several years ago. The release of new formulations of 2 of them, clonazepam and alprazolam, invites review of these broadly effective anxiolytics. Clonazepam has recently become available in a lyophilized wafer that disintegrates when exposed to saliva and enhances ease of administration without altering its pharmacology, as shown by bioequivalence studies. Two U.S. multicenter trials carried out in the 1990s, among others, have provided strong confirmatory evidence for the use of clonazepam in panic disorder. Other recently published data on clonazepam pertain to its use as augmentation therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and in the prevention of recurrences of major depressive disorder. A new, extended-release formulation of alprazolam now allows for once-daily rather than t.i.d. or q.i.d. dosing. With extended release, the blood drug concentrations of alprazolam remain within the therapeutic window for several hours, which should reduce fluctuation in therapeutic effect and curb the clock-watching phenomenon between doses. The literature concerning the use of this new formulation of alprazolam in panic disorder is reviewed.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^114uYnr4]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Secondary REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) due to a medical condition — clonazepam: Recommendation 5 states, "The AASM suggests that clinicians use clonazepam (vs no treatment) for the treatment of secondary RBD due to a medical condition in adults. (CONDITIONAL)", with remarks that "The nature of the patients' medical condition, their age, and their risk for clonazepam-induced sedation and imbalance should be considered in the use and dosing of clonazepam" and "Older patients may be more sensitive to sedating side effects of clonazepam and take longer to metabolize and eliminate the benzodiazepine". The TF identified "1 randomized controlled trial and 38 observational studies" of clonazepam, which "demonstrated clinically significant improvements in RBD symptoms"; certainty was "low due to the risk of bias associated with observational studies", and commonly reported adverse events included "daytime sleepiness, dizziness, and postural instability", while costs were "relatively small compared to the potential high cost of injury due to dream enactment during sleep".

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: an international scoping review [^112cwr2w]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

When BZD are used for anxiety related disorders, there is a clear consensus among most documents to restrict their use to the 'short-term' (often unspecified in terms of duration) but most commonly for less than 4 weeks. Interestingly, alprazolam which has become noticeably more problematic in terms of misuse or harm based on real world data over the past two decades, is still over-represented as a BZD of choice in many guidance documents. This is no doubt attributable to the larger abundance of earlier randomised controlled trial data compared to some other BZDs for conditions such as PD. However, real world evidence of harm via overdose and diversion trends should be considered in framing future recommendations on BZD selection. For instance, some newer documents specifically advise against the use of alprazolam given its rapid onset and shorter-half life; pharmacokinetic properties that increase its potential for withdrawal and misuse. Other major BZD that were prominently represented were diazepam, lorazepam and, especially; clonazepam which has more long-term use data from clinical trials, particularly in PD.

Another area of clear heterogeneity in guidance was in the dosing pattern recommended. Some major guidelines advise regular scheduled dosing of BZD for common anxiety disorders. In contrast, other documents advise 'prn' use or intermittent dosing. How prescriptions are issued and used in real world medical practice can have profound effects on the development of tolerance or dependence for individuals with these conditions and so this is an area where further clarity could be achieved within future guidelines. This is especially important because recent observational research indicates potentially safer outcomes with intermittent compared to chronic dosing.

Guidance for OCD and PTSD were comparatively limited, based on lack of positive evidence of benefit, and no documents clearly advised their use as first line pharmacologic options. Furthermore, the use of BZD in PTSD has been controversial and frequently ill-advised based on their proposed propensity to interfere with fear extinction in exposure therapy as well as potentiate the development of ongoing stress symptomatology in the aftermath of a traumatic event.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113ih89W]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) tapering — dose reduction strategies and pacing specify that clinicians should proactively consider smaller dose reductions and/or slowing the pace of dose reductions as the taper progresses. If patients are unable to tolerate further BZD dose reductions, clinicians can consider maintaining patients on the lower BZD dose with regular risk–benefit assessments consistent with Recommendation 1, and in some limited instances when patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms, returning to the prior BZD dose and pausing the taper until symptoms stabilize may be appropriate. In limited instances when necessary for patient safety, inpatient and medically managed residential settings may use more rapid tapering strategies. Clinical trials evaluating BZD tapering strategies typically used relatively fast schedules (e.g., 25% every 1–2 weeks) with inflexible dose reductions and often had high patient dropout. Recommended BZD dose reductions can target a goal of reducing the BZD by 20% over 4 weeks using options such as reducing the BZD dose by 5% per week, by 10% every other week, by 20% and maintaining at that lower dose for 4 weeks, or reducing the number of pills consumed (for example, for a 5 mg diazepam twice daily prescription, reducing pills from 60 to 48 for 4 weeks). Smaller, consistent dose reductions may be best for patients who are experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms, while providing patients with options can help increase patient buy-in and agency in the tapering process.

### Clonazepam [^11222S7o]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacodynamics:

The precise mechanism by which clonazepam exerts its antiseizure and antipanic effects is unknown, although it is believed to be related to its ability to enhance the activity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.

Pharmacokinetics:

Clonazepam is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of clonazepam is about 90%. Maximum plasma concentrations of clonazepam are reached within 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. Clonazepam is approximately 85% bound to plasma proteins. Clonazepam is highly metabolized, with less than 2% unchanged clonazepam being excreted in the urine. Biotransformation occurs mainly by reduction of the 7-nitro group to the 4-amino derivative. This derivative can be acetylated, hydroxylated and glucuronidated. Cytochrome P-450 including CYP3A, may play an important role in clonazepam reduction and oxidation. The elimination half-life of clonazepam is typically 30 to 40 hours. Clonazepam pharmacokinetics are dose-independent throughout the dosing range. There is no evidence that clonazepam induces its own metabolism or that of other drugs in humans.

Pharmacokinetics in Demographic Subpopulations and in Disease States:

Controlled studies examining the influence of gender and age on clonazepam pharmacokinetics have not been conducted, nor have the effects of renal or liver disease on clonazepam pharmacokinetics been studied. Because clonazepam undergoes hepatic metabolism, it is possible that liver disease will impair clonazepam elimination. Thus, caution should be exercised when administering clonazepam to these patients. (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

In children, clearance values of 0.42 ± 0.32 mL/min/kg (ages 2–18 years) and 0.88 ± 0.4 mL/min/kg (ages 7–12 years) were reported; these values decreased with increasing body weight. Ketogenic diet in children does not affect clonazepam concentrations.

### Benzodiazepine use disorder: common questions and answers [^117UkHzB]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

In the United States, more than 30 million adults have reported taking a benzodiazepine within the past year. Misuse-use of a drug in a way that a doctor did not direct-accounts for 17.2% of all benzodiazepine use. Family physicians face challenges when balancing the patient's perceived benefits of benzodiazepines with known risks and lack of evidence supporting their use. Benzodiazepines cause significant central nervous system-related adverse effects including sedation, confusion, memory loss, depression, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle crashes. Factors that increase the risk of adverse effects and misuse are other substance use disorders, using concomitant central nervous system medications, and central nervous system or pulmonary diseases. Compared with intermittent use, chronic daily use in older adults is associated with a higher risk of falls, fractures, hospitalizations, and death. Withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, sleep disturbances, and agitation are common and often prolonged. Adjunctive treatment with antiepileptics, antidepressants, and pregabalin has been shown to lessen withdrawal symptoms. Deprescribing benzodiazepines for patients who use them chronically should be individualized with slow tapering over weeks to months, or longer, to minimize the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Incorporating behavioral interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy, improves deprescribing outcomes.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^114jvSbF]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — benzodiazepines for agitation or anxiety: Benzodiazepines may have a higher likelihood of side effects and a lower likelihood of benefit than antipsychotics; their long-term use is generally to be avoided and they may be used on an occasional as-needed basis for rare agitation or procedures, with use kept to a minimum and a maximum of 1–3 mg of lorazepam (or equivalent doses of other benzodiazepines) in 24 hours. Oral lorazepam may be given on an as-needed basis in a dosage of 0.5 to 1.0 mg every 4–6 hours, with standard oral doses of 0.5–1.0 mg given from 1 to 2 times per day; oxazepam starting doses of 7.5–15.0 mg may be given 1 to 4 times per day; some clinicians prefer clonazepam starting at 0.5 mg/day with increases up to 2 mg/day. Many clinicians favor oxazepam and lorazepam because they do not require oxidative metabolism in the liver and have no active metabolites. Common adverse effects include sedation, ataxia, amnesia, confusion (even delirium), and possibly paradoxical anxiety, which can worsen cognition and behavior and increase the risk of falls; benzodiazepines also carry a risk of respiratory suppression in patients with sleep-related breathing disorders. Agents with long half-lives and long-lived metabolites can take weeks to reach steady-state levels and generally are not used in this patient population; elderly patients taking long-acting benzodiazepines are more likely to fall and to suffer hip fractures than those taking short-acting agents. If benzodiazepines are prescribed for an extended period (e.g., 1 month), they should be tapered rather than stopped abruptly because of the risk of withdrawal.

### Burning mouth syndrome after taking clonazepam [^116C8pp1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the first published case of clonazepam-induced burning mouth syndrome (BMS).

Case Summary

A 52-year-old white woman presented to the clinic with burning mouth symptoms. The patient was previously maintained on alprazolam therapy for anxiety, but was switched to clonazepam because of increased anxiety and panic. Clonazepam significantly relieved her symptoms, but after four weeks of therapy, she reported a constant, mild, oral burning sensation. An oral examination was negative for mucosal abnormalities, and laboratory tests were unremarkable. The clonazepam dose was reduced, and the symptoms decreased, but remained intolerable. Clonazepam was discontinued, and the burning mouth symptoms completely resolved. Since no other medications relieved the anxiety and panic symptoms, the patient requested clonazepam to be reinitiated, but she again developed intolerable burning mouth symptoms. As clonazepam was discontinued, the symptoms resolved.

Discussion

The clinical presentation of BMS includes burning and painful sensations of the mouth in the absence of mucosal abnormalities. Candidiasis, anemia, menopause, diabetes mellitus, medications, anxiety, and depression are some causes of this syndrome. Paradoxically, clonazepam has been studied for the treatment of BMS and has demonstrated mild to moderate improvement. In this patient, underlying causes of BMS were eliminated when possible. The association between clonazepam and BMS was highly probable according to the Naranjo probability scale.

Conclusions

This is the first published report describing BMS with a benzodiazepine. Although uncommon, clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse effect due to the widespread use of benzodiazepines.

### Pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic benzodiazepine users [^114njksx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines is common practice despite clinical recommendations of short-term use. Benzodiazepines are used by approximately 4% of the general population, with increased prevalence in psychiatric populations and the elderly. After long-term use it is often difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines due to psychological and physiological dependence. This review investigated if pharmacological interventions can facilitate benzodiazepine tapering.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions to facilitate discontinuation of chronic benzodiazepine use.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases up to October 2017: Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Specialised Register of Trials, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and ISI Web of Science. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO ICTRP, and ISRCTN registry, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological treatment versus placebo or no intervention or versus another pharmacological intervention in adults who had been treated with benzodiazepines for at least two months and/or fulfilled criteria for benzodiazepine dependence (any criteria).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 38 trials (involving 2543 participants), but we could only extract data from 35 trials with 2295 participants. Many different interventions were studied, and no single intervention was assessed in more than four trials. We extracted data on 18 different comparisons. The risk of bias was high in all trials but one. Trial Sequential Analysis showed imprecision for all comparisons. For benzodiazepine discontinuation, we found a potential benefit of valproate at end of intervention (1 study, 27 participants; risk ratio (RR) 2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 6.03; very low-quality evidence) and of tricyclic antidepressants at longest follow-up (1 study, 47 participants; RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.82; low-quality evidence). We found potentially positive effects on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms of pregabalin (1 study, 106 participants; mean difference (MD) -3.10 points, 95% CI -3.51 to -2.69; very low-quality evidence), captodiame (1 study, 81 participants; MD -1.00 points, 95% CI -1.13 to -0.87; very low-quality evidence), paroxetine (2 studies, 99 participants; MD -3.57 points, 95% CI -5.34 to -1.80; very low-quality evidence), tricyclic antidepressants (1 study, 38 participants; MD -19.78 points, 95% CI -20.25 to -19.31; very low-quality evidence), and flumazenil (3 studies, 58 participants; standardised mean difference -0.95, 95% CI -1.71 to -0.19; very low-quality evidence) at end of intervention. However, the positive effect of paroxetine on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms did not persist until longest follow-up (1 study, 54 participants; MD -0.13 points, 95% CI -4.03 to 3.77; very low-quality evidence). The following pharmacological interventions reduced symptoms of anxiety at end of intervention: carbamazepine (1 study, 36 participants; MD -6.00 points, 95% CI -9.58 to -2.42; very low-quality evidence), pregabalin (1 study, 106 participants; MD -4.80 points, 95% CI -5.28 to -4.32; very low-quality evidence), captodiame (1 study, 81 participants; MD -5.70 points, 95% CI -6.05 to -5.35; very low-quality evidence), paroxetine (2 studies, 99 participants; MD -6.75 points, 95% CI -9.64 to -3.86; very low-quality evidence), and flumazenil (1 study, 18 participants; MD -1.30 points, 95% CI -2.28 to -0.32; very low-quality evidence). Two pharmacological treatments seemed to reduce the proportion of participants that relapsed to benzodiazepine use: valproate (1 study, 27 participants; RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.90; very low-quality evidence) and cyamemazine (1 study, 124 participants; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.78; very low-quality evidence). Alpidem decreased the proportion of participants with benzodiazepine discontinuation (1 study, 25 participants; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 2.3 participants; low-quality evidence) and increased the occurrence of withdrawal syndrome (1 study, 145 participants; RR 4.86, 95% CI 1.12 to 21.14; NNTH 5.9 participants; low-quality evidence). Likewise, magnesium aspartate decreased the proportion of participants discontinuing benzodiazepines (1 study, 144 participants; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; NNTH 5.8; very low-quality evidence). Generally, adverse events were insufficiently reported. Specifically, one of the flumazenil trials was discontinued due to severe panic reactions.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the low or very low quality of the evidence for the reported outcomes, and the small number of trials identified with a limited number of participants for each comparison, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding pharmacological interventions to facilitate benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic benzodiazepine users. Due to poor reporting, adverse events could not be reliably assessed across trials. More randomised controlled trials are required with less risk of systematic errors ('bias') and of random errors ('play of chance') and better and full reporting of patient-centred and long-term clinical outcomes. Such trials ought to be conducted independently of industry involvement.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^117BBiTo]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — care coordination, consolidation, and assessment advise that prior to initiating a BZD taper, clinicians should attempt to coordinate care with a patient's other BZD prescribers and clinicians managing co-occurring conditions, and clinicians managing the taper should ideally assume management of all of a patient's BZD prescriptions. If patients have been taking different BZDs, clinicians should convert and consolidate the medications to an equivalent dose of a single BZD prior to beginning the taper. A mutually agreed upon tapering rate between patients and clinicians that avoids a very prolonged taper duration can be an effective strategy for BZD discontinuation. Clinicians should consider the likelihood of a given patient developing withdrawal symptoms during the taper and the anticipated severity of those symptoms, noting that BZD withdrawal symptoms can range from anxiety and sleep problems to seizures and delirium.

Substance use disorder (SUD) and unregulated benzodiazepine exposure management indicates that some patients with SUD may report nonmedical use of prescribed BZDs or use of nonprescribed BZDs, making daily dose determination difficult; the CGC recommends that clinicians refer these patients for assessment of potential SUD, and unless contraindicated, these patients should typically be transitioned to a long-acting agent due to the uncertainty regarding the strength of the BZDs they are taking.

### A critical review of the pharmacological treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder in adults: time for more and larger randomized placebo-controlled trials [^117WtDvJ]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Although patients may not be aware of mild symptoms, treating RBD can often be necessary as it can cause frequent and sometimes life-threatening injuries to patients and their bed partners. The current guidelines for RBD treatment include counseling, modification of the bedroom environment to reduce the risk of injury and two main pharmacological agents, namely clonazepam and melatonin. Such information is also presented to patients via reputable online sources, such as sleepfoundation.org and websites of specialized sleep clinics.

Clonazepam has been the recommended treatment since the first clinical description of RBD by Schenck and colleagues back in 1986. Indeed, subsequent case series and open-label studies have reported a clinical efficacy rate of up to 90%. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine, which enhances inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity in the central nervous system leading to anticonvulsant, anxiolytic and skeletal muscle relaxation effects. It has been suggested that clonazepam may be efficacious by suppressing phasic bursts of muscle activity during REM sleep. However, the true mechanisms of action of clonazepam for reducing RBD remain unknown. Significantly, clonazepam is a long acting benzodiazepine with a half-life of 30–40 h that should be used with caution, especially in older adults, as it can lead to dependence along with frequent and sometimes serious side effects, including confusion, morning sedation, cognitive impairment and falls. Clonazepam may also induce or possibly worsen obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) symptoms. It is, therefore, critical to systematically assess whether the existing evidence supports the use of clonazepam to treat RBD, especially in the older population who are known to have the highest prevalence of RBD and in whom the adverse outcomes, such as falls, may be most impactful, particularly in patients with a neurodegenerative disorder such as PD or DLB.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^113epmi2]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Sedative withdrawal — symptom development, indicators, and monitoring — short-acting benzodiazepines (alprazolam, lorazepam) typically present in the First 24 hours after cessation of use, whereas long-acting agents (clonazepam, diazepam) present 24–48 hours after cessation of use; possible indicators include abdominal cramping, nausea, and vomiting; anxiety; circulatory failure; delirium (including disorientation and hallucinations); hyperthermia and sweating; increased heart rate and blood pressure; insomnia; occasional psychotic thoughts; restlessness; seizures; tremors; and unease, and because some indicators may be misattributed to other causes there is an importance of referring any individual who appears unwell for immediate clinical assessment; recommendation SH-3 states that individuals who self-report risk for sedative withdrawal and those who report sedative use below the threshold specified in SH-1 (daily or near daily and within past 7 days) should be monitored at least every 6 hours for at least the first week for emergence of withdrawal signs and symptoms, and SH-4 notes there is no single benzodiazepine withdrawal scale that has been well validated and replicated and that if signs or symptoms emerge or a layperson observes the individual begin to appear unwell, they should be referred for immediate clinical assessment.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111HaPj4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal risk by dose, duration, and frequency (Table 3) — clinical consensus estimates indicate that with any duration and ≤ 3 days per week the risk is no; with < 1 month and ≥ 4 days per week the risk is lower risk, but possible; with 1–3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at low total daily dose the risk is lower risk, but possible, whereas at moderate to high dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration; with ≥ 3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at any dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration. A low daily dose is estimated as 10 mg diazepam equivalents or less (e.g., ≤ 0.5 mg clonazepam, ≤ 2 mg lorazepam, ≤ 1 mg alprazolam), a moderate daily dose is estimated as 10–15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., 0.5–1.5 mg clonazepam, 2–3 mg lorazepam, 1–2 mg alprazolam), and a high daily dose is estimated as more than 15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., > 1.5 mg clonazepam, > 3 mg lorazepam, > 2 mg alprazolam).

### Combined paroxetine and clonazepam treatment strategies compared to paroxetine monotherapy for panic disorder [^114cBvZa]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2003). Low credibility.

Despite the widespread application of combined selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and benzodiazepine treatment for panic disorder, there has been relatively little systematic assessment of the safety and efficacy of this therapeutic strategy. Although the limited number of studies to date suggest a more rapid onset of benefit with combined treatment, this study is the first to address the critical question of whether continued combined treatment confers superior efficacy. This study is a randomized, double-blind, three-arm study in patients with panic disorder (n = 60), comparing the efficacy and safety of paroxetine and placebo (PP), paroxetine coadministered with clonazepam followed by a tapered benzodiazepine discontinuation phase (PC-D), and ongoing combination treatment (PC-M). All treatment groups demonstrated significant improvement by endpoint. There was a significant advantage for the combined treatment groups early in treatment but, subsequently, outcome in all three groups was similar. A trend towards greater achievement of endpoint remission status for the PC-D group was attenuated when variability in baseline severity was considered. The results of this study should be interpreted in the context of a relatively moderate sample size and higher rates of early dropout. Combined treatment with paroxetine and clonazepam resulted in more rapid response than with the SSRI alone, but there was no differential benefit beyond the initial few weeks of therapy. Initiating combined treatment followed by benzodiazepine taper after a few weeks may provide early benefit while avoiding the potential adverse consequences of long-term combination therapy.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1163PgG2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

There is significant heterogeneity in patient response to BZD tapering. In the CGC's experience, some patients who have been taking moderate BZD doses for months experience minimal challenges when tapering at a rate of 10 to 25% every 4 weeks. Other patients — even some who have been taking low BZD doses for a relatively short time (e.g. weeks) — may experience significant withdrawal symptoms, even when tapering at a slower rate. Clinical trials evaluating BZD tapering strategies, which typically have relatively fast (e.g. 25% every 1–2 weeks) and inflexible dose reduction schedules, often have high patient dropout. – While no direct evidence was found comparing various tapering strategies, the CGC considered results of these studies, existing guidance, and their own experience in recommending these tapering strategies.

Recommended BZD dose reductions can be achieved in many ways. For example, a goal of reducing the BZD by 20% over 4 weeks could be achieved by any of the following or a combination of the following strategies:
Reducing the BZD dose by 5% per week
Reducing the BZD dose by 10% every other week
Reducing the BZD dose by 20% and maintaining at that lower dose for 4 weeks
Reducing the number of pills consumed — as an example, clinicians could reduce the number of pills for a 5 mg diazepam twice daily prescription from 60 to 48 for 4 weeks, and patients can decide which pills to skip and when

Smaller, consistent dose reductions may be best for patients who are experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms. However, providing patients with options can help increase patient buy-in and agency in the tapering process.

### Clonazepam [^114MUp5P]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tolerance

Tolerance to clonazepam may develop from continued therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance to the therapeutic effect of clonazepam may develop; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.

Following the short-term treatment of patients with panic disorder in Studies 1 and 2 (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials), patients were gradually withdrawn during a 7-week downward-titration (discontinuance) period. Overall, the discontinuance period was associated with good tolerability and a very modest clinical deterioration, without evidence of a significant rebound phenomenon. However, there are not sufficient data from adequate and well-controlled long-term clonazepam studies in patients with panic disorder to accurately estimate the risks of withdrawal symptoms and dependence that may be associated with such use.

### A critical review of the pharmacological treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder in adults: time for more and larger randomized placebo-controlled trials [^116KH1y3]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the widespread use of both clonazepam and melatonin for treating RBD, until recently there was a lack of good quality trial data. Current international guidelines are still based on evidence from mainly small case-series and open-label studies, which are at high risk of bias and have demonstrated inconsistencies in the clinical effectiveness levels reported. In fact, many patients with RBD were considered refractory to these first-line treatment options, which led clinicians to trial a multitude of other pharmacological agents off-label. Past reviews have not consistently accounted for such reports when calculating the number of responders for these commonly prescribed treatments, or were conducted more than 10 years ago. Thus, there is a need to re-assess whether the existing evidence supports the current recommended guidelines for the pharmacological management of RBD.

The purpose of this update is to provide a semi-systematic overview of all clinical and scientific evidence published to date on the pharmacological management of RBD. We focus on the middle- to older (50 years and above) adult population, which has the highest prevalence of RBD as well as being at the greatest risk for adverse outcomes. Doing so, we set out to provide an update on the total number of adults with isolated or secondary RBD who were clinically followed to assess the efficacy of any pharmacological compound given to treat their RBD symptoms. We also assessed the level of evidence based on the study design, as depicted in Box 1. This review specifically investigates the divide between clinical expectancy and the actual evidence for the effectiveness of the common drugs being recommended for managing RBD. We also seek to provide future directions on how this field could move to a more rigorous evidence-base.

Background — benzodiazepines (BZDs) are FDA‑approved for conditions such as anxiety and panic disorders, social phobia, insomnia, and seizures but are associated with increased risks including falls, motor vehicle accidents, cognitive impairment, delirium, overdose, and death, particularly with concurrent central nervous system depressants like alcohol or opioids; physical dependence is expected and abrupt discontinuation can cause serious and potentially life‑threatening withdrawal symptoms, and the risk–benefit balance of prescribing may shift as patients and co‑medications change, while clinicians in palliative and end‑of‑life care are not the intended audience for this guideline.

### Clonazepam add-on therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy [^114e8oEi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2018, Issue 5. Epilepsy affects over 70 million people worldwide, and nearly a quarter of patients with seizures have drug-resistant epilepsy. People with drug-resistant epilepsy have increased risks of premature death, injuries, psychosocial dysfunction, and a reduced quality of life.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of clonazepam when used as an add-on therapy for adults and children with drug-resistant focal onset or generalised onset epileptic seizures, when compared with placebo or another antiepileptic agent.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the following databases on 4 June 2019: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), MEDLINE (Ovid) 1946 to 3 June, 2019. The Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and randomised or quasi-randomised, controlled trials from Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).

Selection Criteria

Double-blind randomised controlled studies of add-on clonazepam in people with resistant focal or generalised onset seizures, with a minimum treatment period of eight weeks. The studies could be of parallel or cross-over design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted relevant data, and assessed trial quality. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

We found no double-blind randomised controlled trials which met the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from double-blind randomised controlled trials for or against the use of clonazepam as an add-on therapy for adults and children with drug-resistant focal or generalised onset epileptic seizures. Since the last version of this review no new studies have been found.

PK assessment

Online supplemental table S3 shows the administered clonazepam dosages per subject. Figure 2B shows the individual clonazepam concentrations in saliva. After the first day of dosing, the drug's mean (SD) concentration was 0.17 ng/mL and 0.18 ng/mL (0.09) at 4.5 and 5 hours post-dose, respectively. On day 22, the mean (SD) concentration of the last dose was 1.11 ng/mL (0.52) and 1.10 ng/mL (0.41) at 4.5 and 5 hours post-dose, respectively. The accumulation ratio observed for the patients was approximately 6.1–6.5, indicating significant drug accumulation over time.

Titration adjustments of clonazepam

During the study, dosage adjustments necessitated by side effects were made for five out of 15 patients while taking clonazepam. These adjustments, consistently involving a halving of the dose, were executed on day 6, 7 or 8. In three patients, the dose was not increased to the prior dosing at the parents' request on day 11. No dosage modifications were required for patients while they were on the placebo.

Benzodiazepine tapering — post-discontinuation follow-up states that a patient's adjustment to benzodiazepine discontinuation and need for clinician support may last well beyond the time it takes for the drug to be eliminated; although gradual dose reductions and slow tapers may help prevent protracted withdrawal, clinicians should follow up after discontinuation to monitor for and manage symptoms; patients with long-term use may struggle to avoid returning to use and may benefit from ongoing monitoring; clinicians should educate patients with protracted withdrawal symptoms and reassure them that symptoms are likely to resolve as their brains adjust, which may take months; psychosocial support may be helpful; clinicians should avoid reinstating the benzodiazepine but can consider prescribing non-benzodiazepine medications for symptom management when patients are unable to tolerate withdrawal management.

### Administration of the combination clonazepam-deanxit as treatment for tinnitus [^113KE2Pa]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

Present study investigates the combination of Deanxit and clonazepam (Rivotril) intake for relief of tinnitus complaints, respecting a double-blind placebo-controlled approach for Deanxit in a crossover setup.

Background

Although several pharmacologic treatments — including antidepressants, prostaglandins, and aminobutyric acid (GABA)-active drugs — were already presented as promising in tinnitus treatment, no drug has yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicine Agency for the treatment of tinnitus.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to patient group A or patient group B in a double-blind way. Patient group A first received 3 weeks of Deanxit, followed by 1 week of washout and 3 weeks of placebo. Treatment was given in opposite order to subjects from Patient group B. All patients received a daily treatment consisting of clonazepam 1 mg once daily, starting on Day 1.

Results

Significant tinnitus reduction was seen after intake of the combination clonazepam-Deanxit, whereas no differences in tinnitus could be demonstrated after the administration of clonazepam-placebo. This was true for all patients according to the following parameters: time patients are annoyed by the tinnitus (p = 0.026) and the visual analogue scale for tinnitus annoyance (p = 0.024).

Conclusion

Although tinnitus reduction was recorded as modest, this article provides valuable data demonstrating a placebo-controlled tinnitus reduction after clonazepam and Deanxit intake.

### Clonazepam [^113zvo5E]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Panic Disorder:

Adults:

The initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg twice daily. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days. The recommended dose of 1 mg/day is based on the results from a fixed dose study in which the optimal effect was seen at 1 mg/day. Higher doses of 2, 3 and 4 mg/day in that study were less effective than the 1 mg/day dose and were associated with more adverse effects. Nevertheless, it is possible that some individual patients may benefit from doses of up to a maximum dose of 4 mg/day, and in those instances, the dose may be increased in increments of 0.125 to 0.25 mg twice daily every 3 days until panic disorder is controlled or until side effects make further increases undesired. To reduce the inconvenience of somnolence, administration of one dose at bedtime may be desirable.

Treatment should be discontinued gradually, with a decrease of 0.125 mg twice daily every 3 days, until the drug is completely withdrawn.

There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with clonazepam should remain on it. Therefore, the physician who elects to use clonazepam for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

Pediatric Patients:

There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam in panic disorder patients under 18 years of age.

Geriatric Patients:

There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam in panic disorder patients 65 years of age and older. In general, elderly patients should be started on low doses of clonazepam and observed closely (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Clonazepam:

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, increased seizure frequency, and status epilepticus, use a gradual taper to discontinue clonazepam or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence).

Benzodiazepines in OCD — evidence for monotherapy benefit is limited to case reports, controlled data are inconsistent or negative, and modest doses may relieve anxiety without reducing obsessions/compulsions; among those with substance abuse histories they should be prescribed cautiously, and benzodiazepines cannot be recommended as monotherapy for OCD except in rare individuals unable or unwilling to take standard anti-OCD medication. Evidence for beneficial effects of benzodiazepines as monotherapy for OCD is primarily limited to case reports with clonazepam and alprazolam, and for clonazepam negative results from controlled trials cast doubt on earlier positive findings; case reports note an onset within 1–3 weeks.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113vUkGX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — schedule options and feasibility indicate that evaluated tapering schedules vary from a faster pace of reductions of 10 to 25% every 1–2 weeks to a slower pace of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, and guidelines that outline specific tapering protocols generally recommend limiting dose reductions to no more than 25% every 2 weeks. Clinical trial experience notes that 25% weekly dose reductions was too fast for about half of the participants. When patients are taking the lowest available dose for a given benzodiazepine (BZD), reducing the dose by 5% or 10% can be challenging, and although some tablets can be accurately cut in half or even quarters with a pill splitter, smaller dose reductions are more difficult to achieve. Clinicians should take each patient's risk–benefit balance into account when developing tapering strategies and should also consider patients' underlying conditions or symptoms for which BZDs are being used to manage when developing tapering strategies; for example, if BZDs have been used to manage anxiety with insomnia, clinicians can recommend tapering the morning dose first.

### Comparative safety of chronic versus intermittent benzodiazepine prescribing in older adults: a population-based cohort study [^112LatpB]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Benzodiazepines (neuroscience-based nomenclature (NbN): positive allosteric modulators (GABA-A receptor, benzodiazepine site)) are a treatment for anxiety disorders and insomnia but are no longer considered the first-line treatment for either indication. However, benzodiazepine use remains widespread, especially in older adults. In recent data from Ontario, the prevalence of benzodiazepine use in community-dwelling older adults was 11%, with 60% using low doses (50% or less than the World Health Organization defined daily dose (DDD)), 25% using moderate doses (51–100% of the DDD) and 15% using high doses (greater than the DDD).

Regular benzodiazepine use over prolonged periods is controversial due to concerns of tolerance (leading to progressive elevation of dose), dependence, risk of difficult withdrawal and other adverse events. While older adults are susceptible to anxiety disorders and sleep problems, the potential for adverse consequences associated with the use of benzodiazepines appears to be greater than in younger people, particularly in terms of increased risk of falls, fractures, cognitive impairment and mortality. Older adults are more likely to adopt a chronic pattern of use, with one Canadian study reporting a mean duration of use of 75.5 days in new benzodiazepine users aged > 66 years. Other studies have suggested that the duration of use may be even longer, especially in older adults with comorbid dementia where a mean duration of 2 years has been reported.

The issues of whether benzodiazepines should be prescribed to older adults and if so whether treatment should be restricted to a maximum duration have been addressed by numerous national and international guidelines and position statements. However, the controversy is unresolved, and the guidelines have adopted contrasting positions. Some guidelines take the view that benzodiazepines should be avoided entirely in older adults. A second group, comprising both guidelines for adults and those specific to older adults, states that short-term benzodiazepine use may be acceptable for some indications. 'Short-term use' is often not defined but at least one guideline suggests a maximum duration of around 4 weeks. A further group of guidelines acknowledge that time-limited use is preferable, but allow for long-term use in circumstances where the benefits outweigh the risks.

### Clonazepam (Klonopin) [^115aNnxW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Tolerance

Tolerance to Klonopin may develop from continued therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance to the therapeutic effect of Klonopin may develop; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.

Following the short-term treatment of patients with panic disorder in Studies 1 and 2 (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials), patients were gradually withdrawn during a 7-week downward-titration (discontinuance) period. Overall, the discontinuance period was associated with good tolerability and a very modest clinical deterioration, without evidence of a significant rebound phenomenon. However, there are not sufficient data from adequate and well-controlled long-term clonazepam studies in patients with panic disorder to accurately estimate the risks of withdrawal symptoms and dependence that may be associated with such use.
