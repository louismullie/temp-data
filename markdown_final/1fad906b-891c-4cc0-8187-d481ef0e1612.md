## Question

Can you take Cipro with kidney failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ciprofloxacin (Cipro) can be used in kidney failure, and if so, how to dose it safely and effectively across different levels of renal impairment and dialysis modalities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and how renal impairment alters clearance. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled dosing recommendations by creatinine clearance or eGFR and by dialysis type. Next, I will review major safety concerns in advanced CKD, including tendon injury, neuropsychiatric effects, and crystalluria. After that, I should consider special populations such as the elderly, critically ill patients with augmented renal clearance, and pediatrics. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check any conflicting sources along the way.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic foundation. Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily via renal excretion, but there is meaningful nonrenal clearance through biliary and intestinal routes that partially compensates when renal function declines, which explains why dose reductions are not always linear with eGFR and why some patients with moderate impairment may not require adjustment in certain oral regimens [^116fYr4e] [^116LkSDf]. Wait, I should verify the oral bioavailability and half-life to anchor dosing conversions; oral bioavailability is about 70% and the elimination half-life is roughly 4 hours in normal renal function, which supports standard IV-to-PO conversion ratios used in practice [^111LGEQe].

> Next, I should review labeled dosing by renal function. For eGFR greater than 50 mL/min/1.73 m², no dose adjustment is required for oral therapy, and standard adult dosing such as 500–750 mg every 12 hours is acceptable, with IV 400 mg every 8–12 hours as labeled options depending on indication and severity [^114jmCM8] [^11335bRZ]. For eGFR 30–50, oral dosing is typically capped at 250–500 mg every 12 hours and IV at 400 mg every 12 hours, which aligns with both FDA and IDSA guidance for complicated infections [^1156taHE] [^116hiZKd]. For eGFR 5–29, I need to ensure frequency is reduced; oral dosing should be 250–500 mg every 18–24 hours and IV 200–400 mg every 18–24 hours, reflecting prolonged half-life and reduced clearance [^116hiZKd] [^115tTjVS]. For eGFR less than 10, dose reductions of about 50% are reasonable, with some labeling allowing full dose for short courses in exceptional circumstances, though I should caution that this latter approach is high risk and should be reserved for compelling indications with close monitoring [^115ECLKX].

> I will now examine dialysis scenarios. For intermittent hemodialysis, oral ciprofloxacin 250–500 mg once daily given after dialysis is recommended, and IV 200–400 mg once daily after dialysis is commonly used, acknowledging that only a small fraction of drug is removed by dialysis and thus timing after dialysis helps maintain exposure while minimizing accumulation [^116H64Ej] [^115ABCUt] [^117VsQAu]. For peritoneal dialysis, oral 250–500 mg once daily is reasonable, with IV 200–400 mg once daily as an alternative, again recognizing limited dialytic removal and the need to monitor for accumulation and adverse effects [^114go8FE] [^115ABCUt]. For continuous renal replacement therapy, I should double-check clearance estimates; CRRT can meaningfully clear ciprofloxacin, and some data suggest 200 mg every 8–12 hours may be needed to maintain therapeutic levels, though institutional protocols vary and dose reduction to 200–400 mg every 12–24 hours is also used, so I need to tailor to CRRT intensity and clinical response [^111n6jfM] [^1136qo4b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety in advanced CKD. I need to ensure we weigh the boxed warnings and class-specific risks. Fluoroquinolones carry risks of disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions, including tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and CNS effects; these risks are amplified in older adults, those on corticosteroids, and patients with renal impairment, so I should reserve ciprofloxacin for situations where benefits clearly outweigh risks and counsel patients to stop immediately if tendon pain or neuropsychiatric symptoms occur [^115Sqanz] [^117KRUA6]. But wait, what about crystalluria and direct nephrotoxicity? Adequate hydration is essential to prevent crystal formation, and although crystalluria is uncommon at therapeutic doses, case reports document ciprofloxacin crystal nephropathy, so maintaining high urine flow and avoiding highly alkaline urine is prudent in CKD patients [^111BoiPv] [^1154jcSC]. I should also remember that higher-dose fluoroquinolones in advanced CKD are associated with increased 14-day risks of nervous system or psychiatric events, hypoglycemia, and collagen-associated events, reinforcing the need to use the lowest effective dose and avoid supratherapeutic regimens in this population [^115YqALZ] [^1125UbAL].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In the elderly, reduced renal clearance increases exposure and the risk of tendon injury and QT prolongation, so I should start conservatively and monitor closely, especially if interacting QT-prolonging drugs are present or if hypokalemia is uncorrected [^114evAVC] [^116LkSDf]. In critically ill patients, augmented renal clearance can paradoxically necessitate higher ciprofloxacin doses to achieve PK/PD targets, with some algorithms suggesting up to 600 mg four times daily for high MIC pathogens, but this must be balanced against toxicity and is best guided by PK/PD targets and, when available, therapeutic drug monitoring in the ICU setting [^114EcmQz] [^114hGC23]. For pediatrics, standard adult renal-adjustment principles do not directly translate; pediatric PK and dosing are weight-based and often higher per kilogram, and renal impairment adjustments should follow pediatric-specific guidance and available PK data rather than adult eGFR tables [^113Tu3JU] [^115c7UQf].

> I should double-check practical administration issues that can inadvertently alter exposure. Ciprofloxacin absorption is reduced by concomitant multivalent cation products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, iron, zinc, and calcium-rich dairy or fortified juices; these should be separated by at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after dosing to avoid chelation and subtherapeutic levels, which is especially important when I am already reducing dose for renal impairment [^111BoiPv] [^117ELxU6]. Let me verify hydration counseling as well; encouraging liberal fluid intake helps prevent crystalluria and supports safe use in CKD when dosing is conservative and monitoring is in place [^111BoiPv].

> Next, I should review guideline-concordant options for common infections in CKD where ciprofloxacin might be considered. For complicated UTI or pyelonephritis, ciprofloxacin remains a recommended option when susceptibility is favorable, with IDSA endorsing 500–750 mg orally every 12 hours or 400 mg IV every 8–12 hours in patients with normal renal function, and dose-reduced regimens as above for eGFR below 30 mL/min or on dialysis, with attention to local resistance patterns and patient-specific risks [^117GrFR3] [^11335bRZ]. For ESBL-producing Enterobacterales causing cUTI or pyelonephritis, ciprofloxacin is a preferred oral agent if susceptible, with carbapenems reserved when resistance or intolerance precludes fluoroquinolones, again applying renal-adjusted dosing as indicated [^114SRmeB].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and actionable. Yes, ciprofloxacin can be used in kidney failure, but dose and frequency must be adjusted based on eGFR or creatinine clearance and dialysis modality, with heightened vigilance for serious adverse effects in advanced CKD. For eGFR 30–50, use standard or modestly reduced oral or IV dosing; for eGFR 5–29, reduce dose and extend the interval; for eGFR less than 10, reduce dose by about 50% and consider avoiding altogether unless the indication is compelling; for hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, dose after dialysis and use once-daily regimens; for CRRT, consider 200–400 mg every 12–24 hours depending on effluent and clinical response, recognizing that some patients may require higher dosing to achieve targets. Throughout, prioritize the lowest effective dose, separate interacting cations, maintain hydration, and monitor for tendon pain, neuropsychiatric changes, hypoglycemia, and QT effects, especially in older adults or those with additional risk factors [^113Tu3JU] [^116H64Ej] [^111n6jfM] [^1136qo4b] [^115Sqanz] [^111BoiPv].

Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) can be used in patients with kidney failure, but **dose adjustments are required** based on the degree of renal impairment and dialysis status [^113Tu3JU]. For eGFR 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m², use 250–500 mg PO every 12 hours or 400 mg IV every 12 hours; for eGFR 5–29 mL/min/1.73 m², use 250–500 mg PO every 18–24 hours or 400 mg IV every 24 hours; for hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, give 250–500 mg PO or 200–400 mg IV after dialysis [^1156taHE] [^116hiZKd] [^115ABCUt]. Monitor for **increased adverse effects** — especially CNS and tendon complications — and ensure adequate hydration to reduce crystalluria risk [^115Sqanz] [^111BoiPv].

## Pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in renal impairment

Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, with partial non-renal clearance via biliary and intestinal routes [^116fYr4e]. In renal impairment, reduced clearance increases exposure and half-life, necessitating **dose adjustments** to prevent accumulation and toxicity [^1131Cu6y].

---

## Recommended dose adjustments based on renal function

| **Renal function (eGFR)** | **Oral dosing** | **IV dosing** |
|-|-|-|
| ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m² | 500–750 mg every 12 hours | 400 mg every 8–12 hours |
| 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m² | 250–500 mg every 12 hours | 400 mg every 12 hours |
| 5–29 mL/min/1.73 m² | 250–500 mg every 18–24 hours | 400 mg every 24 hours |
| Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis | 250–500 mg after dialysis | 200–400 mg after dialysis |

---

These adjustments align with FDA labeling and IDSA guidance for complicated UTIs and pyelonephritis in patients with renal impairment [^113Tu3JU] [^114SRmeB].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

### Increased risk of adverse effects

Patients with renal impairment have a higher risk of **serious adverse effects**, including:

- **CNS effects**: seizures, confusion, and psychosis [^115Sqanz].
- **Tendon disorders**: tendinitis and tendon rupture, especially in older adults and those on corticosteroids [^117KRUA6].
- **Crystalluria**: risk increases with dehydration or high doses; maintain adequate hydration [^111BoiPv].

---

### Monitoring and patient counseling

- **Monitor renal function**: regularly assess and adjust dosing as needed [^113Tu3JU].
- **Hydration**: ensure adequate fluid intake to prevent crystalluria [^111BoiPv].
- **Patient education**: instruct patients to report tendon pain, CNS symptoms, or signs of crystalluria promptly [^115Sqanz].

---

## Alternative antibiotics

When ciprofloxacin is contraindicated or poorly tolerated, consider alternatives such as beta-lactams (e.g. ceftriaxone, cefepime) or carbapenems, selected based on infection type, severity, and susceptibilities [^114SRmeB].

---

Ciprofloxacin can be used in patients with kidney failure when **dose adjustments are applied** and monitoring is in place. Use the lowest effective dose, adjust for renal function and dialysis, and monitor closely for adverse effects.

10 OVERDOSAGE

In the event of acute overdosage, reversible renal toxicity has been reported in some cases. Observe the patient carefully and give supportive treatment, including monitoring of renal function, urinary pH and acidify, if required, to prevent crystalluria. Adequate hydration must be maintained. Only a small amount of ciprofloxacin (less than 10%) is removed from the body after hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

In mice, rats, rabbits and dogs, significant toxicity including tonic/clonic convulsions was observed at intravenous doses of ciprofloxacin between 125 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg.

### Association of higher-dose fluoroquinolone therapy with serious adverse events in older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^115YqALZ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

To inform safe fluoroquinolone prescribing in patients with advanced CKD, we conducted a population-based study of older adults with an eGFR of less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (excluding those receiving dialysis) and examined the risk of serious adverse events in patients who were treated with a fluoroquinolone at a higher vs a lower dose. We defined a higher-dose fluoroquinolone as ciprofloxacin, 501 to 1000 mg/d; levofloxacin, 501 to 750 mg/d; or norfloxacin, 401 to 800 mg/d. We defined a lower-dose fluoroquinolone as ciprofloxacin, 500 mg/d; levofloxacin, 250 to 500 mg/d; or norfloxacin, 400 mg/d. The primary outcome was the 14-day risk of a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or collagen-associated events.

### Higher dosage of ciprofloxacin necessary in critically ill patients: a new dosing algorithm based on renal function and pathogen susceptibility [^116o1khx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

We included 39 patients with a total of 531 samples of ciprofloxacin; 21 males and 18 females with a median age of 68 (range 30–87) years. In this pharmacokinetic study, the majority of the patients (28/39) were treated with ciprofloxacin for pneumonia. The ciprofloxacin doses administered were 200 mg twice daily (n = 3), 400 mg twice daily (n = 34), or 400 mg three times daily (n = 2). The median eGFR by MDRD was 78 (range 23–208) mL/min. The median AUC 0‐24h was 30.4 (range 14.5–103.5) mg*h/L. A two‐compartment linear model with MDRD as covariate on clearance provided the best fit.

Figure 1 shows the PTAs of AUC/MIC > 125 for ciprofloxacin plotted against MDRD. The four different panels show the PTAs with different MICs (0.064–0.5 mg/L). All patients with an eGFR < 130 mL/min reached target attainment with a dose of 400 mg twice daily provided that the MIC of the pathogen was ≤ 0.125 mg/L. For patients with augmented renal clearance (eGFR > 130 mL/min) and infections caused by less susceptible pathogens, higher dosages than the maximum licensed dose of 1,200 mg daily were estimated to be necessary to obtain target attainment.

The dotted horizontal line indicates a probability of target attainment of 90%. MDRD, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; q.8h. every 8 hours; q.12h. every 12 hours; q.24h. every 24 hours. [Colour figure can be viewed at]

Figure 2 shows the new dosing algorithm of ciprofloxacin. Our simulated upper safety limit of ciprofloxacin exposure is an AUC 0‐24h of 100 mg*h/L. For infections caused by pathogens with an MIC < 0.5 mg/L, successful dosing regimens could be defined for the whole range of MDRDs. The dosing regimens needed to treat infections caused by pathogens with an MIC of 0.5 mg/L resulted in an AUC 0‐24h above our defined safe upper limit and are therefore not shown in the figure.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Ciprofloxacin — renal insufficiency dosing: Usual dose is 500–750 mg PO every 12 hours or 400 mg IV every 8–12 hours. For creatinine clearance (CrCl) 30–50, give 500–750 mg PO every 12 hours or 400 mg IV every 12 hours. For CrCl < 30, give 250–500 mg PO every 24 hours or 400 mg IV every 24 hours. For hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD), give 250–500 mg PO every 24 hours or 200–400 mg IV every 24 hours and administer after HD or PD on day of dialysis.

### Higher dosage of ciprofloxacin necessary in critically ill patients: a new dosing algorithm based on renal function and pathogen susceptibility [^111JCxVF]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Body weight was also found to be a fundamental covariate on ciprofloxacin clearance. Yet, renal function is the main driver for clearance, and thus, systemic exposure. Body weight is already accounted for in the equation of MDRD, which is included as covariate on renal clearance. The nonrenal clearance of ciprofloxacin only accounts for a small part of the ciprofloxacin clearance. Therefore, we suggest that ciprofloxacin dosing should only be adjusted to eGFR and not on body weight.

To achieve adequate target attainment the dosing of ciprofloxacin should be based on renal function and the susceptibility of the causative pathogen. In the situation of empirical treatment, the pathogen susceptibility is unknown and should be derived from epidemiological data. For our simulation, the highest MIC was 0.5 mg/L, which is the epidemiological cutoff value for P. aeruginosa. 7 To reach target attainment in this situation, predicted dosages up to 2,400 mg daily are required even for patients with normal renal function. These dosages are far higher than the licensed dosage of 1,200 mg daily. If more knowledge is gained about the safety and tolerability of higher ciprofloxacin doses, infections caused by pathogens with MIC ≥ 0.5 mg/L might be treatable as well. This encourages further investigations of efficacy and safety of high dose ciprofloxacin. Likewise, reducing the daily dose to 400 mg in case of renal impairment, as is currently recommended, 1 will not result in a desired PTA of > 90% for less susceptible pathogens. In the provided simulations, the MIC is used as denominator. When deploying an MIC‐based dosing strategy, assay variation of the susceptibility testing should be taken into account. 10

### Anaphylactoid reaction considered ciprofloxacin related: a case report and literature review [^115HzUfP]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although ciprofloxacin is a generally well-tolerated fluoroquinolone antibiotic, serious and life-threatening adverse events such as anaphylaxis and pulmonary edema have been described with its use. However, there is a lack of data in the scientific literature regarding these events.

Objectives

This report describes a case of an anaphylactoid reaction, considered probably ciprofloxacin related, that manifested as angioedema and later as pulmonary edema. This report also summarizes the available scientific evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and outcome of ciprofloxacin-associated anaphylactoid reactions.

Methods

Previously reported cases were identified using a search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (years: 1960-June 2009; English-language articles; search terms: ciprofloxacin, anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis, angioedema, and pulmonary edema). The references cited in these articles were examined to identify additional reports. CASE SUMMARY/RESULTS: A 25-year-old healthy white woman with a weight of 65 kg and normal renal function presented with pyelonephritis. She was administered ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID PO and ibuprofen 400 mg q6h PO as needed for pain control. The following day, angioedema and pulmonary edema developed and were thought to be probably associated with ciprofloxacin use (Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale score, 6). Ciprofloxacin treatment was discontinued and supportive care with ceftriaxone 1 g/d IV was provided, and the patient recovered after 1 week of hospitalization. The adverse drug reactions associated with the intake of fluoroquinolones most commonly affect the gastrointestinal system, central nervous system, and skin. The literature search identified 64 cases of anaphylactoid reaction considered probably ciprofloxacin related. Forty-two of these cases were described in large studies, with no detailed data reported. Detailed information on the dose of ciprofloxacin, the time period between ciprofloxacin administration and anaphylactoid reaction, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of these reactions was available in 22 cases described in case reports. Twelve of these cases were described in HIV- patients; 10 cases were described in HIV+ patients. All of the patients recovered, with the exception of 2 patients with HIV infection, who died (unknown cause of death in 1 case and toxoplasma encephalitis in the other case). Fourteen patients (including all of the patients with HIV infection) required hospitalization in the intensive care unit. According to the manufacturer of ciprofloxacin, pulmonary edema has been described as an adverse event associated with ciprofloxacin in < 1% of treated patients. However, a search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases did not identify any documented reports of ciprofloxacin-associated pulmonary edema.

Conclusions

The patient described in this case report experienced an anaphylactoid reaction likely associated with ciprofloxacin use. Although anaphylactoid/ anaphylactic reactions are uncommon (< 5% of cases) adverse events associated with ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones, clinicians should be aware of this potentially life-threatening event, which might also lead to pulmonary edema even in the setting of normal renal function.

Results

Patients

The flow diagram for the cohort build is presented in eFigure 1 in the Supplement. We studied 11 917 older adults with an eGFR of less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (median age, 83 years [IQR, 77–89 years]; 7438 women [62.4%] and 4479 men [37.6%] as self-reported in the Registered Persons Database; median eGFR, 25 [IQR, 21–28] mL/min/1.73 m 2 ;926 [7.7%] had an eGFR of < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m 2) who were newly dispensed a fluoroquinolone at an outpatient pharmacy. The outpatient serum creatinine level to estimate baseline eGFR was measured a median of 54 (IQR, 22–115) days before cohort entry. Of 11 917 patients, 7614 (63.9%) were dispensed ciprofloxacin, 2492 (20.9%) were dispensed levofloxacin, and 1811 (15.2%) were dispensed norfloxacin. The median prescribed dose was 500 (range, 500–1000) mg/d for ciprofloxacin, 500 (range, 250–750) mg/d for levofloxacin, and 800 (range, 400–800) mg/d for norfloxacin (eTable 7 in the Supplement). Fluoroquinolone prescriptions were written by 5838 unique physicians and dispensed by 3582 unique pharmacies.

8.5	Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as CIPRO. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing CIPRO to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential adverse reaction and advised to discontinue CIPRO and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

In a retrospective analysis of 23 multiple-dose controlled clinical trials of CIPRO encompassing over 3500 ciprofloxacin-treated patients, 25% of patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 10% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using CIPRO with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

10 OVERDOSAGE

In the event of acute overdosage, reversible renal toxicity has been reported in some cases. Empty the stomach by inducing vomiting or by gastric lavage. Observe the patient carefully and give supportive treatment, including monitoring of renal function, urinary pH and acidify, if required, to prevent crystalluria and administration of magnesium, aluminum, or calcium containing antacids which can reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. Adequate hydration must be maintained. Only a small amount of ciprofloxacin (less than 10%) is removed from the body after hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

2.4 Important Administration Instructions

With Multivalent Cations

Administer CIPRO at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after magnesium/aluminum antacids; polymeric phosphate binders (for example, sevelamer, lanthanum carbonate) or sucralfate; Videx®(didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder for oral solution; other highly buffered drugs; or other products containing calcium, iron or zinc.

With Dairy Products

Concomitant administration of CIPRO with dairy products (like milk or yogurt) or calcium-fortified juices alone should be avoided since decreased absorption is possible; however, CIPRO may be taken with a meal that contains these products.

Hydration of Patients Receiving CIPRO

Assure adequate hydration of patients receiving CIPRO to prevent the formation of highly concentrated urine. Crystalluria has been reported with quinolones.

Instruct the patient of the appropriate CIPRO administration [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Missed Doses

If a dose is missed, it should be taken anytime but not later than 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. If less than 6 hours remain before the next dose, the missed dose should not be taken and treatment should be continued as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Double doses should not be taken to compensate for a missed dose.

Splitting CIPRO Tablets

CIPRO Tablets, 250 mg and 500 mg are functionally scored tablets which can be split into one-half at the scored line to provide a 125 mg and 250 mg strength, respectively.

2.5 Directions for Reconstitution of the CIPRO Microcapsules for Oral Suspension

CIPRO Oral Suspension is supplied in 5% (5 g ciprofloxacin in 100 mL) and 10% (10 g ciprofloxacin in 100 mL) strengths. CIPRO oral suspension is composed of two components (microcapsules and diluent) that must be combined prior to dispensing.

Preparation of the suspension:

Step 5: Write the expiration date of the re-constituted oral suspension on the bottle label.

Reconstituted product may be stored below 30°C (86°F) for 14 days. Protect from freezing.

No additions should be made to the mixed final ciprofloxacin suspension. CIPRO Oral Suspension should not be administered through feeding or NG (nasogastric) tubes due to its physical characteristics.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential adverse reaction and advised to discontinue ciprofloxacin and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

In a retrospective analysis of 23 multiple-dose controlled clinical trials of ciprofloxacin encompassing over 3500 ciprofloxacin-treated patients, 25% of patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 10% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride tablet (Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride) [^111QbydE]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

- Take ciprofloxacin exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Do not stop taking ciprofloxacin without talking with your healthcare provider. If you stop taking ciprofloxacin too soon, it may not keep you from getting the anthrax disease.

- Side effects may happen while you are taking ciprofloxacin. When taking your ciprofloxacin to prevent anthrax infection, you and your healthcare provider should talk about whether the risks of stopping ciprofloxacin too soon are more important than the risks of side effects with ciprofloxacin.

- If you are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant while taking ciprofloxacin, you and your healthcare provider should decide whether the benefits of taking ciprofloxacin for anthrax are more important than the risks.

What should I avoid while taking ciprofloxacin?

- Ciprofloxacin can make you feel dizzy and lightheaded. Do not drive, operate machinery, or do other activities that require mental alertness or coordination until you know how ciprofloxacin affects you.

- Avoid sunlamps, tanning beds, and try to limit your time in the sun. Ciprofloxacin can make your skin sensitive to the sun (photosensitivity) and the light from sunlamps and tanning beds. You could get severe sunburn, blisters or swelling of your skin. If you get any of these symptoms while taking ciprofloxacin, call your healthcare provider right away. You should use a sunscreen and wear a hat and clothes that cover your skin if you have to be in sunlight.

### Ciprofloxacin crystal nephropathy [^1154jcSC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Ciprofloxacin is a widely used fluoroquinolone for the treatment of patients with complicated and uncomplicated infections. With rare exceptions, only immune-mediated interstitial nephritis was described, with direct renal damage reported only in case of overdose. Experimental studies indicated that crystalluria may be associated with the administration of this drug, but the likelihood that ciprofloxacin crystal nephropathy would occur in humans was believed to be very low on the basis of previous data showing that ciprofloxacin crystalluria depended on a urine pH greater than 6.8. However, we report 2 cases of ciprofloxacin crystal-induced nephropathy with a clinical pattern of acute reversible tubular damage and intratubular crystals identical to that previously described in elderly patients treated with ciprofloxacin dosages within therapeutic schedules. Crystals in the tubules were negative for both the von Kossa stain for phosphates and alizarin red stain for calcium.

### Medications for community pharmacists to dose adjust or avoid to enhance prescribing safety in individuals with advanced chronic kidney disease: a scoping review and modified Delphi [^112mkXtA]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Community pharmacists commonly see individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are in an ideal position to mitigate harm from inappropriate prescribing. We sought to develop a relevant medication list for community pharmacists to dose adjust or avoid in individuals with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min informed through a scoping review and modified Delphi panel of nephrology, geriatric and primary care pharmacists.

Methods

A scoping review was undertaken to identify higher risk medications common to community pharmacy practice, which require a dose adaptation in individuals with advanced CKD. A 3-round modified Delphi was conducted, informed by the medications identified in our scoping review, to establish consensus on which medications community pharmacists should adjust or avoid in individuals with stage 4 and 5 CKD (non-dialysis).

Results

Ninety-two articles and 88 medications were identified from our scoping review. Of which, 64 were deemed relevant to community pharmacy practice and presented for consideration to 27 panel experts. The panel consisted of Canadian pharmacists practicing in nephrology (66.7%), geriatrics (18.5%) and primary care (14.8%). All participants completed rounds 1 and 2 and 96% completed round 3. At the end of round 3, the top 40 medications to adjust or avoid were identified. All round 3 participants selected metformin, gabapentin, pregabalin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin and rivaroxaban as the top ranked medications.

Conclusion

Medications eliminated by the kidneys may accumulate and cause harm in individuals with advanced chronic kidney disease. This study provides an expert consensus of the top 40 medications that community pharmacists should collaboratively adjust or avoid to enhance medication safety and prescribing for individuals with an eGFR below 30 mL/min.

### Higher dosage of ciprofloxacin necessary in critically ill patients: a new dosing algorithm based on renal function and pathogen susceptibility [^1141sK3i]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this hypothesis‐generating study, we have proposed a dosing algorithm for ciprofloxacin for ICU patients, based on renal function and the MIC of the causative pathogen (Figure 2). We have demonstrated that renal function is a significant covariate on ciprofloxacin clearance. We found that MDRD, an eGFR based on serum creatinine, showed the best fit in our model as covariate on ciprofloxacin clearance. Adding serum cystatin C to the equation did not result in a better prediction of ciprofloxacin clearance. This was unexpected since serum creatinine is influenced by length of hospital stay, caused by muscle wasting in ICU patients and subsequent decreased creatinine production. Serum cystatin C–based eGFR is not influenced by length of stay, since serum cystatin C is not dependent on muscle mass or on age, sex, or race. 5 Although ciprofloxacin clearance was properly predicted by renal function, the study was not powered to detect which renal function estimation method had the best performance.

### Developing tailored dosing recommendations for ciprofloxacin in critically ill children using a population approach based on total and unbound concentrations [^115c7UQf]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Optimal ciprofloxacin dosing in critically ill children is influenced by complex factors affecting drug disposition, including pathophysiological changes and supportive therapies. This study aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for ciprofloxacin in critically ill children to identify predictors of inter-individual variability, evaluate target attainment for both total and unbound exposure, and provide tailored dosing recommendations.

Methods

A prospective, open-label, multicentric PK study was conducted in 44 critically ill children (< 16 years) receiving intravenous ciprofloxacin. Blood and urine samples were collected at two dosing occasions (10 mg/kg every 12h) and drug concentrations were assessed in plasma (total and unbound concentrations) and urine. PK parameters were analysed with population PK modelling. Probability of target attainment (PTA) was calculated based on the free or total area under the curve (AUC) and was simulated for different doses of ciprofloxacin.

Results

Ciprofloxacin PK was best described with an allometrically scaled two-compartment model. Typical fraction unbound ciprofloxacin in plasma, and the fraction excreted unchanged in urine were estimated to be 0.52 (IQR: 0.49; 0.56) and 0.89 (IQR: 0.54; 0.95), respectively. Clearance was found to be positively influenced by the glomerular filtration rate and negatively influenced when children were on mechanical ventilation. For a MIC of 0.25 mg/L, the study dose achieved a PTA of 75.3% for unbound exposure (fAUC/MIC > 72h) and 79.7% for total exposure (AUC/MIC > 125h). Adequate PTA (≥ 90%) requires 10 mg/kg every 12h in ventilated patients and 15 mg/kg every 8h (off-label) in non-ventilated patients with normal renal function (80–130 mL/min/1.73m 2).

Conclusions

Standard dosing regimens of ciprofloxacin (20–30 mg/kg per day) fail to achieve adequate target attainment in non-ventilated critically ill children with a normal or elevated renal function. Further research should prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of intensified ciprofloxacin dosing regimens.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114SRmeB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

### Right dose, right now: bedside, real-time, data-driven, and personalised antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock-a two-centre randomised clinical trial [^1154cuEy]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Adequate antibiotic dosing may improve outcomes in critically ill patients but is challenging due to altered and variable pharmacokinetics. To address this challenge, AutoKinetics was developed, a decision support system for bedside, real-time, data-driven and personalised antibiotic dosing. This study evaluates the feasibility, safety and efficacy of its clinical implementation.

Methods

In this two-centre randomised clinical trial, critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock were randomised to AutoKinetics dosing or standard dosing for four antibiotics: vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and ceftriaxone. Adult patients with a confirmed or suspected infection and either lactate > 2 mmol/L or vasopressor requirement were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was pharmacokinetic target attainment in the first 24 h after randomisation. Clinical endpoints included mortality, ICU length of stay and incidence of acute kidney injury.

Results

After inclusion of 252 patients, the study was stopped early due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the ciprofloxacin intervention group, the primary outcome was obtained in 69% compared to 3% in the control group (OR 62.5, CI 11.4–1173.78, p < 0.001). Furthermore, target attainment was faster (26 h, CI 18–42 h, p < 0.001) and better (65% increase, CI 49–84%, p < 0.001). For the other antibiotics, AutoKinetics dosing did not improve target attainment. Clinical endpoints were not significantly different. Importantly, higher dosing did not lead to increased mortality or renal failure.

Conclusions

In critically ill patients, personalised dosing was feasible, safe and significantly improved target attainment for ciprofloxacin.

Trial registration: The trial was prospectively registered at Netherlands Trial Register (NTR), NL6501/NTR6689 on 25 August 2017 and at the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT), 2017–002478–37 on 6 November 2017.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride [^116LkSDf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.9)].

In a retrospective analysis of 23 multiple-dose controlled clinical trials of ciprofloxacin encompassing over 3500 ciprofloxacin-treated patients, 25% of patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 10% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.12)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion; however, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the biliary system of the liver and through the intestine. These alternative pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment. Nonetheless, some modification of dosage is recommended, particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

In preliminary studies in patients with stable chronic liver cirrhosis, no significant changes in ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been observed. The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in patients with acute hepatic insufficiency, have not been studied.

### Association of higher-dose fluoroquinolone therapy with serious adverse events in older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^112fU8aH]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Our study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study designed to assess the risk of adverse events associated with starting a higher- vs lower-dose fluoroquinolone prescription in patients with advanced CKD not receiving dialysis. The study was conducted in the setting of usual clinical care. It included a representative sample of older adults with advanced CKD in Ontario, Canada, where all residents 66 years and older have universal prescription drug coverage. We were able to produce comparison groups that were balanced on 147 baseline characteristics after using inverse probability of treatment weighting. We conducted several sensitivity analyses, and all results supported the main findings.

This study also has some limitations. First, although we used a robust statistical technique to control for confounding by indication and the results were consistent in sensitivity analyses, residual confounding cannot be ruled out. The e-values for the lower confidence bound for the primary outcome were small, which implies that little unmeasured confounding would be needed to reduce the observed association or its 95% CI to the null. Second, despite the use of highly accurate information on fluoroquinolone dispensing, administrative data cannot provide information on the proportion of patients who took their pills as prescribed. Third, we studied patients 66 years and older with advanced CKD, so our findings may not apply to younger patients or those receiving dialysis. Fourth, we examined renally excreted fluoroquinolones as a class, and there were too few prescriptions to perform independent analyses by fluoroquinolone type. Fifth, fluoroquinolone dosing can vary with the type of infection (eTable 1B in the Supplement); however, we could not perform subgroup analysis by infection type owing to small sample sizes. Sixth, misclassification of some study outcomes is expected for codes with low sensitivity, which would also underestimate the number of events (eTable 8 in the Supplement); however, differential misclassification between exposure groups is unlikely. Seventh, the small number of collagen-associated events and other tendinopathies precluded further analysis of these outcomes. Eighth, 926 of 11 917 patients (7.7%) had an eGFR of less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and this small sample precluded any meaningful comparisons between CKD stages. Ninth, much of the data regarding adverse effects are derived from passive reporting systems and small observational studies, which are prone to confounding. Therefore, we chose to include adverse events reported in population-based drug safety studies and meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials and observational studies that resulted in FDA safety warnings. Although we believe that this algorithm for identifying fluoroquinolone-related adverse events is highly specific and robust, we may have missed some outcomes reported in case reports or pharmacovigilance reporting systems and some adverse events that did not result in safety warnings. Last, the magnitude of the risk and fragility of the statistical significance of many of the results may compromise the clinical relevance of our findings. Our study had 80% power to detect a relative risk increase of at least 58% for the primary outcome based on a feasibility analysis results. Although our study requires replication before definitive conclusions can be reached, the magnitude of the risk will likely be small. We did not consider fluoroquinolone effectiveness in this study, and in some cases, physicians may decide to prescribe a higher-dose fluoroquinolone because the potential benefits outweigh the risk.

### Drug dosing adjustments in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1157QyjE]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects renal drug elimination and other pharmacokinetic processes involved in drug disposition (e.g., absorption, drug distribution, nonrenal clearance [metabolism]). Drug dosing errors are common in patients with renal impairment and can cause adverse effects and poor outcomes. Dosages of drugs cleared renally should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate and should be calculated using online or electronic calculators. Recommended methods for maintenance dosing adjustments are dose reductions, lengthening the dosing interval, or both. Physicians should be familiar with commonly used medications that require dosage adjustments. Resources are available to assist in dosing decisions for patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in ICU patients on continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration [^1136qo4b]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the pharmacokinetics of intravenous ciprofloxacin 200 mg every 8 h in critically ill patients on continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), one form of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

Design and Setting

Open, prospective clinical study in a multidisciplinary, intensive care unit in a university-affiliated tertiary referral hospital.

Patients

Six critically ill patients with acute renal failure on CVVHDF.

Interventions

Timed blood and ultrafiltrate samples were collected to allow pharmacokinetics and clearances to be calculated of initial and subsequent doses of 200 mg intravenous ciprofloxacin. CVVHD was performed with 1 l/h of dialysate and 2 l/h of predilution filtration solution, producing 3 l/h of dialysis effluent. The blood was pumped at 200 ml/min using a Gambro BMM-10 blood pump through a Hospal AN69HF haemofilter.

Measurements and Results

Ten pharmacokinetic profiles were measured. The CVVHDF displayed a urea clearance of 42 ± 3 ml/min, and removed ciprofloxacin with a clearance of 37 ± 7 ml/min. This rate was 2–2.5 greater than previously published for ciprofloxacin in other forms of CRRT. On average the CVVHDF was responsible for clearing a fifth of all ciprofloxacin eliminated (21 ± 10%). The total body clearance of ciprofloxacin was 12.2 ± 4.3 l/h. The trough concentration following the initial dose was 0.7 ± 0.3 mg/l. The area under the plasma concentration time curves over a 24-h period ranged from 21 to 55 mg.h l-1.

Conclusions

Intravenous ciprofloxacin 600 mg/day in critically ill patients using this form of CRRT produced adequate plasma levels for many resistant microbes found in intensive care units.

Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of ciprofloxacin when given as an oral tablet is approximately 70% with no substantial loss by first pass metabolism. Ciprofloxacin maximum serum concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in the chart for the 250 mg to 1000 mg dose range (Table 12).

Maximum serum concentrations are attained 1 to 2 hours after oral dosing. Mean concentrations 12 hours after dosing with 250, 500, or 750 mg are 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mcg/mL, respectively. The serum elimination half-life in subjects with normal renal function is approximately 4 hours. Serum concentrations increase proportionately with doses up to 1000 mg.

A 500 mg oral dose given every 12 hours has been shown to produce an AUC equivalent to that produced by an intravenous infusion of 400 mg CIPRO given over 60 minutes every 12 hours. A 750 mg oral dose given every 12 hours has been shown to produce an AUC at steady-state equivalent to that produced by an intravenous infusion of 400 mg given over 60 minutes every 8 hours. A 750 mg oral dose results in a Cmaxsimilar to that observed with a 400 mg intravenous dose (Table 13). A 250 mg oral dose given every 12 hours produces an AUC equivalent to that produced by an infusion of 200 mg CIPRO given every 12 hours.

Food

When CIPRO Tablet is given concomitantly with food, there is a delay in the absorption of the drug, resulting in peak concentrations that occur closer to 2 hours after dosing rather than 1 hour whereas there is no delay observed when CIPRO Suspension is given with food. The overall absorption of CIPRO Tablet or CIPRO Suspension, however, is not substantially affected. The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin given as the suspension are also not affected by food. Avoid concomitant administration of CIPRO with dairy products (like milk or yogurt) or calcium-fortified juices alone since decreased absorption is possible; however, CIPRO may be taken with a meal that contains these products

With oral administration, a 500 mg dose, given as 10 mL of the 5% CIPRO Suspension (containing 250 mg ciprofloxacin/5mL) is bioequivalent to the 500 mg tablet. A 10 mL volume of the 5% CIPRO Suspension (containing 250 mg ciprofloxacin/5mL) is bioequivalent to a 5 mL volume of the 10% CIPRO Suspension (containing 500 mg ciprofloxacin/5mL).

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Ciprofloxacin tablets should be administered orally as described in the appropriate Dosage Guidelines tables.

2.1 Dosage in Adults

The determination of dosage and duration for any particular patient must take into consideration the severity and nature of the infection, the susceptibility of the causative microorganism, the integrity of the patient's host-defense mechanisms, and the status of renal and hepatic function.

Ciprofloxacin Tablets may be administered to adult patients when clinically indicted at the discretions of the physician.

Conversion of IV to Oral Dosing in Adults

Patients whose therapy is started with Ciprofloxacin IV may be switched to ciprofloxacin tablets when clinically indicated at the discretion of the physician (Table 2) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2 Dosage in Pediatric Patients

Dosing and initial route of therapy (that is, IV or oral) for cUTI or pyelonephritis should be determined by the severity of the infection. Ciprofloxacin tablets should be administered as described in Table 3.

1.000000000000000e+00The total duration of therapy for cUTI and pyelonephritis in the clinical trial was determined by the physician. The mean duration of treatment was 11 days (range 10 to 21 days).

2.000000000000000e+00Begin drug administration as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure.

3.000000000000000e+00Begin drug administration as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to Y. pestis.

2.3 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment

Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion; however, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the biliary system of the liver and through the intestine. These alternative pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment. Nonetheless, some modification of dosage is recommended, particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction. Dosage guidelines for use in patients with renal impairment are shown in Table 4.

When only the serum creatinine concentration is known, the following formulas may be used to estimate creatinine clearance:

The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

In patients with severe infections and severe renal impairment, a unit dose of 750 mg may be administered at the intervals noted above. Patients should be carefully monitored.

Pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency were excluded from the clinical trial of cUTI and pyelonephritis. No information is available on dosing adjustments necessary for pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (that is, creatinine clearance of < 50 mL/min/1.73m2).

5.1	Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy, and Central Nervous System Effects

Fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects (hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion). These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after starting CIPRO. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4)].

Discontinue CIPRO immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones.

5.2	Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture

Fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur, within hours or days of starting CIPRO, or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.

The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue CIPRO immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including CIPRO, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117GrFR3]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) oral antibiotics — dose for patients with normal renal function includes the following regimens: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg-125mg every 8 to 12 hours (note: "Other regimens may be more effective"); Cefpodoxime 200mg to 400mg every 12 hours; Ceftibuten 9mg/kg daily (children) and 400mg daily or 200mg every 12 hours (adults); Cefuroxime 500mg every 12 hours; Cephalexin 500mg to 1000mg every 6 hours (note: "Other regimens may be more effective"); Ciprofloxacin 500mg to 750mg every 12 hours; Levofloxacin 500mg to 750mg daily; Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 800mg-160mg every 12 hours. For other oral beta-lactams (e.g. amoxicillin, cefadroxil, cefaclor, cefdinir), comparative clinical outcomes data vs highly bioavailable oral alternatives are more limited and/or discouraging; consider use with infectious disease pharmacist consultation if alternatives are not available.

### Higher dosage of ciprofloxacin necessary in critically ill patients: a new dosing algorithm based on renal function and pathogen susceptibility [^114hGC23]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

The objective of the present study was to develop a dosing algorithm for ciprofloxacin based on both renal function and pathogen susceptibility in critically ill patients. In this observational prospective multicenter pharmacokinetic study, a total of 39 adult intensive care unit patients receiving ciprofloxacin were included. On two occasions a total of 531 samples of ciprofloxacin were collected. Renal function is a significant covariate on ciprofloxacin clearance. A dose of 400 mg every 12 hours was sufficient to reach the preestablished target of area under the curve (AUC) in relation to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (AUC/MIC) > 125 in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 130 mL/min and an infection caused by a pathogen with an MIC ≤ 0.125 mg/L. For patients with infections caused by pathogens with an MIC ≥ 0.5 mg/L and eGFR > 100 mL/min, doses up to 600 mg four times daily or more were estimated to be required. This study provides a new dosing algorithm for ciprofloxacin in critically ill patients. In order to achieve adequate target attainment, the dosing of ciprofloxacin should be based on renal function and the MIC of the causative pathogen. Higher doses than the standard licensed dose are necessary to obtain target attainment for less susceptible pathogens and patients with high renal clearance. In the setting of impaired renal function, a daily dose of 400 mg (which is currently recommended) will not result in adequate target attainment for less susceptible pathogens.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Smpys]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Association of higher-dose fluoroquinolone therapy with serious adverse events in older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^115eFngi]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Population-based data are needed to inform the safe prescribing of fluoroquinolone antibiotics to patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Objective

To quantify the 14-day risk of a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or a collagen-associated event in patients with advanced CKD newly prescribed a fluoroquinolone at a higher vs a lower dose.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada (January 1, 2008, to March 17, 2020) used linked health care data to identify new users of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Participants included adults 66 years or older with advanced CKD (an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 but not receiving dialysis). Data analysis was performed from January 1 to April 30, 2021.

Exposures

A new prescription for a higher-dose fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, 501–1000 mg/d; levofloxacin, 501–750 mg/d; or norfloxacin, 401–800 mg/d) vs a lower-dose fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, 500 mg/d; levofloxacin, 250–500 mg/d; or norfloxacin, 400 mg/d).

Main Outcomes and Measure

The primary outcome was the 14-day risk of a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or a collagen-associated event. Secondary outcomes included a hospital visit with sepsis, retinal detachment or other tendinopathies, all-cause hospitalization, all-cause mortality, and sudden cardiac death. Inverse probability of treatment weighting on the propensity score was used to balance comparison groups on baseline health. Weighted risk ratios and risk differences were obtained using modified Poisson regression and binomial regression, respectively.

Results

Of 11 917 patients (median age, 83 years [IQR, 77–89 years]; 7438 women [62.4%]; median eGFR, 25 [IQR, 21–28] mL/min/1.73 m2) included in the analysis, 5482 (46.0%) received a higher-dose and 6435 (54.0%) received a lower-dose fluoroquinolone. After weighting, the primary composite outcome-a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or a collagen-associated event-occurred in 68 of 5482 patients (1.2%) treated with a higher-dose fluoroquinolone and in 47 of 5516 (0.9%) treated with a lower-dose fluoroquinolone (weighted risk ratio, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.01–2.08]; weighted risk difference, 0.39% [95% CI, 0.01%-0.76%]). The risk of sepsis, retinal detachment, all-cause hospitalization, all-cause mortality, and sudden cardiac death did not differ significantly between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that older patients with advanced CKD who were prescribed a fluoroquinolone at a higher-than-recommended dose were significantly more likely to experience the composite outcome of a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or a collagen-associated event, although the absolute risk of these events was less than 2%.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion; however, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the biliary system of the liver and through the intestine. These alternative pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment. Nonetheless, some modification of dosage is recommended, particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

In preliminary studies in patients with stable chronic liver cirrhosis, no significant changes in ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been observed. The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in patients with acute hepatic insufficiency, have not been studied.

10. Overdosage

In the event of acute overdosage, reversible renal toxicity has been reported in some cases. Empty the stomach by inducing vomiting or by gastric lavage. Observe the patient carefully and give supportive treatment, including monitoring of renal function, urinary pH and acidify, if required, to prevent crystalluria and administration of magnesium, aluminum, or calcium containing antacids which can reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. Adequate hydration must be maintained. Only a small amount of ciprofloxacin (less than 10%) is removed from the body after hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

### Urinary tract infections in patients with chronic renal insufficiency [^111eJNGy]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Despite an increasing population of patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the literature on the management of urinary tract infections (UTI) in these patients is sparse. Patients with underlying diabetes are a specific population at risk. Antimicrobial treatment of UTI requires adequate serum, renal, parenchymal, and urine concentrations of drugs with antibacterial activity versus the etiologic organism. Sulfamethoxazole and nitrofurantoin are examples of drugs with low and likely inadequate urine concentrations in patients with creatinine clearances of < 50 ml/min. Urine concentrations of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin remain sufficient as renal function fails, whereas the concentrations of gemifloxacin and moxifloxacin are too low to predict efficacy. More investigative work is needed in the management of UTI in patients with poor renal function.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential adverse reaction and advised to discontinue ciprofloxacin and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

In a retrospective analysis of 23 multiple-dose controlled clinical trials of ciprofloxacin encompassing over 3500 ciprofloxacin-treated patients, 25% of patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 10% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

### Ciprofloxacin-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome [^114z6tut]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the first case of ciprofloxacin-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS).

Case Summary

A 53-year-old white man was treated with chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Four weeks after initiation of treatment, he recovered his blood cell counts, but developed fever and was prescribed oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily. After 4 doses, he developed the typical features of HUS manifested by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, oliguric renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. The medication was withdrawn, and he received 5 sessions of plasma exchange. He recovered completely and has normal renal function.

Discussion

Secondary HUS or its related syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), is uncommon, but has been reported in association with cancer, chemotherapy, and a variety of medications. Our case represents a possible adverse drug reaction to ciprofloxacin according to the Naranjo probability scale. It is the first reported case of HUS associated with ciprofloxacin.

Conclusions

Ciprofloxacin use was followed by HUS in our patient and was possibly causally related. Early detection, discontinuation of the offending medication, and treatment of HUS/TTP is critical.

### Ciprofloxacin nephrotoxicity-reply… [^1122D2FP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

We appreciate the comments of Anand with respect to the nephrotoxic potential of ciprofloxacin. In our first trial of outpatient antibiotic therapy in low-risk, neutropenic cancer patients, we used a higher-than-usual dose of ciprofloxacin, based on data indicating reduced absorption of orally administered ciprofloxacin after antineoplastic chemotherapy. 1 The study by Ljungberg and Nilsson-Ehle, 2 demonstrating increased oral bioavailability and reduced renal clearance of ciprofloxacin in elderly patients is of interest, and may in part explain our experience in elderly oncologic patients. Although acute renal failure has been associated with ciprofloxacin administered at much lower doses, in our second study of outpatient antibiotic therapy of low-risk neutropenic patients we have reduced the dose of ciprofloxacin to 500 mg orally every 8 hours.

Also, we have substituted amoxicillin/clavulanate for clindamycin in the oral regimen of our second trial, although, as. Rolston KVI, Rubenstein EB. Ciprofloxacin Nephrotoxicity-Reply. Arch Intern Med. 1993;

### Higher dosage of ciprofloxacin necessary in critically ill patients: a new dosing algorithm based on renal function and pathogen susceptibility [^114hY14Y]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

The upper safety limit (AUC 100 mg*h/L) we defined is theoretical and might be conservative. Although treatment with ciprofloxacin is considered safe, with gastrointestinal adverse events as most common side effects, in 1–2% of the patients, more severe adverse events might occur. 11 In a recent evaluation the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) reported on neuropsychiatric toxicities, tendinopathy long‐term disability, and aortic aneurysms/dissections associated with fluoroquinolones. 12 Whether these toxicities are concentration dependent remains to be investigated, so currently there are no recommendations to the maximum exposure. Yet, dose reductions in renal impairment are still recommended to avoid possible toxicity, which we believe might result in insufficient exposure to reach target attainment. Indeed, in the treatment of children with cystic fibrosis with a pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection, doses higher than 1,200 mg daily are used. In these patients, a maximum daily dose of 2,000 mg intravenous is recommended and well‐tolerated. 13 Because of higher clearance in children, the high dosages (30 mg/kg/daily) used in children with cystic fibrosis resulted in similar AUC 0‐24h to adults using 1,200 mg daily. 13

When aiming for a PTA of 90% in the setting of an infection with a pathogen MIC of 0.5 mg/L, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can be considered to warrant that the AUC 0‐24h of 62.5–100 mg*h/L is achieved (i.e. AUC/MIC > 125 with MIC = 0.5). The rationale to perform TDM is supported by the relatively low interoccasion variability of 13.4%, considering the unstable critically ill patient population and the observed interindividual variability of 25.8%.

In conclusion, we provide a new dosing algorithm for ciprofloxacin in critically ill patients based on renal function and MIC. TDM might be considered to safeguard sufficiently high exposure in the setting of infections with a pathogen with a high MIC. In all settings, close observation of potential toxicity is recommended to learn more on the upper limit associated with toxicity. There is an urgent need to clinically assess high‐dose ciprofloxacin (> 1,200 mg/day) to allow treatment of less susceptible pathogens in the critically ill population.

8.6	Renal Impairment

Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion; however, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the biliary system of the liver and through the intestine. These alternative pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment. Nonetheless, some modification of dosage is recommended, particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7	Hepatic Impairment

In preliminary studies in patients with stable chronic liver cirrhosis, no significant changes in ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been observed. The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in patients with acute hepatic insufficiency, have not been studied.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential adverse reaction and advised to discontinue ciprofloxacin and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

In a retrospective analysis of 23 multiple-dose controlled clinical trials of ciprofloxacin encompassing over 3500 ciprofloxacin-treated patients, 25% of patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 10% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

### Higher dosage of ciprofloxacin necessary in critically ill patients: a new dosing algorithm based on renal function and pathogen susceptibility [^117JUvUG]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Ciprofloxacin is one of the most commonly prescribed antimicrobial drugs for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), used for both empirical and targeted therapy for a broad range of infections. Intravenous ciprofloxacin is typically administered in dosages of 400 mg twice daily. Ciprofloxacin is primarily eliminated (50‐60%) by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. 1 It is recommended that dose and/or frequency are reduced in the setting of impaired renal function. 1, 2 Previous pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of ciprofloxacin in critically ill patients showed substantial variability in clearance, most likely driven by variation in renal function. 3, 4 Correct estimation of renal function is difficult especially in critically ill patients with unstable renal function and altered muscle mass. 5 Despite its limitations, glomerular filtration rate (GFR)‐calculations based on creatinine are currently the most‐used method to estimate renal function to guide antimicrobial dosing. The use of combined renal function markers serum cystatin C and creatinine make the estimated GFR (eGFR) less dependent on changes in muscle mass. 5 This may result in an improved estimation of GFR and thus a better approximation of ciprofloxacin clearance.

The antimicrobial efficacy of ciprofloxacin is driven by the area under the curve (AUC) in relation to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the causative microorganism (AUC/MIC). For ciprofloxacin, an AUC/MIC ratio of 125 has been found to be necessary for both microbiological clearance and clinical cure. 6 This might be easily reached with the licensed dose for pathogens with a low MIC, such as Escherichia coli with an epidemiological cutoff value of 0.064 mg/L. 7 Yet, for critically ill patients infected with pathogens with higher MICs such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, higher dosages are required. 5, 8 A maximum tolerated dose or maximum tolerated concentration is not defined for ciprofloxacin.

Considering the variability of ciprofloxacin clearance in critically ill patients and the conflicting instructions on dose adjustments based on renal function, it remains unclear what dosage should be given in critically ill patients. To resolve this issue we conducted a prospective observational PK study to propose a dosing algorithm for ciprofloxacin based on both renal function and MIC in critically ill patients.

Acute renal failure is a rare adverse reaction of antibiotic therapy with quinolones seldom seen in young patients. We report an 18-year-old young woman with cystic fibrosis who experienced a pronounced decline in renal function after oral treatment with ciprofloxacin for 3 weeks. Withdrawal of the drug led to normalization of renal function after 10 days.

Methods

All adult patients admitted to the ICU who were treated with ciprofloxacin intravenous therapy were eligible for inclusion in this prospective observational multicenter PK study. Patients were eligible if they had a central venous or arterial catheter. Dose and duration of ciprofloxacin therapy were determined by the attending physician. Demographic and biochemical data were collected from the medical charts of patients including age, sex, total body weight, height, diagnosis, drug dose history, and comedication. Biochemical data included serum creatinine, serum cystatin C, and urinary creatinine. Within 24 hours after start of ciprofloxacin therapy, two PK curves with eight timepoints each during a dosing interval were collected with an interval of 12–24 hours between the occasions. This study was evaluated by the local ethics committee and the need for a written informed consent was waived due to its observational nature.

Population PK analysis of ciprofloxacin was performed by nonlinear mixed‐effect modeling using the software program NONMEM version 7.4 (Icon plc, Dublin, Ireland). We accounted for the impact of weight on pharmacokinetics a priori by means of allometric scaling of the PK parameters to total body weight. We tested the following algorithms for eGFR as covariates for clearance of ciprofloxacin: Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration based on serum creatinine, based on serum cystatin C and on both serum creatinine and serum cystatin C and 24 hour urine creatinine clearance. Details of the pharmacokinetic analysis can be found in the Supplementary material. Model selection and diagnostics were performed in line with best practice. 9 The final model was used to perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine the probability of target attainment (PTA) with a target of AUC/MIC > 125 for various MICs (0.064–0.5 mg/L). We simulated 10,000 virtual patients for each dose group, using the demographics of 10,000 previous ICU patients at our clinic. From these simulations, we created a dosing algorithm of ciprofloxacin for different pathogen susceptibilities and different renal functions.

To define an upper limit of ciprofloxacin exposure that can be considered safe, we selected the 97.5th percentile of the AUC 0‐24h of 8,000 virtual ICU patients with normal renal function (eGFR > 60 mL/min) receiving 400 mg three times daily. A dosing regimen was considered successful if the PTA was ≥ 90% and the AUC 0‐24h was < 97.5th percentile.

### Pattern, frequency and factors associated with inappropriate high dosing in chronic kidney disease patients at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan [^115b2uqb]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Although, antibiotics (cefixime, ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin) comprised only 7.9% (24/2265) of the total prescribed drugs in our study, we found that 79.1% (19/24) of them were not adjusted for dose. The inappropriate dosing of these drugs in patients with CKD may lead to acute renal failure with tubulointerstitial nephritis, neurotoxicity (hallucination and psychosis) and cardiotoxicty (QT interval prolongation and sudden cardiac death). In our study, metformin and sitagliptin were the two most frequently prescribed antidiabetic agents, followed by glibenclamide, gliclazide and glimepiride. However, it was noted that doses of 59.2% of the prescribed antidiabetics [metformin (60.6%), sitagliptin (60.6%), gliclazide (50.0%), glimepiride (41.6%) and glibenclamide (75.0%)] were not adjusted appropriately. This is concerning as the use of metformin in CKD patients with concurrent hypoxemic conditions may lead to lactic acidosis, and it is recommended that the dose of metformin should be reduced by 50% in CKD stage-3, and should be avoided altogether in CKD stage 4 and 5 patients. Additionally, the plasma concentration of sitagliptin can increase by two to four folds in patients with moderate to severe CKD, increasing the risk congestive heart failure. Therefore, it is recommended to start sitagliptin at a lower dose in patients with an eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Glibenclamide, gliclazide and glimepiride are long acting potent hypoglycemic drugs. Their use without dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment could result in episodes of severe hypoglycaemia. The renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (ACEIs and ARBs) due to their antiproteinuric, nephroprotective and cardioprotective effects and halting the progression of renal impairment are preferred agents in CKD patients. However, it is concerning that in our study doses of captopril (52.0%), enalapril (51.8%), lisinopril (76.9%), losartan (70.3%) and valsartan (41.9%) were not adjusted in CKD patients. The use of these agents without dose adjustment in CKD stage 4 and 5 patients, particularly in the presence of congestive heart failure and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), could cause acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. Additionally, our study found that doses of bisoprolol (76.6%) and atenolol (42.8%) were not adjusted. As these agents are hydrophilic and mainly excreted through the kidney, their use without dose adjustment could result in drug induced cellular injury, inflammation in the renal interstitium and acute renal failure in CKD patients. The analysis further revealed that doses were also not adjusted for hydrochlorothiazide (56.1%) and spironolactone (66.6%). It is worth noting that hydrochlorothiazide has been reported to be ineffective in patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m 2, and its use in CKD stage 4 and 5 patients could lead to severe episodes of hyponatremia, hypokalaemia, volume depletion and acute kidney injury. On the other hand, the inappropriate high doses of spironolactone in patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m 2 could result in severe hyperkalaemia and increase the absolute risk of worsening kidney function. As the excretion of domperidone decreases with decline in kidney function, the repeated doses can increase its plasma half-life in CKD stage 4 and 5 patients. Its prescription with unadjusted dose (53.9% in the current study) could result in QT-interval prolongation and increased risk of sudden cardiac death in CKD patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. The study further showed that inappropriate high doses of aspirin and paracetamol were prescribed to 43.1% patients who were receiving them. As these agents inhibit prostaglandin-E 2 which can result in vasoconstriction and a decrease in renal blood flow, they can potentially worsen the renal function. Therefore it is advised to avoid these agents until absolutely necessary. If their use is unavoidable, treatment should be started with the minimum effective doses, and they should only be used for the shortest possible period. The prescription tramadol without dose adjustment could result in its extended plasma half-life and substantial adverse effects on central nervous system.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential adverse reaction and advised to discontinue ciprofloxacin and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

In a retrospective analysis of 23 multiple-dose controlled clinical trials of ciprofloxacin encompassing over 3500 ciprofloxacin-treated patients, 25% of patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 10% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

### Clinical pharmacodynamics: principles of drug response and alterations in kidney disease [^112q5mq8]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics follow the logic of cause and consequence. Receptor-mediated and reversible effects can be distinguished from direct and irreversible effects. Reversible effects are capacity-limited and saturable whereas irreversible effects are limited only by the number of viable targets. In the case of receptor-mediated and reversible effects a threshold and a ceiling concentration can be defined. Antimicrobial drugs with concentration-dependent action are distinguished from drugs with time-dependent action. Concentration-dependent effects are associated with a high ceiling concentration and the target is the high peak. Time-dependent effects are associated with a high threshold concentration and the target is the high trough. During kidney dysfunction, alterations of drug response are usually attributed to pharmacokinetic but rarely to pharmacodynamic changes. Dose adjustment calculations, therefore, tacitly presume that pharmacodynamic parameters remain unchanged while only pharmacokinetic parameters are altered in kidney failure. Kidney dysfunction influences the pharmacokinetic parameters of at least 50% of all essential drugs. Clinicians usually consider pharmacokinetics when kidney disease is found, but pharmacodynamics is as important. Alterations of pharmacodynamic parameters are conceivable but only rarely reported in kidney failure. Sometimes surprising dosing adjustments are needed when pharmacodynamic concepts are brought into the decision process of which dose to choose. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics should both be considered when any dosing regimen is determined.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113sidrY]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Table 6 — dosing recommendations for drugs used to treat or prevent opportunistic infections in adults with HIV and renal insufficiency — details specific renal adjustments as follows. If SCr increases by 0.3–0.4 mg/dL above baseline, decrease to 3 mg/kg IV per dose; if SCr increases by ≥ 0.5 mg/dL above baseline or ≥ 3+ proteinuria, discontinue therapy. For ciprofloxacin, when CrCl or eGFR is 30–50, use 500–750 mg PO every 12 hours or 400 mg IV every 12 hours; when < 30, use 250–500 mg PO every 24 hours or 400 mg IV every 24 hours; with HD, use 250–500 mg PO every 24 hours or 200–400 mg IV every 24 hours and administer dose after HD on dialysis days. For clarithromycin, usual dose is 500 mg PO every 12 hours; at 30–60, use usual dose unless used with an HIV PI or with COBI, then reduce dose by 50% (or consider using azithromycin as alternative); at < 30 or HD, use 250 mg PO twice daily or 500 mg PO once daily, and if used with an HIV PI or COBI, reduce dose by 75% (or consider using azithromycin as alternative).

### Association of higher-dose fluoroquinolone therapy with serious adverse events in older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^1125UbAL]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is treatment with fluoroquinolone at a higher vs a lower dose associated with increased risk of serious adverse events among older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 11 917 older patients with advanced CKD, treatment with fluoroquinolone at a higher vs a lower dose was associated with increased risk of a composite outcome of a hospital visit with nervous system and/or psychiatric disorders, hypoglycemia, or a collagen-associated event.

Meaning

These findings suggest that fluoroquinolones should be prescribed cautiously and at lower doses among older adults with advanced CKD.

In the event of acute overdosage, reversible renal toxicity has been reported in some cases. Empty the stomach by inducing vomiting or by gastric lavage. Observe the patient carefully and give supportive treatment, including monitoring of renal function, urinary pH and acidify, if required, to prevent crystalluria and administration of magnesium, aluminum, or calcium containing antacids which can reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. Adequate hydration must be maintained. Only a small amount of ciprofloxacin (less than 10%) is removed from the body after hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

Inform patients that antacids containing magnesium, or aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc or didanosine should be taken at least two hours before or six hours after CIPRO administration. CIPRO should not be taken with dairy products (like milk or yogurt) or calcium-fortified juices alone since absorption of ciprofloxacin may be significantly reduced; however, CIPRO may be taken with a meal that contains these products.

Advise patients that if a dose is missed, it should be taken anytime but not later than 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. If less than 6 hours remain before the next dose, the missed dose should not be taken and treatment should be continued as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Double doses should not be taken to compensate for a missed dose.

Advise patients that CIPRO Tablets (250 mg and 500 mg) are scored and can be split into one-half at the scored line to provide a 125 mg or 250 mg strength, respectively.

Specific Populations

Elderly

Pharmacokinetic studies of the oral (single dose) and intravenous (single and multiple dose) forms of ciprofloxacin indicate that plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin are higher in elderly subjects (older than 65 years) as compared to young adults. Although the Cmaxis increased 16% to 40%, the increase in mean AUC is approximately 30%, and can be at least partially attributed to decreased renal clearance in the elderly. Elimination half-life is only slightly (~20%) prolonged in the elderly. These differences are not considered clinically significant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Renal Impairment

In patients with reduced renal function, the half-life of ciprofloxacin is slightly prolonged. Dosage adjustments may be required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Hepatic Impairment

In preliminary studies in patients with stable chronic liver cirrhosis, no significant changes in ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been observed. The kinetics of ciprofloxacin in patients with acute hepatic insufficiency, have not been fully studied.

Pediatrics

Table 11 summarizes pharmacokinetic parameters in pediatric patients aged less than 1 to less than 12 years of age receiving intravenous treatment.

These values are within the range reported for adults at therapeutic doses. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of pediatric patients with various infections, the predicted mean half-life in children is approximately 4 hours to 5 hours, and the bioavailability of the oral suspension is approximately 60%.

### Ciprofloxacin-induced drug fever [^117MfkRg]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Drug-induced fever is an uncommon but important differential in patients with unexplained fever. We present a case of a woman in her 60s with advanced renal disease and recent total hip arthroplasty who developed fever after an extended course of ciprofloxacin treatment. Extensive investigations, including cultures, imaging and orthopaedic review, failed to identify an infectious source. Although her fever initially resolved by day 2, it recurred on day 19 of treatment. Repeat assessments remained inconclusive. Ciprofloxacin-induced drug fever was suspected, and defervescence occurred within 48 hours of discontinuation, with no recurrence thereafter. This case highlights the importance of considering drug fever once other causes have been excluded. Early recognition can prevent unnecessary antibiotic escalation, reduce hospital stay and improve patient outcomes. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for this diagnosis, particularly when new medications coincide with unexplained fever in the absence of clear infection.

Study Cohort

We assembled a cohort of adults 66 years and older with an eGFR of less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (excluding patients receiving dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) who received a new prescription for a single oral fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or norfloxacin) dispensed from an outpatient pharmacy between January 1, 2008, and March 17, 2020. The dispense date served as the date of cohort entry (ie, the index date). The age threshold of 66 years and older was used to ensure all patients had at least 1 year of prescription drug coverage before the index date. We restricted the cohort to patients with at least 1 serum creatinine measurement in the period from 1 year to 7 days before the index date (we excluded those with measurements within the 7-day period before the index date because these creatinine values may be elevated owing to acute infection).

To ensure patients were new fluoroquinolone users, we excluded those with evidence of fluoroquinolone use in the 180-day period before the index date. Ontario health care databases do not contain in-hospital treatment information, which may introduce an immeasurable time bias in pharmacoepidemiologic studies. To ensure study antibiotic treatments were initiated in an outpatient setting and to reduce the immeasurable time bias, we excluded patients discharged from the hospital or emergency department within 2 days before the index date (in Ontario, patients who start a fluoroquinolone prescription during a hospital admission would have their outpatient prescription dispensed on the same day or the day after hospital discharge). To ensure generalizability to usual prescribing, we excluded patients prescribed nonstandard doses (ie, ciprofloxacin, < 500 mg/d or > 1000 mg/d; levofloxacin, < 250 mg/d or > 750 mg/d; and norfloxacin, < 400 mg/d or > 800 mg/d). We also excluded patients prescribed a topical fluoroquinolone. Each patient could only enter the cohort once. This study had 80% power to detect a relative risk increase of at least a 58% for the primary outcome (corresponding to a risk ratio [RR] of 1.58; 2-sided α = .05; an incidence of 1% of the primary outcome in patients initiating treatment with a lower-dose fluoroquinolone) based on a feasibility analysis results.

### Ciprofloxacin-associated choreoathetosis in a haemodialysis patient [^114CvknE]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

This report describes a case of drug-associated choreoathetosis in a patient receiving ciprofloxacin. A 72-year-old haemodialysis patient presented with a 4-day history of progressive weakness, restlessness and involuntary movements of all limbs. He had been prescribed ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for a lower respiratory tract infection 7 days previously. He had generalised choreoathetosis affecting both upper and lower limbs. The temporal relationship with drug exposure and a dose which was on the upper limit for his renal impairment implicated ciprofloxacin as the culprit. His symptoms completely resolved within 1 week of drug withdrawal and never recurred subsequently.
