## Question

Opioids contraindicated in ESRD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which opioids are contraindicated in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic rationale in ESRD that drives opioid selection and avoidance. Then, I should verify which opioids are explicitly labeled as contraindicated or strongly recommended to avoid in renal impairment. Next, I will examine agents that are considered "use with caution" and clarify why they are not absolute contraindications. After that, I should review safer alternatives and any exceptions for acute or palliative contexts. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically usable list with monitoring and dose-adjustment principles anchored to guidelines and labeling [^111EfdGe] [^111EHeVq].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic rationale in ESRD. In advanced kidney failure, renal clearance of drugs and metabolites is markedly reduced, and dialysis can unpredictably alter drug levels, so opioids with active renally cleared metabolites or parent drug accumulation pose risks of neurotoxicity, respiratory depression, and prolonged sedation; conversely, agents with minimal renal elimination and no active renally cleared metabolites are preferred, which is why guidance emphasizes hepatic metabolism and low dialyzability when selecting opioids in ESRD [^111cLPd9] [^116Bs7A1] [^116zVQqV].

> Now, I should verify which opioids are explicitly contraindicated or strongly recommended to avoid. Multiple high-credibility oncology and supportive care guidelines advise avoiding morphine, meperidine, codeine, and tramadol in patients with significant renal impairment because of accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites (e.g., morphine-3-glucuronide, morphine-6-glucuronide, normeperidine, tramadol metabolites) and increased risk of opioid-induced neurotoxicity and seizures; this is framed as a strong recommendation unless no alternatives exist [^111EfdGe] [^115211Cb] [^111x8ff7] [^114hKGGY]. Wait, let me verify the morphine metabolites point: yes, M3G and M6G accumulate in renal impairment and are implicated in neurotoxicity and hyperalgesia, reinforcing the avoidance of morphine in ESRD [^114WjFyi] [^112747qS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "contraindicated" versus "avoid". I need to check whether any authoritative source lists an absolute contraindication for these opioids in ESRD. The FDA labeling for methadone does not list renal impairment as a contraindication, and oncology guidelines frame morphine, meperidine, codeine, and tramadol as agents to avoid rather than absolutely contraindicated; thus, the correct clinical phrasing is "avoid unless no alternatives", not "absolute contraindication", even though in practice many clinicians treat them as functionally contraindicated in ESRD [^111EfdGe] [^115211Cb].

> Next, I should review agents that are "use with caution" and clarify why they are not absolute contraindications. Oxycodone and hydromorphone are often used in ESRD with careful monitoring because, although their clearance is reduced and metabolites may accumulate, the clinical risk is generally lower than with morphine; nonetheless, start low, titrate slowly, and monitor closely for sedation and respiratory depression, and note that hydromorphone-3-glucuronide can accumulate and contribute to neurotoxicity in renal failure, so vigilance is essential [^112P19vk] [^113d2tgD] [^116Zrixy] [^111xn1Xz]. I should double-check dialysis effects: oxycodone is partially dialyzed (~10% removal), which can be clinically relevant for dosing around dialysis sessions, reinforcing the need for individualized plans [^111Gpfsy].

> I will now examine the preferred alternatives in ESRD. Fentanyl (particularly transdermal), methadone, and buprenorphine are generally preferred because they undergo minimal renal elimination and are not significantly dialyzed; however, I need to ensure I state the caveats: fentanyl's PK in severe renal impairment is incompletely characterized and labeling advises caution, methadone requires ECG monitoring for QT prolongation and should be initiated by experienced clinicians, and buprenorphine's ceiling effect may confer a respiratory safety advantage in some patients [^111EfdGe] [^113S4ncv] [^116NKYFv]. Let me verify buprenorphine's dialysis profile: it is not dialyzed and requires no dose adjustment in CKD, supporting its use in ESRD when indicated [^116NKYFv].

> But wait, what if the clinical context is acute postoperative pain or palliative care? I should confirm exceptions. In acute pain or end-of-life scenarios, short-course or carefully titrated opioids may be justified even in ESRD, with specialist input and enhanced monitoring; for example, calciphylaxis pain protocols describe cautious use of oxycodone or hydromorphone for breakthrough pain while avoiding morphine as background therapy, and perioperative reviews emphasize individualized PK considerations and dialysis timing for dose adjustments [^1133xnWv] [^116zVQqV] [^1152yhTt]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not contradict the general avoidance stance: it does not; it reflects risk–benefit exceptions in specific contexts with close supervision [^111EfdGe].

> Let me synthesize the practical clinical answer. Opioids that should be avoided in ESRD due to accumulation of active or neurotoxic metabolites include morphine, meperidine, codeine, and tramadol; these are not absolute contraindications in labeling, but strong guideline recommendations support avoidance unless no suitable alternatives exist and specialist oversight is in place [^111EfdGe] [^115211Cb] [^111x8ff7]. Agents that can be used with caution and careful monitoring include oxycodone and hydromorphone, typically at reduced initial doses with slow titration and attention to dialysis timing and neurotoxicity symptoms; preferred options with minimal renal clearance include fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine, each with their own safety considerations such as QT monitoring for methadone and limited dialysis removal for fentanyl [^112P19vk] [^116NKYFv] [^111cLPd9].

> I should confirm monitoring and stewardship principles to make this actionable. In ESRD, use the lowest effective dose, reassess frequently, monitor for opioid-induced neurotoxicity (myoclonus, confusion, seizures), and coordinate dosing around dialysis; avoid sedative co-medications when possible, and consider buprenorphine as a safer long-term option when appropriate, aligning with VA/DoD CKD guidance and CDC dosing cautions in renal impairment [^114vTRHn] [^111EHeVq] [^112dgYFH]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied fentanyl is universally safe in ESRD; I should correct that: while commonly used, fentanyl labeling notes limited PK data in severe renal impairment, so clinical vigilance remains essential even with preferred agents [^111TcFu8].

> Final check and concise clinical takeaway: opioids to avoid in ESRD are morphine, meperidine, codeine, and tramadol because of neurotoxic metabolite accumulation; oxycodone and hydromorphone are not absolutely contraindicated but require caution, dose reduction, and close monitoring; preferred agents include fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine due to minimal renal elimination, with methadone and buprenorphine often favored in chronic pain with appropriate monitoring and specialist involvement [^111EfdGe] [^112P19vk] [^116NKYFv].

Opioids are not absolutely contraindicated in ESRD, but **morphine, codeine, tramadol, and meperidine should be avoided** due to accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites [^111EfdGe] [^111x8ff7]. Fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine are preferred because they have minimal renal clearance and are not dialyzed [^111cLPd9] [^116NKYFv]. If opioids are used, start low, titrate slowly, and monitor closely for sedation, confusion, and respiratory depression [^112dgYFH]. Non-opioid strategies should be first-line whenever possible [^112P19vk] [^114vTRHn].

## Opioids to avoid in ESRD

Certain opioids are **particularly risky in ESRD** because they rely on renal excretion or produce active metabolites that accumulate in renal failure, increasing the risk of neurotoxicity and respiratory depression [^111EfdGe] [^111cLPd9].

| **Opioid** | **Rationale for avoidance** |
|-|-|
| Morphine | - Accumulates as morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) <br/> - Causing neurotoxicity and respiratory depression [^114WjFyi] |
| Codeine | - Accumulates as morphine metabolites <br/> - Risking neurotoxicity and respiratory depression [^112oAEvE] [^111cLPd9] |
| Tramadol | - Accumulates as active metabolites <br/> - Increasing risk of seizures and neurotoxicity [^112oAEvE] |
| Meperidine | - Accumulates as normeperidine <br/> - Causing seizures and neurotoxicity [^112oAEvE] [^111cLPd9] |

---

## Safer opioid alternatives in ESRD

Some opioids are **preferred in ESRD** because they undergo minimal renal clearance or are not significantly removed by dialysis [^116NKYFv].

| **Opioid** | **Rationale for use** |
|-|-|
| Fentanyl | - Minimal renal clearance <br/> - Not dialyzed <br/> - Preferred for severe pain [^116uhML9] [^111cLPd9] |
| Methadone | - Minimal renal clearance <br/> - Not dialyzed <br/> - Useful for chronic pain [^115LTD5v] [^113S4ncv] |
| Buprenorphine | - Minimal renal clearance <br/> - Not dialyzed <br/> - Lower risk of respiratory depression [^116NKYFv] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **cautious opioid use in ESRD** [^114vTRHn]. The VA/DoD CKD guideline recommends buprenorphine as the preferred opioid due to its lower risk of respiratory depression and minimal renal clearance [^116NKYFv]. ASCO guidelines advise avoiding morphine, codeine, tramadol, and meperidine in renal impairment and recommend fentanyl, methadone, or buprenorphine when opioids are necessary [^111EfdGe] [^111x8ff7].

---

## Risks associated with opioid use in ESRD

Opioid use in ESRD carries **significant risks**, including:

- **Respiratory depression**: Increased risk due to accumulation of active metabolites [^114WjFyi].
- **Neurotoxicity**: Sedation, confusion, and myoclonus from metabolite accumulation [^112747qS].
- **Increased mortality**: Higher mortality associated with opioid use in dialysis patients [^114o2WPT] [^114Wr1v5].

---

## Monitoring and dose adjustment strategies

When opioids are used in ESRD, **careful monitoring and dose adjustments are essential**:

- **Start low and titrate slowly**: Begin at 25–50% of usual doses and adjust based on response and side effects [^113d2tgD] [^111om6kS].
- **Frequent monitoring**: Closely monitor for sedation, confusion, respiratory depression, and constipation [^116EaQwA] [^112VG6kk].
- **Dialysis considerations**: Methadone and fentanyl are not dialyzed, while hydromorphone may be removed by dialysis, requiring dose adjustments around dialysis sessions [^115LTD5v] [^113DujtK].

---

## Non-opioid alternatives for pain management

Given the risks, **non-opioid strategies should be prioritized** in ESRD:

- **Acetaminophen**: Preferred first-line for mild pain; minimal renal clearance [^112P19vk].
- **Gabapentinoids**: Effective for neuropathic pain; require dose adjustment and careful monitoring [^115nwMfi].
- **Topical agents**: Capsaicin and lidocaine patches for localized pain [^112P19vk].
- **Non-pharmacologic interventions**: Physical therapy, acupuncture, and cognitive-behavioral therapy [^114vTRHn].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Avoid**: Morphine, codeine, tramadol, and meperidine due to neurotoxic metabolite accumulation [^111EfdGe].
- **Prefer**: Fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine for their minimal renal clearance and dialysis independence [^116NKYFv].
- **Monitor**: Closely for sedation, confusion, respiratory depression, and constipation [^116dFBej].
- **Prioritize**: Non-opioid strategies whenever possible [^112P19vk].

---

Opioids are not absolutely contraindicated in ESRD, but **morphine, codeine, tramadol, and meperidine should be avoided** due to neurotoxic metabolite accumulation. Fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine are preferred alternatives, and careful monitoring and dose adjustments are essential when opioids are used [^111EfdGe] [^116NKYFv].

### Analgesia in patients with ESRD: a review of available evidence [^113WXBcF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Moderate to severe pain frequently accompanies chronic diseases in general and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in particular. Several analgesic agents and associated metabolites show altered pharmacokinetics in the presence of reduced glomerular filtration rate. Drug-related side effects may exacerbate symptoms frequently observed in persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD; eg, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and constipation) or those often attributed to hemodialysis therapy (eg, orthostatic hypotension and impaired cognition). Persons with advanced CKD and ESRD are at increased risk for adverse effects of analgesic agents because of enhanced drug sensitivity, comorbid conditions, and concurrent medication use. Dose adjustment and avoidance of certain analgesics may be required in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD. We review the available evidence on pharmacokinetics and adverse drug effects of various analgesic agents commonly used in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD. Determining an optimal approach to the control of pain in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD will require additional research.

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^111xnHqa]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Atkinson et al thoroughly reviewed literature on commonly used opioids in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) setting and ultimately hypothesized that opioids primarily undergoing hepatic phase II metabolism that yields inactive metabolites (such as tapentadol) are highly protein bound, have larger molecular weights, and have higher lipophilicity (to avoid being dialyzed), should be considered first in this population of patients.

NSAIDs have well-documented renal toxicities that can cause acute kidney injury and influence progression of CKD.–They have been shown to increase sodium retention and edema, cause hyperkalemia through decreased delivery of potassium to the distal tubule, cause acute renal failure through disruption of the renal hemodynamic balance, cause nephrotic syndrome by increasing lymphocyte recruitment and activation, and cause acute and chronic renal papillary necrosis through direct toxicity. Nonrenal toxicities include increased blood pressure, decreased antihypertensive effects of several medications, and increased gastrointestinal (GI) bleed risk.

The totality of these toxicities led the American Society of Nephrology to recommend that all patients with hypertension, heart failure, or CKD of all causes avoid NSAID use, in their "Choosing Wisely" campaign published in 2012. This recommendation should further be extended to patients on dialysis. Residual renal function has proven to be important even after commencement of dialysis, because of its implication on dialysis adequacy.NSAIDs have been shown to negatively impact residual renal function, and dialysis patients are more susceptible to fluid and electrolyte changes, have blood pressures that are more difficult to control, and are at higher risk for GI bleeds; thus dialysis patients may be at an even greater risk of harm from NSAID use than the general population.,

Acetaminophen is most commonly used to alleviate mild pain symptoms such as headaches, toothaches, or backaches. The mechanism in which acetaminophen provides analgesia remains unclear; however, it is thought to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the hypothalamus and possibly the spinal cord, with minimal effects on the kidneys. The majority of data supports its renal safety when used in lower, intermittent doses, and only few cases have reported acute renal toxicity after ingestion of larger doses. Chronic high-dose acetaminophen may cause renal function decline (decrease in glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL/min) and has been reported in women who consumed > 3,000 g of acetaminophen over 11 years and has also been associated with tubular necrosis with long-term use (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.28–3.24).

### End-stage renal disease: symptom management and advance care planning [^116uhML9]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

The prevalence of end-stage renal disease continues to increase, and dialysis is offered to older and more medically complex patients. Pain is problematic in up to one-half of patients receiving dialysis and may result from renal and nonrenal etiologies. Opioids can be prescribed safely, but the patient's renal function must be considered when selecting a drug and when determining the dosage. Fentanyl and methadone are considered the safest opioids for use in patients with end-stage renal disease. Nonpain symptoms are common and affect quality of life. Phosphate binders, ondansetron, and naltrexone can be helpful for pruritus. Fatigue can be managed with treatment of anemia and optimization of dialysis, but persistent fatigue should prompt screening for depression. Ondansetron, metoclopramide, and haloperidol are effective for uremia-associated nausea. Nondialytic management may be preferable to dialysis initiation in older patients and in those with additional life-limiting illnesses, and may not significantly decrease life expectancy. Delaying dialysis initiation is also an option. Patients with end-stage renal disease should have advance directives, including documentation of situations in which they would no longer want dialysis.

### Pain management in patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease [^112P19vk]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review evaluates current recommendations for pain management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with a specific focus on evidence for opioid analgesia, including the partial agonist, buprenorphine.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence supports the use of physical activity and other nonpharmacologic therapies, either alone or with pharmacological therapies, for pain management. Nonopioid analgesics, including acetaminophen, topical analgesics, gabapentinoids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and TCA may be considered based on pain cause and type, with careful dose considerations in kidney disease. NSAIDs may be used in CKD and ESKD for short durations with careful monitoring. Opioid use should be minimized and reserved for patients who have failed other therapies. Opioids have been associated with increased adverse events in this population, and thus should be used cautiously after risk/benefit discussion with the patient. Opioids that are safer to use in kidney disease include oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine. Buprenorphine appears to be a promising and safer option due to its partial agonism at the mu opioid receptor.

Summary

Pain is poorly managed in patients with kidney disease. Nonpharmacological and nonopioid analgesics should be first-line approaches for pain management. Opioid use should be minimized with careful monitoring and dose adjustment.

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^116dFBej]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

There are two basic scenarios a provider will encounter with the treatment of opioids in CKD patients: inheriting the established opioid patient or initiating chronic opioid therapy. Inherited opioid patients should be assessed for risks versus benefits, with an "escape route" in mind if improvement is suboptimal or aberrancy is observed and confirmed.

Due to the risk of respiratory depression and abuse associated with opioids, patients need to be thoroughly evaluated before starting therapy and closely monitored for the duration of treatment. Therapeutic monitoring is complicated by little to no urine output that precludes the ability to perform urine drug monitoring. This should not allow the patient a "free pass" to avoid opioid compliance monitoring. Instead obtaining random serum blood levels should become the standard of care. The Risk Index for Overdose or Serious Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (RIOSORD) could be used to assess patients for opioid-induced respiratory depression and qualify these patients for "take home naloxone".

An obvious barrier for prescribing opioids in this population is the lack of guidance from major pain management organizations, for nearly all aspects of pain management in patients with CKD, which is directly attributable to the lack of evidence-based treatment guidelines. Recommendations published in 2007 by Murtagh et al suggested fentanyl, methadone, and tramadol as opioids to be used in advanced CKD patients managed without dialysis. Although these opioids have favorable pharmacokinetic profiles when used in those with renal dysfunction, they still carry their own heightened risks. Methadone can prolong the QTc interval and increase risk of torsades de pointes; fentanyl has extremely variable absorption characteristics, which lead to variable serum concentrations that are not easily controlled; and both tramadol and methadone are ubiquitously fraught with toxicities and polymorphic variabilities associated with phase I cytochrome metabolism.

### Opioid management in CKD [^11291DrG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience a high pain and symptom burden. Concurrently, opioid prescription and use in patients with CKD continues to increase, leading to concern for opioid-related risks. Nephrologists increasingly face challenging clinical situations requiring further evaluation and treatment of pain, for which opioid use may be indicated. However, nephrologists are not commonly trained in pain management and may find it difficult to compile the necessary information and tools to effectively assess and treat potentially multidimensional pain. In these situations, they may benefit from using an evidence-based stepwise approach proposed in this article. We address current approaches to opioid use for pain management in CKD and offer a stepwise approach to individualized opioid assessment, focusing on kidney-specific concerns. This includes thorough evaluation of the pain experience, opioid use history, and treatment goals. We subsequently discuss considerations when initiating opioid therapy, strategies to reduce opioid-related risks, and recommended best practices for opioid stewardship in CKD. Using this sequential approach to opioid management, nephrologists can thereby gain a broad overview of key patient considerations, the foundation for understanding implications of opioid use, and a patient-tailored plan for opioid therapy.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^112VG6kk]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background pain control

If the patient is opioid naïve, commence a safe opioid at the lowest effective dose (select an opioid that does not have clinically relevant active metabolites that depend on renal excretion) and titrate to effect. The authors recognise that opioids are not considered appropriate for chronic pain. However, this is an acute pain arising in response to tissue injury and death and therefore, we recommend an opioid as first line therapy.

In opioid naïve patients who are starting an opioid for the first time a starting dose of alfentanil 0.5 mg continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) over 24 h is proposed. This is approximately equivalent to morphine 7.5 mg/24 h by subcutaneous infusion. The authors recommend alfentanil as it is not removed by dialysis, it does not cause toxicity in an ESRD population and it occupies a low volume in syringe drivers. This guidance is drawn from literature on the use of opioids in cancer patients with severe and end stage terminal illness and is supported by the clinical pharmacology literature. Fentanyl by CSCI is an alternative.

Where the patient is not opioid naïve, convert their existing opioid to alfentanil by CSCI. Palliative medicine team can help with conversions if this is outside of the usual scope of practice of the general clinician. Titrate daily to either pain relief or toxicity. Increases in background analgesia are usually of the order of 30–50% every 24 h having checked for any signs or symptoms of opioid neurotoxicity. Symptoms of neurotoxicity include troublesome confusion or cognitive slowing, misperceptions or visual hallucinations. If neurotoxicity occurs reduce the dose of opioids by 30% and add adjuvant analgesics e.g. gabapentinoid.

Thirty percentage of patients will experience nausea for 3–5 days on starting an opioid. Ensure that an antiemetic is available for use as and when needed e.g. metoclopramide 10 mg per oral (PO) or subcutaneously (SC) three times a day. Patients will experience constipation and need to be prescribed a regular daily laxative. Senna 7.5 mg twice a day is recommended as a starting dose.

### Narcotic use for acute postoperative pain management in mohs micrographic surgery patients with end stage renal disease: a review of the literature [^1152yhTt]. Dermatologic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncontrolled acute postoperative pain presents a significant management challenge when opioids are used in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Currently, there is a lack of quality pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data regarding opioid medication use in ESRD patients to optimize safe and effective management.

Objective

To review the published literature on pharmacologic evidence for and against the use of opioid medications for acute postoperative pain following Mohs micrographic surgery in ESRD patients.

Methods

A search of PubMed was conducted to identify articles on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of opioid pain medications in ESRD patients through March 1, 2020.

Results

Seventy-five articles were reviewed. Limited data exist on opioids safe for use in ESRD and are mostly confined to small case series. Studies suggest tramadol and hydromorphone could be considered when indicated. Methadone may be a safe option, but should be reserved for treatment coordinated by a trained pain subspecialist.

Conclusion

Randomized clinical trials are lacking. Studies that are available are not sufficient to perform a quantitative methodologic approach. Evidence supports the judicious use of postoperative opioid medications in ESRD patients at the lowest possible dose to achieve clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^111EHeVq]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Full-agonist opioids in CKD — The 2022 VA/DoD CPG for the Use of Opioids in the Management of Chronic Pain noted the evidence of ill effects of long-term full agonist opioid use, including opioid use disorder (OUD), overdose, and death, and concurs with CDC guidance that opioids should not be considered routine therapy for chronic pain outside of active cancer, palliative, and end-of-life care. The guideline recommends against the initiation of opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain, particularly in younger patients; in CKD, observational studies associate full-agonist opioid use with kidney failure progression, hospitalization, and mortality. Non-pharmacologic options and optimization of non-opioid analgesics should usually be considered prior to opioid prescribing, although closely monitored opioid therapy may be warranted in select patients after careful consideration of risks and benefits. When initiating opioids, a short duration prescription with reevaluation at 30 days or sooner to assess improvements in pain and functional status and adverse effects, is recommended, and the lowest effective dose of opioids as indicated by patient-specific risks and benefits is recommended.

### NSAIDs in CKD: are they safe? [^1137WjKP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The management of pain in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging for many reasons. These patients have increased susceptibility to adverse drug effects due to altered drug metabolism and excretion, and there are limited safety data for use in this population despite a high pain burden. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been regarded as dangerous for use in patients with CKD because of their risk for nephrotoxicity and thus alternative classes of analgesics, including opioids, have become more commonly used for pain control in this population. Given the well-established risks that opioids and other analgesics pose, further characterization of the risk posed by NSAIDs in patients with CKD is warranted. NSAID use has been associated with acute kidney injury, progressive loss of glomerular filtration rate in CKD, electrolyte derangements, and hypervolemia with worsening of heart failure and hypertension. The risk for these nephrotoxicity syndromes is modified by many comorbid conditions, risk factors, and characteristics of use, and in patients with CKD, the risk differs between levels of glomerular filtration rate. In this review, we offer recommendations for the cautious use of NSAIDs in the CKD population after careful consideration of these risk factors on an individualized basis.

### Clinical pharmacology considerations in pain management in patients with advanced kidney failure [^111ZdH3A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pain is common and poorly managed in patients with advanced CKD, likely due to both under and over prescription of appropriate analgesics. Poorly managed pain contributes to patients' poor quality of life and excessive health care use. There is tremendous variability within and between countries in prescribing patterns of analgesics, suggesting that factors other than patient characteristics account for these differences. This article discusses the pharmacologic management of acute and chronic pain in patients with advanced CKD, and the role analgesics, including opioids, play in the overall approach to pain management.

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^116fYBjp]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

In hemodialysis (HD) patients, the prevalence of chronic pain can be up to 92%. A survey of HD patients found 55% reported a severe pain episode in the previous 24 hours. Furthermore, ~75% of HD patients report inadequate pain management. Despite these shocking statistics there is no universally accepted guideline for the treatment of pain in HD patients. Nevertheless, poorly managed pain in HD patients promulgates psychological disturbances, impaired sleep, decreased dialysis compliance, and an overall decline in quality of life.

Providers may be hesitant to prescribe analgesics to patients on HD due to the significant differences in pharmacokinetics compared with their healthy counterparts. Pharmacokinetic variations of most drugs are generally well studied in "healthy" patients; however, physiochemical attributes in HD patients are fraught with uncertainty.

Due to decreased renal elimination of medications and metabolites, a common assumption in patients with renal disease is that estimated renal function is the main, and sometimes only, factor to consider when making dose adjustments. Although not entirely false, other physiologic changes must be considered when selecting medications and commensurate dosing. Table 1 demonstrates the various changes that occur to absorption, volume of distribution, and elimination that must be accounted for in this patient population.

The dialysis machine itself must also be considered among the many changes that HD patients undergo when selecting pharmacotherapy. Certain characteristics impact the removal of a drug by dialysis, including molecular weight, protein binding, volume of distribution, and water solubility. The least likely drugs to be removed by dialysis are those with large molecular weights that are highly protein bound, that have high volume of distribution, and with poor water solubility. Given the aforementioned complexities of selecting appropriate medications for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the potential for adverse events with inappropriate dosing, it is no wonder why providers are so uncomfortable prescribing analgesic therapy to patients with advanced CKD. Nonpharmacologic approaches should be optimized and used in conjunction with any chronic pain patient. If pharmacotherapy is required for adequate pain management, opioids are frequently thought to be first-line therapy when comparing toxicities to alternatives such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

### Perioperative pharmacologic management of patients with end stage renal disease [^116zVQqV]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of numerous medications used in the perioperative period are altered in patients with end-stage renal disease. Clearance of drugs, or their metabolites, that are normally excreted by the kidney is markedly reduced in ESRD. In addition, patients with ESRD may also have alterations in gastrointestinal absorption, volume of distribution, protein binding, and metabolic clearance of pharmacologic agents. Finally, drug removal may be augmented during dialysis. All of these factors contribute to the need for dose adjustment of medications, including analgesics, anesthetics, neuromuscular blockers, and antimicrobial agents, which may be used in the perioperative management of the ESRD patient.

### When ESKD complicates the management of pain [^113tBmmN]. Seminars in Dialysis (2020). Medium credibility.

Pain is one of the most common symptoms reported by patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and negatively impacts their health-related quality of life (HRQOL), dialysis adherence, healthcare utilization, and mortality. There are a number of patient-related and health system-related barriers that make it very challenging to treat pain in these patients. Moreover, the limited availability of efficacious and safe nonopiate analgesic options has led to over-use of opioids in this population. We propose a framework for pain assessment and tailored treatment using nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches to optimize pain management and opioid use. Additionally, we recommend system-level changes to improve care coordination and pain management in ESKD patients.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^1133xnWv]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Avoid morphine, oxycodone, tramadol or codeine as background analgesia as they can rarely be titrated to effect in this population without opioid-induced neurotoxicity. Once pain is stable, transdermal fentanyl or buprenorphine may be used in place of opioids by continuous subcutaneous infusion. If the lesions heal and pain resolves it is important to reduce the opioids step by step and aim to withdraw them fully.

To address the neuropathic element of pain secondary to calciphylaxis, gabapentin 100 mg after each haemodialysis session or pregabalin 25 mg after each haemodialysis session may be used in conjunction with opioids. If the patient is not on haemodialysis, start with a dose of 100 mg of gabapentin on alternate days or 25 mg of pregabalin on alternate days. Caution is needed as gabapentinoids accumulate in ESRD though they are removed by dialysis.

Discuss the use of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with the nephrology team as they are very effective for the management of the inflammatory aspect of pain secondary to calciphylaxis. If residual renal function is not important, use an oral or parenteral NSAID (e.g. ketorolac) by continuous subcutaneous infusion for pain that is not controlled with the measures outlined above. Cover with a proton pump inhibitor is recommended. In general, NSAIDs are best used at the minimally effective dose and for a short duration but their harms are weighed against their opioid sparing effect.

If background pain remains problematic or dose-limiting toxicity is encountered, consider the addition of methadone as a co-analgesic or rotation to methadone from the current opioid. This step may require hospice inpatient care and should only be undertaken with specialist palliative care guidance.

Breakthrough pain control

Even when background pain control is achieved, the patient may continue to experience spontaneous breakthrough pain. Oxycodone 1–2 mg may be used by oral or by subcutaneous injection on a four hourly to 6 hourly basis. In countries where hydromorphone is available, 0.5 mg of hydromorphone sublingually four hourly is useful.

Opioids versus NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease (CKD) not requiring dialysis — associations with outcomes and utilization: In a prospective cohort followed for a median of 6.8 years, baseline full-agonist opioid and NSAID use were 9.9% and 15.5% respectively; baseline opioid use was associated with increased risk for a kidney disease composite outcome, kidney failure requiring KRT, hospitalization, and death, whereas baseline NSAID use was associated with increased risk for the kidney disease composite outcome and hospitalization, with outcomes not consistent among subgroups, and overall opioid use had a stronger association with adverse effects than NSAIDs. Given benefits and risks, some reviews now recommend considering cautious time-limited use of NSAIDs with consideration of individual risk factors, SDM, and careful monitoring.

SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE AND END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE

Over 1.5 million people with advanced CKD and about 750 000 people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) live in the United States. One-quarter to one-half of patients with CKD experience chronic symptoms such as pain, nausea, anorexia, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression, several of which are approved indications for medical cannabis. In addition, anxiety, depression, and insomnia are the most common psychiatric conditions that people self-treat with cannabis. Evidence supports the use of cannabis in patient populations without CKD for treating several of these symptoms including chronic pain, nausea, and loss of appetite. The rationale for its use in patients with CKD and ESRD has been previously reviewed by myself and others.

Pain prevalence among patients with CKD and ESRD is as high as 50%. Pain attributed to kidney disease occurs from polycystic kidney disease, renal colic from nephrolithiasis, renal osteodystrophy, or uremic neuropathy. Historically, cannabis has been recommended for a wide range of ailments including as a spasmolytic for cases of renal colic and to facilitate the excretion of small kidney stones.

Over 60% of dialysis patients receive at least one opioid prescription annually and approximately 20% of them take prescription opioids chronically. Both short-term and chronic use of prescription opioids are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cannabis could have a therapeutic role in pain management that deserves clinical consideration and further clinical trial investigation. Access to medical cannabis has been associated with decreased opioid prescriptions and dose reductions. The National Academies concluded that substantial evidence exists for the use of cannabis and cannabinoids to treat chronic pain while meta-analyses and systematic reviews of cannabis use, including prescription cannabinoids, have given mixed results for treating chronic pain.

Regarding specific circumstances for opioids for pain, more specifically with respect to patients with renal/hepatic impairment, ASCO 2022 guidelines recommend to consider switching to methadone, if not contraindicated, in patients with renal impairment currently treated with an opioid. Titrate opioids primarily eliminated in the urine, such as fentanyl, oxycodone, and hydromorphone, and obtain frequent monitoring for risk or accumulation of the parent drug or active metabolites. Avoid using morphine, meperidine, codeine, and tramadol in these patients, unless there are no alternatives.

This article reviews the literature pertaining to the metabolism of several of the commonly used opioids, and the known activity of their metabolites. The effect of renal failure on the pharmacokinetics of these drugs and metabolites is then reviewed. Finally, the effect of renal dialysis on opioid drugs and metabolites is reviewed. Based on the review, it is recommended that morphine and codeine are avoided in renal failure/dialysis patients; hydromorphone or oxycodone are used with caution and close monitoring; and that methadone and fentanyl/sufentanil appear to be safe to use. Note is made that the "safe" drugs in renal failure are also the least dialyzable.

Data Evaluation and Discussion

Opioids for Cancer Pain

Prior to evaluating best practices for interventional methods of pain relief in the cancer patient it is valuable to review the current evidence for commonly used non-invasive options.

As pain can be moderate to severe in up to 50% of all individuals with cancer, opioids are commonly used in this patient population. The WHO developed a three step "Ladder" for treatment of cancer pain that recommends non-opioid medications first, followed by mild opioids, and lastly by strong opioids until the patient has achieved pain control. Adjuvant medications may be initiated at any step in the treatment process. Methadone has numerous clinical and pharmacological considerations differentiating it from other opioids and is addressed separately below.

Opioid agent selection should be individualized to account for the variance in pain presentations and co-existing medical comorbidities. Morphine and codeine should be avoided in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD); hydromorphone or oxycodone can be used with caution, while methadone and fentanyl appear to be safe to use. Similarly, liver function plays a key role in the activation, transformation, and metabolism of opioid medications. Opioid selection and dosing schedule should be carefully reviewed in patients with liver dysfunction. Methadone, meperidine, and codeine should be avoided in patients with liver dysfunction, while dose adjustments might be required with morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, and tramadol. Certain long-acting opioids with known immunosuppressive properties (ie, morphine, fentanyl, methadone) have been found to have increased incidence of infections compared to those without immunosuppressive properties (ie, oxycodone, oxymorphone, tramadol), and this must be carefully considered given the cancer-induced immunocompromised state in this patient population. Ultimately, the choice of opioid might be limited by the insurance coverage. Codeine, morphine, fentanyl, and methadone are the opioids listed on the WHO essential drug list and might be more accessible compared to some of the newer opioids, such as buprenorphine.

### Opioid management in older adults with chronic kidney disease: a review [^112oAEvE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain, a common comorbidity of chronic kidney disease, is consistently under-recognized and difficult to treat in older adults with nondialysis chronic kidney disease. Given the decreased kidney function associated with aging and chronic kidney disease, these patients are at increased risk for drug accumulation and adverse events. Emerging research has demonstrated the efficacy of opioids in chronic kidney disease patients, but research specifically focusing on older, nondialysis chronic kidney disease patients is scarce. The primary objective of this review is to determine which oral and transdermal opioids are the safest for older, nondialysis chronic kidney disease patients. We discuss the limited existing evidence on opioid prescription in older, nondialysis chronic kidney disease patients and provide recommendations for the management of oral and transdermal opioids in this patient population. Specifically, transdermal buprenorphine, transdermal fentanyl, and oral hydromorphone are the most tolerable opioids in these patients; hydrocodone, oxycodone, and methadone are useful but require careful monitoring; and tramadol, codeine, morphine, and meperidine should be avoided due to risk of accumulation and adverse events. Because older adults with nondialysis chronic kidney disease are at increased risk for adverse events, vigilant monitoring of opioid prescription is critical. Lastly, collaboration among an interprofessional clinical team can ensure safe prescription of opioids in older adults with nondialysis chronic kidney disease.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^111jYsuo]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pain is one of most common symptoms experienced by patients with kidney disease. More than 70% of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) report experiencing pain. Pain has been associated with lower quality of life, high symptom burden, and greater risk of developing kidney disease, its progression, and mortality. Thus, management of pain is a vital component of comprehensive care for patients with CKD.

The already high medication burden makes pain management even more complex in patients with CKD. There are no well-established guidelines for pain management specific to those individuals with kidney disease. Special precautions are needed to manage treatment of patients with reduced kidney function, who may be more prone to experiencing drug toxic effects, adverse effects, greater dose adjustment requirements, and drug interactions. Opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly used analgesics. Opioids may have extended half-life in patients with advanced CKD, with substantial effects on the central nervous system, resulting in respiratory depression, hypotension, and addiction. Long-term opioid use is a risk factor for opioid abuse and dependence. Use of NSAIDs in patients with CKD may result in nephrotoxicity, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, hypertension, and other complications. Therefore, patients with CKD may be especially at risk of receiving suboptimal pain control and inappropriate use of prescription analgesics.

The opioid epidemic has recently received considerable attention from clinicians, policy makers, and the public. However, to our knowledge, few studies have assessed use of analgesics and outcomes in patients with reduced kidney function, particularly with regard to the long-term effects. The present study sought first to examine trends from 2006 to 2015 in the use of opioids and prescription NSAIDs among older (age ≥ 65 years) patients with CKD in the US, and then to explore factors associated with opioid and NSAID use, as well as outcomes associated with their use, including development of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and death. We hypothesized that prescription analgesic use would be higher in patients with CKD compared with the general population. Furthermore, we postulated that use of prescription NSAIDs would be associated with more rapid kidney disease progression to ESKD and opioid use with both higher mortality and advanced-stage or progressive kidney disease.

Conclusion

In conclusion, there is wide variation in the current management of pain in calciphylaxis, amongst renal and palliative care physicians. The rarity of the condition and severity of pain are particularly challenging for non-pain specialists who have a tendency to revert to familiar drugs such as opioids. Moreover, there are no published guidelines or recommendations to support clinicians with decision-making.

### Analgesic use and associated adverse events in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ELWoL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Treating pain in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging because of altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with an increased risk of toxicity and drug adverse events in this population. The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to assess the prevalence of analgesic use and establish the risk of analgesics-related adverse events, in patients with CKD.

Methods

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL were searched until January 2021. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression were conducted to pool and summarise prevalence data and measures of association between analgesic use and adverse events.

Results

Sixty-two studies relevant to the prevalence of analgesic use and 33 to analgesic-related adverse events were included, combining data on 2.3 and 3 million individuals, respectively. Pooled analyses found that 41% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35–48) of the CKD population regularly use analgesia. The annual period prevalence was estimated at 50% for opioids and 21% for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Overall, 20% and 7% of patients with CKD are on chronic opioid or NSAID therapy, respectively. Opioid use was associated with an increased risk of death (1.61; 95% CI, 1.12–2.31; n = 7, I² = 91%), hospitalisation (1.38; 95% CI, 1.32–1.45; n = 2, I² = 0%), and fractures (1.51; 95% CI, 1.16–1.96; n = 3, I² = 54%).

Conclusion

High levels of analgesic consumption and related serious adverse outcomes were found in patients with CKD. Consideration needs to be given to how these patients are assessed and managed in order to minimise harms and improve outcomes.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^113S4ncv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Methadone — initiation, dosing principles, and monitoring: Methadone should be initiated and adjusted by, or in consultation with, a practitioner who has the relevant knowledge and expertise; if a provider with clinical experience is not available, then another long-acting opioid may be used until such consultation is obtained. Dose titration should occur after at least 5–7 days on a designated dose (in the large majority of cases), and careful consideration must be given to potential drug interactions and to the potential for QT prolongation. Methadone is considered to be safe in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment but should be used with caution in end-stage disease cases of these conditions. There are a number of methods available that use conversion ratios to initiate or titrate methadone; no single method is considered superior to others, and titration should be based on patient response and not solely based on equianalgesic dosing tables. Monitoring ECG for QTc interval prolongation is recommended based upon certain clinical scenarios.

### Opioid use in chronic pain patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review [^115E2qRd]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the prevalence of chronic pain and opioid management among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Design

Systematic review.

Methods

A systematic search was performed, including citations from 1960 to May 2015. The review highlights methodological quality assessment of the selected studies; prevalence of pain; type, dose, and reason for opioid use; effectiveness of pain control and associated adverse effects of opioids in CKD patients.

Results

Twelve of 131 articles met inclusion criteria. There were no randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluable, and 12 were observational studies. Out of 12 studies, four were of high quality, six were of moderate quality, and the remaining two were low-quality studies. The studies were from different countries with sample size ranging from 10 to 12,782. Several studies showed a high prevalence of chronic uncontrolled pain. The effectiveness of different categories of opioids, dose, duration, and commonly prescribed opioids varied across studies.

Conclusions

Based on a systematic review of the current literature, there is fair evidence for the high prevalence of chronic pain among patients with CKD, which is not being effectively managed, probably due to underprescription of analgesics or opioids in the CKD population. Clinicians are in need of additional and well-designed randomized control trials that focus on the indications for opioid therapy, appropriate opioid doses and dosing intervals, outcomes with adequacy of symptom control, and reporting on the incidence of adverse side effects.

### Opioids for chronic pain management in patients with dialysis-dependent kidney failure [^115GaDbJ]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

Chronic pain is highly prevalent among adults treated with maintenance haemodialysis (HD) and has profound negative effects. Over four decades, research has demonstrated that 50–80% of adult patients treated with HD report having pain. Half of patients with HD-dependent kidney failure (HDKF) have chronic moderate-to-severe pain, which is similar to the burden of pain in patients with cancer. However, pain management in patients with HDKF is often ineffective as most patients report that their pain is inadequately treated. Opioid analgesics are prescribed more frequently for patients receiving HD than for individuals in the general population with chronic pain, and are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and health-care resource use. Furthermore, current opioid prescribing patterns are frequently inconsistent with guideline-recommended care. Evidence for the effectiveness of opioids in pain management in general, and in patients with HDKF specifically, is lacking. Nonetheless, long-term opioid therapy has a role in the treatment of some patients when used selectively, carefully and combined with an ongoing assessment of risks and benefits. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the use of opioid therapy in patients with HDKF and chronic pain, including a discussion of buprenorphine, which has potential as an analgesic option for patients receiving HD owing to its unique pharmacological properties.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^115heYoE]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that there has been substantial use of opioids and prescription NSAIDs among older patients with CKD in the US with a clear increasing trend until recently, with early suggestion of decreasing use, perhaps due to the recent heightened awareness of the opioid epidemic in the US. Clinicians must continue evaluating benefits and risks of using opioids and NSAIDs in this and other patient populations. Specifically, clear clinical guidelines for chronic pain management among patients aged 65 years and older with CKD may be warranted to address potentially suboptimal pain management in this patient population.

### Opioid prescription, morbidity, and mortality in United States dialysis patients [^114o2WPT]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Aggressive pain treatment was advocated for ESRD patients, but new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend cautious opioid prescription. Little is known regarding outcomes associated with ESRD opioid prescription. We assessed opioid prescriptions and associations between opioid prescription and dose and patient outcomes using 2006–2010 US Renal Data System information in patients on maintenance dialysis with Medicare Part A, B, and D coverage in each study year (n = 671,281, of whom 271,285 were unique patients). Opioid prescription was confirmed from Part D prescription claims. In the 2010 prevalent cohort (n = 153,758), we examined associations of opioid prescription with subsequent all-cause death, dialysis discontinuation, and hospitalization controlled for demographics, comorbidity, modality, and residence. Overall, > 60% of dialysis patients had at least one opioid prescription every year. Approximately 20% of patients had a chronic (≥ 90-day supply) opioid prescription each year, in 2010 usually for hydrocodone, oxycodone, or tramadol. In the 2010 cohort, compared with patients without an opioid prescription, patients with short-term (1–89 days) and chronic opioid prescriptions had increased mortality, dialysis discontinuation, and hospitalization. All opioid drugs associated with mortality; most associated with worsened morbidity. Higher opioid doses correlated with death in a monotonically increasing fashion. We conclude that opioid drug prescription is associated with increased risk of death, dialysis discontinuation, and hospitalization in dialysis patients. Causal relationships cannot be inferred, and opioid prescription may be an illness marker. Efforts to treat pain effectively in patients on dialysis yet decrease opioid prescriptions and dose deserve consideration.

End-stage renal disease chronic itch is a frequent symptom that bothers patients with advanced stages of chronic kidney disease. The pathogenesis of the chronic itch symptom is complex and not yet fully understood and includes many metabolic, immunologic, and neurogenic factors. A significant burden of the disease results in decreased quality of life with sleep impairment, depressive symptoms, and increased mortality of affected individuals. No treatment of choice is available; topical therapy (emollients), phototherapy (UV-B), and systemic therapy (antiepileptics, opioid agonists, and antagonists) provide significant relief in varying percentages of patients.

### Intradialytic clearance of opioids: methadone versus hydromorphone [^115LTD5v]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

Opioids are commonly prescribed to patients with chronic pain associated with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. The stability of opioid analgesia during dialysis may vary among different opioids. No studies to date have corroborated this clinical observation by directly comparing plasma concentrations of different opioids during dialysis. We compared changes in peridialysis plasma concentrations of 2 pharmacokinetically distinct opioids, methadone and hydromorphone (HM). Fourteen dialysis patients with chronic pain received either methadone or HM for at least 2 weeks before beginning the study. Blood samples were obtained immediately before, during, and after hemodialysis in 2 separate dialysis sessions, 1 week apart, and were analyzed for opioid concentrations. Methadone plasma concentrations were more stable during hemodialysis compared to HM: the mean percent change of methadone plasma levels was 14.9% ± 8.2% (± SD) compared with 55.1% ± 8.1% in the HM treatment group, a difference of 40.2% (95% confidence interval 17.14 to 63.14). The mean plasma clearance of methadone was 19.9 ± 8.5 mL/min (± SD) compared with 105.7 ± 8.3 mL/min for HM, a difference of 85.7 mL/min (95% confidence interval 61.9 to 109.1). There were no differences between the 2 opioid groups in pain scores, side effect profile, and quality of life. Methadone therapy was not associated with an increased rate of adverse events. If confirmed by larger clinical studies, methadone could be considered as one of the opioids of choice in dialysis patients.

Gabapentinoids in CKD — Gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin) are eliminated solely by the kidneys, and adverse effects and safety signals include dizziness, somnolence, edema, and gait disturbance, with increased falls, fractures and altered mental status among users and highest risk for falls or fractures at doses ≥ 2400 mg/d. Among older patients with eGFR < 60, starting at a higher dose (gabapentin > 300 mg/d or pregabalin > 75 mg/d) was associated with a slightly higher risk (1.9% vs 1.5%) of hospital visit for encephalopathy, fall, fracture or respiratory depression within 30 days; among dialysis patients, gabapentinoids are associated with altered mental status, falls, and fracture, and concomitant use with an opioid was associated with increased risk of death compared to only opioids. Thus, gabapentinoids should be prescribed only when benefits clearly exceed risks, and use of lower doses and avoidance of concurrent administration with opioids or other sedating medications is suggested in patients with CKD or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

Table N-1 — conceptual approach to chronic pain management in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) emphasizes focusing on function, non-pharmacologic options, careful pharmacologic use tailored to kidney function, and selective referral. Opioids are prescribed to patients with CKD/ESKD at rates several-fold higher than the general population (20% CKD, 30% dialysis vs. 4–7% general U.S. Population), and use of opioids engenders its own risks. Focus on function includes to "Emphasize functional outcomes (rather than pain scores) when assessing therapeutic interventions". Address co-occurring conditions by "Treat co-occurring mental health conditions… - pain may improve… " and to "Identify OUD or physiologic opioid dependence and treat with MOUD (e.g., buprenorphine, or referral for methadone)" while encouraging meaningful functional activities. Try non-pharmacologic interventions by "Add psychosocial or behavioral interventions… based on availability and patient preference if self-management strategies are insufficient", and "Consider acupuncture and chiropractic care if available and indicated", with familiarity with local resources. For medications, "Select medications based on risk of nephrotoxicity, side effects, overdose and potential drug interactions", "Adjust dose… using eGFR or using manufacturer's dose guidance", and "Consider starting at lower dose and titrating slowly to mitigate risks"; "Use analgesics judiciously, short-term", "De-prescribe if no benefit is observed in the near-term (e.g., 3 months)", and "Consider patient-directed deprescribing… stabilized (e.g., 9–12 months)". Also "Assess risk of fall and fracture… and use caution when co-prescribing sedating medications". Refer to pain specialists as needed: "Consider referral when there is diagnostic uncertainty… ", "Employ multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary approach… ", and "Offer virtual options… when available".

### Pharmacokinetics of oxycodone / naloxone and its metabolites in patients with end-stage renal disease during and between haemodialysis sessions [^111Gpfsy]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The pharmacokinetics of oxycodone in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis are largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone/naloxone prolonged release and their metabolites in patients with ESRD during and between haemodialysis sessions.

Methods

Single doses of oxycodone/naloxone (5/2.5 or 10/5mg) were administered in nine patients with ESRD using a cross-over design on the day of dialysis and on a day between dialysis sessions. Plasma, dialysate and urine concentrations of oxycodone, naloxone and their metabolites were determined up to 48h post-dosing using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system.

Results

Haemodialysis performed 6–10h after dosing removed ∼10% of the administered dose of oxycodone predominantly as unconjugated oxycodone and noroxycodone or conjugated oxymorphone and noroxymorphone. The haemodialysis clearance of oxycodone based on its recovery in dialysate was (mean ± SD) 8.4 ± 2.1L/h. The geometric mean (coefficient of variation) plasma elimination half-life of oxycodone during the 4-h haemodialysis period was 3.9h (39%) which was significantly shorter than the 5.7h (22%) without haemodialysis. Plasma levels of the active metabolite oxymorphone in its unconjugated form were very low.

Conclusions

Oxycodone is removed during haemodialysis. The pharmacokinetics including the relatively short half-life of oxycodone in patients with ESRD with or without haemodialysis and the absence of unconjugated active metabolites indicate that oxycodone can be used at usual doses in patients requiring dialysis.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen (Oxycodone and acetaminophen) [^116Zrixy]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatic Impairment

In a pharmacokinetic study of oxycodone in patients with end-stage liver disease, oxycodone plasma clearance decreased and the elimination half-life increased.

Because oxycodone is extensively metabolized in the liver, its clearance may decrease in patients with hepatic impairment. Initiate therapy in these patients with a lower than usual dosage of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets and titrate carefully. Monitor closely for adverse events such as respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Renal Impairment

In a study of patients with end stage renal impairment, mean elimination half-life was prolonged in uremic patients due to increased volume of distribution and reduced clearance. Oxycodone should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment.

Because oxycodone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, its clearance may decrease in patients with renal impairment. Initiate therapy with a lower than usual dosage of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets and titrate carefully. Monitor closely for adverse events such as respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

### Alvimopan [^115dfrNu]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Gastrointestinal-Related Adverse Reactions in Opioid-Tolerant Patients

Patients recently exposed to opioids are expected to be more sensitive to the effects of mu-opioid receptor antagonists, such as alvimopan. Since alvimopan acts peripherally, clinical signs and symptoms of increased sensitivity would be related to the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea). Patients receiving more than 3 doses of an opioid within the week prior to surgery were not studied in the postoperative ileus clinical trials. Therefore, if alvimopan is administered to these patients, they should be monitored for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Alvimopan is contraindicated in patients who have taken therapeutic doses of opioids for more than 7 consecutive days immediately prior to taking alvimopan [see Contraindications (4)].

Patients with severe hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of serious adverse reactions (including dose-related serious adverse reactions) because up to 10-fold higher plasma concentrations of alvimopan have been observed in such patients compared with patients with normal hepatic function. Therefore, the use of alvimopan is not recommended in this population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

5.5 End-Stage Renal Disease

No studies have been conducted in patients with end-stage renal disease. Alvimopan is not recommended for use in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

5.6 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Patients with Complete Gastrointestinal Obstruction

No studies have been conducted in patients with complete gastrointestinal obstruction or in patients who have surgery for correction of complete bowel obstruction. Alvimopan is not recommended for use in these patients.

5.7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Pancreatic and Gastric Anastomoses

Alvimopan has not been studied in patients having pancreatic or gastric anastomosis. Therefore, alvimopan is not recommended for use in these patients.

### Association of opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs with outcomes in CKD: findings from the CRIC (chronic renal insufficiency cohort) study [^111WPBbA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Safe analgesic choices are limited in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We conducted a comparative analysis of harm from opioids versus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in CKD.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

3,939 patients with CKD in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study.

Exposures

30-day analgesic use reported at annual visits.

Outcomes

A composite outcome of 50% glomerular filtration rate reduction and kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT), as well as the outcomes of kidney failure requiring KRT, hospitalization, and pre-kidney failure death.

Analytical Approach

Marginal structural models with time-updated exposures.

Results

Participants were followed up for a median of 6.84 years, with 391 (9.9%) and 612 (15.5%) reporting baseline opioid and NSAID use, respectively. Time-updated opioid use was associated with the kidney disease composite outcome, kidney failure with KRT, death (HRs of 1.4 [95% CI, 1.2–1.7], 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1–1.7], and 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2–2.0], respectively), and hospitalization (rate ratio [RR], 1.7; 95% CI, 1.6–1.9) versus opioid nonusers. Similar results were found in an analysis restricted to a subcohort of participants reporting ever using other (nonopioid and non-NSAID) analgesics or tramadol. Time-updated NSAID use was associated with increased risk for the kidney disease composite (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0–1.5) and hospitalization (RR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0–1.3); however, these associations were not significant in the subcohort. The association of NSAID use with the kidney disease composite outcome varied by race, with a significant risk in blacks (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.7). NSAID use was associated with lower risk for kidney failure with KRT in women and individuals with glomerular filtration rate < 45mL/min/1.73m² (HRs of 0.63 [95% CI, 0.45–0.88] and 0.77 [95% CI, 0.59–0.99], respectively).

Limitations

Limited periods of recall of analgesic use and potential confounding by indication.

Conclusions

Opioid use had a stronger association with adverse events than NSAIDs, with the latter's association with kidney disease outcomes limited to specific subgroups, notably those of black race.

### Anesthetic considerations for the patient with renal failure [^116KNxH1]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Patients in end-stage renal disease and chronic liver failure present a number of challenges to the anesthesiologist. They may be chronically ill and debilitated and have the potential for multisystem organ dysfunction. To safely manage these patients we need to understand the benefits and limitations of dialysis and the altered pharmacology of commonly used anesthetic agents and perioperative medications in chronic renal failure.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^116NKYFv]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD CKD — opioid selection and buprenorphine use in chronic pain and opioid use disorder (OUD) emphasizes that concomitant use of other sedating medications should be avoided, and that use of opioids whose metabolites are less dependent on kidney function, such as oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, and buprenorphine, is preferred; patients should be provided with overdose education as well as a prescription for naloxone. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist available in several different formulations (e.g., patch, buccal, sublingual), which has a beneficial effect on pain intensity in the general population; due to its partial agonism, it has lower risk for respiratory sedation and overdose, and it is metabolized in the liver, requires no dose adjustment in CKD, and is not dialyzed. In patients with CKD who have an indication for opioid initiation or are already on full agonist opioids, Buprenorphine may provide a safer alternative for pain management, and sublingual (but not buccal or transdermal) buprenorphine is also indicated for the treatment of OUD; the 2022 VA/DoD CPG for the Use of Opioids in the Management of Chronic Pain suggests the use of buprenorphine instead of full agonist opioids due to lower risk of overdose and misuse, and a waiver is no longer required for prescribing any formulation of buprenorphine.

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen [^116EaQwA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Geriatric Use

Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see WARNINGS].

These drugs are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to evaluate renal function.

Hepatic Impairment

In a pharmacokinetic study of oxycodone in patients with end-stage liver disease, oxycodone plasma clearance decreased and the elimination half-life increased.

Because oxycodone is extensively metabolized in the liver, its clearance may decrease in patients with hepatic impairment. Initiate therapy in these patients with a lower than usual dosage of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets and titrate carefully. Regularly evaluate for adverse events such as respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].

Renal Impairment

In a study of patients with end stage renal impairment, mean elimination half-life was prolonged in uremic patients due to increased volume of distribution and reduced clearance. Oxycodone should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment.

Because oxycodone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, its clearance may decrease in patients with renal impairment. Initiate therapy with a lower than usual dosage of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets and titrate carefully.

ASCO guideline — clinical interpretation for renal impairment notes that in patients with significant renal function impairment, morphine use may result in the accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites such as morphine-3-glucuronide and normorphine, and opioid-induced neurotoxicity; other opioids such as hydromorphone or fentanyl are less likely to result in accumulation of active metabolites in renal failure; methadone can also be a good alternative since it is primarily metabolized in the liver, but it should only be used by experienced clinicians.

### High-dose opioid utilization and mortality among individuals initiating hemodialysis [^111B8TpD]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Individuals undergoing hemodialysis frequently report moderate to severe pain, and receive three-fold more opioid prescriptions than the general United States population. Since 2007 over half of individuals on hemodialysis received at least one opioid prescription. In 2010, almost one-quarter of individuals on dialysis received opioids for 90 or more days. Together, these data suggest high-dose opioid utilization among hemodialysis patients may be common.

Between 1999 and 2011, aggressive marketing of prescription opioids and other forces, converged to drive unprecedented increases in opioid prescribing, addiction and overdose death in the United States. While numerous investigations have examined these matters in the general population, fewer have characterized the impact of the opioid epidemic among individuals with kidney disease, including those on hemodialysis. This is important because individuals with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) may be likely to be prescribed high doses of opioids and those undergoing hemodialysis, in particular, face a disproportionately high risk of opioid-related adverse events. For example, hydrocodone and oxycodone, which are the two most commonly prescribed opioids among adults undergoing hemodialysis, are recommended to be used with caution among patients with renal impairment due to the possible accumulation of parent drug and/or metabolites. We sought to expand upon prior investigations examining the impact of opioid utilization among adults undergoing hemodialysis by accounting for large variations in opioid doses across people and time.

The goals of our study were to: 1) characterize the prevalence of high-dose opioid utilization among individuals undergoing hemodialysis and 2) quantify the relationship between opioid dose and risk of death. A more thorough understanding of what doses of opioids may increase the risk of mortality may assist clinicians, patients and policy-makers in improving pain management and reducing mortality among hemodialysis patients in the United States.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^114hKGGY]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — opioid selection and monitoring in renal or hepatic impairment states that for patients with renal impairment currently treated with an opioid, clinicians may rotate to methadone, if not contraindicated, as this agent is excreted fecally, and that morphine, meperidine, codeine, and tramadol should be avoided unless there are no alternatives; for patients with renal or hepatic impairment who receive opioids, clinicians should perform more frequent clinical observation and opioid dose adjustment.

### Safety of medical therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease [^113SmH8P]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Maintaining patient safety is a necessary step to improve healthcare delivery. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have an increased frequency of adverse safety events largely because of medication errors.

Recent Findings

CKD and ESRD have several features which threaten patient safety. Reduced glomerular filtration rate affects the clearance of many medications and is also associated with several comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and anemia. These comorbidities of CKD often increase the complexity of treatment regimens. Patients with ESRD, requiring dialysis or transplantation, have an even greater potential for adverse safety events because of the reliance on renal replacement modalities and the frequent requirements of polypharmacy and potential drug-drug interactions.

Summary

There is an important need to develop strategies to provide inpatient and outpatient management plans to limit the risk of adverse medication errors across a wide range of educational and socioeconomic backgrounds, and a critical need to develop a uniform set of standards for evaluating patient safety in CKD and ESRD as well as appropriate descriptions of the prototypical safety profiles of patients who have CKD, a kidney transplant, or who are on dialysis.

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen (nalocet) [^114fdBUN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Geriatric Use

Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

### Pharmacokinetic studies in hemodialysis patients [^113DujtK]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Intermittent hemodialysis is the primary supportive therapy for patients with end-stage renal disease, who commonly receive several drugs to treat both their underlying disease and the conditions that arise during long-term hemodialysis therapy. Many of these drugs are dialyzable, and their hemodialytic removal may compromise therapeutic efficacy if appropriate supplementary doses are not given. Emergency hemodialysis may also be life-saving for patients who have received drug overdoses or have ingested toxic substances. Optimal therapy in both these clinical settings is critically dependent on the availability of reliable information from well-designed pharmacokinetic studies.

### Interventions for itch in people with advanced chronic kidney disease [^115mbrE5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Itch in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, often very distressing and associated with depression, reduced quality of life, and increased death. The most common first-line treatment has been the use of antihistamines despite the lack of substantial evidence for its use for uraemic itch. Few recommendations and guidelines exist for treatment.

Objectives

We aimed to determine: 1) the benefits and harms (both absolute and relative) of all topical and systemic interventions for the treatment of uraemic itch, either alone or in combination, when compared with placebo or standard care; and, 2) the dose strength or frequency, stage of kidney disease or method of dialysis used (where applicable) in cases where the effects of these interventions vary depending on co-interventions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 17 December 2019 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with CKD stages 4 or 5 comparing treatments (pharmacological, topical, exposure, dialysis modality) for CKD associated itch to either placebo or other established treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently abstracted study data and assessed study quality. Data were analysed using a random effects meta-analysis design estimating the relative effects of treatment versus placebo. Estimates of the relative effects between treatments are included where possible. For continuous measures of severity of itch up to three months, mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) were used. When reported, adverse effects were tabulated. The certainty of the evidence was estimated using GRADE.

Main Results

Ninety-two RCTs, randomising 4466 participants were included. Fifty-eight studies (3285 participants) provided sufficient data to be meta-analysed. Of these, 30 compared an intervention to a placebo or control. The 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was the dominant instrument utilized for itch reporting and the Duo score was used in a minority of studies. GABA analogues including, gabapentin and pregabalin, reduce itch in patients with CKD (5 studies, 297 participants: 4.95 cm reduction, 95% CI 5.46 to 4.44 lower in VAS compared to placebo; high certainty evidence). Kappa opioid agonists, including nalfurafine also reduced itch in this population (6 studies, 661 participants: 1.05 cm reduction, 95% CI 1.40 to 0.71 lower in VAS compared to placebo; high certainty evidence). Ondansetron had little or no effect on itch scores (3 studies, 183 participants: 0.38 cm reduction, 95% CI 1.04 lower to 0.29 higher in VAS compared to placebo; high certainty evidence). Reduction in the severity of itch was reported with oral montelukast, turmeric, zinc sulfate and topical capsaicin. For all other interventions, the certainty of the evidence was low to moderate, and the interventions had uncertain effects on uraemic pruritus. Six studies have disclosed significant financial support from their respective manufacturers, six were affected by lack of blinding, and 11 studies have 15 participants or less. Older, smaller RCTs often failed to follow intention-to-treat protocols with unexplained dropouts after randomisation. Adverse effects were generally poorly and inconsistently reported across all RCTs. No severe adverse events were reported for any intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

The RCTs of this meta-analysis contain a large array of interventions with a diverse set of comparators. For many interventions, trials are sparse. This served to make informative meta-analysis challenging. Of all treatments for uraemic pruritus, gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) were the most studied and show the greatest reduction in itch scores. Further RCTs, even of the scale of the largest trials included in this review, are unlikely to significantly change this finding. Kappa-opioid agonists (mainly nalfurafine) also may reduce itch, but indirect comparison suggests a much more modest effect in comparison to GABA analogues. Evidence for oral montelukast, turmeric, zinc sulfate, and topical capsaicin also showed an itch score reduction. However, these reductions were reported in small studies, and warrant further investigation. Ondansetron did not reduce itch. It is somewhat unlikely that a further study of ondansetron will change this result.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^115211Cb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — opioid use in renal or hepatic impairment advises that for patients with renal impairment currently treated with an opioid, clinicians may rotate to methadone, if not contraindicated, as this agent is excreted fecally. Opioids primarily eliminated in urine, such as fentanyl, oxycodone, and hydromorphone, should be carefully titrated and frequently monitored for risk or accumulation of the parent drug or active metabolites. Morphine, meperidine, codeine, and tramadol should be avoided in this population, unless there are no alternatives; Type: Informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Strength of recommendation: Strong. For patients with renal or hepatic impairment who receive opioids, clinicians should perform more frequent clinical observation and opioid dose adjustment; Type: Informal consensus, benefits outweigh harms; Strength of recommendation: Strong.

Morphine — all listed formulations — dosing in special populations: Information applies to all formulations of morphine listed. Elderly patients should be used with caution and at lower dose. In renal dysfunction, bioavailability is increased, clearance is decreased, and metabolites M3G and M6G accumulate significantly; reduce dose for CrCl of 30 to < 60 mL/min by 50 to 75%, and for CrCl of 15% to 30% reduce dose by 25% to 50% or avoid use. In hepatic dysfunction, clearance decreases and half-life increases; use carefully in patients with cirrhosis and consider reducing dose or extending dosing interval by 1.5 to 2 times.

Methadone

Methadone is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers with applications to treat pain with nociceptive and neuropathic components. The L isomer (R-methadone) is a Mu/Delta receptor agonist while the D isomer (S-methadone) is a NMDA receptor antagonist and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Methadone has higher intrinsic activity but lower Mu receptor affinity than morphine allowing for pain relief while minimizing related side effects. The NMDA antagonism decreases excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate binding at the NMDA receptor site, leading to reduction of hyperalgesia, neuropathic pain, and depressed opioid receptor functionality.

According to the WHO analgesic ladder, strong opioids are considered the third step in treating adult cancer pain. Methadone is utilized when patients develop opioid tolerance, intolerance to side effects, or allergic reaction to other strong opioids such as morphine. Methadone is excreted through the feces showing benefit in patients with advanced CKD and ESRD. Patients having developed neuropathic pain from cancer treatment or compressive/radiation plexopathy may benefit from the dual nociceptive and neuropathic properties.

Methadone initiation dosing should be 2.5 mg TID in opioid naive patients with dose adjustments of 5 mg/day or less every 5–7 days. Opioid tolerant patients should be converted to an equianalgesic dose (1:2 to 1:20 conversion factor) with maximum starting dose of 30 mg/day and dose adjustment of 10 mg/day or less every 5–7 days. The analgesic half-life is 6–8 hours, so dosing every 6–8 hours is recommended. Common side effects include somnolence, nausea, constipation, and xerostomia, however rarer side effects have been described and include fatal arrhythmia, serotonin syndrome, respiratory depression, pruritus, diaphoresis, and neurotoxicity. Prior to initiation, cardiac arrhythmia risk should be assessed, and a baseline EKG obtained to evaluate for QT prolongation. A QTc between 450 and 500 ms puts the patient at a higher risk for development of torsades de pointes. When QTc > 500 ms, alternative therapy should be considered. Follow-up EKG is recommended 2–4 weeks after methadone initiation. High gastric pH or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use increases methadone absorption, while high urinary pH reduces methadone clearance leading to accumulation despite primarily fecal clearance.

According to a Cochrane review and secondary literature search, there is no evidence comparing methadone to placebo in the cancer population and there is weak evidence (small sample size, limited scope) with comparison to morphine. Studies demonstrate equipotent efficacy in treating mild pain when comparing methadone to morphine or transdermal fentanyl with comparable associated side effects.

### High-dose opioid utilization and mortality among individuals initiating hemodialysis [^114Wr1v5]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In our study of adults initiating hemodialysis in the United States, we found 67% of individuals receive at least one opioid prescription and 11% receive at least 1 day of high-dose opioids within 1 year of hemodialysis initiation. Doses < 60MME per day were not associated with an increased risk of mortality, but high-dose utilization was associated with a 1.63-fold increased the risk of mortality compared to 0MME per day. Our findings demonstrate the importance of minimizing opioid dose and improving the safety of pain management among individuals undergoing hemodialysis. Prescribers and individuals on hemodialysis should carefully weigh the benefits and risks of high-dose opioid treatment and even proceed cautiously with opioid doses as low as 60MME per day.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^116Bs7A1]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Medication management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — Patients with CKD have altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics due to reduced renal elimination of drugs, including reduced filtration, secretion, and kidney metabolism. Bioavailability and non-kidney drug clearance may also be altered, especially in more advanced stages of CKD. Drugs that can be used in CKD should be dose-adjusted based on the degree of residual kidney function; the extent of dose reduction typically depends on the level of kidney function, and some medications may be contraindicated in those with severe kidney dysfunction. Most often, as the data to evaluate the need for dose adjustment in patients with CKD is part of the FDA approval process, recommendations frequently rely primarily on the manufacturer's product labeling.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^112kFuNT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Short-acting opioids — morphine: Initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) is 10 to 30 mg every 4 hr. There is no optimal or maximum dose of morphine; patients on LOT are likely to become tolerant and require doses higher than the usual dosage range to maintain the desired effect. Timing parameters are Analgesic Onset (min): 30, Peak (min): 60, Duration (hr): 3 to 5, and t½ (hr): 2 to 4 in adults. In special populations, for the elderly or debilitated give with extreme caution and use a lower dose; for hepatic dysfunction use carefully in patients with cirrhosis and consider reducing dose or extending dosing interval by 1.5 to 2 times, noting half-life may be doubled (3 to 4 hr) and bioavailability is increased; and for renal dysfunction reduce dose or, if severe renal impairment exists, avoid use. Other considerations include that M6G, an active metabolite, may accumulate in renal impairment, and M3G, a metabolite without analgesic activity, may accumulate in renal impairment and has been implicated in morphine-induced neurotoxicity, hyperalgesia, and allodynia.

### Mortality risk in chronic kidney disease patients transitioning to dialysis: impact of opiate and non-opiate use [^115S4yZo]. American Journal of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Population-based studies show there is a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients suffering from chronic pain. While opiates are frequently prescribed in non-dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) patients, there may be toxic accumulation of metabolites, particularly among those progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We examined the association of opiate versus other analgesic use during the pre-ESRD period with post-ESRD mortality among NDD-CKD patients transitioning to dialysis.

Methods

We examined a national cohort of US Veterans with NDD-CKD who transitioned to dialysis over 2007–14. Among patients who received ≥ 1 prescription(s) in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System within 1 year of transitioning to dialysis, we examined associations of pre-ESRD analgesic status, defined as opiate, gabapentin/pregabalin, other non-opiate analgesic, versus no analgesic use, with post-ESRD mortality using multivariable Cox models.

Results

Among 57,764 patients who met eligibility criteria, pre-ESRD opiate and gabapentin/pregabalin use were each associated with higher post-ESRD mortality (ref: no analgesic use), whereas non-opiate analgesic use was not associated with higher mortality in expanded case-mix analyses: HRs (95% CIs) 1.07 (1.05–1.10), 1.07 (1.01–1.13), and 1.00 (0.94–1.06), respectively. In secondary analyses, increasing frequency of opiate prescriptions exceeding 1 opiate prescription in the 1-year pre-ESRD period was associated with incrementally higher post-ESRD mortality (ref: no analgesic use).

Conclusions

In NDD-CKD patients transitioning to dialysis, pre-ESRD opiate and gabapentin/pregabalin use were associated with higher post-ESRD mortality, whereas non-opiate analgesic use was not associated with death. There was a graded association between increasing frequency of pre-ESRD opiate use and incrementally higher mortality.

### Palliative care and the management of common distressing symptoms in advanced cancer: pain, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue [^111Q3rTu]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

For the pharmacologic management of mild to moderate pain, nonopioid analgesics, such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, remain widely used in clinical practice. Opioids for mild to moderate pain are added at step two of the WHO analgesic ladder. Codeine phosphate and/or tramadol are commonly used, although this is supported by limited evidence. Two recent Cochrane reviews found only weak evidence to support their use, and some authors have suggested bypassing step two of the WHO analgesic ladder and proceeding directly from step one to step three. Opioids, specifically morphine, remain the first-choice analgesic for moderate to severe cancer-related pain. A 2017 review of nine systematic reviews, (incorporating 152 individual studies) examining any opioid for cancer-related pain found that, on average, 19 of 20 patients with cancer with moderate or severe pain who receive opioids and can tolerate them will have their pain reduced to mild or no pain within 14 days. Opioids should be given orally where possible and titrated individually to the lowest effective, tolerable dose. Either immediate- or modified-release preparations can be prescribed regularly, with immediate-release preparations also available as required for breakthrough pain. No evidence of superiority across opioids for moderate to severe pain exists: morphine remains the first-line opioid of choice in international guidance because of its familiarity, availability, and cost. Fentanyl and buprenorphine are recommended in renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30)when morphine is contraindicated. Despite limited evidence, switching between opioid preparations is common practice when the first-line opioid chosen is ineffective or poorly tolerated. Adverse effects from opioid therapy are common and predictable. Constipation, nausea, and vomiting are most commonly reported, and guidelines recommend the use of laxatives with all opioid prescriptions.

### Medical safety in the care of the person with end-stage kidney disease [^114pFEHY]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Much is written about medical safety as it pertains to patients with chronic kidney disease, yet the transition to end-stage kidney disease and processes inherent to the receipt of dialysis present unique safety challenges in this population. Educational efforts in medical safety need to focus on the areas of greatest threat and where intervention can provide the greatest benefit. This study addresses such safety topics in the dialysis population and identifies potential strategies that may aid in harm reduction.

Background

Chronic pain is common, and its management is complex in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but limited data are available on opioid prescribing. We examined opioid prescribing for non-cancer and non-end-of-life care in patients with CKD.

Methods

This was a population-based retrospective cohort study using administrative databases in Ontario, Canada which included adults with CKD defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 from 1 November 2012 to 31 December 2018 and estimated the proportion of opioid prescriptions (type, duration, dose, potentially inappropriate prescribing, etc.) within 1 year of cohort entry. Prescriptions had to precede dialysis, kidney transplant or death.

Results

We included 680445 adults with CKD, and 198 063 (29.1%) were prescribed opioids. Codeine (14.9%) and hydromorphone (7.2%) were the most common opioids. Among opioid users, 24.3% had repeated or long-term use, 26.1% were prescribed high doses and 56.8% were new users. Opioid users were more likely to be female, had cardiac disease or a mental health diagnosis, and had more healthcare visits. The proportions for potentially inappropriate prescribing indicators varied (e.g. 50.1% with eGFR < 30 were prescribed codeine, and 20.6% of opioid users were concurrently prescribed benzodiazepines, while 7.2% with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were prescribed morphine, and 7.0% were received more than one opioid concurrently). Opioid prescriptions declined with time (2013 cohort: 31.1% versus 2018 cohort: 24.5%; p < 0.0001), as did indicators of potentially inappropriate prescribing.

Conclusions

Opioid use was common in patients with CKD. While opioid prescriptions and potentially inappropriate prescribing have declined in recent years, interventions to improve pain management without the use of opioids and education on safer prescribing practices are needed.

2.6	Dosage Modifications in Patients with Moderate to Severe Renal Impairment

Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment, and end-stage renal disease may have higher plasma concentrations than those with normal function. Initiate therapy with one half the initial dose of HYSINGLA ER in these patients and regularly evaluate for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.7	Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of HYSINGLA ER

Do not abruptly discontinue HYSINGLA ER in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.

When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking HYSINGLA ER, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose opioid (including HYSINGLA ER) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen [^111xn1Xz]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets in pediatric patients have not been established.

Geriatric Use

Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see WARNINGS].

These drugs are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function.

Hepatic Impairment

In a pharmacokinetic study of oxycodone in patients with end-stage liver disease, oxycodone plasma clearance decreased and the elimination half-life increased.

Because oxycodone is extensively metabolized in the liver, its clearance may decrease in patients with hepatic impairment. Initiate therapy in these patients with a lower than usual dosage of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets and titrate carefully. Regularly evaluate closely for adverse events such as respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].

Renal Impairment

In a study of patients with end stage renal impairment, mean elimination half-life was prolonged in uremic patients due to increased volume of distribution and reduced clearance. Oxycodone should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment.

Because oxycodone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, its clearance may decrease in patients with renal impairment. Initiate therapy with a lower than usual dosage of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets and titrate carefully. Regularly evaluate closely for adverse events such as respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY)].

Eligibility criteria

The study enrolled adults (≥ 18 years) with ESRD undergoing HD 3 times per week for at least the past 3 months with a dry body weight ≤ 135 kg (i.e. the target post-dialysis weight, as determined by the subject's nephrologist or dialysis unit during screening). Subjects were excluded if they had a history of missed HD sessions due to noncompliance in the past 2 months; were anticipated to receive a kidney transplant during the study; or had serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 2.5x the reference upper limit of normal (ULN), or bilirubin > 4x the ULN at screening.

Assessments

Pharmacokinetics

Blood samples were collected via a peripheral line in the arm opposite to the dosing site at the following time points: dose 1 (day 1) pre-dialysis (i.e. within 5 min prior to starting dialysis); post-dialysis (i.e. within 10 min following the end of dialysis); 0.0833, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 44 (day 3, approximately 10 min prior to starting the second dialysis) hours after dosing; dose 2: 1 sample drawn approximately 44 h after dosing (pre-dialysis on day 5); dose 3: pre- and post-dialysis on day 5 (pre-dose) and at 0.0833, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and approximately 68 (day 8, pre-dialysis) hours after dosing. A final PK sample was drawn post-dialysis on day 8 (approximately 72 h after day 5 dosing).

Safety assessment

Safety, including AEs, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and standard laboratory tests, was monitored throughout the study.

Statistical analyses

The planned sample size (n = 6 for difelikefalin and n = 2 for placebo in each dose cohort) was considered appropriate for a PK and safety study with a dose-escalation design. The safety population consisted of all randomized subjects who received any study drug at any time during the study. Safety data were summarized descriptively with no formal statistical analysis.

### Psychotherapeutic agents in end-stage renal disease [^115CoqSN]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are often affected by many comorbid conditions, including mental health disorders. Psychiatric illness among patients with ESRD has been associated with increased risks for nonadherence, hospitalizations, suicide, and all-cause mortality. We reviewed the pharmacokinetic data available with psychotherapeutic agents, focusing on physiologic data rather than specific dosing recommendations. Unfortunately data regarding the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of psychotherapeutic agents in ESRD remain rather limited. Of the agents available, it appears that the most data in this patient group were found with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines. Given the small number of patients enrolled in many of the studies and the wide inter-individual variability, it was difficult to interpret the significance of results in many instances. A number of agents, such as tricyclic antidepressants, were associated with adverse effects that would be imperative to avoid in patients with ESRD. Psychotherapeutic medications should be started at low doses and titrated carefully, while monitoring the efficacy and safety of each agent.

### Opioid prescribing by multiple providers in Medicare: retrospective observational study of insurance claims [^112brY3w]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Background on the US Medicare program

The US Medicare program is the primary source of healthcare insurance for Americans above the age of 65 and for individuals aged under 65 with specific disabilities and conditions such as end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. In 2012, about 83% of Medicare's 50 million enrollees were above the age of 65 and the remaining younger enrollees had disabilities or specific clinical conditions as above. For each insured beneficiary, Medicare covers the costs of inpatient care through Medicare Part A, the costs of outpatient care through Medicare Part B, and the costs of prescription drug coverage through Medicare Part D. While most Medicare enrollees receive their insurance through traditional Medicare — a system in which healthcare professionals and hospitals bill the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) directly for any care that is provided — about a quarter of Medicare enrollees receive their insurance through Medicare Advantage insurance (otherwise referred to as Part C). Medicare Advantage is a type of Medicare health plan offered by private insurance companies that contract with Medicare to provide beneficiaries with inpatient, outpatient, and prescription drug coverage.

Prescription claims data used in this study

Each year, the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services process more than a billion prescription drug claims for its more than 37 million beneficiaries who receive their prescription drug insurance through the Medicare Part D program. Through an agreement with CMS, we obtained data on the prescription drug claims of a 20% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries who had Part D coverage in 2010. Because not all Medicare beneficiaries obtain their prescription drug coverage through the Part D program — for example, of 50.7 million Medicare beneficiaries in 2012, 37.1 million had Part D coverage — our sample was not representative of Medicare overall but instead representative of the Part D population.

We identified prescription claims corresponding to an opioid drug (complete or partial opioid agonists and combination formulations) according to National Drug Code (see appendix table A); formulations used for antidiarrheal and antitussive purposes were excluded. The most commonly prescribed opioids were hydrocodone with acetaminophen (paracetamol) (42.9% of all claims), oxycodone with acetaminophen (11.6%), tramadol (11.9%), oxycodone (7.4%), morphine sulfate (4.5%), and fentanyl (4.2%). We did not have information on the indication for which the opioid was prescribed.

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride (Opana er) [^115ZJxiJ]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Individualization of Dose

Once therapy is initiated, pain relief and other opioid effects should be frequently assessed. In clinical practice, titration of the total daily OPANA ER dose should be based upon the amount of supplemental opioid utilization, severity of the patient's pain, and the patient's ability to tolerate the opioid. Patients should be titrated to generally mild or no pain with the regular use of no more than two doses of supplemental analgesia, i.e. "rescue", per 24 hours.

If signs of excessive opioid-related adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. If this adjustment leads to inadequate analgesia, a supplemental dose of OPANA, another immediate-release opioid, or a non-opioid analgesic may be administered. Dose adjustments should be made to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioid-related adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are under control, upward titration should continue to an acceptable level of pain control.

During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient and the caregiver/family. Patients and caregivers/family members should be advised of the potential side effects.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Patients with mild hepatic impairment should be started with the lowest dose and titrated slowly while carefully monitoring side effects. OPANA ER is contraindicated in patients with moderate and severe hepatic dysfunction (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).

Patients with Renal Impairment

There are 57% and 65% increases in oxymorphone bioavailability in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS). Accordingly, in patients with creatinine clearance rate less than 50 mL/min, OPANA ER should be started with the lowest dose and titrated slowly while carefully monitoring side effects.

Regarding medical management for cancer pain, more specifically with respect to opioids, dose adjustments, AAHPM/ASCO/HPNA/MASCC/NICSO 2025 guidelines recommend to consider rotating to methadone for patients with renal impairment currently treated with an opioid, if not contraindicated, as this agent is excreted fecally. Carefully titrate and frequently monitor opioids primarily eliminated in urine, such as fentanyl, oxycodone, and hydromorphone, for risk of accumulation of the parent drug or active metabolites. Avoid using morphine, meperidine, codeine, or tramadol in this population unless there are no alternatives.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^112dgYFH]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).
When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.
For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the severity of pain and other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8).
The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). TABLE Morphine milligram equivalent doses for commonly prescribed opioids for pain management Sources: Adapted from Von Korff M, Saunders K, Ray GT, et al. Clin J Pain 2008;24:521–7 and Nielsen S, Degenhardt L, Hoban B, Gisev N. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2016;25:733–7. Abbreviations: mcg/hr = microgram per hour; mg = milligram; MME = morphine milligram equivalent. * Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, tablets containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended-release tablets containing oxycodone 10 mg and taken twice a day would contain a total of 20 mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr. 2) Equianalgesic dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and pharmacokinetics. 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial µ -receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full µ -receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. † Tapentadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists. § Tramadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tramadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists.
If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage and should generally avoid dosage increases when possible.
Many patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to ≥ 50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥ 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.
Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage on the basis of individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^116bgxqN]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest investigation of real-world use of prescription analgesics among older adults with and without CKD in the US, covering 2006 to 2015. Use of analgesics, particularly opioids, was high in the Medicare CKD population, increasing substantially between 2006 and 2013, then stabilizing or decreasing slightly thereafter. A higher proportion of opioid vs prescription NSAID use was found in patients with CKD compared with non-CKD Medicare beneficiaries. As expected, cumulative use of analgesics, both opioids and prescription NSAIDs, decreased with CKD progression. This prescription pattern could be associated with patients with advanced CKD being more susceptible to toxic effects and adverse effects in the setting of reduced kidney function. Additionally, NSAIDs were widely used in earlier stages of CKD while opioids were more frequently used in patients with advanced CKD. This finding may reflect both the variation in severity of pain by CKD stage, as opioids are typically used to treat moderate to severe pain, and avoidance of NSAIDs in patients with more advanced CKD, in whom risk of progression is higher with use of this class of medication owing to the inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on prostaglandin synthesis in the kidneys, with resultant potential for intrakidney ischemia.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^113d2tgD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Short-acting opioids — hydromorphone: Initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) is 2 mg every 4 to 6 hr, and an initial dose of 4 to 8 mg may be given for severe pain. There is no optimal or maximum dose of hydromorphone; patients on LOT are likely to become tolerant and require doses higher than the usual dosage range to maintain the desired effect. Timing parameters are Analgesic Onset (min): 15 to 30, Peak (min): 30 to 60, Duration (hr): 3 to 4, and t½ (hr): 2 to 3. In special populations, for the elderly or debilitated use with caution and start at 25% to 50% of usual dose at the low end of the dosing range, and for hepatic or renal dysfunction reduce initial dose by 25% to 50% of usual dose depending on degree of impairment. Other considerations note women appear to have a 25% higher Cmax than men, and hepatic metabolism via glucuronidation to active metabolites (mainly hydro-morphone 3-glucuronide) can accumulate in renal impairment.

### Impact of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous difelikefalin, a kappa opioid receptor agonist for the treatment of pruritus [^1114R2Sr]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Difelikefalin is a selective kappa opioid receptor agonist that is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease in adults undergoing hemodialysis (HD). In this study, we assessed the pharmacokinetics (PK) of intravenous (IV) difelikefalin in healthy subjects, in non–dialysis-dependent (NDD) subjects with varying stages of kidney disease, and in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing HD.

Methods

The PK and safety of single IV doses of difelikefalin (3.0 mcg/kg) were initially evaluated in NDD subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment compared with matched healthy subjects. Based on those data, the PK and safety of 3 dose levels of IV difelikefalin (0.5, 1.0, or 2.5 mcg/kg) were compared with matched placebo in subjects undergoing HD with each dose administered following dialysis, 3 times over a 1-week treatment period).

Results

Single IV dosing of difelikefalin in NDD subjects (N = 36) with mild renal impairment demonstrated comparable exposure to healthy subjects with normal renal function, while subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment had higher total exposure. NDD subjects with severe renal impairment had higher total exposure compared with those with moderate renal impairment (i.e. exposure in severe NDD > moderate NDD > mild NDD ≈ healthy subjects). Clearance of difelikefalin correspondingly decreased with increasing renal impairment. In the multiple-dose study in subjects with ESRD undergoing HD (N = 19), IV difelikefalin demonstrated dose proportionality and was shown to be mostly cleared by dialysis; steady state was achieved with the second dose on day 3. Safety findings for all subjects were consistent with the known profile of IV difelikefalin.

Conclusions

IV difelikefalin was well tolerated. Similar exposure was observed in NDD subjects with mild renal impairment compared with healthy subjects with normal renal function, with reduced clearance and higher exposure in NDD subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment. Dose proportionality was demonstrated in subjects with ESRD undergoing HD administered IV difelikefalin 3 times per week following dialysis and was shown to be mostly cleared by dialysis.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^115bZfD2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple experts from OWG expressed concern that including specific dosage thresholds in a main recommendation statement would emphasize them as authoritative absolutes and would lead to noncollaborative tapers or other potentially harmful consequences. Experts also noted the lack of a single standard formula for calculating MMEs. However, experts agreed there is a need for thresholds as benchmarks and suggested including them in the supporting text after the main recommendation statement. Experts also agreed with separating recommendations on dosage into a recommendation applying to patients starting opioids and patients already receiving opioids.

When opioids are used for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should start opioids at the lowest possible effective dosage. For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed on the basis of the severity of pain and other clinical factors, such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8). The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). For example, a label for hydrocodone bitartrate (5 mg) and acetaminophen (300 mg) states that the usual adult dosage is one or two tablets every 4–6 hours as needed for pain, and the total daily dosage should not exceed eight tablets. Clinicians should use additional caution when initiating opioids for patients aged ≥ 65 years and patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency because of a potentially smaller therapeutic window between safe dosages and dosages associated with respiratory depression and overdose (see Recommendation 8). Formulations with lower opioid doses (e.g. hydrocodone bitartrate 2.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg) are available and can facilitate dosing when additional caution is needed. Product labeling regarding tolerance includes guidance for patients already taking opioids. In addition to opioids, clinicians should consider cumulative dosages of other medications, such as acetaminophen, that are combined with opioids in many formulations and for which decreased clearance of medications might result in accumulation of medications to toxic levels.

Because there is in-vivo evidence of renal contribution to the elimination of fentanyl transdermal system, renal impairment would be expected to have significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl transdermal system. Avoid the use of fentanyl transdermal system in patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.18) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Morphine — other considerations: Morphine SR is preferred first-line long-acting agent because of similar efficacy to other long-acting opioids, comparable safety profile, provider familiarity with use, and lower cost. The metabolite M6G may accumulate in renal impairment and contribute to excessive opioid effects, and M3G, a metabolite without analgesic activity, may accumulate in renal impairment and has been implicated in morphine-induced neurotoxicity, hyperalgesia, and allodynia.

### Lofexidine [^116m669h]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

- The usual lofexidine tablets dosage are three 0.18 mg tablets taken orally 4 times daily at 5-to 6-hour intervals lofexidine tablets treatment may be continued for up to14 days with dosing guided by symptoms. (2.1)

- Discontinue lofexidine tablets with a gradual dose reduction over 2 to 4 days.(2.1)

- **Hepatic or Renal Impairment**: Dosage adjustments are recommended based on degree of impairment. (2.2, 2.3)

2.1 Dosing Information

The usual lofexidine tablets starting dosage is three 0.18 mg tablets taken orally 4 times daily during the period of peak withdrawal symptoms (generally the first 5 to 7 days following last use of opioid) with dosing guided by symptoms and side effects. There should be 5 to 6 hours between each dose. The total daily dosage of lofexidine tablets should not exceed 2.88 mg (16 tablets) and no single dose should exceed 0.72 mg (4 tablets).

Lofexidine tablets treatment may be continued for up to 14 days with dosing guided by symptoms.

Discontinue lofexidine tablets with a gradual dose reduction over a 2- to 4-day period to mitigate lofexidine tablets withdrawal symptoms (e.g., reducing by 1 tablet per dose every 1 to 2 days) [see Warnings & Precautions (5.5)]. The lofexidine tablets dose should be reduced, held, or discontinued for individuals who demonstrate a greater sensitivity to lofexidine tablets side effects [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Lower doses may be appropriate as opioid withdrawal symptoms wane.

Lofexidine tablets can be administered in the presence or absence of food.

2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Recommended dosage adjustments based on the degree of hepatic impairment are shown in Table 1 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Table 1: Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Patients with Renal Impairment

Recommended dosage adjustments based on the degree of renal impairment are shown in Table 2. Lofexidine tablets may be administered without regard to the timing of dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Things we Do for No reason ™: avoiding methadone for opioid withdrawal [^111wmpiz]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

WHEN HOSPITALISTS SHOULD AVOID OFFERING METHADONE FOR OPIOID WITHDRAWAL

Patient preference should guide opioid withdrawal treatment. Some patients may prefer buprenorphine for withdrawal when they want to continue OUD treatment after discharge given variable geographical availability of methadone and strict methadone regulations requiring frequent OTP visits which makes methadone adherence challenging. Weighing the risks and benefits through shared decision-making can help patients determine the best treatment option.

When the QTc (> 500 ms) is prolonged, hospitalists should replete electrolytes, limit nonessential QTc prolonging medications, reassess the QTc, and discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives to methadone, including buprenorphine and other opioid agonists (e.g. oxycodone, hydromorphone) for opioid withdrawal. Hospitalized patients may have metabolic derangements or require medications that prolong the QTc and these should be addressed and discussed with the patient when selecting opioid withdrawal treatment. In one study, the methadone dose was only weakly associated with QTc prolongation and not associated with cardiac events.

When optimized, methadone should not sedate patients. However, individuals with conditions affecting respiratory drive (e.g. advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or methadone metabolism (e.g. end stage renal disease, end stage liver disease) may not tolerate methadone due to sedation. In these instances, hospitalists should also discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives with patients.

### High-dose opioid utilization and mortality among individuals initiating hemodialysis [^1147uKqe]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

This work highlights the importance of prescribing the minimum necessary dose of opioids for pain management among individuals undergoing hemodialysis, but should not deter providers from aiding patients in achieving adequate pain management. Between 2007 and 2014, almost three-quarters of individuals on hemodialysis in our study received at least one opioid prescription. Despite recent declines in opioid prescribing in the United States, we found the average percentage of days exposed to high-dose utilization increased among adults who received at least one opioid prescription during hemodialysis. Given opioid prescribing among individuals undergoing hemodialysis peaked between 2010 and 2012, the increase in average percentage of days exposed to opioids observed from 2007 through 2014 is likely due to changes in socio-economic status and the growing percentage of individuals initiating hemodialysis who were white, retired, and over 65 years old. Prior work also suggests that between 2006 and 2010, the proportion of all individuals undergoing dialysis who had prescriptions for opioids ≥ 90 days increased from 20.0 to 23.4%. These trends are alarming given oxycodone and hydrocodone, which are recommended to be used with caution or completely avoided in the hemodialysis population, are the two most commonly prescribed opioids among adults receiving hemodialysis. In 2014, HD patients were prescribed 333.9 MME of oxycodone per 100 person-days and 229.2 MME of hydrocodone per 100 person-days.

### Assessment of prescription analgesic use in older adults with and without chronic kidney disease and outcomes [^115Ptt6L]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The substantial geographic variations in overall, long-term, and cumulative use of opioids and NSAIDs may reflect inconsistent treatment strategies across states. States with the highest prevalence of opioid or NSAID use did not necessarily have the longest average cumulative use of these medications. Previous studies also showed geographic variations in opioid use and opioid-related hospitalization and emergency department visits. These geographic variations suggest that each state or county may be facing different issues regarding inappropriate use of prescription analgesics. Considering the epidemic of opioid misuse, overdose, and death, it would be particularly relevant to design local regulations, educate physicians regarding opioid therapies, and raise public awareness about the risks of opioid use.

In our outcomes analyses, opioid use was associated with a higher risk of developing ESKD and death, independent of CKD status, which may be due to opioid users being at high risk of opioid dependence and opioid overdose, with consequent higher hospitalization and mortality. It is possible that people in pain requested or received more opioids. In contrast with opioids, no association was observed between NSAID use (except receiving NSAIDs for 91–180 days) and progression to ESKD, but a significant protective association was observed between receiving NSAIDs and death, with adjustment of other patient-level factors. Previous studies have been inconsistent with regard to the association between NSAIDs and progression to ESKD. Some found that regular consumption of NSAIDs was associated with decreased kidney function. Additionally, the risk of developing ESKD increased with greater cumulative exposure to NSAIDs among those with CKD. However, others have suggested that use of NSAIDs was not associated with decreased kidney function. Use of NSAIDs in CKD requires caution because of their known direct nephrotoxic effects, risk of causing fluid and electrolyte imbalances, hypertension, and other complications. However, effective pain management may relieve pain and related stress and could potentially delay disease progression and mortality. The observed protective association of NSAIDs and outcomes may reflect the benefits of pain relief relative to potential nephrotoxic effects, or it may be the consequence of rational clinical decision-making, such that physicians use NSAIDs for patients with CKD at earlier stages and for those who have low risk of progressing to ESKD regardless of stage, while they choose opioids for patients at later stages of disease and high risk of progression. Our results highlight the need for further investigation of the benefits and risks of choosing NSAIDs vs opioids in pain management.

Buprenorphine TDS — because steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved within 72 hours, buprenorphine TDS dosage may be adjusted every 3 days. It is a potential treatment option for patients with significant renal impairment or those with gastrointestinal structural or functional abnormality that interferes with swallowing or absorption of oral medications.

### Dialysis… [^111q7ARX]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

In the United States, nearly 90% of patients with ESRD are treated with center-based hemodialysis, but many patients are unaware that other options exist. 5, 13 Alternatives include in-home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, which can provide flexibility in frequency and duration of dialysis sessions. Patients who receive targeted education before the initiation of dialysis are more likely to choose peritoneal dialysis. 13–15 |Uncontrolled hypertension| Most patients with ESRD will be treated with hemodialysis, and arteriovenous access is usually preferred. Early referral allows for evaluation and creation of vascular access before dialysis is needed. For patients with stage III to V chronic kidney disease, strategies to preserve peripheral venous access are important. These include avoiding excessive venipuncture, peripherally inserted central venous catheters, and subclavian venous catheters.

Other Considerations VACCINATION Because of immune suppression and increased susceptibility to infection in patients with ESRD, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides specific vaccination recommendations for this population. Routine vaccinations against seasonal influenza and tetanus should be continued in these patients. Additionally, the CDC recommends hepatitis B and pneumococcal vaccination. 3 Potassium excretion by the kidneys is decreased in patients with ESRD, putting them at high risk of hyperkalemia and its complications. 40 Secondary hyperparathyroidism is also common; therefore, serum calcium and phosphate levels should be measured every one to three months, parathyroid hormone levels every three to six months, and alkaline phosphatase levels at least every 12 months.

41 Patients with ESRD should also be assessed for vitamin D deficiency.
41. 43 Although statin therapy can continue during dialysis treatments if already established, initiating statin therapy has not been shown to improve outcomes. 44 Aspirin is likely beneficial for individuals at very high risk of atherosclerotic events. However, there is a lack of conclusive evidence regarding the role of aspirin therapy for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with ESRD. 45, 46.
