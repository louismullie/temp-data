## Question

What proteins appear in the urine in amyloidosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which proteins appear in the urine in amyloidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the dominant amyloidosis subtype driving urinary findings. Then, I should characterize the key urinary protein classes and the best assays to detect them. Next, I will connect each protein pattern to its renal pathophysiology. After that, I should differentiate patterns by AL versus AA amyloidosis. Finally, I will consider measurement pitfalls, prognostic implications, and how guidelines direct monoclonal protein screening in this context [^117MCzUr] [^1127R3UJ] [^114PyRUU].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Most diagnostic algorithms that intersect cardiology and nephrology focus on systemic AL (light-chain) amyloidosis when screening for monoclonal proteins, and they explicitly recommend serum and urine immunofixation plus a serum free light chain assay in any patient with suspected cardiac amyloidosis, which by extension captures the renal AL phenotype that commonly presents with proteinuria; AA amyloidosis also involves the kidney but lacks monoclonal proteins, so the protein pattern differs accordingly [^117MCzUr] [^1127R3UJ] [^115LCrcx] [^114PyRUU].

> Now, I need to characterize the principal proteins detected in urine. First, monoclonal immunoglobulin free light chains (Bence Jones proteins) are the pathogenic precursors in AL; they are best detected by urine immunofixation electrophoresis and quantified/monitored with serum free light chain assays, given the recognized inaccuracies and patient burden of 24-hour urinary light-chain collections; importantly, some patients will have monoclonal protein detected only in urine, reinforcing the need to include urine immunofixation in the workup [^117MCzUr] [^1127R3UJ] [^115LCrcx] [^111NS9x8] [^111CUrUS].

> Hold on, I should also review albumin specifically. Renal involvement in AL frequently targets the glomerulus, producing albumin-predominant proteinuria that can reach nephrotic range; in this setting, the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) correlates closely with 24-hour protein and is generally preferred over uPCR for estimating glomerular proteinuria, especially at lower levels where uPCR performance drops; moreover, in plasma cell dyscrasias, uPCR can be misleading because it does not differentiate albumin from monoclonal light chains, potentially inflating total protein estimates when urinary light chains are abundant [^114igw7F] [^111DFh4e] [^1169RTF2] [^115g1J9w].

> Wait, let me not overlook tubular proteins. Retinol-binding protein (RBP) and other low–molecular-weight proteins rise when proximal tubular reabsorption is impaired; in AL, urinary RBP indexed to creatinine (uRBPCR) reflects proximal tubular dysfunction and independently predicts renal outcomes beyond eGFR, uPCR, and hematologic response, with tissue-level correlations to chronic tubulointerstitial damage on kidney biopsy; mechanistically, this aligns with megalin-mediated endocytosis failure in the proximal tubule [^117VHyU2] [^112jYrFf] [^114mtz8L] [^112nSBJR].

> I will now examine the pathophysiologic basis for each protein class to ensure coherence. Light chains are freely filtered and normally reclaimed by proximal tubules; clonal overproduction and tubulointerstitial injury in AL overwhelm and disrupt reabsorption, increasing urinary free light chains; glomerular amyloid disrupts the size-selective barrier, leading to albumin-dominant proteinuria; and proximal tubular dysfunction from tubular/interstitial amyloid deposition causes increased excretion of low–molecular-weight proteins like RBP despite relatively preserved glomerular function early on [^111sbKZr] [^114igw7F] [^112nSBJR] [^1164urm9].

> Next, I should differentiate protein patterns by amyloidosis type. In AL, all three categories commonly coexist: monoclonal free light chains detectible by urine immunofixation, albumin-predominant glomerular proteinuria quantifiable by uACR, and variable low–molecular-weight proteins indicating proximal tubular involvement; in AA amyloidosis, proteinuria is predominantly albuminuric from glomerular deposition, and monoclonal light chains are absent, though tubular proteins can still rise when tubulointerstitial compartments are involved, consistent with biopsy distributions that are usually glomerular but can include vascular and tubulointerstitial patterns [^114PyRUU] [^1164urm9] [^117UZqHN].

> But wait, what about the best measurement strategy in practice? I should double-check the role of each test. The guidelines are clear that both serum and urine immunofixation plus serum free light chains are required to rule in or out AL in suspected amyloidosis, since a subset has only urinary monoclonal protein; 24-hour urine measurements are cumbersome and often inaccurate for light chains, so pairing serum free light chains with urine immunofixation improves reliability; for quantifying glomerular proteinuria, uACR tracks 24-hour protein well and outperforms uPCR at lower albumin levels; I initially thought uPCR was broadly unreliable in this population, but hold on, that's too absolute — uPCR correlates strongly overall with 24-hour protein and remains useful at higher proteinuria, yet it can mislead when light chains are abundant because it cannot distinguish albumin from monoclonal proteins, which is precisely why uACR is preferred for staging and response when monoclonal proteins are present [^115LCrcx] [^117MCzUr] [^1127R3UJ] [^111NS9x8] [^1169RTF2] [^111DFh4e].

> Let me consider prognostic implications to complete the picture. Severity of albuminuria in renal AL correlates with risk of progression to kidney failure and is used for renal staging and response assessment; reduction in proteinuria with disease-directed therapy tracks with improved renal outcomes; in parallel, elevated uRBPCR identifies proximal tubular injury and independently predicts progression to ESKD beyond traditional markers, supporting its role as an adjunctive prognostic biomarker in AL [^114igw7F] [^117VHyU2] [^111HZuoN].

> Finally, I should confirm that tissue and imaging correlates support these urine patterns. Kidney biopsy series show that most renal amyloid has a glomerular-dominant distribution, consistent with albuminuria magnitudes, while creatinine and eGFR better reflect interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy; nuclear SAP scintigraphy demonstrates that abnormal renal tracer uptake correlates with proteinuria, further aligning tissue burden with urinary protein signatures in systemic amyloidosis [^1164urm9] [^111SybYh] [^117UZqHN].

In amyloidosis, the key urinary proteins excreted are **immunoglobulin light chains (Bence Jones proteins)** [^111CUrUS], **albumin** [^114PyRUU], and **low-molecular-weight proteins** such as β2-microglobulin and retinol-binding protein [^114mtz8L], reflecting combined glomerular and tubular injury [^111sbKZr] [^114igw7F]. Light chains are most prominent in **AL amyloidosis** [^111CUrUS], while **albuminuria** dominates in AA and other types [^116p5cMV]; tubular proteins indicate proximal tubular dysfunction and correlate with renal outcomes [^114mtz8L] [^117VHyU2]. Urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation [^1127R3UJ] and **serum free light chain assays** [^115LCrcx] are essential for detecting and monitoring these proteins [^117MCzUr].

---

## Immunoglobulin light chains (Bence Jones proteins)

- **Definition**: Free kappa or lambda light chains produced by clonal plasma cells, filtered at the glomerulus, and variably reabsorbed; excess overwhelms reabsorption and appears in urine [^111sbKZr].

- **Clinical significance**: Hallmark of AL amyloidosis [^111CUrUS]; their detection confirms monoclonal protein production and supports diagnosis [^115LCrcx].

- **Detection methods**: Urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation (UPEP/UIFE) [^1127R3UJ] and serum free light chain (sFLC) assays [^117MCzUr] are recommended in suspected amyloidosis.

---

## Albumin

- **Definition**: Major plasma protein; glomerular injury from amyloid deposits increases filtration and causes albuminuria [^111sbKZr].

- **Clinical significance**: Predominant in AA [^114PyRUU] and other non-AL types; nephrotic-range proteinuria is common in renal amyloidosis [^114igw7F].

- **Detection methods**: Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) [^111DFh4e] and 24-hour urine collections [^114byk5C] quantify albuminuria and guide staging [^114igw7F].

---

## Low-molecular-weight proteins

- **Definition**: Small proteins (e.g. β2-microglobulin, retinol-binding protein) normally reabsorbed by proximal tubules; tubular injury increases their excretion [^112nSBJR].

- **Clinical significance**: Indicate proximal tubular dysfunction and correlate with renal outcomes in AL amyloidosis [^114mtz8L] [^117VHyU2].

- **Detection methods**: Specific immunoassays (e.g. ELISA) [^114mtz8L] quantify these proteins in urine [^117VHyU2].

## Clinical implications of urinary protein excretion in amyloidosis

Urinary protein excretion in amyloidosis informs **diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring** because the pattern and quantity of proteins help distinguish subtypes and guide further testing [^1127R3UJ] [^111sbKZr] [^114PyRUU]. The degree of proteinuria — particularly albuminuria — predicts renal outcomes and progression to ESRD [^114igw7F] [^117VHyU2]. Serial measurement of these urinary proteins helps assess treatment response [^111CUrUS] and disease progression [^114igw7F].

## Summary table of urinary proteins in amyloidosis

| **Protein type** | **Clinical significance** | **Detection methods** |
|-|-|-|
| Immunoglobulin light chains (Bence Jones proteins) | Hallmark of AL amyloidosis; indicates monoclonal protein production | UPEP/UIFE, sFLC assays |
| Albumin | Predominant in AA and other non-AL types; indicates glomerular injury | uACR, 24-hour urine collection |

### Urinary retinol binding protein predicts renal outcome in systemic immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis [^114mtz8L]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Renal risk stratification in systemic immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary protein creatinine ratio (uPCR), the latter attributed to glomerular dysfunction, with proximal tubular dysfunction (PTD) little studied. Urinary retinol binding protein 4 (uRBP), a low molecular weight tubular protein and highly sensitive marker of PTD, was prospectively measured in 285 newly diagnosed, untreated patients with systemic AL amyloidosis between August 2017 to August 2018. At diagnosis, the uRBP/creatinine ratio (uRBPCR) correlated with serum creatinine (r = 0.618, P < 0.001), uPCR (r = 0.774, P < 0.001), and eGFR (r = -0.537, P < 0.001). Patients with elevated uRBPCR at diagnosis were more likely to progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (uRBPCR > 130 nmol/mmol) compared to patients with baseline eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m² [HR 4.11, (95% CI 1.45–11.65); P = 0.008] and those who failed to achieve a deep haematological response to chemotherapy within 3 months of diagnosis [HR 6.72, (95% CI 1.83–24.74); P = 0.004], and also predicted renal progression [HR 1.91, (95% CI 1.18–3.07); P = 0.008]. Elevated uRBPCR indicates PTD and predicts renal outcomes independently of eGFR, uPCR, and clonal response in systemic AL amyloidosis. The role of uRBPCR as a novel prognostic biomarker merits further study, particularly in monoclonal gammopathies of renal significance.

### Correlation between urine ACR and 24-h proteinuria in a real-world cohort of systemic AL amyloidosis patients [^114igw7F]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare clinical entity, with an estimated incidence of 10–14 cases per million people in the United States. The pathogenic immunoglobulin light chain in systemic AL amyloidosis is most often produced by a small clonal plasma cell population, and misfolded light chains aggregate and deposit in organs as amyloid fibrils, leading to organ toxicity and dysfunction.

Renal AL amyloid deposition predominantly involves the glomerulus; therefore, patients typically develop albuminuria, renal insufficiency, or nephrotic syndrome. Renal involvement is seen in approximately 50–70% of systemic AL amyloid patients at diagnosis and is defined as 24-h urine protein (24hUP) greater than 0.5 grams per day, predominantly albumin. In patients with renal AL amyloidosis, the degree of renal insufficiency and proteinuria at diagnosis is predictive of the risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis.

- **Proteinuria reduction**: The reduction in proteinuria with plasma cell-directed therapy has also been shown to correlate with prevention of end-stage kidney disease and improved survival in systemic AL amyloidosis patients. Therefore, the assessment of proteinuria in amyloidosis remains clinically relevant for prognostication at diagnosis and for monitoring disease response.

Currently, the gold standard for assessment of proteinuria is a timed 24-hour urine collection that measures the total protein. However, a 24-hour protein (24hUP) collection is cumbersome for patients and is unreliable due to under or over-collection and laboratory processing methods.

### Free immunoglobulin light-chain serum levels in the follow-up of patients with monoclonal gammopathies: Correlation with 24-hr urinary light-chain excretion [^111CUrUS]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

In patients with light-chain myeloma or primary AL-amyloidosis, 24-hr light-chain excretion in the urine is considered an essential marker of the tumor mass. However, 24-hr urine collection and analysis may be cumbersome and prone to inaccuracy. Recently, a sensitive immunonephelometric assay for immunoglobulin free light chains (FLC) in the serum was developed. We sought to determine whether the serum level of monoclonal FLC could be used as an indicator of urinary excretion and disease evolution.

Seven patients with light-chain myeloma and AL-amyloidosis were studied, all of whom had a monoclonal FLC that could be detected in the urine using standard methods. In four of these patients, follow-up revealed a remarkable correlation between FLC serum levels and daily urinary excretions. The ratio of serum level to urinary light-chain excretion, although stable in a given patient, was extremely variable between patients. In the three remaining cases, featuring hardly measurable amounts of light chain in the urine, the serum FLC assay proved sensitive enough for correlation with clinical events. Thus, immunonephelometric measurement of serum FLCs is a reliable method for the follow-up of patients with light-chain secreting monoclonal gammopathies.

### Correlation between urine ACR and 24-h proteinuria in a real-world cohort of systemic AL amyloidosis patients [^111DFh4e]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Given the cumbersome nature of 24-hour urine protein (24hUP) collections, both the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) and the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR) have been studied to estimate proteinuria in amyloidosis patients. This is the first large, real-world study showing that uACR correlates strongly with a 24hUP in patients both at diagnosis and during follow-up. Although the uPCR was found to correlate with 24hUP in a small study of patients with various subtypes of amyloidosis, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization guidelines recommend uACR over uPCR for estimating proteinuria, given that uACR is more sensitive at detecting glomerular pathology, especially at lower concentrations of albuminuria. This was demonstrated in our study, as the correlation between uPCR and 24hUP decreased at lower concentrations of proteinuria.

We also showed that the uPCR cutoffs to predict proteinuria > 500 mg/day varied based on the time of sample collection, further limiting the utility of this test. In plasma cell dyscrasias, such as amyloidosis, the uPCR may also be misleading because it does not differentiate albuminuria from monoclonal protein excretion. In systemic AL amyloidosis, assessing albuminuria is relevant for evaluating renal response to therapy. Therefore, in patients with concomitant urinary monoclonal protein excretion, which we would expect to be highest prior to therapy, it is possible that uPCR measurements may overestimate proteinuria. Although this could not be assessed in this study due to the small number of patients with a uPCR and uACR measurement at diagnosis.

### Significant association between renal function and amyloid-positive area in renal biopsy specimens in AL amyloidosis [^111SybYh]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

The kidney is a major target organ for systemic amyloidosis, which often affects the kidney, resulting in conditions such as proteinuria and elevated serum creatinine (Cr). The correlation between the amount of amyloid deposits and clinical parameters is not completely understood. The aim of this study was to clarify the correlation between the amyloid area in all renal biopsy specimens and clinical parameters.

- **Methods**: Fifty-eight patients with an established diagnosis of AL amyloidosis participated in the study, all of whom showed amyloid deposits in renal biopsies. We retrospectively investigated the correlation between clinical data and the amyloid-occupied area in whole renal biopsy specimens.

- **Results**: The area occupied by amyloid was less than 10% in 57 of the 58 patients and was under 2% in 40 patients. For statistical analyses, the %amyloid-positive areas were transformed to common logarithmic values (Log10%amyloid). Cr showed a significant correlation with Log10%amyloid, while the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) showed a significant negative correlation. Patient age, creatinine clearance (Ccr), blood urea nitrogen, and urinary protein were not significantly correlated with Log10%amyloid. The correlation with other clinical factors, such as sex and serum concentrations of total protein, albumin, immunoglobulins, and complements, was evaluated. None of these factors significantly correlated with Log10%amyloid. According to sex- and age-adjusted multiple linear regression analysis, Log10%amyloid had a significant positive association with Cr and a significant negative association with eGFR.

- **Conclusion**: There is a significant association between the renal function parameters Cr and eGFR and the amyloid-positive area in renal biopsy specimens in patients with AL amyloidosis.

### Percentage of urinary albumin excretion and serum-free light-chain reduction are important determinants of renal response in myeloma patients with moderate to severe renal impairment [^112PDSW9]. Blood Cancer Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Univariate and multivariate analyses showed the significance of urinary albumin excretion ≥ 25% as a negative predictive factor for renal recovery. Percentages of serum FLC reduction ≥ 80% on day 12 and ≥ 95% on day 21 were significant in univariate analysis, but only the latter remained significant in multivariate analysis. This study validates the observation reported by Leung et al, who found that urinary albumin excretion ≥ 25% is a negative predictor for biopsy-proven cast nephropathy with a sensitivity of 0.98, specificity of 0.94, and negative predictive value of 0.99.

Early reduction of serum iFLC is associated with renal recovery in MM patients with RI. When RI is severe, serum levels of iFLC remain high even with effective chemotherapy due to reduced renal clearance, which may further aggravate renal function. Plasma exchange and high cutoff dialysis have been examined with mixed efficacy. However, using urinary albumin excretion patterns, we could further stratify MM patients with RI who may benefit from an aggressive FLC reduction strategy. We speculate that RI patients with low albumin excretion would especially benefit from early induction of aggressive chemotherapy combined with direct removal of FLC by targeting FLC levels.

Although the positive prognostic value of urine albumin < 25% on renal response appeared robust, it is important to note that this was a retrospective study and patients were treated heterogeneously. Additionally, we did not stratify the patients except for eGFR.

### Excretion of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy infectivity in urine [^114k1D7x]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Two studies of scrapie in naturally and experimentally infected sheep reported PrP^d depositions in the renal papillae and in the intraepithelial cortex, medulla, and papillae. Similar to our findings, both studies indicated that not all scrapie tissues examined were positive for PrP^d. In chronic wasting disease, PrP^d staining was uniquely localized in the ectopic lymphoid follicle of the kidney of a whitetail deer. All studies indicated either no changes or mild to no inflammatory changes of the kidney. Thus, our histologic and immunohistochemical results for scrapie-infected hamsters are consistent with results found for sheep and deer and suggest that under normal conditions, TSE diseases do not have concomitant inflammatory changes in the kidney.

That urine titer is similar to that of plasma suggests that urine infectivity may originate from blood, but how the infectivity would be excreted is not clear. In general, proteins greater than 40 kDa are not excreted, and smaller proteins crossing the glomeruli are reabsorbed in the renal tubule and returned to the blood. If TSE infectivity is particulate (greater than 40 kDa), its presence in urine might indicate abnormalities in renal filtration, perhaps related to the accumulation of PrP^d in the collecting tubules of the medulla. The accumulation of immunoglobulins in the urine of TSE-infected hamsters and humans may also indicate malfunction of the urinary system. Excretion of a small C-terminal fragment of the normal cellular form of the prion protein in urine of infected and noninfected animals has been reported, but PrP^res or PrP^d forms ca…

### Characteristics of urinary and serum soluble Klotho protein in patients with different degrees of chronic kidney disease [^113UyrHL]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Klotho is a single-pass transmembrane protein, which appears to be implicated in aging. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the relationship between the soluble Klotho level and renal function in patients with various degrees of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

- **Methods**: The levels of soluble Klotho in the serum and urine obtained from one hundred thirty-one CKD patients were determined by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system.

- **Results**: The amount of urinary excreted Klotho during the 24-hour period ranged from 1.6 to 5178 ng/day (median 427 ng/day; interquartile range [IR] 56.8–1293.1), and the serum Klotho concentration ranged from 163.9 to 2123.7 pg/ml (median 759.7 pg/ml; IR 579.5–1069.1). The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was significantly correlated with the log-transformed values of the amount of 24-hour urinary excreted Klotho (r = 0.407, p < 0.01) and the serum Klotho levels (r = 0.232, p < 0.01). However, a stepwise multiple regression analysis identified eGFR to be a variable independently associated only with the log-transformed value of the amount of 24-hour urinary excreted Klotho but not with the log-transformed serum Klotho concentration. Despite the strong correlation between random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio and the 24-hour urinary protein excretion (r = 0.834, p < 0.01), a moderate linear association was observed between the log-transformed value of the amount of 24-hour urinary excreted Klotho and that of the urinary Klotho-to-creatinine ratio (Klotho/Cr) in random urine specimens (r = 0.726, p < 0.01).

### Quantitative amino acid and proteomic analysis: Very low excretion of polypeptides > 750 Da in normal urine [^112iWs5y]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Quantitative data on protein and polypeptide excretion in normal urine are lacking. In Fanconi syndrome, the failure of proximal tubular protein reabsorption leads to 'tubular' proteinuria, but little is known about peptide excretion.

- **Methods**: Urine from normal (N = 5) and Fanconi patients (Dent's disease, N = 2; Lowe syndrome, N = 3) was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography into proteins (> 10 kD) and smaller polypeptides. Each fraction was subjected to amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis. In complementary proteomic approaches, urinary polypeptides were each subjected to reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and nano-flow liquid chromatography directly coupled to electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry (NanoLC-ESI-MS/MS) before and after tryptic digestion.

- **Results**: Based on amino acid composition, normal human urine, excluding Tamm-Horsfall protein, contains 33.7 ± 10.7 mg of protein per 24 hr (mean ± SEM), defined as polypeptides > 10 kD; peptide content in the range of 750 Da to 10 kD is 22.0 ± 9.6 mg. Fanconi patients excrete greatly increased amounts of protein, 1740 ± 660 mg/24 hr, and peptide, 446 ± 145 mg/24 hr. Peptides 2 to 5 kD were present in 12.9- ± 3.9-fold excess in Fanconi compared with normal urine. In contrast, free amino acid excretion in Fanconi was elevated only 2.14- ± 0.73-fold. Mass spectrometric techniques determined that the major form of albumin in both normal and Fanconi urine was the f

### Urine proteome analysis in murine nephrotoxic serum nephritis [^1116AocZ]. American Journal of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Urine contains serum proteins filtered by the glomerulus or secreted by the renal tubules and proteins produced locally by the urinary tract. Proteomic analysis of urine holds potential as a noninvasive means of studying or monitoring disease activity. In mice, large concentrations of albumin and lipocalins complicate the identification of urinary biomarkers in disease models.

- **Methods**: Passive nephrotoxic serum nephritis was induced in mice. Urine proteins were identified and quantified by iTRAQ and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Results were compared to Western blotting and multiplex immunoassays.

- **Results**: Large concentrations of major urinary proteins dominate the urine proteome of mice even in the context of acute nephritis. Increased proteinuria caused by nephrotoxic serum nephritis is transient and includes increased albumin excretion. There were no alterations in chemokine excretion. Altered hepcidin excretion was identified, most likely reflecting local production and renal retention.

- **Conclusion**: Proteomic analysis of mouse urine remains challenging due to the abundance of a limited subset of proteins. iTRAQ analysis does not circumvent these challenges but can provide information on post-translational processing of some proteins. Hepcidin is identified as a potential urinary marker of nephritis, and its role in disease pathogenesis warrants further study.

### Progression of chronic kidney disease: The role of blood pressure control, proteinuria, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition: A patient-level meta-analysis [^111HZuoN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce blood pressure and urine protein excretion, and they slow the progression of chronic kidney disease.

- **Purpose**: To determine the levels of blood pressure and urine protein excretion associated with the lowest risk for progression of chronic kidney disease during antihypertensive therapy with and without ACE inhibitors.

- **Data sources**: Eleven randomized, controlled trials comparing the efficacy of antihypertensive regimens with or without ACE inhibitors for patients with predominantly nondiabetic kidney disease.

- **Study selection**: A MEDLINE database search for English-language studies published between 1977 and 1999.

- **Data extraction**: Data on 1860 nondiabetic patients were pooled in a patient-level meta-analysis. Progression of kidney disease was defined as a doubling of baseline serum creatinine level or the onset of kidney failure. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to assess the association of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and urine protein excretion with kidney disease progression across 22,610 patient visits.

- **Data synthesis**: The mean duration of follow-up was 2.2 years, and kidney disease progression was documented in 311 patients. Systolic blood pressure of 110 to 129 mm Hg and urine protein excretion of less than 2.0 g/d were associated with the lowest risk for kidney disease progression. ACE inhibitors remained beneficial after adjustment for blood pressure and urine protein excretion, with a relative risk of 0.67 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.84]. The increased risk for kidney progression at higher systolic pressures was noted.

### Urinary retinol binding protein predicts renal outcome in systemic immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis [^112jYrFf]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Quantification of Log uRBPCR at baseline correlated with several serum and urine biomarkers, most notably serum creatinine (r = 0.618, P < 0.0001), observed in 23 patients with uRBPCR ≥ 100 µg/mmol, including 12 with a uRBPCR of > 1000 µg/mmol. Baseline demographics of patients according to uRBPCR < 100 µg/mmol compared to those with uRBPCR ≥ 100 µg/mmol are listed in Table II.

Patients with baseline uRBPCR of ≥ 100 µg/mmol were older, had significantly higher uPCR, and lower eGFR at diagnosis compared to those with baseline uRBPCR of < 100 µg/mmol. There was a strong correlation between uRBPCR and index of chronic damage in renal biopsy specimens (r = 0.561, P < 0.0001) (Figure 1).

### Proteinuria as a modifiable risk factor for the progression of non-diabetic renal disease [^116vyF8K]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce urine protein excretion and slow the progression of renal disease. The beneficial effect in slowing the progression of renal disease is greater in patients with higher urine protein excretion at the onset of treatment. We hypothesized that the greater beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on the progression of renal disease in patients with higher baseline levels of proteinuria is due to their greater antiproteinuric effect in these patients.

- **Methods**: Data were analyzed from 1860 patients enrolled in 11 randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of antihypertensive regimens, including ACE inhibitors, to regimens not including ACE inhibitors on the progression of non-diabetic renal disease. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between the level of proteinuria at baseline and changes in urine protein excretion during follow-up. The Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess the relationship between changes in urine protein excretion during follow-up and the effect of ACE inhibitors on the time to doubling of baseline serum creatinine values or onset of end-stage renal disease.

- **Results**: Mean (median) baseline urine protein excretion was 1.8 (0.94) g/day. Patients with higher baseline urine protein excretion values had a greater reduction in proteinuria during the follow-up in association with treatment with ACE inhibitors and with lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressures (interaction P < 0.001 for all).

### Two distinct clinical courses of renal involvement in rheumatoid patients with AA amyloidosis [^112LFh7C]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

We conducted a prospective study to investigate whether a correlation exists between the clinical course of renal involvement and the pathological findings of renal amyloidosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

- **Methods**: Patients with RA of more than 5 years' duration and who did not show renal manifestations were selected and received a duodenal biopsy for the diagnosis of amyloidosis. After the diagnosis of AA amyloidosis, patients received a renal biopsy, and patterns of amyloid deposition were examined. We followed the renal functions (serum levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine) of patients diagnosed with AA amyloidosis for 5 years.

- **Results**: We diagnosed 53 patients with AA amyloidosis and monitored the renal function of 38 of them for over 5 years. The histological patterns were examined; in the 38 patients, there were appreciable variations in the patterns of amyloid deposition. In 27 patients, amyloid deposits were found exclusively in the glomerulus (type 1). In the other 11 patients, however, amyloid deposits were found selectively around blood vessels and were totally absent in the glomerulus (type 2). In type 1 patients with glomerular involvement, renal function deteriorated rapidly regardless of disease state; most patients received hemodialysis. In type 2 patients with purely vascular involvement, however, renal function did not deteriorate significantly.

- **Conclusion**: In patients with RA and AA amyloidosis, two distinct clinical courses in terms of renal involvement were identified. It is suggested that renal function does not deteriorate.

### Technescan mag3 [^116CRuZw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Following intravenous injection of technetium Tc 99m mertiatide, the appearance, concentration, and excretion of the tracer in the kidney can be monitored to assess renal function. Although technetium Tc 99m mertiatide is highly plasma protein bound following intravenous injection, the protein binding is reversible, and the tracer is rapidly excreted by the kidneys via active tubular secretion and glomerular filtration. In normal volunteers, 89% of the tracer was plasma protein bound after intravenous injection. In healthy subjects with normal renal function (mean serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL), technetium Tc 99m mertiatide was rapidly cleared from the blood. The plasma clearance was approximately 0.3 liters/minute, and nearly 90% of the dose was excreted in the urine within three hours.

- **Renal impairment study**: In a study involving three patients with renal impairment (serum creatinine greater than 6.3 mg/dL), there was decreased blood clearance and a reduction in the amount excreted in the urine over three hours. In these patients, 78% of the tracer was plasma protein bound after intravenous injection. The mean plasma clearance of technetium Tc 99m mertiatide was 0.03 liters/minute, and on average, 21.3% was excreted in three hours.

In both healthy subjects and patients with renal impairment, the plasma concentration-time profile showed a biexponential decline.

### Decreased urinary peptide excretion in patients with renal disease [^112hi7XM]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Normal urine contains low-molecular-weight peptides or protein fragments that have been poorly studied, primarily because of the technical difficulty of measuring peptides in the presence of proteins. We studied these substances in healthy subjects and patients with renal disease and varying degrees of proteinuria to understand the factors that determine their excretion.

- **Methods**: We estimated these substances as the difference between results using the Lowry method (which detects both proteins and peptides) and those obtained using the dye-binding Bradford (Biorad) method (Biorad Laboratories Inc, Hercules, CA; which detects only proteins).

- **Results**: We validated this 2-assay approach to measure peptide levels by showing that such proteins as immunoglobulin G, albumin, and lysozyme were measured equally by the Lowry and Biorad methods, whereas degraded proteins were recognized by the Lowry method only, but not by the Biorad method. We found that healthy subjects excreted less than 200 mg of protein, but 3 to 4 g of peptides/g creatinine; thus, peptides constituted approximately 95% of total protein material excreted in urine. Patients with renal disease and proteinuria had a progressive decrease in peptide excretion, ranging from 3 to 0 g/g creatinine. Twenty-five percent of nephrotic patients (18 of 72 patients) excreted very small amounts of peptides in urine (0% to 10% of total protein material).

- **Conclusion**: We found that healthy persons excrete substantial amounts of peptides in urine, and this excretion decreases in the presence of proteinuric renal disease.

### Nonbiopsy diagnosis of cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis [^113FFQ7t]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiac transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is a progressive and fatal cardiomyopathy for which several promising therapies are in development. The diagnosis is frequently delayed or missed due to the limited specificity of echocardiography and the traditional requirement for histological confirmation. It has long been recognized that technetium-labeled bone scintigraphy tracers can localize to myocardial amyloid deposits, and the use of this imaging modality for the diagnosis of cardiac ATTR amyloidosis has lately been revisited. We conducted a multicenter study to ascertain the diagnostic value of bone scintigraphy in this disease.

- **Methods and results**: Results of bone scintigraphy and biochemical investigations were analyzed from 1,217 patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis referred for evaluation in specialist centers. Of 857 patients with histologically proven amyloid (374 with endomyocardial biopsies) and 360 patients subsequently confirmed to have nonamyloid cardiomyopathies, myocardial radiotracer uptake on bone scintigraphy was > 99% sensitive and 86% specific for cardiac ATTR amyloid, with false positives almost exclusively from uptake in patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis. Importantly, the combined findings of grade 2 or 3 myocardial radiotracer uptake on bone scintigraphy and the absence of a monoclonal protein in serum or urine had a specificity and positive predictive value for cardiac ATTR amyloidosis of 100% (positive predictive value confidence interval, 98.0–100).

- **Conclusions**: Bone scintigraphy enables the diagnosis of cardiac ATTR amyloidosis.

### Predictors of early death in patients with wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^115RE2XU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Clinical evaluation comprised the following: family and past medical history collection, physical examination with neurological assessment, ECG, echocardiogram, measurement of NT-proBNP and troponins, measurement of serum creatinine and 24-hour urinary protein excretion, serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis, and quantification of free light chains. At the time of the first clinical evaluation, all patients were assessed according to the NYHA and the ECOG-PS.

- **Nyha and Ecog-PS scales**: The ECOG-PS is a numbering scale that describes patients' level of functioning in terms of their ability to care for themselves, daily activity, and physical ability. The scale runs from 0 to 5 as follows:
	- **0**: Fully active, able to carry on all predisease performance without restriction.
	- **1**: Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature (e.g. light housework, office work).
	- **2**: Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities, up and about more than 50% of waking hours.
	- **3**: Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours.
	- **4**: Completely disabled, cannot carry on any self-care, totally confined to bed or chair.
	- **5**: Patient passed away.

### EASL-ERN clinical practice guidelines on Wilson's disease [^116YFGQ9]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion, EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining both serum ceruloplasmin and basal 24-hour urinary copper excretion as the first step for screening for copper metabolism abnormalities. This applies to adult patients with suspected Wilson's disease presenting with either predominantly hepatic, neurological, or neuropsychiatric manifestations. Obtain relative exchangeable copper determination in serum if available.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: An update on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^117XimeT]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis is a disease that can be associated with a variety of symptoms and clinical findings. These include a speckled myocardium, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrhythmias. Patients may present with leg swelling, ankle swelling, or excessive urination at night. Other associated symptoms are fatigue, dyspnea, palpitations, and lightheadedness.

The condition is also linked to specific electrocardiographic changes such as PR depression or diffuse ST elevation, and low voltages. Genetic abnormalities and predispositions are noted risk factors, particularly in males. Severe diastolic dysfunction and general signs of inflammation may also signal the presence of cardiac amyloidosis.

### Light and heavy chain deposition disease with focal amyloid deposition diagnosed with mass spectrometry: a case report [^115xsk3h]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

A 79-year-old Japanese woman with leg oedema visited her primary care physician three months before being admitted to our hospital. Outpatient treatment with diuretics was initiated, but the oedema did not improve. Three days before admission, she experienced palpitations and fatigue, prompting another visit to her physician. Her laboratory data showed severe anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb], 58 g/L) and she was subsequently admitted to our hospital.

She had no specific medical or family history of renal disease. Physical examination revealed moderate leg oedema and kyphosis, with no other indications of amyloidosis, such as numbness, signs consistent with polyneuropathy, gastrointestinal symptoms, macroglossia, orthostatic hypotension, purpura, or any skin changes. Laboratory data revealed microcytic anaemia (Hb, 50 g/L; mean corpuscular volume, 85.9 fL), hypoalbuminemia (albumin, 2.8 g/dL), and a possible slight decline in kidney function (serum creatinine, 0.64 mg/dL; estimated glomerular filtration rate, 66.9 mL/min/1.73 m²). Serum IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were 794 mg/dL, 1006 mg/dL, and 48 mg/dL, respectively. The serum free light chain (FLC) level for kappa and lambda was 77.4 mg/L and 15.2 mg/L, respectively, with an FLC ratio of 5.09. The brain natriuretic peptide level was 72.7 pg/mL. She also had iron and zinc deficiency. Serum and urine electrophoresis revealed the presence of IgA-kappa type M proteins (immunofixation method; Fig. 1). Serum β2-microglobulin was 4.6 mg/L.

### Attruby [^113umXpu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Adverse reactions:

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

	- The safety data reflect the exposure of 421 participants with ATTR-CM to ATTRUBY 712 mg (administered as two 356 mg tablets) administered orally twice daily in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 30 months fixed treatment duration. The median duration of exposure to ATTRUBY in the safety population was 29 months. There was a higher frequency of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions such as diarrhea 11.6% versus 7.6% and upper abdominal pain 5.5% versus 1.4% in the ATTRUBY versus placebo group, respectively. The majority of these GI adverse reactions were categorized as mild and resolved without drug discontinuation.

	- A similar proportion of ATTRUBY-treated and placebo-treated participants discontinued study drug because of an adverse event (9.3% and 8.5%, respectively).

- **Laboratory tests**:

	- **Increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR**: Initiation of ATTRUBY causes an increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR, which generally occurs within 4 weeks of starting therapy and stabilizes. In a trial of adults with ATTR-CM, a mean increase in serum creatinine of 0.2 and 0.0 mg/dL and a mean decrease in eGFR of 8.2 and 0.7 mL/min/1.73 m² was observed in the ATTRUBY and placebo groups, respectively, at Day 28.

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^116L7Sc5]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

The relationships among serum bilirubin concentration, kidney function, and proteinuria have yet to be fully elucidated, nor have these relationships been investigated in Korean adults.

- **Method**: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of Korean adults who were evaluated at Kosin University Gospel Hospital (Busan, Republic of Korea) during a five-year period from January 2005 to December 2009. We evaluated the relationships among serum bilirubin concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and 24-hour urinary protein excretion in a sample of 1363 Korean adults aged 18 years or older.

- **Results**: The values of eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and 24-hour urine albumin ≥ 150 mg/day were observed in 26.1% (n = 356) and 40.5% (n = 553) of subjects, respectively. Fasting glucose levels ≥ 126 mg/dL were observed in 44.9% (n = 612) of the total sample. After adjustment for potential confounding factors including demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and other laboratory measures, total serum bilirubin was positively associated with eGFR and negatively associated with proteinuria both in the whole cohort and in a subgroup of diabetic individuals.

- **Conclusions**: To our knowledge, this is the first hospital-based study specifically aimed at examining the relationships among serum total bilirubin concentration, 24-hour urine protein, and kidney function in Korean adults. We demonstrated that serum total bilirubin concentration was negatively correlated with 24-hour urine protein and positively correlated with eGFR in Korean non-diabetic and diabetic adults.

### Twenty-four-hour Bence-Jones protein determinations: Can we ensure accuracy [^111NS9x8]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Light chain disease represents 15% to 20% of cases of multiple myeloma. Guidelines recommend monitoring these patients with 24-hour urine collections.

- **Objective**: To determine the reliability of 24-hour urine collections in assessing the amount of Bence-Jones protein (BJP).

- **Design**: We included all patients from our institution from 2003 through 2008 with BJP who had more than four 24-hour urine collections. We compared BJP excretion calculated from the submitted 24-hour collection with BJP excretion calculated by normalizing the collection to that patient's mean 24-hour creatinine excretion. We also looked at differences in serial values with these two methods. In addition, we evaluated the feasibility of using random urine samples to determine BJP excretion.

- **Results**: A total of 14 patients with 135 24-hour urine collections met our inclusion criteria. The 24-hour urine creatinine excretion for each patient, which should be reasonably constant, varied considerably (coefficient of variation range 12%-30%). Differences in the two methods of calculating BJP excretion ranged from -1588 to 2315 mg/d. Among a total of 121 serial 24-hour measurements, the differences were clinically significant in 37 (30%). Among a total of 23 random urine samples from 11 of these patients submitted within 10 days of a 24-hour collection, the estimated BJP excretion appeared to be accurate in at least 18 (78%).

- **Conclusions**: Twenty-four-hour urine collections for BJP are, in practice, often misleading. At a minimum, one should verify that the 24-hour creatinine excretion is accurate.

### Renal amyloidosis revisited: Amyloid distribution, dynamics and biochemical type [^1164urm9]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Renal amyloidosis results from protein misfolding and leads to progressive renal insufficiency. Few data are available concerning the relevance of the histomorphological patterns and the dynamics of the disease process.

- **Methods**: Cases of renal amyloidosis in native kidney biopsies (n = 203) were retrospectively evaluated for the pattern of amyloid distribution, the extent of glomerular amyloid deposition, and the amount of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. One hundred and fifty-eight cases were characterized by immunohistochemistry to determine the biochemical amyloid type. Morphological findings were correlated with available clinical data.

- **Results**: According to the predominant site of amyloid deposition, 84.6% showed a glomerular, 9.4% a vascular, and 6% a tubulointerstitial distribution pattern. Within the glomeruli, amyloid was initially deposited in a focal segmental fashion that became diffuse and global in later stages. Most cases were identified as AL lambda (84/158) or AA (68/158). There was no correlation between the biochemical type and the distribution pattern. Serum creatinine correlated well with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, and proteinuria with the glomerular amyloid load.

- **Conclusions**: The relevance of the different distribution patterns is unclear at the moment, but they may be due to the physicochemical properties of the amyloid fibrils in a given patient. This may become important in future anti-fibrillar therapies.

### Urinary retinol binding protein predicts renal outcome in systemic immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis [^117VHyU2]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). High credibility.

A total of 285 treatment‐naïve patients who attended the National Amyloidosis Centre with newly diagnosed systemic AL amyloidosis between August 2017 and August 2018 were enrolled in a prospective study. In this study, urinary retinol binding protein (uRBP) was measured alongside routine clinical, biochemical, echocardiographic, and scintigraphic assessments, conducted according to the AL Chemotherapy Study (ALchemy) protocol.

Renal involvement by amyloid at study entry (baseline) was defined as non‐Bence Jones proteinuria of > 0.5 g/24 h. Cardiac involvement was established by echocardiography, according to International Amyloidosis Consensus Criteria, with additional cardiac magnetic resonance imaging as appropriate.

All patients underwent hematological assessments every 1–3 months at the National Amyloidosis Centre. This included serum free light chain (FLC) assay, serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis, clinical evaluation, serum and urine biochemistry, echocardiography, and serum amyloid P component (SAP) scintigraphy every six months.

All patients were managed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and provided written informed consent for study entry (REC reference: 09/H0715/58) and publication of their data.

Quantification of proteinuria involved measuring the urinary protein/creatinine ratio (uPCR) and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (uACR) using standard biochemical assays. The uRBP was measured using a manual two‐site two‐step sandwich enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as previously described, with results expressed as the uRBP.

### No regression of renal AL amyloid in monoclonal gammopathy after successful autologous blood stem cell transplantation and significant clinical improvement [^112Zf2GP]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous blood stem cell transplantation induces remission of plasma cell dyscrasia in patients with AL amyloidosis. However, the impact of this treatment on the glomerular amyloid mass is still unknown.

- **Methods**: In the present study, the quantity of the renal amyloid mass before and more than 3 years after high-dose melphalan treatment and autologous blood stem cell transplantation was assessed in two patients. At the time of the second renal biopsy, both patients were in complete remission without detectable serum and urinary monoclonal IgA-lambda and a normal percentage of plasma cells in the bone marrow.

- **Results**: In both patients with biopsy-proven AL amyloidosis, urinary protein excretion decreased from 7 g/24 h to < 2 g/24 h more than 3 years after autologous blood stem cell transplantation. In contrast, glomerular amyloid deposits persisted, as shown in the second biopsy.

- **Conclusion**: Despite complete remission of the plasma cell dyscrasia and improvement of glomerular permeability, the amount of glomerular amyloid mass did not regress.

### Renal phenotypic investigations of megalin-deficient patients: novel insights into tubular proteinuria and albumin filtration [^112nSBJR]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

The reabsorption of filtered plasma proteins, hormones, and vitamins by the renal proximal tubules is vital for body homeostasis. Studies of megalin-deficient mice suggest that the large multi-ligand endocytic receptor, megalin, plays an essential role in this process. In humans, dysfunctional megalin causes the extremely rare Donnai-Barrow/Facio-Oculo-Acustico-Renal (DB/FOAR) syndrome, characterized by a distinctive and multifaceted phenotype, including low-molecular-weight proteinuria. In this study, we examined the role of megalin in tubular protein reabsorption in humans through analysis of proximal tubular function in megalin-deficient patients.

- **Methods**: Direct sequencing of the megalin-encoding gene (LRP2) was performed in a family in which three children presented with classical DB/FOAR manifestations. Renal consequences of megalin deficiency were investigated through immunohistochemical analyses of renal biopsy material and immunoblotting of urine samples.

- **Results**: In the patients, a characteristic urinary protein profile with increased urinary excretion of vitamin D-binding protein, retinol-binding protein, and albumin was associated with the absence of, or reduced, proximal tubular endocytic uptake, as shown by renal immunohistochemistry. In the absence of tubular uptake, urinary albumin excretion was in the micro-albuminuric range, suggesting that limited amounts of albumin are filtered in human glomeruli.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrated that megalin plays an essential role in human proximal tubular protein reabsorption.

### Correlation between urine ACR and 24-h proteinuria in a real-world cohort of systemic AL amyloidosis patients [^111TLs1D]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Low credibility.

A simple linear regression model showed that a higher uACR was associated with a significantly higher 24hUP (β 1.03, 95% CI 0.99–1.06, R² 0.775, p < 0.001). A univariable linear regression was used to assess the effect of serum creatinine, time of collection (AM or PM), age at collection, sex, and body mass index (BMI) on the relationship between uACR and 24hUP. All of these variables were significant in the univariable analyses (p < 0.15) and were therefore included in the multivariable analysis. In the multivariable analysis, sex, BMI, and age at uACR collection remained significant.

Variables significant in the multivariable linear regression were used to construct a model to predict 24hUP. A significant regression equation was found: E (24hUPᵢ) = 372 + 1.04(uACRᵢ) + 51(BMIᵢ) − 23(age at uACR collectionᵢ) − 248(if male sexᵢ). The 24hUP increased by 1.03 mg for every 1 mg/g increase in uACR, increased by 51 mg for each 1 kg/m² increase in BMI, decreased by 23 mg for each 1 year increase in age, and males had a lower 24hUP by 248 mg. The overall model was statistically and clinically significant (p < 0.001 and adjusted R² 0.795, respectively). Age at uACR collection, gender, and BMI did not confound the primary relationship between uACR and 24hUP, and no collinearity was observed.

### Correlation between urine ACR and 24-h proteinuria in a real-world cohort of systemic AL amyloidosis patients [^116VhTJh]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Low credibility.

To validate the renal staging system using uACR, we used a ROC analysis and determined that 24-hour proteinuria > 5000 mg was predicted by a uACR of 3580 mg/g with the highest sensitivity and specificity. For convenience, we used uACR > 3600 (sensitivity 93%, specificity 94%) as a substitute for 24hUP > 5000 mg in the renal staging model. Of the 394 patients with renal involvement at diagnosis, 109 had a paired uACR and 24hUP collection within 30 days of diagnosis and were therefore included in the renal staging validation analysis.

The median time between diagnosis and uACR collection in the patients included in the renal staging analysis was 1 (IQR –1 to 17) day. The median follow-up duration from diagnosis was 19 months (IQR 3–31). Thirty-five (32%) of patients underwent an autologous stem cell transplant. At the time of uACR collection, the median eGFR was 62 (IQR 38–78) mL/min/1.73 m^2, median serum creatinine was 1.1 (IQR 0.9–1.8) mg/dL, median uACR was 3329 (IQR 1149–5151) mg/g, and the median 24hUP was 3176 (IQR 1307–7823) mg. A total of 15 (14%) patients progressed to ESRD requiring dialysis, at a median of 5 (IQR 1–14) months from diagnosis.

- **Renal staging system application**: The renal staging system was applied using either 24hUP > 5000 mg or uACR > 3600 mg/g as the criteria for proteinuria. The stratification of patients by renal stage was strongly concordant using 24hUP and uACR (k = 0.823, 95% CI 0.728–0.919). All patients identified as stage 3 using 24hUP were also stage 3 using uACR.

### Correlation between urine ACR and 24-h proteinuria in a real-world cohort of systemic AL amyloidosis patients [^115g1J9w]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Low credibility.

In this study, we found that a uACR > 300 mg/g best predicted a 24hUP > 500 mg (sensitivity 92%, specificity 97%), the minimum threshold of proteinuria used to define renal involvement. However, Palladini et al. found that a uACR > 500 mg/g was the best predictor of a 24hUP > 500 mg (with a reported sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 97%). The discrepancy in the uACR thresholds between studies may be explained by variations in the test itself (e.g. differences in the laboratory measurements of urine creatinine) or the patient population. On average, males have more muscle mass than females and therefore excrete more urinary creatinine, leading to lower uACR values. Our study included a disproportionately higher number of men (64%) than women, which may have skewed our ROC analysis.

In our dataset, a uACR cutoff of > 300 mg/g was more sensitive than a uACR > 500 mg/g at predicting a 24hUP > 500 mg and was associated with a positive predictive value of 97% and negative predictive value of 94%. Our dataset comprised known systemic AL amyloid patients, and so the prevalence of renal involvement was high. In the real-world setting, where systemic AL amyloidosis is a rare diagnosis with an estimated prevalence of 40.5 cases per million patients, the negative predictive value of a uACR < 300 mg/g can effectively rule out a 24hUP > 500 mg in more than 93% of patients, making uACR an effective and convenient screen for renal involvement. The added value of a 24-hour urine collection at diagnosis in systemic AL amyloidosis is minimal.

### Organ response in patients with AL amyloidosis treated with NEOD001, an amyloid-directed monoclonal antibody [^1165gyZQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

At enrollment in January 2014, the patient's urinary protein was 5,129 mg/day (normal, 5,000 mg/day), which would eventually lead to end‐stage renal disease and necessitate dialysis. The patient also had slightly elevated serum creatinine (1.4 mg/dL; normal range, 0.8–1.3 mg/dL), below normal creatinine clearance (62 mL/min; normal range, 77–160 mL/min), and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) not significantly impacted at baseline.

The patient began NEOD001 treatment 40.3 months after his last exposure to plasma cell-directed (PCD) therapy. He was treated for 9 months with 16 mg/kg NEOD001 every 28 days, then escalated to 24 mg/kg (maximum tolerated dose, MTD) for the remainder of this trial. At the 5‐month follow‐up visit, after four infusions of NEOD001, proteinuria was reduced by 36%, which constitutes a consensus‐defined renal response. As of the trial cutoff date (May 9, 2016), he had received 29 infusions (20 at the MTD). His best response, recorded after 23 months of treatment, revealed an 88% reduction in proteinuria from baseline (602 mg/day). The patient's serum creatinine levels had stabilized at 1.1 mg/dL, and his creatinine clearance had risen to fluctuate within the normal range (74–92 mL/min). The patient's eGFR did not change from screening (52–60 mL/min/1.73 m^2). He also experienced progressive functional improvement, complete resolution of edema, and no more fatigue.

### Torsemide [^116EnWEY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

Torsemide elimination in normal subjects has a half-life of approximately 3.5 hours. It is cleared from circulation predominantly through hepatic metabolism, accounting for about 80% of total clearance, while excretion into urine constitutes approximately 20% of total clearance in patients with normal renal function. Since torsemide extensively binds to plasma protein (> 99%), minimal amounts enter tubular urine via glomerular filtration. Most renal clearance occurs through active secretion by the proximal tubules into tubular urine. After a single oral dose, the amounts recovered in urine were: torsemide 21%, metabolite M1 12%, metabolite M3 2%, and metabolite M5 34%.

- **Renal impairment**: In patients with renal failure, renal clearance of torsemide is significantly decreased, although total plasma clearance remains largely unchanged. This results in a smaller fraction of the dose reaching the intraluminal site of action, thereby reducing the natriuretic effect of any given dose of the diuretic.

- **Hepatic impairment**: In patients with hepatic cirrhosis, there is an increase in the volume of distribution, plasma half-life, and renal clearance of torsemide, but total clearance remains consistent.

- **Geriatric patients**: The renal clearance of torsemide is reduced in elderly subjects compared to younger adults, reflecting the decline in renal function that commonly occurs with aging. However, total plasma clearance and elimination half-life remain unchanged.

### Predicting kidney transplantation outcomes using proteinuria ascertained from spot urine samples versus timed urine collections [^114byk5C]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Proteinuria has been associated with transplant loss and mortality in kidney transplant recipients. Both spot samples (albumin-creatinine ratio [ACR] and protein-creatinine ratio [PCR]) and 24-hour collections (albumin excretion rate [AER] and protein excretion rate [PER]) have been used to quantify protein excretion, but which measurement is a better predictor of outcomes in kidney transplantation remains uncertain.

- **Study design**: Observational cohort study.

- **Setting & participants**: Tertiary care center, 207 kidney transplant recipients who were enrolled in a prospective study to measure glomerular filtration rate. Consecutive patients who met inclusion criteria were approached.

- **Predictors**: ACR and PCR in spot urine samples, AER and PER in 24-hour urine collections.

- **Outcomes**: Primary outcome included transplant loss, doubling of serum creatinine level, or death.

- **Measurements**: Urine and serum creatinine were measured using a modified Jaffé reaction that had not been standardized by isotope-dilution mass spectrometry. Urine albumin was measured by immunoturbidimetry. Urine protein was measured by pyrogallol red molybdate complex formation using a timed end point method.

Results from the study indicated a mean follow-up period of 6.4 years, with 22% of participants developing the primary endpoint. Multivariable-adjusted areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were similar across the different protein measurements: ACR (0.85; 95% CI, 0.79–0.89), PCR (0.84; 95% CI, 0.79–0.89), PER (0.86; 95% CI, 0.80–0.90), and AER (0.83; 95% CI, 0.78–0.88). C Index values also were similar for the different protein measurements.

### Amyloid load and clinical outcome in AA amyloidosis in relation to circulating concentration of serum amyloid A protein [^116p5cMV]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

Reactive systemic (AA, secondary) amyloidosis occurs in chronic inflammatory diseases, and most patients present with nephropathy. The amyloid fibrils are derived from the circulating acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A protein (SAA), but the relation between the production of fibril precursor protein, amyloid load, and clinical outcome in AA and other types of amyloidosis is unclear.

- **Methods**: We studied amyloidotic organ function and survival prospectively for 12–117 months in 80 patients with systemic AA amyloidosis in whom serum SAA concentration was measured monthly and visceral amyloid deposits were assessed annually by serum amyloid P component scintigraphy. Underlying inflammatory diseases were treated as vigorously as possible.

- **Findings**: Amyloid deposits regressed in 25 of 42 patients whose median SAA values were within the reference range (< 10 mg/L) throughout follow-up, and amyloidotic organ function stabilized or improved in 39 of these cases. Outcome varied substantially among patients whose median SAA concentration exceeded 10 mg/L, but amyloid load increased and organ function deteriorated in most of those whose SAA was persistently above 50 mg/L. Estimated survival at 10 years was 90% in patients whose median SAA was under 10 mg/L, and 40% among those whose median SAA exceeded this value (p = 0.0009).

- **Interpretation**: Although isolated amyloid fibrils are stable in vitro, AA amyloid deposits exist in a state of dynamic turnover, and outcome is favorable in AA amyloidosis when the SAA concentration is maintained below 10 mg/L. The potential for amylo…

### Diagnostic performance of 123i-labeled serum amyloid P component scintigraphy in patients with amyloidosis [^117UZqHN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

To assess the diagnostic accuracy and additional information provided by 123I-labeled serum amyloid P component (SAP) scintigraphy in patients with systemic and localized amyloidosis, the following study was conducted:

- **Subjects and methods**: 123I-labeled human SAP was injected intravenously into 20 controls and 189 consecutive patients with histologically proven amyloidosis: of AA type in 60 cases, AL type in 80, hereditary ATTR type in 27, and localized amyloidosis in 22 cases. SAP scintigrams were obtained 24 hours after tracer injection and were analyzed for abnormal patterns of uptake. Sensitivity and specificity were determined, and scintigraphic findings were compared with clinical data.

- **Results**: Diagnostic sensitivity of SAP scintigraphy for systemic AA, AL, and ATTR amyloidosis was 90%, 90%, and 48% respectively, and specificity was 93%. The distribution of amyloid was less diverse in AA than in AL type. Myocardial uptake was not visualized in any patient. Splenic amyloid was very frequent (80%) in AA and AL type but rarely detected clinically (14%). Abnormal tracer uptake in the liver and kidneys correlated with disturbed liver function and proteinuria, respectively. Bone marrow uptake was specific for AL (21%) and was more frequent in AL kappa than AL lambda. Localized amyloid deposits were not imaged.

- **Conclusion**: SAP scintigraphy is diagnostic of amyloid in most patients with AA and AL type, but fewer with hereditary ATTR type, relating to differing distributions and burdens of amyloid in these disorders. It usually reveals more widespread organ involvement than is identified clinically.

### Use of a first-line urine protein-to-creatinine ratio strip test on random urines to rule out proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1144hApu]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Urine protein strip tests are often used in the ward or clinic as first-line measures of proteinuria. The ability of a semi-quantitative meter-read strip test for the protein-to-creatinine ratio, Multistix PRO 10LS (Siemens Medical Solutions, Tarrytown, USA), was assessed as a first-line test to exclude significant proteinuria in the monitoring of patients with established chronic kidney disease.

- **Methods**: Eighty-six patients attending a hospital renal outpatient clinic collected three random urine samples during a 24-hour period. Random urine protein-to-creatinine ratios measured by the strip test were compared to the laboratory estimation of 24-hour protein excretion on that same day.

- **Results**: At significant protein excretion of 0.3 g/24 h, the strips elicited negative predictive values in the range of 91.2–94.1% and negative likelihood ratios of 0.01–0.12, using all the random urines. Receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis also demonstrated good performance with all samples.

- **Conclusions**: The strip test allows the physician to rule out significant proteinuria at the patient consultation on a random urine sample, obviating the need for specially collected samples, and with the added benefit of reducing the need for a lengthy and costly quantitative laboratory follow-up by approximately 40–48%.

### Kit for the preparation of technetium Tc99m mertiatide [^112nhiih]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Following intravenous injection of technetium Tc 99m mertiatide, the appearance, concentration, and excretion of the tracer in the kidney can be monitored to assess renal function. Although technetium Tc 99m mertiatide is highly plasma protein-bound following intravenous injection, the protein binding is reversible, and the tracer is rapidly excreted by the kidneys via active tubular secretion and glomerular filtration.

In normal volunteers, following intravenous injection of technetium Tc 99m mertiatide, 89% of the tracer was plasma protein-bound. In healthy subjects with normal renal function (mean serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL), technetium Tc 99m mertiatide was rapidly cleared from the blood. The plasma clearance was approximately 0.3 liters/minute, and nearly 90% of the dose was excreted in the urine in three hours.

In a study conducted on three patients with renal impairment (serum creatinine greater than 6.3 mg/dL), there was decreased blood clearance and a reduction in the amount excreted in the urine over three hours. In these patients, 78% of the tracer was plasma protein-bound after intravenous injection. The mean plasma clearance of technetium Tc 99m mertiatide was 0.03 liters/minute, and on average, 21.3% was excreted in three hours.

In both healthy subjects and patients with renal impairment, the plasma concentration-time profile demonstrated a biexponential decline.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: An update on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^111SogJ5]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cardiac amyloidosis:

- **Definition**: Cardiac amyloidosis refers to the infiltration of the heart muscle by amyloid proteins, resulting in cardiomyopathy.

- **Pathophysiology**: Cardiac amyloidosis is caused by the extracellular accumulation of misfolded protein fragments, specifically immunoglobulin light-chain and transthyretin protein, in the heart muscle.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations are related to the development of restrictive cardiomyopathy and include angina, myocardial infarction, and heart failure (HF). An increased risk of thromboembolic complications is also present.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Unadjusted 5-year mortality rates are estimated at 65% in patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis and 44% in patients with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis.

### Percentage of urinary albumin excretion and serum-free light-chain reduction are important determinants of renal response in myeloma patients with moderate to severe renal impairment [^114bYSc7]. Blood Cancer Journal (2014). High credibility.

Urine analysis is a simple but essential test for patients with renal disease irrespective of its cause. However, urine dipstick detects only albumin and is unreliable for detecting myeloma paraprotein. Renal lesions of amyloidosis and monoclonal Ig deposition disease are usually seen in the glomeruli, whereas tubulointerstitial lesions are seen in cast nephropathy. Recently, Leung et al. reported the association of renal pathology and urine albumin excretion. They found that the percentage of urinary albumin excretion was highest in patients with amyloid light-chain amyloidosis (70%), followed by light-chain deposition disease (55%), acute tubular necrosis (25%), and lowest in cast nephropathy (7%). Our results validate their observations in the clinical setting. Consistent with their observations, the median percentage of urine albumin in patients with and without renal response was 7.5% and 30%, respectively (P = 0.007) in our study.

Urinary secretion of Bence–Jones protein was not measured in our study due to the difficulty in its quantification. As various proteins were often excreted in urine, multiple peaks that prevent measurement of urinary Bence–Jones protein were frequently observed in a subset of patients with RI by urine protein electrophoresis. Dimopoulos et al. reported that high levels of urinary Bence–Jones protein (> 2 g per day) were not related to renal response in patients treated with novel agents.

### Urinary biomarkers in obstructive nephropathy [^116FekfZ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Obstructive nephropathy is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children. However, assessing the severity of renal impairment and predicting which children will progress to renal failure are challenging tasks for healthcare providers.

- **Design, setting, participants, and measurements**: This case-control study measured the urinary excretion of candidate biomarkers in 27 prevalent case-patients with posterior urethral valves (PUVs) and 20 age-matched controls. The study correlated their urinary concentrations with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and analyzed receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and regression analyses to assess their performance as tests for low GFR.

- **Results**: The median urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio was higher in children with PUV (45 g/mol; range, 5–361 g/mol) than in controls (7 g/mol; range, 3–43 g/mol) (P < 0.01) and correlated inversely with renal function (r = -0.44; P < 0.05). In whole urine, the excretion of aquaporin-2 was significantly decreased, while that of TGFβ and L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) was significantly increased. Whole-urine TGFβ excretion correlated inversely with GFR (r = -0.53; P < 0.05). As tests for low GFR, whole-urine TGFβ, L1CAM, and urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio performed best, with areas under the ROC curves of 0.788, 0.795, and 0.814, respectively. By linear regression analysis, whole-urine TGFβ, L1CAM, and urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio were associated with low GFR in the case-patients.

- **Conclusions**: Candidate biomarkers of obstructive nephropathy can be readily measured in whole urine and in urine exosomes. In boys with PUV, these biomarkers co…

### Correlation between urine ACR and 24-h proteinuria in a real-world cohort of systemic AL amyloidosis patients [^1169RTF2]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Evaluating the association between a protein-to-creatinine ratio and 24hUP, a total of 286 systemic AL amyloid patients had a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR) and uACR collected on the same day, along with a 24hUP collection within 7 days of the spot urine collections. In 22 patients, the random urine samples were collected within 30 days of diagnosis, and the median time from diagnosis of amyloidosis to random urine collection was 7 (IQR 0–58) months. A urine MCP was quantifiable in 26 (9%) of patients at the paired 24hUP collection, and the median urine MCP was 139 (67–564) mg based on urine protein electrophoresis conducted using the 24-hour urine collection.

Seventy-three percent (n = 208) of patients included in this analysis had renal amyloid involvement at diagnosis. We found that in these patient samples, the uPCR correlated strongly with 24hUP (Pearson's r = 0.83, 95% CI 0.80–0.87), as did the uACR (Pearson's r = 0.88, 95% CI 0.85–0.90). However, in patients with lower levels of proteinuria (24hUP < 3000 mg), uACR correlated better with 24hUP (Pearson's r = 0.81, 95% CI 0.77–0.86) compared to uPCR (Pearson's r = 0.65, 95% CI 0.56–0.73).

### First and second morning spot urine protein measurements for the assessment of proteinuria: a diagnostic accuracy study in kidney transplant recipients [^112NTNV2]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Bias, precision, and accuracy of first and second morning spot urine estimated protein excretion were compared with 24-hour proteinuria. Bias was defined as the mean difference between the measured value of 24-hour proteinuria and the estimated value from spot urine samples (measured-estimated). Percent bias was defined as (bias/24-hour protein excretion) × 100. Precision was defined as the standard deviation of the mean bias. Accuracy was defined as the percentage of estimated values within 15%, 30%, and 50% of the measured value.

*P* < 0.05; **P** < 0.01.

Scatter plot and Bland-Altman analysis were performed, comparing measured with estimated 24-hour urine protein excretion for first and second morning spot urine collections. In Bland-Altman plots, horizontal lines are drawn at the mean difference, and at the 95% limits of agreement (defined as the mean difference ± 1.96 times the standard deviation of the differences).

### Sustained pharmacological depletion of serum amyloid P component in patients with systemic amyloidosis [^115tTGvu]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Serum amyloid P component (SAP) is a universal constituent of amyloid deposits and contributes to their formation and/or persistence. We developed CPHPC ((R)-1-[6-[(R)-2-carboxy-pyrrolidin-1-yl]-6-oxo-hexanoyl]pyrrolidine-2 carboxylic acid), a novel bis(D-proline) drug, to specifically target SAP. This document reports our first exploratory open-label proof of principle study in systemic amyloidosis. CPHPC produced sustained, > 95% depletion of circulating SAP in all patients and approximately 90% reduction in the SAP content of the two amyloidotic organs that became available. There were no significant adverse effects of either SAP depletion or CPHPC itself. No accumulation of amyloid was demonstrable by SAP scintigraphy in any patient on the drug. In hereditary fibrinogen amyloidosis, which is inexorably progressive, proteinuria was reduced in four of five patients receiving CPHPC, and renal survival was prolonged compared to a historical control group. These promising clinical observations merit further study.

### Bilateral yellow plaques on the upper eyelids [^117By6RG]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: What complementary test would most likely explain the etiology of the skin lesions?
A. Genetic study of ECM1 gene
B. Abdominal fat pad biopsy
C. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis
D. Lipid profile
E. No further test is required

- **Answers**:
	- A. Genetic study of ECM1 gene – Incorrect. Loss-of-function mutations in the extracellular matrix protein ECM1 gene are used to confirm the diagnosis of lipoid proteinosis.
	- B. Abdominal fat pad biopsy – Incorrect. In an already-diagnosed cutaneous amyloidosis case, an abdominal fat pad biopsy will be redundant and will not help in delineating the etiology of the lesions.
	- C. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis – Correct. The most common cause of systemic amyloidosis is the deposition of immunoglobulin light chains secondary to plasma cell dyscrasias, where the results of serum and urine protein electrophoresis may be abnormal. A quantitative serum-free light-chain assay will further help, especially in rare occasions, such as in the presented patient, when the serum protein electrophoresis and urine protein electrophoresis return normal.
	- D. Lipid profile – Incorrect. Based on the histopathological features, the diagnosis is amyloidosis, and a lipid profile would not be the best next step in identifying the underlying causative disorder. On the contrary, dyslipidemia is seen in 50% of patients presenting with xanthelasma.
	- E. No further test is required – Incorrect. Amyloidosis involves the deposition of amyloid material with a wide range of etiologies. Therefore, conducting supplementary tests is of paramount importance in establishing the appropriate cause.

### Correlation between urine ACR and 24-h proteinuria in a real-world cohort of systemic AL amyloidosis patients [^116mV4zw]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Low credibility.

We explored the association between 24-hour urine protein (24hUP) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) in multiple subsets of our patients with systemic AL amyloidosis. These subsets are characterized in Table 2. We found that uACR correlated equally well with 24hUP in patients with samples taken within 30 days of diagnosis (n = 155, Pearson's r = 0.87, 95% CI 0.83–0.90) or at any time during their disease course (n = 575, Pearson's r = 0.88, 95% CI 0.86–0.90).

The correlation remained strong even in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² (n = 127, Pearson's r = 0.84, 95% CI 0.79–0.89) and those with proteinuria of less than 3 g/day (n = 466, Pearson's r = 0.81, 95% CI 0.77–0.84) at the time of urine sample collection.

### Wainua [^115DbVCA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Eplontersen is an antisense oligonucleotide-GalNAc conjugate that causes degradation of mutant and wild-type TTR mRNA through binding to the TTR mRNA, which results in a reduction of serum TTR protein and TTR protein deposits in tissues.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In Study 1 [see Clinical Studies (14)], following administration of the recommended Wainua dosage every 4 weeks to patients with hATTR amyloidosis, a decrease in serum TTR levels was observed at the first assessment and the least square mean serum TTR at Week 35 was reduced by 81% from baseline. Similar TTR reductions were observed across subgroups including Val30Met variant status, body weight, sex, age, or race. Eplontersen also reduced the mean steady-state serum vitamin A by 71% by Week 37 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: At a dose 2.7 times the maximum recommended dose for Wainua, clinically significant QTc interval prolongation was not observed.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of Wainua were evaluated following subcutaneous administration of single and multiple doses (once every 4 weeks) in healthy subjects and multiple doses (once every 4 weeks) in patients with hATTR amyloidosis. Eplontersen Cmax and AUC showed a slightly greater than dose-proportional increase following single subcutaneous doses ranging from 45 to 120 mg (i.e. 1- to 2.7-times the recommended dose) in healthy volunteers. Population estimates (mean ± SD) of steady-state maximum concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUCτ) were 283 ± 152 ng/mL.

### Urinary excretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^112fhoqq]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) progresses to renal insufficiency in over 50% of patients and is characterized by interstitial inflammation and fibrosis in the end stage. In a rat model of ADPKD, monocytes accumulate within the renal interstitium in association with increased levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in cyst mural cells and increased excretion of this chemokine into the urine. To determine the extent to which this chemokine is abnormally expressed in patients with ADPKD, a cross-sectional study was conducted of MCP-1 in urine, serum, and cyst fluid, and MCP-1 production by mural epithelial cells cultured from the cysts of human patients with ADPKD.

Upper boundaries for urinary MCP-1 excretion (> 263 pg/mg creatinine) and serum creatinine concentration (> 1.5 mg/dl) determined in 19 normal individuals were used to categorize 55 ADPKD patients into three groups.

- **Group 1 (n = 13)**: Urine MCP-1 excretion (136 ± 14 pg/mg creatinine) was not different from normal volunteers (152 ± 16 pg/mg); serum creatinine levels and urine total protein excretion were normal as well.
- **Group 2 (n = 27)**: Urine MCP-1 excretion was increased (525 ± 39 pg/mg creatinine), but serum creatinine levels and urine protein excretion were not different from normal.
- **Group 3 (n = 15)**: Urine MCP-1 excretion increased further (1221 ± 171 pg/mg), serum creatinine levels increased to 4.3 ± 0.8 mg/dl, and urine protein excretion rose to 0.64 ± 0.28 mg/mg creatinine.

Serum MCP-1 levels of ADPKD patients (84 ± 9.9 pg/ml; n = 15) did not differ from normal.

### Amyloidosis-associated kidney disease [^111sbKZr]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The amyloidoses are a group of disorders in which soluble proteins aggregate and deposit extracellularly in tissues as insoluble fibrils, causing progressive organ dysfunction. The kidney is one of the most frequent sites of amyloid deposition in AL, AA, and several of the hereditary amyloidoses.

Amyloid fibril formation begins with the misfolding of an amyloidogenic precursor protein. The misfolded variants self-aggregate in a highly ordered manner, generating protofilaments that interact to form fibrils. The fibrils have a characteristic appearance by electron microscopy and generate birefringence under polarized light when stained with Congo red dye.

Advances in elucidating the mechanisms of amyloid fibril formation, tissue deposition, and tissue injury have led to new and more aggressive treatment approaches for these disorders. This article reviews the pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of the amyloidoses, focusing heavily on the renal aspects of each of these areas.

### Renal AA amyloidosis: presentation, diagnosis, and current therapeutic options: a review [^114PyRUU]. Kidney International (2023). High credibility.

Amyloid A amyloidosis is thought to be the second most common form of systemic amyloidosis behind amyloidosis secondary to monoclonal Ig. It results from the deposition of insoluble fibrils in the extracellular space of tissues and organs, derived from the precursor protein serum amyloid A, an acute-phase reactant synthesized excessively in the setting of chronic inflammation. The kidney is the most frequently involved organ. Most patients present with proteinuria and kidney failure. Diagnosis is made through tissue biopsy with involvement of the glomeruli in most cases, and often includes the vessels and tubulointerstitial compartment.

Treatment usually targets the underlying etiology and increasingly consists of blocking the inflammatory cascade of cytokines with interleukin-1 inhibitors, interleukin-6 inhibitors, and tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors to reduce serum amyloid A protein formation. This strategy has also shown efficacy in cases where an underlying etiology cannot be readily identified, significantly improving prognosis. Additionally, there is increased interest in developing effective therapies to clear amyloid deposits from tissues, albeit with mitigated results so far.
