## Question

Should an MRI or X-ray be done prior to physical therapy for low back pain with bilateral neurological manifestations?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether MRI or X-ray should be obtained before starting physical therapy in a patient with low back pain and bilateral neurological manifestations, and if so, which modality and timing are appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes "bilateral neurological manifestations" and whether that implies a red flag or progressive deficit. Then, I should verify guideline-based indications for imaging in low back pain with neurologic findings. Next, I will compare MRI versus X-ray for this scenario and decide which is first-line. After that, I need to consider timing relative to PT initiation. Finally, I should weigh potential harms of early imaging and synthesize a clear recommendation with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical meaning of "bilateral neurological manifestations". Wait, let me verify that this phrasing typically signals either bilateral radiculopathy or features concerning for cauda equina syndrome, such as bilateral leg weakness, sensory changes, or bladder/bowel dysfunction, which are red flags mandating urgent evaluation rather than routine care pathways [^114pK5br].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm the imaging indications in guidelines. The VA/DoD guideline recommends diagnostic imaging when neurologic deficits are progressive or otherwise serious, and the ACR Appropriateness Criteria advise MRI for suspected cauda equina syndrome and for persistent or progressive radiculopathy in patients who are candidates for intervention; Choosing Wisely and AAFP similarly advise imaging when red flags or neuromuscular deficits are present, not routine imaging otherwise [^114yZEZ4] [^1151j7Un] [^1163LDmg] [^112xTTUU].

> I will now examine the choice of modality. MRI is preferred for suspected nerve root compression, cauda equina syndrome, infection, or malignancy because it delineates soft tissues and neural elements; X-ray is inferior for these pathologies and is better reserved for fracture assessment or postsurgical hardware evaluation, not for bilateral neurologic deficits suggesting cord/cauda or multilevel root involvement [^112ZkrWF] [^116BxmRG] [^114UwfEa] [^116NfdxE].

> Wait, I should double-check the timing relative to PT. Early MRI in non-specific low back pain without red flags is associated with increased surgery, opioid use, and costs without improving outcomes; however, when serious neurologic deficits or cauda equina are suspected, imaging should not be delayed, and PT can proceed in parallel if the patient is stable and access to MRI is prompt, with precautions to avoid aggravating maneuvers until the anatomy is clarified [^114iscmr] [^1173T3qB] [^113MwM4Q] [^116BxmRG].

> But wait, what if the "bilateral neurological manifestations" are mild and nonprogressive, such as subtle sensory changes without motor loss or sphincter symptoms? Let me reconsider — if deficits are not severe or progressive and no other red flags are present, a short trial of conservative care with close monitoring may be reasonable, yet the phrase "bilateral" still raises concern for multilevel or cauda-level pathology; given the risk of missing time-sensitive surgical emergencies, urgent MRI remains the safer, guideline-concordant choice in this scenario [^113MwM4Q] [^114pK5br] [^116BxmRG].

> I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, obtain MRI urgently before or in parallel with PT when bilateral neurological manifestations are present, because this constitutes a red flag that warrants advanced imaging to exclude cauda equina syndrome, significant multilevel radiculopathy, infection, or malignancy; X-ray is not appropriate as initial imaging here because it will not visualize the neural elements adequately and could delay definitive management [^113MwM4Q] [^112ZkrWF] [^116BxmRG] [^114UwfEa].

---

In patients with low back pain and bilateral neurological manifestations, **MRI is indicated before physical therapy** when deficits are severe or progressive, or when serious pathology (infection, malignancy, fracture, cauda equina) is suspected [^114yZEZ4] [^114UwfEa]. MRI is the preferred modality because it best visualizes **soft tissues, nerve roots, and spinal cord**, enabling accurate diagnosis and surgical or procedural planning [^114pK5br] [^116xcjhc] [^1179CjUZ]. Routine X-ray is not recommended in the absence of red flags, as it does not show soft tissues and may miss critical pathology [^113BXcmc] [^116xcjhc]. If MRI is contraindicated, CT myelography is an alternative [^113oyNgG]. Early imaging improves outcomes by guiding appropriate management and preventing neurological deterioration [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several authoritative guidelines provide clear recommendations on imaging in patients with low back pain and neurological manifestations:

- **VA/DoD clinical practice guideline (2022)**: Strongly recommends diagnostic imaging when neurological deficits are progressive or otherwise serious, or when other red flags (e.g. malignancy, fracture, infection) are present [^113MwM4Q] [^114yZEZ4].

- **American College of Radiology (ACR) appropriateness criteria (2021)**: Recommends MRI as the initial imaging modality for patients with suspected serious underlying conditions, including infection, malignancy, or cauda equina syndrome [^114UwfEa] [^116BxmRG].

- **American College of Physicians (ACP) guidelines**: Recommend obtaining MRI or CT in patients with persistent low back pain and signs or symptoms of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis, particularly if they are potential candidates for surgery or epidural steroid injections [^116uiKNp] [^116xPMBX].

---

## Indications for MRI in low back pain with bilateral neurological manifestations

MRI is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Severe or progressive neurological deficits**: Motor weakness, sensory loss, or bowel/bladder dysfunction [^1172qyrP].

- **Suspected serious underlying conditions**: Infection, malignancy, or cauda equina syndrome [^1172qyrP].

- **Persistent symptoms**: Symptoms lasting longer than six weeks without improvement despite conservative management [^1152weWt].

- **Preoperative planning**: When surgical intervention or epidural steroid injections are being considered [^116uiKNp].

---

## Limitations of X-ray imaging

X-ray imaging has significant limitations in evaluating patients with bilateral neurological manifestations:

- **Limited soft tissue visualization**: X-rays cannot adequately visualize soft tissues, nerve roots, or spinal cord, limiting their utility in diagnosing neurological compression or inflammation [^112ZkrWF].

- **Inability to detect certain pathologies**: X-rays cannot reliably detect herniated discs, spinal tumors, or infections, which are common causes of neurological deficits [^114pK5br].

- **Radiation exposure**: Repeated X-ray exposure poses unnecessary radiation risks, particularly when the diagnostic yield is low [^115tEBou].

---

## Benefits of MRI over X-ray

MRI provides several advantages over X-ray imaging in patients with bilateral neurological manifestations:

- **Superior soft tissue visualization**: MRI clearly depicts soft tissues, nerve roots, and spinal cord, allowing accurate identification of compressive lesions, inflammation, or edema [^112ZkrWF].

- **Detection of serious pathologies**: MRI can reliably detect herniated discs, spinal tumors, infections, and cauda equina syndrome, which are critical for appropriate management planning [^114pK5br].

- **Non-invasive and radiation-free**: MRI does not involve radiation exposure, making it safer for repeated imaging if necessary [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks and harms of delayed imaging

Delaying appropriate imaging in patients with bilateral neurological manifestations can lead to significant risks and harms:

- **Progression of neurological deficits**: Delayed diagnosis and treatment can result in irreversible neurological damage, including permanent motor or sensory loss [^116ZsSFX].

- **Increased healthcare utilization**: Delayed imaging and treatment can lead to prolonged pain, increased healthcare costs, and higher likelihood of surgical intervention [^notfound].

- **Patient anxiety and distress**: Prolonged uncertainty regarding the underlying cause of neurological symptoms can negatively impact patient mental health and quality of life [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring immediate MRI

Certain clinical scenarios necessitate immediate MRI without delay:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for immediate MRI** |
|-|-|
| Cauda equina syndrome | - Saddle anesthesia <br/> - Bowel/bladder dysfunction <br/> - Severe bilateral leg weakness [^114pK5br] |
| Suspected spinal infection | - Fever <br/> - Elevated inflammatory markers <br/> - Severe localized pain [^114UwfEa] |
| Suspected spinal malignancy | - History of cancer <br/> - Unexplained weight loss <br/> - Night pain [^114UwfEa] |
| Severe or progressive neurological deficits | - Motor weakness <br/> - Sensory loss <br/> - Gait disturbances [^114yZEZ4] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In patients with low back pain and bilateral neurological manifestations, **MRI is the preferred imaging modality** before initiating physical therapy. MRI provides superior visualization of soft tissues, nerve roots, and spinal cord, enabling accurate diagnosis and appropriate management planning. Routine X-ray imaging is not recommended in the absence of red flags, as it lacks the diagnostic capacity to identify serious underlying conditions. Delaying appropriate imaging can result in progression of neurological deficits, increased healthcare utilization, and patient distress. Therefore, clinicians should prioritize MRI imaging in patients with bilateral neurological manifestations to ensure timely and effective treatment.

Management of lumbar radicular pain depends on whether neurologic deficit is present. The definition of lumbar radiculopathy is radicular pain in the setting of focal weakness and/or asymmetrically diminished deep tendon reflexes. Objective sensory impairment may be evident on examination, but it is not a criterion for defining radiculopathy. Electrodiagnostic studies, although not necessary to make the diagnosis, are abnormal in lumbar radiculopathy. Deep tendon reflexes are commonly diminished bilaterally in older adults; therefore, in our algorithm we only recommend pursuing management of radiculopathy if the patient has objective evidence of asymmetric weakness on exam.

Patients with radiculopathy are at risk for progressive and permanent neurologic damage. Therefore, if a clinician is concerned for lumbar radiculopathy based on history and physical exam, the patient would benefit from urgent imaging and referral. Advanced imaging such as lumbar spine MRI (or CT if MRI is contraindicated) is useful to plan interventions such as epidural corticosteroid injections and/or surgical decompression. When referring the patient for specialist care, we recommend initial evaluation by a non-operative musculoskeletal provider if available, because not all radiculopathy requires surgical management. Seventy percent of patients with lumbar radiculopathy will improve with conservative care within 4 weeks of the onset of symptoms, and up to 90% of patients with lumbar radiculopathy from a herniated disc (in the absence of significant lumbar spinal stenosis) treated with core stabilization exercises and education eventually achieve good or excellent outcomes. Especially in the aging population, avoiding unnecessary surgical procedures can help minimize associated morbidity and peri-operative complications. Nevertheless, this population will require close follow-up for patients who do not improve and in those with functionally significant weakness that may benefit from surgical decompression within the first 8 weeks of symptom onset.

Imaging studies in low back pain — overall role and indications emphasize limited diagnostic value for routine use: Imaging modalities have frequent false positive and negative results, the primary utility of imaging lies in interventional and/or surgical planning or in determining the presence of serious medical conditions, and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the most useful tool. Routine ordering of imaging for low back pain should be discouraged, and current recommendations from the American College of Physicians are that (1) imaging is only indicated for severe progressive neurological deficits or when red flags are suspected, and (2) routine imaging does not result in clinical benefit and may lead to harm.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® low back pain: 2021 update [^1152weWt]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the United States, acute low back pain, with or without radiculopathy, is the leading cause of years lived with disability and the third ranking cause of disability-adjusted life-years. Uncomplicated acute low back pain and/or radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition that does not warrant any imaging studies. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags, raising suspicion for a serious underlying condition, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, or infection. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria low back Pain [^1172qyrP]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Most patients presenting with uncomplicated acute low back pain (LBP) and/or radiculopathy do not require imaging. Imaging is considered in those patients who have had up to 6 weeks of medical management and physical therapy that resulted in little or no improvement in their back pain. It is also considered for those patients presenting with red flags raising suspicion for serious underlying conditions, such as cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, and infection. Many imaging modalities are available to clinicians and radiologists for evaluating LBP. Application of these modalities depends largely on the working diagnosis, the urgency of the clinical problem, and comorbidities of the patient. When there is concern for fracture of the lumbar spine, multidetector CT is recommended. Those deemed to be interventional candidates, with LBP lasting for > 6 weeks having completed conservative management with persistent radiculopathic symptoms, may seek MRI. Patients with severe or progressive neurologic deficit on presentation and red flags should be evaluated with MRI. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: a joint clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society [^116xPMBX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

RECOMMENDATION 1: Clinicians should conduct a focused history and physical examination to help place patients with low back pain into 1 of 3 broad categories: nonspecific low back pain, back pain potentially associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis, or back pain potentially associated with another specific spinal cause. The history should include assessment of psychosocial risk factors, which predict risk for chronic disabling back pain (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: Clinicians should not routinely obtain imaging or other diagnostic tests in patients with nonspecific low back pain (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 3: Clinicians should perform diagnostic imaging and testing for patients with low back pain when severe or progressive neurologic deficits are present or when serious underlying conditions are suspected on the basis of history and physical examination (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 4: Clinicians should evaluate patients with persistent low back pain and signs or symptoms of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis with magnetic resonance imaging (preferred) or computed tomography only if they are potential candidates for surgery or epidural steroid injection (for suspected radiculopathy) (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 5: Clinicians should provide patients with evidence-based information on low back pain with regard to their expected course, advise patients to remain active, and provide information about effective self-care options (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 6: For patients with low back pain, clinicians should consider the use of medications with proven benefits in conjunction with back care information and self-care. Clinicians should assess severity of baseline pain and functional deficits, potential benefits, risks, and relative lack of long-term efficacy and safety data before initiating therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). For most patients, first-line medication options are acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RECOMMENDATION 7: For patients who do not improve with self-care options, clinicians should consider the addition of nonpharmacologic therapy with proven benefits-for acute low back pain, spinal manipulation; for chronic or subacute low back pain, intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, yoga, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or progressive relaxation (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Diagnostic imaging for low back pain: advice for high-value health care from the American College of Physicians [^114hvKiN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnostic imaging is indicated for patients with low back pain only if they have severe progressive neurologic deficits or signs or symptoms that suggest a serious or specific underlying condition. In other patients, evidence indicates that routine imaging is not associated with clinically meaningful benefits but can lead to harms. Addressing inefficiencies in diagnostic testing could minimize potential harms to patients and have a large effect on use of resources by reducing both direct and downstream costs. In this area, more testing does not equate to better care. Implementing a selective approach to low back imaging, as suggested by the American College of Physicians and American Pain Society guideline on low back pain, would provide better care to patients, improve outcomes, and reduce costs.

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^116xcjhc]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Diagnostic tests for low back pain (LBP) — imaging and other diagnostic testing: Lumbar spine x-rays are not recommended in patients with LBP without red flags for serious spinal pathology within the first 4 to 6 weeks, and among patients with evidence of radiculopathy, imaging in the acute setting is also not recommended; however, an imaging study may be appropriate when limitations from consistent symptoms have persisted for 1 month or more or when potentially serious pathology or progressive neurologic deficit(s) are concerns. Pretest probability and test characteristics are critical, as lumbosacral spine MRIs are more likely to be "abnormal" by age 40 in normal individuals and herniated discs are not infrequently found in asymptomatic teenagers and young adults; at present, no single imaging modality shows a clear overall advantage, though MRI is superior for soft tissues including intervertebral disc herniations. In the absence of moderate- to high-quality studies, additional diagnostic tests for LBP and spinal conditions are Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I), Low Confidence.

### Diagnostic tests for low back disorders [^114GnoGL]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) clinical evaluation — history, physical examination, and red flags: No quality studies assess the utility and/or components of a history and physical examination; nevertheless, the Panel's consensus recommendation is that a careful history and physical examination is naturally important for appropriate evaluation and diagnosis. The initial assessment of LBP has a unique emphasis on 'ruling out' serious underlying conditions, and this process primarily relies upon the identification of red flags that in employed populations include trauma, history of cancer, immunosuppression, progressive neurological deficit, renal colic, and history of urinary tract infections. The absence of red flags and conditions generally rules out the need for specialist studies, referral, or inpatient care during the first 4 to 6 weeks. A comprehensive evaluation and documentation include history, prior treatment, vocation and avocational activities, functional level, medical and family history, social history including substance(s) use, review of systems, laboratory testing, and imaging studies. Evaluation using repeated end-range testing while monitoring for patterns of pain response determines the presence or absence of directional preference and pain centralization.

### Evaluation and treatment of acute low back pain [^111B5nVx]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Acute low back pain with or without sciatica usually is self-limited and has no serious underlying pathology. For most patients, reassurance, pain medications, and advice to stay active are sufficient. A more thorough evaluation is required in selected patients with "red flag" findings associated with an increased risk of cauda equina syndrome, cancer, infection, or fracture. These patients also require closer follow-up and, in some cases, urgent referral to a surgeon. In patients with nonspecific mechanical low back pain, imaging can be delayed for at least four to six weeks, which usually allows the pain to improve. There is good evidence for the effectiveness of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, heat therapy, physical therapy, and advice to stay active. Spinal manipulative therapy may provide short-term benefits compared with sham therapy but not when compared with conventional treatments. Evidence for the benefit of acupuncture is conflicting, with higher-quality trials showing no benefit. Patient education should focus on the natural history of the back pain, its overall good prognosis, and recommendations for effective treatments.

Diagnosis & Treatment of Low Back Pain — imaging: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against an association between low back pain and spondylosis using routine radiography (Grade of Recommendation: I). For computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of low back pain in the absence of x-ray/radiographic abnormality, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question. For whether duration of symptoms correlates with abnormal findings on imaging, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question.

### Low back pain investigations and prognosis: a review [^116pcDrz]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Low back pain is reviewed in terms of when investigations are useful and its clinical course. Despite the extensive evaluation of the accuracy of investigations such as radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and myelography, there is a surprising dearth of research to inform their use in primary care. There is no clear evidence on which to base judgments for selection of appropriate tests to confirm or exclude low back pain pathology. It appears that investigations are rarely necessary for low back pain. Specific investigations should be ordered to identify a particular pathology but should not be ordered routinely for general screening. In the absence of pathology, low back pain and its associated disability improve rapidly in the first weeks after onset, but, in contradiction to all guidelines, both commonly persist and the best evidence suggests that recurrences are common.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for radicular symptoms — MRI is not recommended for acute radicular pain syndromes in the first 6 weeks unless the problems are severe and not trending towards improvement assuming the MRI confirms a nerve root compression consistent with clinical examination and surgery is being considered. Repeat MRI imaging without significant clinical change in symptoms and/or signs is also not recommended (Moderately Not Recommended (B), Moderate Confidence). For subacute or chronic radicular pain, MRI is moderately recommended when symptoms last at least 4 to 6 weeks without improvement and prompt surgery is being considered, and MRI at 3 to 4 weeks (before the epidural steroid injection) may be reasonable (Moderately Recommended (B), Moderate Confidence).

VA/DoD Low Back Pain — red flags evaluation and recommendation: The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low for detection of serious spinal pathologies by history/symptoms or physical examination, but given the high likelihood of catastrophic harms from a failure to identify a serious underlying condition and that the life-preserving benefits of conducting a history and physical examination to identify red flags outweigh very small potential harms, it determined a Strong recommendation is warranted and decided upon a Strong for recommendation, noting that conducting a history and physical examination including assessment of neurological deficits and red flags is generally feasible and accepted. Supporting risk data indicate that the presence of multiple red flags increases the probability of fracture to between 42% and 90%, and that urinary retention signals higher risk of cauda equina syndrome (CES), which has an estimated prevalence of 0.04% among patients presenting with LBP, whereas in patients without urinary retention, the probability of CES was approximately 0.01%.

### Stratified care to prevent chronic low back pain in high-risk patients: the TARGET trial. A multi-site pragmatic cluster randomized trial [^116UAo8e]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

All adult patients (18 years or older) who presented at a participating primary care clinic with a primary complaint of LBP were eligible for screening. Patients who endorsed chronic symptoms based on a two-item LBP Questionnaire derived from the NIH Chronic LBP task force were ineligible. The questions included: 1) How long has low back pain interfered with your ability to do regular daily activities, and 2) How often has low back pain interfered with your ability to do regular daily activities? A response of "more than three months" to question one, and a response of "half the days or more than half the days" to question two defined chronic LBP. All remaining patients completed the nine-item STarTBack Tool, which produces two scores: an overall score and a distress subscale score, the latter of which focusses on five psychological obstacles to recovery (e.g. fear, anxiety, catastrophizing, etc.). Scoring four of five defined the high-risk group and coupled with a confirmatory primary encounter or ordering diagnosis of back pain in the EMR completed eligibility. Patients were excluded retrospectively if they presented with specific non-musculoskeletal causes of LBP (examples: cauda equina syndrome, cancer-related back pain, epidural abscess, or vertebral fracture). There were no changes to the eligibility criteria for patients after the trial began.

2.2 Interventions

For all participating primary care clinics, prior to recruitment we used educational outreach through grand rounds, staff meetings, and online modules to review acute LBP guidelines without monitoring or incentivizing adherence. Education was based on the most up to date guidelinesand included recommendations for a focused history and physical examination, with diagnostic imaging and testing not indicated unless signs of severe or progressive neurologic deficits or serious non-musculoskeletal conditions were present/suspected.

Clinics randomized to the intervention received enhanced usual care with specific instructions for immediate referral of high-risk patients to a stratified approach to care. In all study locations except one (BMC), referrals occurred through an automatic best practice alert (BPA) in the EMR triggered by scores from the STartBack tool. For two study sites (UPMC and IH), the order was electronically linked to an in-network, centralized physical therapy service or to an administrator who followed up with the patient to schedule the physical therapy. At the remaining sites, the referral was either printed in the patient's after visit summary to be given to the physical therapist or a patient navigator followed up with the patient to schedule physical therapy.

### Musculoskeletal imaging in physical therapist practice [^111xqsT4]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

This article presents an overview of current concepts of evidence-based diagnosis using a variety of imaging modalities for a broad spectrum of musculoskeletal conditions and syndromes. There is limited but increasing evidence that physical therapists appropriately use diagnostic studies in clinical practice. Pathology revealed by diagnostic studies must be viewed in the context of the complete examination, as pathology is common in the asymptomatic population. Special diagnostic challenges are presented by patients with areas of referred pain, multiple injuries or multiple areas of pathology, neoplasms, and infections. Plain film radiographs have been overused in the clinical management of many conditions, including low back pain. Clinical decision rules provide simple evidence-based guidelines for the appropriate use of imaging studies.

### Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for facet joint interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) guidelines facet joint interventions 2020 guidelines [^114qLZdU]. Pain Physician (2020). High credibility.

Facet joint pain — history, physical examination, and imaging are used to screen and inform testing, but clinical criteria have limited diagnostic accuracy. Many researchers have attempted to develop a series of diagnostic clinical criteria to establish the diagnosis of facet joint pain as cause of axial spinal pain, including unilateral or bilateral axial spinal pain associations, pseudoradicular pain, morning stiffness, pain on extension and rotation, negative neurological examination, and normal gait; however, the sensitivity and specificity of these criteria are very low. Even then, history and physical examination continue to be the fundamental for screening patients with low back pain, even though they cannot establish facet joint diagnosis as the specific cause of the pain, but provide suspicion of the diagnosis. Imaging is not very useful in identifying facet pain; however, imaging is necessary and useful in identifying red flags, disc herniation, and discogenic pain. A systematic review and pilot study to create a clinical diagnosis scale included 6 phases, utilizing a total of 36 signs and symptoms, and a total of 12, with 8 symptoms and 4 signs were included in the final survey.

### ACR appropriateness criteria on low back pain [^114Sn7hb]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute low back pain with or without radiculopathy is one of the most common health problems in the United States, with high annual costs of evaluation and treatment, not including lost productivity. Multiple reports show that uncomplicated acute low back pain or radiculopathy is a benign, self-limited condition that does not warrant any imaging studies. Guidelines for recognition of patients with more complicated status can be used to identify those who require further evaluation for suspicion of more serious problems and contribute to appropriate imaging utilization.

### Neuroimaging in low back pain [^117JLozJ]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Patients commonly present to family physicians with low back pain. Because the majority of patients fully or partially recover within six weeks, imaging studies are generally not recommended in the first month of acute low back pain. Exceptions include patients with suspected cauda equina syndrome, infection, tumor, fracture, or progressive neurologic deficit. Patients who do not improve within one month should obtain magnetic resonance imaging if a herniated disc is suspected. Computed tomographic scanning is useful in demonstrating osseous structures and their relations to the neural canal, and for assessment of fractures. Bone scans can be used to determine the extent of metastatic disease throughout the skeletal system. All imaging results should be correlated with the patient's signs and symptoms because of the high rate of positive imaging findings in asymptomatic persons.

Evidence notes that "most patients with lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy will improve with noninvasive management within four weeks", and that imaging "did not significantly improve outcomes in patients for whom there was no pretest concern for serious underlying conditions"; red flags analyzed "included suspicion or history of cancer, IV drug use, indwelling vascular catheter, and other infection sites". The Work Group observed that "the laboratory and imaging tests in question posed relatively little harm; however, there is enormous harm caused by failure to diagnose a serious pathology", and despite "very low quality evidence", "the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low", yet it "concluded this recommendation continued to merit a Strong for rating considering the high likelihood of catastrophic harms from a failure to identify a serious underlying condition that is causing LBP".

### Timing of physical therapy initiation for nonsurgical management of musculoskeletal disorders and effects on patient outcomes: a systematic review [^112KQvnM]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Background

Current US practice guidelines suggest an initial "wait-and-see" approach following onset of musculoskeletal pain, particularly for spinal pain. Several studies suggest that early, compared with delayed, initiation of physical therapy for musculoskeletal conditions may decrease health costs and improve outcomes.

Objective

To compare early and delayed initiation of physical therapy for individuals with musculoskeletal conditions and to assess effects on patient-important outcomes and cost.

Methods

MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science, and PEDro were the data sources. We included studies that compared early and delayed initiation of physical therapy for patients with musculoskeletal disorders. Studies in which early and delayed interventions differed were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted study characteristics and outcomes, and determined eligibility and quality through consensus with a third reviewer. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used in summary conclusions. Standardized effect sizes (d) and odds ratios were calculated to assess the effect strength of early versus delayed physical therapy for each included study.

Results

Of the 3855 articles initially screened, 14 studies were included. The majority of articles studied low back pain (only 2 articles studied cervical pain). For spinal pain, there was low-quality evidence that early versus delayed physical therapy was associated with decreased cost and decreased frequency of opioid prescriptions, advanced imaging, and surgeries without compromising patient-important outcomes. One subgroup analyzed showed improved function/disability with early physical therapy in an occupational health setting.

Conclusion

Although there were consistent results across studies favoring early physical therapy for decreased cost and medical utilization, quality was limited. Preliminary evidence suggests that early physical therapy may decrease cost without compromising outcomes. The primary limitation of the current research on this topic is in study design. Additional high-quality research involving prospective randomized designs and economic impact analyses is required to further investigate the outcomes associated with early initiation of physical therapy.

### Lumbar spine MRI for low back pain: indications and yield [^116i7t8Z]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Low back pain is one of the most common causes of physician visits in the United States with an enormous socioeconomic burden. Because of this burden, numerous studies have focused on its diagnosis and management. New technologies have been quickly adopted with the hope that they will improve our understanding of the physiopathology of the disease and assist us in alleviating patients' pain and discomfort. Unfortunately, previous studies have not been able to show that higher utilization of advanced imaging technology is associated with improvements in patient outcome. This article highlights practices that are evidence-based versus those that are common, or heterogeneous, but not supported by existing evidence. We also highlight outstanding areas for further research.

Conclusion

Clinicians and researchers should be encouraged to follow standardized practices in accordance with evidence-based medicine guidelines. The use of such guidelines will decrease variation in care, allowing researchers to more easily design and conduct comparative effectiveness studies of diagnostic imaging.

### Choosing wisely in physical medicine and rehabilitation: developing Canadian recommendations for resource stewardship [^115nn8Q5]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Choosing Wisely Canada aims to reduce potentially harmful or unnecessary diagnostic investigations and practices in healthcare delivery. A committee of the Canadian Association of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation surveyed the general membership seeking suggestions on new or revised Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations. Draft recommendations were revised and refined with an emphasis on resource stewardship and alignment with the Choosing Wisely Canada mission. The updated 2023 Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations for physical medicine and rehabilitation are to avoid: (1) investigating and treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with neurogenic bladder; (2) recommending more than a brief period of physical and cognitive rest after mild traumatic brain injury; (3) starting opioid treatment for chronic noncancer pain without exhausting other approaches; (4) ordering diagnostic imaging for low back pain in the absence of red flags; (5) repeating injections without evaluating patients' responses to them; and (6) recommending carpal tunnel release without first confirming nerve entrapment with electrodiagnostic studies or ultrasonography. We present unique implementation tools to equip practitioners with quality improvement strategies to adopt these recommendations into their practices. Future work will include developing recommendations that consider planetary health co-benefits, creating knowledge translation tools, and assessing the impact of recommendation adoption into clinical practice.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^115tgnSQ]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

Relevant History

The patient is a 90-year-old female with past medical history including a left sacral insufficiency fracture, thoracic vertebral compression fracture, and degenerative left medial meniscus tear, who presented with stabbing left lateral hip pain. The pain was chronic but had been progressing in severity over the past month. There was no inciting event or fall. The pain was exacerbated by lying on her left side and was affecting her sleep. At baseline, she ambulated with a rollator walker, but the pain was starting to limit her ability to walk. She had a history of low back and posterior left buttock pain, but she denied current pain in these regions. She also denied weakness or pain radiation into her lower extremities.

Relevant Physical Examination

On examination, she had no pain with lumbar or hip range of motion. She had full, symmetric, and pain-free lower extremity strength, and deep tendon reflexes and sensation to light touch were intact and symmetric in her lower extremities. She had a positive Trendelenburg sign with single-leg stance bilaterally, and she was tender to palpation over the left greater trochanter but not the right. Ober's, seated slump, and straight leg raise tests were negative. (See Figures 2 and 4 for descriptions of Ober's and the seated slump test.)

Figure 2
Ober's test: 1) The patient is positioned side-lying, and the leg to be tested is on top; the pelvis is stabilized perpendicular to the exam table by the examiner's hand; 2) The knee of the affected leg is passively flexed to 90°, and then the hip is passively stretched through abduction and extension (to position the iliotibial band behind the greater trochanter) by the examiner; (A) shows the view from above and (B) shows the anterior perspective; 3) The knee of the affected leg is allowed to slowly drop by gravity until reaching its final resting angle. If the final angle is greater than 0° when compared to the plane of the table (i.e. the hip is still abducted), Ober's test is positive; (C) highlights a negative Ober's test.

Imaging

Focused ultrasound performed by a musculoskeletal physiatrist with ultrasound training revealed evidence of bursitis of the left greater trochanter, which correlated with the patient's point of maximal tenderness.

Unlabelled

The rate of lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging in the United States is growing at an alarming rate, despite evidence that it is not accompanied by improved patient outcomes. Overutilization of lumbar imaging in individuals with low back pain correlates with, and likely contributes to, a 2- to 3-fold increase in surgical rates over the last 10 years. Furthermore, a patient's knowledge of imaging abnormalities can actually decrease self-perception of health and may lead to fear-avoidance and catastrophizing behaviors that may predispose people to chronicity. The purpose of this clinical commentary is as follows: (1) to describe an outline of the appropriate use, as defined in recent guidelines, of diagnostic imaging in patients with low back pain; (2) to describe how inappropriate use of lumbar spine imaging can increase the risk of patient harm and contributes to the recent large increases in healthcare costs; (3) to provide physical therapists with clear guidelines to educate patients on both appropriate imaging and information to dampen the potential negative effects of imaging on patients' perceptions and health; and (4) to present an example of a successful clinical pathway that has reduced imaging and improved outcomes.

### Management of chronic low back pain: rationales, principles, and targets of imaging-guided spinal injections [^111Ke7HV]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

If low back pain does not improve with conservative management, the cause of the pain must be determined before further therapy is initiated. Information obtained from the patient's medical history, physical examination, and imaging may suffice to rule out many common causes of chronic pain (eg, fracture, malignancy, visceral or metabolic abnormality, deformity, inflammation, and infection). However, in most cases, the initial clinical and imaging findings have a low predictive value for the identification of specific pain-producing spinal structures. Diagnostic spinal injections performed in conjunction with imaging may be necessary to test the hypothesis that a particular structure is the source of pain. To ensure a valid test result, diagnostic injection procedures should be monitored with fluoroscopy, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. The use of controlled and comparative injections helps maximize the reliability of the test results. After a symptomatic structure has been identified, therapeutic spinal injections may be administered as an adjunct to conservative management, especially in patients with inoperable conditions. Therapeutic injections also may help hasten the recovery of patients with persistent or recurrent pain after spinal surgery.

The clinical problem

The past two decades have seen a paradigm shift in the way we use imaging when managing low back pain (LBP). Imaging was once a routine part of the diagnostic workup for most cases of LBP. Evidence now indicates that imaging is useful only in the small subgroup of patients for whom there is suspicion of red flag conditions. These conditions include cancer, infection, inflammatory disease, fracture, and severe neurological deficits — which together account for only 5–10% of LBP presentations in primary care. For the remaining 90–95% of LBP cases (called non-specific or uncomplicated LBP), imaging will not guide management and can cause more harm than benefit. International guidelinesand "Choosing Wisely" campaigns now encourage a diagnostic triage approach to identify those patients who require imaging (box 1). Given these advances in knowledge, imaging rates for LBP should be decreasing, but recent systematic reviews show the opposite, reporting that imaging has increased over the past 20 yearsand that at least a third of all images are unnessary.

"Choosing Wisely" statements from different countries related to avoiding the use of routine imaging for low back pain

"Don't routinely image patients with low back pain regardless of the duration of symptoms unless: (a) there are clinical reasons to suspect serious underlying pathology (i.e. red flags), or (b) imaging is necessary for the planning and/or execution of a particular evidenced-based therapeutic intervention on a specific spinal condition". — Canadian Spine Society, Choosing Wisely Canada
"Do not undertake imaging for low back pain in patients without indications of a serious underlying condition". — Australian Rheumatology Association, Choosing Wisely Australia
"Do not routinely offer imaging in a non-specialist setting for people with low back pain with or without sciatica. Consider imaging in specialist settings of care (for example, a musculoskeletal interface clinic or hospital) for people with low back pain with or without sciatica only if the result is likely to change management". — Royal College of Physicians, Choosing Wisely UK

### Chronic low back pain in adults: evaluation and management [^111izsd2]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic low back pain, defined as lumbar pain persisting for 12 weeks or more, occurs in about 13% of U.S. adults. Patients with chronic low back pain should have a history and physical examination to identify red flags that may indicate serious conditions that warrant immediate intervention or yellow flags (i.e., psychological, environmental, and social factors) that indicate risk of disability. The examination should include an evaluation for radicular symptoms. Routine imaging is not recommended but is indicated when red flags are present, there is a neuromuscular deficit, or if pain does not resolve with conservative therapy. Patients should avoid bed rest. Nonpharmacologic treatment is first-line management and may include therapies with varying evidence of support, such as counseling, exercise therapy, spinal manipulation, massage, heat, dry needling, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and physical therapy. Pharmacologic interventions are second-line treatment. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the initial medication of choice; duloxetine may also be beneficial. Evidence is inconclusive to recommend the use of benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, corticosteroids, insomnia agents, anticonvulsants, cannabis, acetaminophen, or long-term opioids. Epidural corticosteroid injections are not recommended except for short-term symptom relief in patients with radicular pain. Most patients with chronic low back pain will not require surgery; evaluation for surgery may be considered in those with persistent functional disabilities and pain from progressive spinal stenosis, worsening spondylolisthesis, or herniated disk. Physicians should consider prevention of chronic low back pain when patients present with acute back pain. Screening tools are available to predict the progression from acute to chronic low back pain, and targeted treatment strategies are beneficial for preventing progression.

### Improving appropriate imaging for non-specific low back pain [^115KfSf5]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

In response, we sought to build awareness and enhance engagement and buy-in by conducting educational sessions with key ordering provider groups in internal medicine (eg, attending physicians, hospitalists and residents) to review clinical practice variabilities and share information from the Choosing Wisely campaign about avoiding imaging studies for acute non-specific LBP without specific indications.

During this first phase, all LBP imaging orders were examined to see if they met appropriate HEDIS criteria and to isolate where and why HEDIS quality measures may be lower than desired for acute non-specific LBP imaging orders. During clinic rounding, HEDIS criteria were communicated with providers to improve adherence and documentation.

For our next phase of the study, we implemented changes to the EMR. Prior to implementation, guidance was not provided for image ordering for non-specific LBP. Working with information technology, we developed CDS order sets and built practice alerts and reminders in the EMR to marry the clinical guidelines with our institution's order entry system that established a standardised workflow for non-specific LBP. A new order panel (see figure 1) was developed that required patients to meet specific criteria to minimise inappropriate imaging and improve guideline-adherent practice. After the history and physical examination of the patient, providers were required to answer a series of questions during the order entry process. Provider responses placed patients presenting with LBP into categories (eg, non-specific LBP; LBP associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis; LBP associated with other specific spinal causes) that included discrete indications for X-ray, MRI and CT scans based on evidence-based recommendations for appropriate imaging. As such, diagnostic imaging studies were to be performed only in those patients who have severe or progressive neurologic deficits or were suspected of having a serious or specific underlying condition (eg, cancer, trauma). Access to imaging was denied when providers did not document compliance with institutionally approved indications though providers were allowed to proceed with an override by entering an active acknowledgement for opposing recommendations.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low-back pain because of paraspinous muscle spasm: a physician roundtable [^112584zn]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the availability of evidence-based guidelines to diagnose and treat acute low-back pain, practical application is nonuniform and physician uncertainty regarding best practices is widespread.

Objective

The objective of this study was to further optimal treatment choices for screening, diagnosing, and treating acute low-back pain caused by paraspinous muscle spasm.

Methods

Four experts in pain medicine (three family physicians and one physiatrist) participated in a roundtable conference call on October 18, 2010, to examine current common practices and guidelines for diagnosing and treating acute low-back pain and to offer commentary and examples from their clinical experience.

Results

Participants discussed the preferred choices and timing of diagnostic and imaging tests, nonpharmacologic therapies, nonopioid and opioid medication use, biopsychosocial evaluation, complementary therapies, and other issues related to treatment of acute low-back pain. Principal clinical recommendations to emerge included thorough physical exam and medical history, early patient mobilization, conservative use of imaging tests, early administration of muscle relaxants combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to reduce pain and spasm, and a strong emphasis on patient education and physician-patient communication.

Conclusions

Early, active management of acute low-back symptoms during the initial onset may lead to better patient outcomes, reducing related pain and disability and, possibly, preventing progression to chronicity.

### Mechanical low back pain [^112ZkrWF]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Low back pain is usually nonspecific or mechanical. Mechanical low back pain arises intrinsically from the spine, intervertebral disks, or surrounding soft tissues. Clinical clues, or red flags, may help identify cases of nonmechanical low back pain and prompt further evaluation or imaging. Red flags include progressive motor or sensory loss, new urinary retention or overflow incontinence, history of cancer, recent invasive spinal procedure, and significant trauma relative to age. Imaging on initial presentation should be reserved for when there is suspicion for cauda equina syndrome, malignancy, fracture, or infection. Plain radiography of the lumbar spine is appropriate to assess for fracture and bony abnormality, whereas magnetic resonance imaging is better for identifying the source of neurologic or soft tissue abnormalities. There are multiple treatment modalities for mechanical low back pain, but strong evidence of benefit is often lacking. Moderate evidence supports the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and topiramate in the short-term treatment of mechanical low back pain. There is little or no evidence of benefit for acetaminophen, antidepressants (except duloxetine), skeletal muscle relaxants, lidocaine patches, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in the treatment of chronic low back pain. There is strong evidence for short-term effectiveness and moderate-quality evidence for long-term effectiveness of yoga in the treatment of chronic low back pain. Various spinal manipulative techniques (osteopathic manipulative treatment, spinal manipulative therapy) have shown mixed benefits in the acute and chronic setting. Physical therapy modalities such as the McKenzie method may decrease the recurrence of low back pain and health care expenditures. Physical therapy modalities such as the McKenzie method may decrease the recurrence of low back pain and use of health care. Educating patients on prognosis and incorporating psychosocial components of care such as identifying comorbid psychological problems and barriers to treatment are essential components of long-term management.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^114iscmr]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Early imaging for low back pain — evidence of harms: In a very large retrospective matched cohort (n = 405,965) of patients with non-specific lumbar pain, lumbar MRI performed within six weeks of symptom onset was associated with a higher probability of surgery, greater prescription opioid use, increased costs of care, and higher pain scores; the early MRI group was 13 times more likely to undergo lumbar surgery (1.48% versus 0.12%), and associated acute care costs were 1.4 times greater ($8,082 versus $5,560). In patients with low back pain without red flags, routine imaging led to increased costs, healthcare utilization, and absence from work, and imaging did not provide health benefits; the systematic review included "six RCTs and eight observational studies", and overall quality of evidence was "moderate with harms and burdens outweighing benefits".

Recommendations for "patients with low back pain" encompass patient populations with acute, subacute, or chronic LBP with or without neurological symptoms.

### Improving appropriate imaging for non-specific low back pain [^115tEBou]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Background

LBP is a common condition in the United States — approximately 80% of adults have LBP at some point during their life and roughly 30% of the adult population suffer from LBP at any given time. Although LBP is the most common cause of disability in the United States, it often has no identifiable anatomic or physiologic cause. Many patients seeking care for LBP receive lumbar spine radiography, CT or MRI. However, for most patients with acute non-specific LBP, symptoms resolve within 4 weeks and the use of routine imaging may result in unnecessary radiation exposure and add unnecessary costs and wasted time for patients without improved patient outcomes.

National quality guidelines, such as The National Committee of Quality Assurance's Health Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS), established the quality measure for use of image studies for LBP in efforts to improve rates of appropriate imaging in the healthcare setting. Despite these evidence-based guidelines, significant variability in clinical practice exists, with imaging studies often used to diagnose aetiology of acute non-specific LBP.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® back pain-child: 2024 update [^111ikCPa]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Nontraumatic back pain is a common chief complaint encountered in the pediatric population. Although there are many etiologies for pediatric back pain, most cases are attributable to benign mechanical causes. Serious conditions causing back pain such as inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic etiologies are much less common but these pathologies can lead to long-term morbidity. Recent paradigm shift to judicious use of diagnostic imaging resources has come to the forefront. Although imaging is unlikely to be beneficial in transient back pain without neurologic deficit and normal physical examination, prompt imaging evaluation is required when there are clinical and laboratory findings suggesting an infectious or neoplastic etiology. For this document, various clinical scenarios are discussed by which a child may present with back pain. Imaging studies that might be most appropriate (based on the best available evidence or expert consensus) in these clinical scenarios are detailed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^114VW3oB]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis & treatment of low back pain — guideline scope and development explains that although opioids are addressed, it is in a limited fashion, and this is the largest clinical guideline NASS has ever undertaken and four years in the making. The development included 82 clinical questions and the literature search resulted in more than 45,000 articles; due to the high volume of literature and the labor-intensive nature of the review, literature search dates are spread out in some instances (although most were within the same month), and consideration should be given to the fact that newer research has been published since the literature searches have taken place. The document is based on the evidence known at the time of the literature review, and evidence can be incomplete or immature and recommendations can change in the future where the current evidence is thin, weak, or evolving. Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition and inclusion/exclusion criteria, excluding conditions such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee; given these exclusions, the recommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed treatment protocol, should not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods, and the ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient.

### Neuroimaging in low back pain | AAFP… [^114pK5br]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

|Recent onset of bladder dysfunction Severe or progressive neurologic deficit in lower extremity| Patients who have experienced recent trauma should be considered for radiographic evaluation. Imaging studies are used to evaluate the extent of osseous, ligamentous, neural, and soft tissue injuries. The initial imaging study should be cost-effective and expeditious, and maintain a minimal diagnostic error rate. For these reasons, a radiographic series may be the most appropriate screening examination. Patients with infection or tumor should be initially screened with plain radiographs followed by MRI. These patients are generally on either end of the age spectrum, and physical examination may reveal unexplained weight change, fever, chills, night sweats, or a history of cancer. Immediate imaging is also necessary if the patient has — or is suspected of having — cauda equina syndrome. This condition is most common in persons between 30 and 40 years of age following an acute disc herniation.

Physical examination reveals low back pain with bilateral weakness of the lower extremity, saddle anesthesia, and bowel and bladder incontinence. These patients should undergo immediate MRI and be sent for surgical consultation. The initial radiographic series should be followed with MRI and/or CT if results of the screening examination or the physical examination are abnormal. In cases of neurologic deficit, CT and/or MRI scans should be obtained to depict the spinal cord and surrounding tissue. The superiority of CT in capturing details of osseous structures allows for thorough assessment of fractures. Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI has emerged as the procedure of choice for diagnostic imaging of neurologic structures related to low back pain.

Although a significant variation can exist in the quality of lumbar spine MRI images as a function of the imaging center and the image interpreter, 20 MRI is better than CT in showing the relationship of the disc to the nerve, and at locating soft tissue and nonbony structures. For this reason, it is better than CT at detecting early osteomyelitis, discitis, and epidural-type infections or hematomas. MRI provides high resolution, multiaxial, multiplanar images of tissue with no known biohazard effects. The only contraindication to MRI is the presence of ferromagnetic implants, cardiac pacemakers, intracranial clips, or claustrophobia. Two different types of images are generally obtained using MRI: T.

### Appropriate use of MRI for evaluating common… [^115U4bAq]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

The use of magnetic resonance imaging has become routine in the evaluation of musculoskeletal conditions. Originally, MRI was used mainly as a preoperative planning tool for patients thought to have surgical pathology based on history and physical examination. In recent years, however, MRI often has been used solely to establish a diagnosis, in many cases before any conservative treatment has been instituted. This practice raises the following questions: Is MRI overused in patients with musculoskeletal conditions. What are the indications for MRI. 1, 2 Shoulder pain is most often associated with conditions that do not require surgery. 3 Similarly, knee pain, especially without discrete trauma, is often secondary to nonsurgical conditions such as tendinopathy and patellofemoral syndrome.

4 The treatment for these common conditions — which usually involves muscle strengthening and stretching, and possibly physical therapy — would not be dependent on MRI results. Most patients will improve within a few weeks or months. 10 There are certain acute neck, back, shoulder, and knee conditions for which MRI should be considered after four to six weeks of conservative care if the findings could alter treatment. In patients who have neck and back pain with persistent radiculopathy or those who have loss of balance and gait problems indicative of cervical myelopathy, MRI can detect disk herniations or spinal stenosis that may benefit from more aggressive treatment. 1, 2. 11 MRI of the knee is indicated in younger patients who present with posttraumatic swelling and an inability to fully extend because they may have sustained a repairable buckethandle meniscus tear.

12, 13 Even in these acute situations when a patient presents with significant pain, MRI is not indicated immediately because the clinical picture may be worse than the actual pathology, and the patient may improve with four to six weeks of conservative care. For most patients, especially those who are older with less traumatic, more chronic problems, MRI is indicated only after a few months if conservative treatment has been ineffective. In these more chronic situations, MRI is useful for confirming the suspected pathology when a referral for surgery is contemplated. There will be a small percentage of patients who do not improve and in whom the diagnosis remains unclear. In these cases, MRI can be used to rule out surgical pathology. 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14.

### Imaging for low-back pain: rarely indicated, often harmful… [^116CB8ew]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: When should be diagnostic imaging be used for patients with low-back pain. Bottom Line: X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging for patients with low-back pain are associated with increased cost, poorer health in recipients, and an increased risk for surgery. Routine imaging of back patients is not warranted and, moreover, the indications for imaging are few: major risk factors for cancer, signs of cauda equina syndrome, and severe neurologic deficits. Radiography recommendations after a trial of therapy include weak risk factors for cancer, signs of ankylosing spondylitis in young patients, or vertebral fracture risk factors in older people. MRI should be limited to patients with radiculopathy or symptoms of spinal stenosis who don't respond to therapy. Using diagnostic tests for a putative therapeutic effect does not decrease patients' anxiety.

Study Design: Practice guideline Funding Source: Foundation Setting: Various. Synopsis: These guidelines are based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of research investigating the usefulness of various imaging studies in patients with low-back pain. Based on a meta-analysis of 6 studies, routine imaging with x-ray, MRI, or computed tomography in patients without underlying conditions does not have any effect on pain, function, quality of life, or patient-rated improvement, and, contrary to common wisdom, does not alleviate patients' anxieties about back pain. These studies were done in patients with and without radiculopathy. Several studies have demonstrated that patients who had routine imaging will have more pain and worse overall health status.

That's not to say that imaging won't pick up abnormalities; herniated or bulging discs and spinal stenosis are commonly found in asymptomatic patients, as well as in those with back pain, with up to 90% of asymptomatic individuals older than 60 years having a degenerated or bulging disc. Abnormal findings can lead to surgery that will not be effective since the exposed abnormality is simply coincident to the real cause of the pain. The guidelines suggest plain films, along with erythrocyte sedimentation rate determination for patients with major risk factors for cancer, and MRI for patients at risk for spinal infection, signs of cauda equina syndrome, or severe neurologic deficits, such as progressive weakness or motor deficits at multiple neurologic levels.

### Avoid imaging studies (MRI, CT or X-rays) for acute low… [^114dFCEQ]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Imaging for low back pain in the first six weeks after pain begins should be avoided in the absence of specific clinical indications. Most low back pain does not need imaging and doing so may reveal incidental findings that divert attention and increase the risk of having unhelpful surgery.
