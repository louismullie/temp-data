## Question

What are the criteria related to instrumental activities of daily living (iADLs) used in diagnosing a neurocognitive disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) criteria are used in diagnosing a neurocognitive disorder, how they differentiate mild versus major neurocognitive disorder, and how to assess them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the DSM-5 diagnostic framework that uses functional independence as the key discriminator. Then, I should verify the IADL versus basic ADL distinction and map functional criteria to mild and major categories. Next, I will review thresholds, domains, and validated instruments, including performance-based options. After that, I should consider cultural, baseline, and etiological nuances, and finally synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm that preserves these nuances and supports reliable staging and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic scaffold: DSM-5 and contemporary guidelines define mild versus major neurocognitive disorder primarily by the degree to which cognitive decline interferes with independence in everyday activities, with interference indicating major NCD and preserved independence despite inefficiency or compensatory strategies indicating mild NCD [^1131DwsG] [^116hpKhU] [^116r5oTg] [^1156i2xt].

> I need to check the distinction between instrumental and basic ADLs: IADLs are cognitively complex tasks such as managing finances, medications, transportation, shopping, cooking, communication, housekeeping, and technology use, whereas basic ADLs like bathing, dressing, and toileting are typically spared until later and become clearly impaired in major NCD as disease progresses [^113U9HK8] [^111DcJGf] [^111ibHr8].

> Next, I should review the DSM-5 functional criterion within each category: for mild NCD, there are noticeable difficulties with complex tasks, greater effort, inefficiency, or reliance on compensatory strategies, but independence is maintained; for major NCD, impairment interferes with independence and requires assistance or supervision in IADLs, with BADL decline more common as severity advances [^111DcJGf] [^116hpKhU] [^116r5oTg].

> Hold on, I should verify whether there is any numeric cutoff: DSM-5 and major guidelines deliberately avoid fixed IADL score thresholds and emphasize clinical judgment integrating history and testing; some cohort studies have used pragmatic cut points, such as pairing low MMSE with IADL scores of 7 or less to operationalize dementia, but these are research conventions rather than diagnostic rules, so I need to be careful not to overinterpret them [^116YXGbz] [^116hpKhU] [^117Y82ey].

> Let me consider the core domains to probe during history: finances, medication management, meal preparation, transportation and driving, shopping, communication and appointments, housekeeping and safety, and technology use, while also sampling advanced activities like work, hobbies, and travel for early detection of subtle decline [^113U9HK8] [^114yhgVH] [^111ibHr8].

> Next, I should review instruments: the Functional Activities Questionnaire is suited to mild impairment screening, the Lawton IADL scale remains widely used though dated and sometimes gendered, the Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire and its short version offer strong psychometric performance across the spectrum, and the ADCS-ADL and ADCS-ADL-MCI are commonly used in prodromal-to-mild AD, each with strengths and sensitivity limits in early disease that I should match to the clinical question [^113U9HK8] [^115A17Sp] [^1138WoVD] [^111nJgiZ] [^117GBSTf] [^114ZKW9k].

> Wait, let me verify performance-based options: when self-report or informant data are unreliable or discordant, direct observation tools such as the Performance Assessment of Self-Care Skills can discriminate normal aging from MCI on cognitively focused IADLs like shopping and checkbook balancing, reinforcing the value of triangulating informant report, performance-based assessment, and cognitive testing [^1166oKmB] [^116hpKhU] [^116r5oTg].

> I will now examine the interview method more closely: I need to ensure I obtain convergent history from the patient and an informant with concrete examples, timing, and trajectory of functional change, using specific prompts about whether tasks are harder than before and when abilities changed, because this anchors severity and progression and mitigates recall and insight bias [^113U9HK8] [^116hpKhU].

> But wait, what about individual baseline and culture: functional ratings must be interpreted against premorbid education, occupation, roles, and sociocultural context, with attention to biases in legacy scales and the need for cross-cultural adaptation and inclusion of modern, technology-based tasks to avoid misclassification across genders and diverse settings, including LMIC contexts [^116hpKhU] [^115HM7om] [^114yhgVH] [^112CXWbF] [^1167jdnK] [^115EmyNA].

> Next, I should review etiology-specific patterns and differentials: early IADL inefficiency often accompanies amnestic presentations of Alzheimer's disease, executive dysfunction may drive disproportionate IADL failure in vascular NCD, fluctuating cognition in Lewy body disease can yield variable IADL performance, and frontotemporal syndromes may degrade socially mediated IADLs via impaired judgment; major depressive disorder and other psychiatric conditions can also impair IADLs, so corroborating cognitive profiles, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and, when indicated, structural imaging is essential to refine etiology and exclude mimics [^113kYbTj] [^116BArHo] [^113RDJ2j] [^115RGt39].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical diagnostic algorithm: if there is no IADL impairment after thorough history, informant input, and appropriate testing, consider subjective cognitive decline or normal aging; if there is mild IADL difficulty with maintained independence using compensatory strategies, this supports mild NCD; if there is IADL dependence requiring assistance or supervision, this supports major NCD, after which I should integrate multidomain cognitive testing, evaluate for reversible contributors, and consider biomarkers or imaging when etiological clarification will change management [^111DcJGf] [^116hpKhU] [^116r5oTg] [^113RDJ2j].

> Let me summarize to ensure accuracy: the extent to which cognitively mediated IADL deficits interfere with independence is the central DSM-5 functional discriminator between mild and major neurocognitive disorder, and rigorous, culturally sensitive assessment using informant history, validated questionnaires, and performance-based tasks enhances diagnostic reliability, staging, and longitudinal monitoring while avoiding overreliance on any single cut score or instrument [^111DcJGf] [^116YXGbz] [^1138WoVD] [^114ZKW9k].

The diagnostic criteria for neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) require assessment of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) to distinguish between mild and major NCD [^1131DwsG]. Mild NCD involves **mild IADL impairment** that does not require assistance, whereas major NCD involves **significant impairment** that necessitates assistance [^111DcJGf] [^114NgTUV]. IADL assessment should use validated tools — such as the Lawton IADL scale [^114yhgVH], Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire [^1138WoVD], or Functional Activities Questionnaire [^113U9HK8] — and account for cultural, educational, and occupational factors [^115HM7om]. Accurate IADL evaluation is essential for **diagnosis, staging, and monitoring progression** in NCDs [^114ZKW9k] [^111ibHr8].

---

## Definition and importance of IADLs

IADLs are complex tasks essential for independent living, including managing finances, medications, transportation, shopping, meal preparation, housekeeping, and communication [^114yhgVH]. These activities require higher-order cognitive processes such as executive function, memory, attention, and problem-solving [^1131DwsG]. Impairment in IADLs is often the earliest **functional manifestation** of cognitive decline and is critical for differentiating between mild and major NCDs [^111DcJGf] [^1166oKmB].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for IADL impairment in neurocognitive disorders

The **DSM-5 [^1131DwsG] provides clear guidance** for differentiating mild and major NCDs based on the severity of IADL impairment:

| **Severity level** | **Definition of IADL impairment** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild NCD | - Mild impairment in IADLs <br/> - Does not require assistance <br/> - May need increased effort, compensatory strategies, or occasional support | - Independent living maintained <br/> - Early cognitive decline |
| Major NCD | - Significant impairment in IADLs <br/> - Requires assistance with complex tasks <br/> - Loss of independence | - Substantial functional decline <br/> - Requires caregiver support |

---

## Specific IADL domains assessed

The following IADL domains are **commonly assessed** in the diagnostic evaluation of NCDs [^114yhgVH]:

- **Financial management**: Paying bills, managing bank accounts, handling cash transactions.
- **Medication management**: Organizing, remembering, and correctly taking medications.
- **Transportation**: Driving, using public transportation, arranging rides.
- **Shopping**: Planning, purchasing, and managing groceries or other essential items.
- **Meal preparation**: Planning, preparing, and cooking meals.
- **Housekeeping**: Maintaining a clean and safe living environment.
- **Communication**: Using telephone, email, or other communication devices.

---

## Recommended assessment tools

Several **validated tools** are recommended for assessing IADL impairment in NCDs:

| **Assessment tool** | **Description** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| Lawton IADL scale [^114yhgVH] | - Widely used <br/> - Assesses eight IADL domains <br/> - Informant-based | - Simple <br/> - Quick <br/> - Effective for screening and monitoring |
| Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q) [^1138WoVD] | - Comprehensive <br/> - Proxy-based <br/> - Covers a wide range of cognitively complex IADLs | - Sensitive to early functional decline <br/> - Validated internationally [^115HM7om] |
| Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) [^113U9HK8] | - Informant-based <br/> - Assesses ten IADL domains | - Useful for detecting mild impairment <br/> - Monitoring progression |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the **importance of IADL assessment** in the diagnostic evaluation of NCDs. The EFNS recommends assessing IADL impairment due to cognitive decline as an essential part of dementia diagnosis [^1156i2xt]. The Alzheimer's Association recommends evaluating the impact of cognitive symptoms on IADLs and ADLs using validated instruments and informant reports [^113U9HK8] [^116r5oTg]. The DSM-5 [^111DcJGf] provides detailed examples of IADL impairments corresponding to specific cognitive domains to guide clinicians in differentiating mild and major NCDs [^1131DwsG].

---

## Clinical implications of IADL impairment

IADL impairment has **significant clinical implications**:

- **Diagnostic differentiation**: Helps distinguish mild NCD from major NCD and other cognitive disorders [^1131DwsG].
- **Prognostic value**: Predicts progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia [^113yxWLb].
- **Care planning**: Informs the level of support and interventions required for patients and caregivers [^116hpKhU].
- **Monitoring progression**: Essential for tracking disease progression and evaluating treatment effectiveness [^111ibHr8].

---

## Challenges and considerations

Despite the importance of IADL assessment, **several challenges exist**:

- **Lack of standardized criteria**: No universally accepted criteria [^111DcJGf] specify the number or type of IADLs that must be impaired, leading to variability in clinical practice [^114NgTUV].
- **Cultural and individual differences**: Assessment must consider cultural, educational, and occupational backgrounds to avoid bias [^112CXWbF].
- **Subjectivity**: Reliance on informant reports may introduce subjectivity, necessitating careful clinical judgment [^116Gf9Nj].

---

## Conclusion

IADL impairment is a **core criterion** for diagnosing neurocognitive disorders, differentiating mild from major NCDs. Mild NCD is characterized by IADL impairment that does not require assistance, whereas major NCD requires significant assistance. Accurate assessment using validated tools and clinical judgment is essential for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring progression [^116YXGbz].

### Detecting functional decline from normal aging to dementia: Development and validation of a short version of the Amsterdam IADL questionnaire [^111ibHr8]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2017). Low credibility.

Dementia is a syndrome characterized by progressive cognitive decline and significant interference in daily function. The first observable problems in daily life often concern the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). IADL can be defined as "complex activities for which multiple cognitive processes are necessary", such as cooking, managing finances, and driving. Detecting functional decline along the continuum from normal aging to dementia is highly relevant for a number of reasons. Subtle IADL problems may already be present in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and predict progression to dementia. This suggests that assessment of IADL can be used to select MCI subjects at an increased risk for dementia. Once a diagnosis has been established, measuring IADL performance remains essential for monitoring clinical progression. Finally, IADL assessment plays a pivotal role in clinical trials, particularly in the evaluation of symptomatic treatment in dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD).

IADL performance is often measured using proxy-based questionnaires. Unfortunately, most of these questionnaires suffer from serious limitations. They focus on everyday activities that are outdated and less relevant for patients in the early stages of dementia. Furthermore, psychometric properties such as reliability, validity, and responsiveness are often questionable or overlooked. Recent studies have pointed out that improvements in IADL instruments are necessary, especially for detecting IADL problems in MCI and the early stages of dementia.

### Detecting functional decline from normal aging to dementia: Development and validation of a short version of the Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire [^1138WoVD]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2017). Low credibility.

Detecting functional decline from normal aging to dementia is relevant for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Therefore, the Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q) was developed as a 70-item proxy-based tool with good psychometric properties. We aimed to design a short version while preserving its psychometric quality.

- **Methods**: Study partners of subjects (n = 1355), ranging from cognitively normal to dementia subjects, completed the original A-IADL-Q. We selected the short version items using a stepwise procedure combining missing data, Item Response Theory, and input from respondents and experts. We investigated internal consistency of the short version and concordance with the original version. To assess its construct validity, we additionally investigated concordance between the short version and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD). Finally, we investigated differences in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scores between diagnostic groups across the dementia spectrum.

- **Results**: We selected 30 items covering the entire spectrum of IADL functioning. Internal consistency (0.98) and concordance with the original version (0.97) were very high. Concordance with the MMSE (0.72) and DAD (0.87) scores was high. IADL impairment scores increased across the spectrum from normal cognition to dementia.

- **Discussion**: The A-IADL-Q short version (A-IADL-Q-SV) consists of 30 items and has maintained the psychometric quality of the original A-IADL-Q. As such, the A-IADL-Q-SV is a concise measure of functional decline.

### Psychometric evaluation of the A-NKS: A diagnostic instrument to assess impairment of activities of daily living in mild and major neurocognitive disorder according to DSM-5 [^111DcJGf]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

ADL and instrumental ADL (IADL) are distinct concepts: ADL refers to basic self-care tasks such as bathing and dressing, whereas IADL relates to more complex activities like managing finances and using transportation. A mild NCD diagnosis requires mildly impaired IADL, while a more severe impairment requiring support is a criterion for major NCD. In contrast, basic ADL remain stable over a longer period and are only severely impaired in major NCD, necessitating assistance.

Despite the diagnostic importance of ADL impairment in distinguishing between mild and major NCD, the method to identify this impairment is not specified in diagnostic guidelines, resulting in flexibility and uncertainty for clinicians assessing ADL functioning. This issue is also present when comparing dementia to mild cognitive disorder according to ICD-10, as only a few examples of ADL impairments associated with cognitive impairments in dementia are provided.

The German guidelines for diagnosing dementia recommend collecting a detailed self, third-party, family, and social assessment of ADL impairments. However, they lack specifications on how exactly ADL impairments should be assessed, such as the number and type of ADLs that must be impaired and the manner of their impairment.

The DSM-5 offers more detailed guidelines in this regard. For both mild and major NCDs, the DSM-5 provides comprehensive examples of possible ADL impairments corresponding to six specified neurocognitive domains (complex attention, learning and memory).

### Assessment of instrumental activities of daily living in patients with cognitive impairment based on their ability to use household appliances [^114yhgVH]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Low credibility.

Given that MCI is characterized by minimal impairments in IADL, evaluating these activities is critical for distinguishing between dementia and MCI. Additionally, assessing IADL remains essential even following a dementia diagnosis, as these impairments significantly influence the daily lives of both patients and caregivers and are thus essential for planning care needs, legal matters, and financial decisions. In summary, the assessment of IADL is important for both diagnostic purposes and follow-up care management.

The Lawton IADL scale, developed in 1969, remains a widely used tool by clinicians and researchers. This informant-based questionnaire provides valuable insights into the functional skills necessary for individuals to live independently within their community. The scale comprises eight items: telephoning, shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundering, use of transportation, use of medicine, and financial behavior. The IADL items form an eight-point scale for females and a five-point scale for males, as certain tasks in the scale, such as food preparation, housekeeping, and laundering, are deemed exclusive to females. However, there is a growing consensus among experts, such as Fessler et al, that the IADL scale requires updating to accurately reflect modern-day functional abilities to continue being used as a valid tool in clinical and research practice. The increased reliance on electrical devices today has altered the skills needed to perform daily activities compared to when the Lawton IADL scale was first introduced.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

Impairment in daily functioning is a core element of the diagnosis of dementia. The patient and informant should be queried about aspects of daily functioning that might be affected by impairments in the domains of learning and memory, language, attention, executive functioning, mental agility, spatial cognition, and psychomotor speed. In a patient with cognitive complaints, the clinician should carefully survey for examples of success or difficulty with complex instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).

The survey should include:

- **Advanced ADLs**: Management of financial matters, hobbies/work, technology, leisure, travel to unfamiliar areas.
- **IADLs**: Household tasks such as meal preparation, medication use, and driving.
- **Basic self-care activities**: Bathing, dressing, and toileting.

The clinician may ask the informant: "Does she/he (referring to the patient) carry out (then name the specific task)?" If the answer is yes, then ask: "Is it more difficult for her/him (the patient) to carry this out than in the past?" Additionally, ask: "How long has it been since you/your loved one has been able to do (then name the specific, individual functional task that they had previously been able to accomplish)?" and "What was performance at that time versus now?" This inquiry can solidify the clinician's understanding of the onset and trajectory of change in symptoms.

Several instruments have been validated to assess daily function. The Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) is one such instrument intended for mildly impaired persons.

### Can performance on daily activities discriminate between older adults with normal cognitive function and those with mild cognitive impairment [^1166oKmB]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine whether preclinical disability in the performance of cognitively focused instrumental activities of daily living (C-IADL) tasks can discriminate between older adults with normal cognitive function and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Secondarily, it aimed to determine the two tasks with the strongest psychometric properties and assess their discriminative ability to generate diagnosis-relevant information about cognitive changes associated with MCI and mild neurocognitive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria.

- **Design**: Secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from a cohort of individuals diagnosed with normal cognitive function or MCI.

- **Setting**: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

- **Participants**: Older adults with remitted major depression (N = 157).

- **Measurements**: Diagnosis of cognitive status was made at the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, University of Pittsburgh. Performance on eight C-IADLs was measured using the criterion-referenced, observation-based Performance Assessment of Self-Care Skills (PASS).

- **Results**: Ninety-six older adults with normal cognitive function (mean age 72.5 ± 5.9) and 61 with MCI (mean age 75.5 ± 6.3) participated. The eight C-IADLs demonstrated 81% accuracy in discriminating cognitive status (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.81, P < .001). Two tasks, shopping and checkbook balancing, were the most discriminating (AUC = 0.80, P < .001); they demonstrated similar ability as all eight C-IADLs in determining cognitive status.

### A new informant-based questionnaire for instrumental activities of daily living in dementia [^116qfgEY]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2012). Low credibility.

Interference in everyday functioning is part of the diagnostic criteria for dementia. Questionnaires measuring "instrumental activities of daily living" (IADL) are used to assess this interference, but the psychometric quality of these questionnaires is often questioned. Additionally, these questionnaires are less suited for early-onset patients. This is problematic given the high frequency of relatively young patients in memory clinics. In this article, we describe the development and psychometric properties of a new informant-based IADL questionnaire aimed at detecting incipient dementia and suitable for a broad age range.

- **Methods**: We defined IADL in consensus with experts and constructed items based on existing items and suggestions from experts and informants. Informants of subjects (n = 206) who visited the Alzheimer Center of the VU University Medical Center completed the questionnaire. We investigated factor structure using classical exploratory factor analysis and item response theory. Test-retest reliability was assessed in 73 informants using weighted κ values.

- **Results**: The questionnaire consisted of 75 items and was computerized to enhance ease of administration. Exploratory factor analysis supported a single-factor model, with 48.3% of the variance being explained by the first factor. We removed five items, as they did not fit the model. A high internal consistency was demonstrated. Test-retest reliability showed that the majority of items (87.9%) had substantial-to-almost perfect κ values.

### Diagnostic accuracy of instrumental activities of daily living for dementia in community-dwelling older adults [^115A17Sp]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

Many people living with dementia remain underdiagnosed and unrecognized, making screening strategies important for early detection.

- **Objective**: To examine whether the Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale, compared with other cognitive screening tools — the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Ascertain Dementia 8-item Informant Questionnaire (AD8) — can identify older (≥ 65 years) adults with dementia.

- **Design**: Population-based cross-sectional observational study.

- **Setting**: All 19 counties in Taiwan.

- **Participants**: Community-dwelling older adults (n = 10,340; mean age 74.87 ± 6.03).

- **Methods**: All participants underwent a structured in-person interview. Dementia was identified using National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association core clinical criteria for all-cause dementia. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the discriminant abilities of the IADL scale, MMSE, and AD8 to differentiate participants with and without dementia.

- **Results**: We identified 917 (8.9%) participants with dementia and 9,423 (91.1%) participants without. The discriminant abilities of the MMSE, AD8, and IADL scale (cutoff score: 6/7; area under curve = 0.925; sensitivity = 89%; specificity = 81%; positive likelihood ratio = 4.75; accuracy = 0.82) were comparable. Combining IADL with AD8 scores significantly improved overall accuracy: specificity = 93%; positive likelihood ratio = 11.74; accuracy = 0.92.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings support using the IADL scale to screen older community-dwelling residents for dementia, as it has discriminant power.

### Psychometric properties of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living for mild cognitive impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL) scale: A post hoc analysis of the ADCS ADC-008 trial [^117GBSTf]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). High credibility.

- **Methods**: The psychometric evaluation of the ADCS-ADL-MCI was undertaken using data from the ADCS ADC-008 trial, a 36-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in subjects with amnestic MCI.

- **Data source and analysis population**: All subjects were aged 55–91 years (inclusive) and met criteria for amnestic MCI of a presumably degenerative nature (insidious onset, gradual progression) defined as: 1) subjective memory complaint corroborated by an informant; 2) general cognition and functional ability sufficiently preserved so that a diagnosis of AD dementia or non-AD dementia could not be made; 3) abnormal memory function defined as scoring below the education-adjusted normative cutoff value on one paragraph from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory II subtest; 4) a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5; and 5) a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≥ 24. Clinical diagnosis was assigned absent biomarker evidence of disease pathology.

Eligible subjects who completed the screening visit and gave informed consent were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatment groups in a double-blind fashion: placebo plus a multivitamin daily (n = 259); Vitamin E (2,000 IU) plus a multivitamin daily (n = 257); or donepezil (10 mg) plus a multivitamin daily (n = 253). The primary outcome was the development of possible or probable AD dementia.

The science of evaluating an instrument's measurement properties does not consider the biological mechanism of the underlying disease process and is agnostic as to the reason.

### Changes in everyday function in individuals with psychometrically defined mild cognitive impairment in the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly Study [^113yxWLb]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2007). Low credibility.

To examine trajectories of change in everyday function for individuals with cognitive deficits suggestive of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), data from the longitudinal, multisite Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly Study was utilized. This allowed for post hoc classification of MCI status at baseline, using psychometric definitions for amnestic MCI, nonamnestic MCI, multidomain MCI, and no MCI.

The study was conducted across six U.S. cities and involved 2,832 volunteers (mean age 74; 26% African American) living independently, recruited from senior housing, community centers, hospitals, and clinics. Mixed-effect models examined changes in self-reported activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), using data from the Minimum Data Set Home Care Interview in 2,358 participants over a 3-year period.

In models for IADL performance, IADL difficulty, and a daily functioning composite, there was a significant time by MCI classification interaction for each MCI subtype. This indicates that all MCI groups showed faster rates of decline in everyday function than cognitively normal participants with no MCI.

The results demonstrate the importance of MCI as a clinical entity that not only predicts progression to dementia, but also predicts functional declines in activities that are key to autonomy and quality of life. MCI classification guidelines should allow for functional changes in MCI, and clinicians should monitor for such changes. Preservation of function may serve as a meaningful indicator of quality of life.

### Instrumental activities of daily living, amyloid, and cognition in cognitively normal older adults screening for the A4 study [^1167pow6]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Low credibility.

We examined the associations among instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), cortical amyloid, and cognition in cognitively normal (CN) older adults screening for the A4 Study (n = 4486). Participants underwent florbetapir (amyloid) positron emission tomography. IADL were assessed using the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Prevention Instrument. Separate logistic regression models were run with cortical amyloid or cognition as the independent variable and IADL as the dependent variable, adjusting for age and sex.

- **Results**: IADL difficulties were endorsed infrequently (≤ 16%). Overall IADL and four selected IADL item difficulties — "remembering appointments", "finding belongings", "following TV programs", and "remembering events" — reported by both participants and study partners were significantly associated with greater amyloid burden and worse cognition.

- **Discussion**: Although IADL deficits were infrequent in this CN cohort, greater participant and study partner reporting of overall IADL deficits and subtle difficulties in specific IADL items were associated with mildly higher amyloid burden and worse cognition.

### EFNS task force: the use of neuroimaging in the diagnosis of dementia [^113RDJ2j]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vascular cognitive impairment, more specifically with respect to brain imaging, EFNS 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining structural imaging at least once during the diagnostic work-up of patients with cognitive impairment for at least three purposes: to exclude other potentially treatable diseases, to recognize vascular lesions, and to identify specific findings that help distinguish different forms of neurodegenerative types of dementia.

### Research criteria for the diagnosis of prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies [^116BArHo]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Some published guidance on the early clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) already exists. DSM-5 recommends a diagnosis of mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) with Lewy bodies "for individuals who present with the core or suggestive features at a stage when cognitive or functional impairments are not of sufficient severity to fulfill criteria for major NCD". This recommendation is based on the 2005 version of DLB guidelines and requires updating. ICD-11 takes a similar approach toward diagnosing mild NCD at a syndromic level and lists both Lewy body disease and Parkinson's disease (PD) as possible causes.

The diagnostic position for other prodromal manifestations of DLB — such as delirium-onset and psychiatric-onset — is less clear than for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Operationalization of specific criteria for these syndromes is not yet justified, and the reliable differentiation of the minority of delirious and psychiatrically ill patients who have underlying Lewy body pathology from the majority who do not will probably only be achieved when routinely applicable biomarkers are developed. Lewy body disease is seldom, if ever, currently considered as part of the differential diagnosis of delirium or late-onset psychiatric disorder, and we hope the information provided in the text and accompanying boxes will raise clinicians' awareness of that possibility.

### The influence of diversity on the measurement of functional impairment: An international validation of the Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire in eight countries [^115HM7om]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Low credibility.

The Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire (A‐IADL‐Q) assesses cognitively complex IADLs that are prone to decline in incipient dementia. It covers a wide range of activities: the original version contains 70 items, while the short version (A‐IADL‐Q‐SV) has 30. Both the original and short versions were used in the included studies. We analyzed both versions, with a special focus on the short version, because all items from the short version are also included in the original and can therefore be compared between all participants.

Unlike many other IADL instruments, the A‐IADL‐Q has been validated extensively and has been shown to have good internal consistency, validity, and reliability. Furthermore, it appears to be independent of age and gender, and sensitive to change over time. The short version was developed to create a more concise measure, as well as to reduce potential cultural bias by only including widely relevant activities. International use of the A‐IADL‐Q is steadily increasing. All translations have undergone a cross‐cultural adaptation process based on procedures described by Beaton et al, in which experts and prospective users were asked to evaluate the translated instrument (a more detailed description of this process can be found in the Supplementary Material).

The questionnaire is scored using item response theory (IRT), which assumes that an instrument measures a latent trait, represented in a scale ranging from total absence to abundance.

### Psychometric evaluation of the A-NKS: A diagnostic instrument to assess impairment of activities of daily living in mild and major neurocognitive disorder according to DSM-5 [^1164xa57]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Individuals with major NCD showed less physical and cognitive activity compared to other groups. Those with mild NCD exhibited less impairment in activities, as assessed by two items of the EQ-5D. Depressive symptoms were lowest in cognitively healthy individuals and highest in individuals with major NCD. This finding was also reflected in autonomy.

### Instrumental activities of daily living scales to detect cognitive impairment and dementia in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review [^111hpNJM]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Low credibility.

- **Strengths and limitations of this review**: A significant strength of this review was our comprehensive and rigorous search strategy (see Supplementary Material) and use of multiple electronic databases to identify potential articles for inclusion. We also hand-searched reference lists of all included articles to maximize the scope of our search. We carried out independent title, abstract, and full-text screening and all disagreements were adjudicated by a third reviewer. Our quality assessment indicated that, although most diagnostic accuracy studies included demonstrated some risk of bias, overall, they showed moderate-good quality.

However, we only included articles available in English due to limited resources and may not have captured all relevant IADL tools for LMICs. For example, we have limited representation of Asian countries despite significant work reported on cognitive assessments in Asia. Additionally, we excluded studies which combined IADL questions with cognitive assessments within one tool (e.g. Everyday Cognition Scale) as they did not fall within the strict remit of our review question. These tools could also be considered within the diagnostic process in LMICs, and further investigation should determine how useful they may be.

A variety of IADL tools were assessed within this review across a diverse range of populations. As such, a meta-analysis was inappropriate to conduct at this time but may be useful in the future when greater evidence bases are built for discrete measures. At this time, the evidence for any tool is limited by inconsistencies in valid research.

### Influencing factors on instrumental activities of daily living functioning in people with mild cognitive disorder - a secondary investigation of cross-sectional data [^116TEUME]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Due to demographic changes worldwide, preventing disability caused by neurocognitive impairment is a public health priority. However, it is not fully understood what contributes to disability in persons with neurocognitive impairment and, consequently, how to counteract disability with non-pharmacological interventions. Dementia refers to a family of neurological diseases leading to memory loss and impaired cognitive function severely enough to affect the performance of everyday activities in daily life. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and shows different progressive severity stages, e.g. mild, moderate, and severe AD.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is described as the transient state between normal cognitive aging and dementia. It has widely been used in clinical and research settings to define and study the early stages of dementia. MCI is characterized by no dementia, with a subjective and clinically manifest decline in one or more domains of cognition greater than expected for age, with no or only minor impairments in performing instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). A significant challenge in clinical care is making a clear distinction between MCI and mild AD since overlap occurs between the two conditions. Furthermore, the distinction between cognitively healthy older persons, MCI, and mild AD is also based on how impaired cognition affects daily life activities; however, no clear cut-offs have been proposed. Therefore, everyday functioning is an important clinical and diagnostic feature of mild forms of cognitive decline.

### Assessment of instrumental activities of daily living in patients with cognitive impairment based on their ability to use household appliances [^115xPuTF]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: The study included outpatient participants who sought treatment at the Memory Clinic with their caregivers at Kyoto University Hospital between April 2022 and June 2023 or the Center of Neurological and Cerebrovascular Diseases, Koseikai Takeda Hospital, between January and March 2023. The sample consisted of 98 community-dwelling patients experiencing subjective or objective cognitive impairment.

- **Subjects**: Patients diagnosed with dementia or MCI were evaluated by board-certified neurologists specializing in AD and related disorders. The diagnoses were based on the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIAAA) workgroup diagnostic criteria/Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria, and Petersen's criteria. Various cognitive tests, such as the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), Trail Making Test (TMT), and Clock Drawing Test (CDT), were used as reference findings, along with the logical memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) to detect detailed memory impairment. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) was defined as a self-reported decline in cognitive functions, especially memory, without formal deficits on neuropsychological testing. Patients with amnestic MCI were selected as it is considered an earlier stage of AD.

In this study, the participants were divided into two groups based on their medical diagnosis: the non-dementia group (SCD–MCI) and the dementia group.

- **Exclusion criteria**: The exclusion criteria included the following:
	1. Patients with severe ADL impairment requiring constant assistance.

### Apathy, but not depression, predicts all-cause dementia in cerebral small vessel disease [^117Y82ey]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

- **All-cause dementia diagnosis**: Dementia was defined using the DSM-5 definition of major neurocognitive disorder. Participants were diagnosed with dementia if they met one of the following criteria: dementia was diagnosed in a memory clinic or equivalent clinical service; there was panel consensus between a neurologist and clinical neuropsychologist that the clinical picture met DSM-5 criteria for dementia after blind review of medical records and cognitive assessments; or if the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was less than 24, indicative of cognitive impairment, and the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) score was 7 or less, indicating reduced capabilities in daily living.

	- The date of dementia was defined as the date of diagnosis. If this was unknown, and the diagnosis was based on review of medical records or cognitive performance, the midpoint date between the visit at which the diagnosis was established and the previous visit was used.

- **Radboud University Nijmegen Diffusion Tensor and Magnetic Resonance Cohort**: Dementia was defined using DSM-IV-TR criteria, which is broadly synonymous with the DSM-5 definition of major neurocognitive disorder. Dementia was considered present if it was diagnosed in a memory clinic or equivalent clinical service; there was a panel consensus between a neurologist, clinical neuropsychologist, and geriatrician that the clinical picture met DSM-IV-TR criteria for dementia after blind review of medical records and cognitive assessments; or if the MMSE score was less than 24 and the IADL score was 7 or less.

### Contribution of a multicomponent intervention on functional capacity and independence on activities of daily living in individuals with neurocognitive disorder [^116VB7Xo]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The eligibility criteria for participants were defined as follows: Individuals needed to be aged 60 years or older, and they must have been clinically diagnosed by a physician for at least six months with a major neurocognitive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR or DSM-5), with dementia according to the ICD-10, or per the NINCDS-ADRDA. Additionally, they needed to have the ability to walk autonomously without the need for an assistive device or human assistance.

The exclusion criteria included individuals diagnosed with any condition or disorder for which exercise is contraindicated, such as unstable or ongoing cardiovascular, respiratory, or musculoskeletal conditions. Recent hospitalization within the previous month, recovering from surgery, or rehabilitation were also grounds for exclusion. Furthermore, individuals presenting an advanced stage of major neurocognitive disorder (e.g. a score of 10 or less on the MMSE) that could affect physical performance during exercise training sessions or testing procedures were excluded.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, specifically concerning diagnostic criteria, the AAP 2019 guidelines recommend diagnosing ADHD according to the DSM-5 criteria. This includes documentation of symptoms and impairment in one or more major settings (social, academic, or occupational), relying on information drawn primarily from reports from parents or guardians, teachers, other school personnel, and mental health clinicians involved in the patient's care. It is crucial to rule out any alternative cause.

### Cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments of function in prodromal-to-mild Alzheimer's disease: A comparison of the ADCS-ADL and A-IADL-Q scales [^114ZKW9k]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). High credibility.

Per regulatory guidance from both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, the assessment of function in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for establishing the efficacy of novel AD therapeutics. Currently, the most widely used instrument for measuring function in AD clinical trials is the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study–Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS‐ADL). While the ADCS‐ADL appears to be sufficiently sensitive to consistently detect treatment‐related changes in the rate of functional decline in moderate AD dementia, poorer sensitivity is seen at earlier stages of the disease, such as mild AD dementia.

As interventions for AD, particularly those targeting amyloid beta (Aβ), increasingly focus on patient populations at earlier stages of the disease, the continued utility of the ADCS‐ADL for clinical trials in prodromal (i.e. mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) to mild (i.e. mild AD dementia) AD remains uncertain. One approach used in recent trials in prodromal‐to‐mild AD is to implement modified versions of the ADCS‐ADL that have either been optimized for MCI (ADCS‐ADL‐MCI) or focus on instrumental activities of daily living (iADLs), which become impaired at earlier stages of disease progression (ADCS‐iADL). However, even these modified versions of the ADCS‐ADL have only inconsistently demonstrated treatment benefits for functional outcomes with interventions that have more robustly shown efficacy on global and cognitive endpoints.

An alternative approach has been to develop novel functional assessments th

### Defining benefit: Clinically and biologically meaningful outcomes in the next-generation Alzheimer's disease clinical care pathway [^115YDQhJ]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

Utilizing treatment benefits detected in early stages of disease to measure outcomes across the AD continuum, core clinical features commonly assessed in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) trials are cognition, function, and behavior, which are differentially affected across the AD continuum. Several clinical measures have been used as trial outcomes to assess these clinical features. However, many existing clinical assessment tools require expert administrative experience and have limited sensitivity to subtle changes in the preclinical or early stages of AD, where patients tend to exhibit slow and variable progression. These challenges can be exacerbated by high variability in baseline functioning, cognitive ability, and educational and cultural backgrounds of patients, as well as floor and ceiling effects of many of the clinical assessment tools. Similarly, many common scales used in clinical practice lack sensitivity to detect change in patients with biomarker confirmation of AD yet display few symptoms.

Although a variety of tools are available for use in clinical trials for early AD, not all of them are practical for use in real-world clinical practice (and vice versa). For example, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is commonly used in routine clinical practice to assess cognitive changes in early AD, but it is not widely used in clinical trials as an outcome assessment. On the other hand, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale 13 items (ADAS‐Cog‐13), a modified version of the ADAS‐Cog‐11 that includes a delayed word recall task and a number cancellation task to increase sensitivity, is often used in research settings.

### Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): Executive summary of recommendations for primary care [^116hpKhU]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

In most cases, the goal of the evaluation process is to determine whether the patient has a diagnosable brain disease affecting cognition or behavior. The first step — a determination that a person does or does not have dementia — is critical for the clinician. This allows them to discuss whether the patient needs or will likely need specific supports, including surrogate decision-makers.

Differentiating between cognitive–behaviorally impaired versus unimpaired states requires clinical judgment. The determination that a person has mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia (or mild vs. major neurocognitive disorder in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition [DSM‐5] terminology) is the first step of a diagnostic formulation. This requires the clinician to integrate reliable history regarding the types, trajectory, and impact of changes in cognitive, behavioral, and daily activity functions with the patient's performance on tests of cognitive function in multiple domains (attention, memory, language, executive function, visual function, socio‐emotional behavior).

The patient's symptoms and performance on tests are influenced by various individual factors that must be considered. These include education, occupation, culture, living situation, family or other relationship dynamics, developmental history, and medical and psychiatric comorbidities.

### Advances in management of neuropsychiatric syndromes in neurodegenerative diseases [^113kYbTj]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A similar strategy for the diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th edition. This approach defines major neurocognitive disorder as having evidence of significant decline from past cognitive ability, impairment of cognitive performance sufficient to interfere with activities of daily living (ADL), and not exclusively explained by a delirium or some other mental disorder.

The clinical symptoms include memory impairment, language abnormalities, visuospatial disturbance, executive dysfunction, attention impairment, and social cognition decline. The inclusion of social cognition as a key feature allows major cognitive disorder to be identified by a decline in empathy, sympathy, social judgment, responsiveness to social cues, and appropriate social behavior. Major neurocognitive disorder due to AD requires the presence of memory impairment plus impairment of at least one of the other domains. In this setting, compromised social cognition in addition to memory impairment would allow fulfillment of the clinical criteria for major neurocognitive disorder due to AD.

- **Core clinical features of DLB**: There are four core clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), two of which must be present to allow a diagnosis of DLB in a patient with progressive cognitive decline. These core features include fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, and parkinsonism. One can make a diagnosis with no behavioral features based on fluctuating cognition and parkinsonism, but behavioral features including hallucinations and REM sleep behavior disorder need to be considered as well.

### Current and future prevalence estimates of mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and its subtypes in a population-based sample of people 70 years and older in Norway: The HUNT study [^111L2i7Q]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment

For each individual, two experts from a diagnostic work-up group of nine medical doctors with comprehensive scientific and clinical expertise in geriatrics, old-age psychiatry, or neurology made independent diagnoses of dementia and mild cognitive impairment by applying the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. If no consensus was reached after comparing the diagnosis between the two experts, a third expert was consulted. The diagnostic work-up group had access to all the available data.

Participants were categorized into one of four groups: no cognitive impairment, amnestic MCI, non-amnestic MCI, or dementia. Amnestic MCI was diagnosed when the predominant cognitive symptom was memory impairment, whereas non-amnestic MCI was diagnosed when other cognitive symptoms were dominant, with a relative sparing of memory. Furthermore, people with a diagnosis of dementia were categorized as having Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), Lewy body dementia (including dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia) (LBD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), mixed dementia, other specified dementia, or unspecified dementia. We did not have access to any biological data, so dementia subtypes were mainly determined based on information about clinical symptoms and symptom course from the next of kin. Standard diagnostic criteria according to the DSM-5 were applied for MCI (mild neurocognitive disorder), dementia (major neurocognitive disorder), and all the dementia subtypes. Mixed dementia was defined as dementia.

### Instrumental activities of daily living scales to detect cognitive impairment and dementia in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review [^112VF54c]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Low credibility.

Data was synthesized according to the type of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) tool that each study employed: translated, translated and adapted, and newly developed for a target population. This approach was determined after reviewing all studies included in this review.

- **Translated tools**: IADL tools used and/or validated in another country and language, directly translated into a target language (e.g. English to Portuguese).

- **Translated and adapted tools**: IADL tools used and/or validated in another country and language, translated into the target language using a cross-cultural approach. This involves adapting terminology or changing items to ensure appropriateness for the target culture.

- **Newly developed tools for a target population**: IADL tools specifically developed for the population being studied, usually through consensus processes to ensure that items included are appropriate and relevant to the culture (e.g. inclusion of "tying lower garments appropriately" in Indian populations).

All studies included in this review reported reliability, validity, and/or diagnostic accuracy:

- **Reliability**: internal consistency (such as Cronbach's alpha), test-retest, inter-rater (including ICCs, Pearson/Spearman correlations)

- **Validity**: concurrent, construct, convergent, discriminative (such as between-group comparisons)

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: criterion validity, sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values, area under the curve (AUC)

### Evidence for the utility of actuarial neuropsychological criteria across the continuum of normal aging, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia [^113bdSPp]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Low credibility.

According to ADNI criteria, a CN diagnosis requires the presence or absence of subjective memory complaints, verified by a study partner, beyond what one would expect for age. It also requires documented normal memory function by scoring above education-adjusted cutoffs on the Logical Memory II subscale (Delayed Paragraph Recall, Paragraph A only) from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R; ≥ 9 for 16 or more years of education; ≥ 5 for 8–15 years of education; and ≥ 3 for 0–7 years of education), a Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score between 24–30 (inclusive), a CDR® Dementia Staging Instrument score of 0, and the absence of significant impairment in cognitive functions or activities of daily living.

A MCI diagnosis requires a subjective memory concern reported by the participant, study partner, or clinician, documented abnormal memory function by scoring below education-adjusted cutoffs on the WMS-R Logical Memory II subscale (< 11 for 16 or more years of education; < 9 for 8–15 years of education; and ≤ 6 for 0–7 years of education), a MMSE score between 24–30 (inclusive), a CDR score of 0.5, and general cognition and functional performance that are sufficiently preserved such that a diagnosis of AD cannot be made.

Dementia (due to AD) diagnosis requires a subjective memory concern reported by the participant, study partner, or clinician, documented abnormal memory function by scoring below education-adjusted cutoffs on the WMS-R Logical Memory II subscale (≤ 8 for 16 or more years of education; ≤ 4 for 8–15 years of education; and ≤ 2 for 0–7 years of education), a MMSE score between 2.

### Psychometric evaluation of the A-NKS: A diagnostic instrument to assess impairment of activities of daily living in mild and major neurocognitive disorder according to DSM-5 [^112Fbk8s]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Activities of daily living (ADL) functioning are essential in diagnosing neurocognitive disorders (NCD). However, no standardized and validated instrument exists based on international classification systems.

- **Objective**: We aimed to psychometrically evaluate the differentiated assessment of ADL and instrumental ADL (IADL) impairments due to NCD according to DSM-5 criteria (Instrument für die Erfassung von Alltagsbeeinträchtigungen bei Neurokognitiven Störungen; A-NKS).

- **Methods**: We conducted a pilot study involving 92 participant-informant dyads — composed of participants with mild or major NCDs, cognitively healthy individuals, and an informant — to test acceptability, internal consistency, and convergent validity with similar measures.

- **Results**: Both A-NKS versions demonstrated excellent internal consistency (α = 0.95–0.99) and correlated with other instrumental ADL instruments: participant [informant]: Barthel Index: rs = -0.26, p ≤ 0.05 [rs = -0.30, p ≤ 0.01]; Amsterdam IADL: rs = 0.59, p ≤ 0.01 [rs = 0.48, p ≤ 0.01]; SIDAM ADL: rs = 0.46, p ≤ 0.001 [rs = 0.47, p ≤ 0.001]. Additionally, there are correlations with the scale autonomy of the WHOQOL-OLD (rs = -0.50, p ≤ 0.001 [rs = -0.37, p ≤ 0.001]) and physical, as well as cognitive activities (rs = -0.39, p ≤ 0.001 [rs = -0.50, p ≤ 0.001]). The instrument was well-accepted by participants and informants.

- **Conclusions**: The A-NKS possesses acceptable psychometric properties to assess ADL due to neurodegenerative decline in both healthy individuals and those with mild or major NCD. Further research is needed to confirm reliability and validity and to investigate additional aspects.

### Sex differences in the relation between subjective memory complaints, impairments in instrumental activities of daily living, and risk of dementia [^114ucqxu]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Because the competing risk of death may be a major etiological factor in the relationship between cognitive and/or IADL symptoms and dementia, specifically when assessing sex differences, we assessed the influence of the competing risk of death using a cause-specific hazard approach. This involved repeating all analyses with mortality and mortality/dementia combined as outcomes. This approach was favored over a subdistribution hazard approach (e.g. Fine-Gray analysis) because we were interested in the etiological relations between IADL, SMC mortality, and dementia. For this, the cause-specific approach is the most appropriate, as it allows for evaluation of the extent to which a decrease in dementia risk associated with a predictor might be due to an increase in mortality.

To assess sex differences in HRs, risks for dementia, mortality, and dementia-mortality combined were first assessed in the total population, and subsequently in subgroups for men and women separately. To determine whether the association between SMC/IADL-I and each outcome status differed significantly between men and women, we used p-values from interaction terms with sex for the individual SMC/IADL categories using dummy variables in the overall population (i.e. isolated SMC (yes/no) * sex; isolated IADL (yes/no)-I * sex; and SMC + IADL-I (yes/no) * sex). Furthermore, we tested the differences between models including and not including these interaction terms with likelihood-ratio tests to assess the p-value for the overall interaction of sex with SMC/IADL-I groups.

### Detecting functional decline from normal aging to dementia: Development and validation of a short version of the Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire [^115mvkbR]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2017). Low credibility.

- **Subjects**: We selected 1355 subjects with different levels of cognitive functioning, ranging from normal cognition (NC) to dementia. Their study partner, mainly a spouse, relative, or friend, completed the Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q). We included subjects from the neurologic memory clinics of the VU University Medical Center (VUmc) Alzheimer Center in Amsterdam, The Netherlands (n = 1117), and the Alzheimer Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands (n = 32), along with subjects from the geriatric memory clinic of the VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands (n = 102). All subjects underwent a comprehensive dementia assessment, including clinical history, medical and neurologic examination, screening laboratory tests, a neuropsychological test battery, and brain imaging. During these visits, study partners completed the A-IADL-Q on an iPad. Subjects' diagnoses were established in a multidisciplinary diagnostic meeting that included at least a neurologist or geriatrician.

- **Cognitively normal subjects**: We included subjects (n = 104) from the Amsterdam site of the preclinAD cohort of the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease project. Inclusion criteria for this cohort were age ≥ 60, modified telephone interview for cognitive screening > 22, Geriatric Depression Scale -1.5 standard deviation of age-adjusted normative data, and a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 with a score on the memory subdomain of 0. During the baseline visit, study partners completed the A-IADL-Q on an iPad.

Data were collected between October 2012 and August 2016. All subjects provided written informed consent.

### Instrumental activities of daily living scales to detect cognitive impairment and dementia in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review [^111nJgiZ]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Low credibility.

The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study–Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADLS) is a 23-item informant-based scale that includes assessments of basic activities of daily living (BADLs, 6 items), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs, 10 items), and advanced ADLs (7 items). Each item is rated as either dependent, partially independent, or totally independent, with a maximum score of 79 points, where lower scores reflect greater impairments. It requires approximately 12 minutes to administer.

Two studies assessed the ADCS-ADLS by translating it into Turkish and Portuguese, conducted in Turkey and Brazil, respectively. For the Turkish version, only minor adjustments to wording were made. For the Brazilian version, an expert committee applied changes to the format of questions, cultural expressions, and vocabulary, and added one sub-item. This adapted ADCS-ADLS Brazilian version was tested in community dwellers with and without cognitive impairment, which led to the removal of "selecting/choosing clothes" and modification of "eating with knives and forks" to "eating independently". People with dementia made up 44% of Aysun et al.'s sample, and 35% of Cintra et al.'s sample, with an additional 34% having mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Mean education ranged from 3.6–5.7 years across the samples.

Cintra et al. reported diagnostic accuracy measures for the Brazilian ADCS-ADLS. Using a cut-off score of 71, dementia could be distinguished from controls with 97% sensitivity, 70% specificity, 78% positive predictive value, and 95.4% negative predictive value (AUC: 0.841).

### Concordance between self-report and performance-based measures of everyday functioning in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders [^116Gf9Nj]. AIDS and Behavior (2017). Low credibility.

Self-report is typically used to differentiate between asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI) and mild neurocognitive disorder (MND) in the assessment of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Yet, it is unclear whether the lack of self-reported functional impairments in individuals with ANI is indicative of a genuine absence of functional impairment or inaccurate self-reports.

In the present study, we examined the relationship between previously validated self-report measures, such as the patient's assessment of own functioning inventory and the instrumental activities of daily living inventory, and performance-based measures like the Texas Functional Living Scale. The study included 112 virologically controlled HIV-infected and 40 well-matched, HIV-uninfected participants. Participants with symptomatic cognitive impairment (CI) had significantly lower overall scores and higher rates of impairment on a performance-based measure of everyday functioning compared to participants with either asymptomatic CI or normal cognitive performance (WNL [within normal limits]; all p < 0.05). Meanwhile, asymptomatic CI and WNL participants had comparable rates of impairment and performance within the average range on the performance-based measure.

The concordance between self-report and performance-based measures of everyday functioning in asymptomatic and symptomatic CI supports ANI and MND as clinically distinct diagnostic entities. This also supports the use of self-reports as appropriate measures of everyday functioning in the diagnosis of HAND.

### Psychometric evaluation of the A-NKS: A diagnostic instrument to assess impairment of activities of daily living in mild and major neurocognitive disorder according to DSM-5 [^117WdYJr]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

The aim of our study was to investigate the psychometric characteristics of the A-NKS, an instrument designed to assess ADL impairments specifically based on the diagnostic specifications of the DSM-5. Assessing ADL impairment is crucial for diagnosing mild and major NCD, particularly to distinguish between these two forms. ADL functioning is a decisive criterion: in major NCD, ADL impairment caused by cognitive difficulties is required, while in mild NCD, cognitive deficits do not or only minimally interfere with the capacity for independence.

We found a very good acceptance of the A-NKS by the target population, demonstrated by a high agreement regarding the length of the individual items, the length of the instrument, and the applicability of the answer categories. Moreover, the low number of missing values in our study also indicates a high acceptability of the A-NKS. This further supports the notion that the A-NKS is a well-received instrument for assessing ADL impairments in individuals with mild and major NCD according to DSM-5 criteria.

- **Internal consistency**: The internal consistency of the A-NKS is at an excellent level for both participant- and informant-rated versions.
- **Convergent validity**: Regarding convergent validity, the hypothesized associations were mostly confirmed for both A-NKS versions. For the informant-rated A-NKS, all expected associations were confirmed except for the correlation between the RMET and the A-NKS subscale "social cognition", which was also not confirmed for the participant-rated version.

Additionally, in the participant-rated A-NKS, no significant findings were observed.

### The Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): Validated clinical assessment instruments [^116r5oTg]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

The Alzheimer's Association convened a Diagnostic Evaluation, Testing, Counseling and Disclosure Clinical Practice Guideline Workgroup (the DETeCD‐ADRD CPG Workgroup). Our emphasis is on good clinical practice for the process of evaluating a patient presenting with an illness (i.e. symptoms, obtained through history, and signs, obtained through examination) that may represent the clinical manifestations of common brain diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) — in some cases with exacerbating medical conditions or factors. While this guideline applies to a patient with any severity of cognitive or behavioral impairment, it does not consider individuals who do not have symptoms; therefore, it does not address the topic of screening in asymptomatic people. This DETeCD‐ADRD CPG seeks to empower all clinicians, including those in primary, specialty, or subspecialty care, to implement a structured yet individualized patient‐centered approach to diagnostic evaluation that includes clear communication with the patient and an informant or care partner(s).

For any given individual, the differentiation of what is a cognitive–behaviorally impaired versus an unimpaired state requires clinical judgment. The determination that a person has mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia (or Mild versus Major Neurocognitive Disorder in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition terminology) is the first step of a diagnosis that requires the clinician to integrate reliable history regarding the types and trajectory of the symptoms.

### Proposition of a corrected measure of the Lawton instrumental activities of daily living score [^1167jdnK]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease or related disorders are a main cause of functional decline, with the diagnosis of a major neurocognitive stage defined as a significant cognitive decline that interferes with independence in activities of daily living, as presented in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) criteria. Functional decline in older adults leads to institutionalization and increased health care costs, as well as shifting many daily responsibilities to caregivers and increasing their burden. The accuracy of the functional abilities assessment is therefore one of the key features in the diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders and their changes, as well as in research studies aiming to assess the effect of interventions to delay functional decline.

Among the several scales available to measure the level of functional abilities, and in the lack of consensus, the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale has been widely adopted and is usually part of the evaluation in clinical practice in the memory centers in France. The Lawton IADL scale was developed to assess more complex abilities of daily living necessary for living independently in the community; nonetheless, there is limited information on its psychometric properties. Additionally, the original Lawton IADL scale displays some limitations as it does not account for the possibility of having never performed one or several assessed activities, which could potentially underestimate the overall patient's functional level.

### Instrumental activities of daily living scales to detect cognitive impairment and dementia in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review [^112CXWbF]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Low credibility.

The largest proportion of people with dementia worldwide live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with dementia prevalence continuing to rise. Assessment and diagnosis of dementia involve identifying the impact of cognitive decline on function, usually measured by instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).

This review aimed to identify IADL measures specifically developed, validated, or adapted for use in LMICs to guide the selection of such tools.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was conducted across fourteen databases up to April 2020. Only studies reporting on the development, validation, or adaptation of IADL measures for dementia or cognitive impairment among older adults (aged over 50) in LMICs were included. The QUADAS 2 was used to assess the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies.

- **Results**: Twenty-two papers met the inclusion criteria, identifying 19 discrete IADL tools across 11 LMICs. These tools were either translated from IADL measures used in high-income countries (n = 6), translated and adapted for cultural differences (n = 6), or newly developed for target LMIC populations (n = 7). Seven measures were investigated in multiple studies; the overall quality of diagnostic accuracy was moderate to good.

- **Conclusion**: The reliability, validity, and accuracy of IADL measures for supporting dementia diagnosis within LMICs were reported. Key components to consider when selecting an IADL tool for such settings were highlighted, including choosing culturally appropriate, time-efficient tools that account for gender and literacy biases and can be conducted by any volunteer.

### Classifying neurocognitive disorders: The DSM-5 approach [^1131DwsG]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Neurocognitive disorders, including delirium, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia, are characterized by a decline from a previously attained level of cognitive functioning. These disorders have diverse clinical characteristics and aetiologies, with Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, Lewy body disease, frontotemporal degeneration, traumatic brain injury, infections, and alcohol abuse representing common causes. This diversity is reflected by the variety of approaches to classifying these disorders, with separate groups determining criteria for each disorder on the basis of aetiology.

As a result, there is now an array of terms to describe cognitive syndromes, various definitions for the same syndrome, and often multiple criteria to determine a specific aetiology. The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) provides a common framework for the diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders, first by describing the main cognitive syndromes, and then defining criteria to delineate specific aetiological subtypes of mild and major neurocognitive disorders.

The DSM-5 approach builds on the expectation that clinicians and research groups will welcome a common language to deal with neurocognitive disorders. As the use of these criteria becomes more widespread, a common international classification for these disorders could emerge for the first time, thus promoting efficient communication among clinicians and researchers.

### Mild cognitive impairment — beyond controversies, towards a consensus: Report of the International Working Group on Mild Cognitive Impairment [^114NgTUV]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The First Key Symposium was held in Stockholm, Sweden, from 2–5 September 2003. The aim of the symposium was to integrate clinical and epidemiological perspectives on the topic of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A multidisciplinary, international group of experts discussed the status and future directions of MCI with regard to clinical presentation, cognitive and functional assessment, and the role of neuroimaging, biomarkers, and genetics. Agreement on new perspectives, as well as recommendations for management and future research, were discussed by the international working group.

The specific recommendations for the general MCI criteria include the following:

- **The person is neither normal nor demented**: There is evidence of cognitive deterioration shown by either objectively measured decline over time and/or subjective report of decline by self and/or informant in conjunction with objective cognitive deficits.
- **Activities of daily living are preserved**: Complex instrumental functions are either intact or minimally impaired.

### The Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): Validated clinical assessment instruments [^116YXGbz]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

For example, the diagnosis of dementia may be straightforward in a formerly high-functioning patient whose family reports an insidious onset of impaired memory and executive function with impairment in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and who scores a 20/30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Yet, this first step in the diagnostic formulation may be very challenging in a symptomatic and highly educated person who reports memory loss impacting occupational function but performs in the unimpaired range on a brief cognitive assessment test like the MoCA. Such an individual may require a neuropsychological evaluation to document impaired performance or establish a baseline that can serve to track changes. Unlike the diagnosis of anemia, hyperkalemia, or proteinuria, there is no test value that determines the diagnosis of MCI or dementia — it requires integration of multiple layers and types of information and, importantly, clinical judgment.

In some cases, a patient with cognitive concerns may be documented to perform normally on a detailed neuropsychological evaluation; such a person might be classified as having "subjective cognitive decline", a clinical construct being studied extensively by an international research community. In other cases, a patient has developed an acquired change in personality or behavior but is found to be cognitively intact; such a patient might be classified as having "mild behavioral impairment", another clinical construct being evaluated by the research community.

The second step — determination of cognitive–

### Neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease are the main determinants of functional impairment in advanced everyday activities [^113DwP8d]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment are independent contributors to functional impairment in activities of daily living (ADL) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. ADL can be divided according to its complexity into three subdomains: basic (BADL), instrumental (IADL), and advanced (a-ADL).

The objective of the study was to examine the cognitive and neuropsychiatric determinants of BADL, IADL, and a-ADL in both normal cognitive elders and AD patients.

The methods involved assessing 144 subjects using the clinical dementia rating (CDR). The cohort included CDR = 0, n = 52 (control group); 92 AD patients with CDR = 0.5, n = 34; and CDR = 1&2, n = 58. These individuals were evaluated through measures of cognitive performance and neuropsychiatric symptoms, which were incorporated into regression models to determine the best predictors for each ADL subdomain at every CDR status.

The results indicated that AD patients were significantly older, and exhibited considerably more severe functional impairment, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and cognitive decline compared to controls. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were the strongest predictors of functional impairment in controls and CDR = 0.5 AD patients, with apathy severity being the most crucial determinant of IADL and a-ADL impairment in the latter group. Conversely, in CDR 1&2 AD patients, cognitive impairment was the primary determinant of functional impairment, with memory being the best predictor of IADL and a-ADL impairment, while global cognition was the key determinant for BADL impairment.

In conclusion, the contribution of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms varied according to the ADL subdomain and CDR. In very mild AD cases and controls, the influences differed.

### Adlarity [^115JPfqV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The ability of donepezil to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), a multi-item instrument that has been extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients. The ADAS-cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language, and praxis. The ADAS-cog scoring range is from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Elderly normal adults may score as low as 0 or 1, but it is not unusual for non-demented adults to score slightly higher.

The patients recruited as participants in each study had mean scores on the ADAS-cog of approximately 26 points, with a range from 4 to 61. Experience based on longitudinal studies of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease suggests that scores on the ADAS-cog increase (worsen) by 6–12 points per year. However, smaller changes may be seen in patients with very mild or very advanced disease since the ADAS-cog is not uniformly sensitive to change over the course of the disease. The annualized rate of decline in the placebo patients participating in donepezil trials was approximately 2 to 4 points per year.

### Frontal hypometabolism in neurocognitive disorder with behavioral disturbance [^117NTS32]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Criteria for the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) include decreased frontal metabolism. FDG-PET was used to investigate whether patients with neurocognitive disorder and behavioral disturbance (bvNCD), who did not fulfill three bvFTD criteria, had a characteristic brain metabolic pattern.

- **Methods**: Patients were referred from a memory clinic to nuclear medicine for the differential diagnosis of NCD with dysexecutive syndrome and predominant mild frontal atrophy. Patients were classified into two groups before FDG-PET: probable bvFTD (n = 25) or bvNCD (n = 27) when only two bvFTD criteria were met.

- **Results**: Voxel-based and multivariate PLS analyses of FDG-PET did not show significant between-group differences at inclusion. After 4.8 years of follow-up, most patients with probable bvFTD received the same diagnosis; three remained very stable, and one participant was given a psychiatric diagnosis. Five patients with bvNCD fulfilled criteria for probable bvFTD at a 4.4 years mean follow-up, while two participants remained very stable and three received alternative neurological or psychiatric diagnoses. When initial FDG-PETs were compared between groups stratified at follow-up (26 bvFTD versus 17 bvNCD), there was a trend (p < 0.001 uncorrected) for lower prefrontal with relatively preserved premotor metabolism in bvFTD compared to bvNCD. Twelve bvNCD participants had neuropsychological testing before inclusion. They all presented executive dysfunction and normal visuospatial performance, and most (n = 9) had memory encoding impairment. Frontal hypometabolism was observed.

### The relationship between neurocognitive and psychosocial functioning in major depressive disorder: a systematic review [^115RGt39]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Neurocognitive deficits are demonstrated in major depressive disorder (MDD) and most likely contribute to the functional impairment experienced by affected individuals. We systematically reviewed the evidence on neurocognitive deficits and their relationships to psychosocial functioning in MDD. English-language literature was searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Direct, and PsycInfo databases for the years 1980 to October 15, 2013, using the following terms:

- **Depressive disorder**: depressive disorder, depressive disorder, major

- **Cognitive terms**: cognitive, neurocognitive, neuropsych*

- **Impairment terms**: impairment, deficit, performance, test

- **Outcomes and assessments**: quality of life; functional outcomes; outcome assessment, health care; assessment, outcomes; assessment, patient outcomes; outcomes assessment; outcomes assessments, patient

- **Study selection**: Inclusion criteria were (1) nongeriatric adults (< 60 years) with a primary diagnosis of MDD by DSM-IV, ICD-9, or ICD-10 criteria; (2) use of neuropsychological tests; and (3) use of a specific measure of social, occupational, or daily functioning. Of 488 articles identified in the initial search, 10 met the inclusion criteria.

- **Data extraction**: Two independent appraisers assessed the eligibility of the studies. Substantial heterogeneity in the samples and methods precluded a quantitative meta-analysis, so we performed a narrative descriptive review.

The included studies employed a variety of neurocognitive tests and assessments of psychosocial functioning. Overall, depressed samples exhibited neurocognitive deficits in various domains.

### Evidence for the utility of actuarial neuropsychological criteria across the continuum of normal aging, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia [^117MVwLD]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Low credibility.

A different set of criteria, termed "consensus" criteria, are implemented by the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). According to NACC criteria, a CN diagnosis requires that the participant does not meet criteria for MCI or dementia. To render an MCI diagnosis, the diagnosing clinician or team must determine if memory impairment is present (i.e. a cognitive complaint is supported by evidence of impairment or decline that is not normal for age, yet functional activities are essentially normal, and the extent of impairment/decline is not sufficient to warrant a dementia diagnosis), based on clinical judgment and/or neuropsychological memory tests. The same clinical and/or psychometric approach is applied to determine whether other cognitive domains are also impaired. Standard criteria for dementia due to AD or for other non-AD dementia disorders are used to guide dementia diagnoses.

The NACC consensus criteria are more consistent with standards of MCI classification (which include complaints of cognitive impairment or decline, objective evidence of cognitive impairment in any domain, and preserved activities of daily living) but are distinct from the specific diagnostic methods used in ADNI in that they do not require memory impairment for a diagnosis and are therefore more amenable to the heterogeneity of MCI. However, both the consensus approach and the conventional approach leave room for subjectivity in diagnostic decision-making given their use of cognitive and functional screening measures and heavy reliance on clinician judgment.

### Applying the HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder diagnostic criteria to HIV-infected youth [^111Wzv87]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to apply the HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) criteria for diagnosing HAND in HIV-infected adults to a cohort of HIV-infected youth. This was done to establish whether this system is able to detect a spectrum of neurocognitive disorders (ND) in HIV-infected youth.

- **Methods**: We used a comprehensive pediatric neurocognitive battery, an assessment of functional competence, and the American Academy of Neurology system for diagnosing ND in a cross-sectional study. The participants included HIV-infected youth (n = 86) and HIV-negative controls (n = 34) to establish whether this system could detect a spectrum of ND in HIV-infected youth aged 6–16 years.

- **Results**: Compared to a well-matched control group of HIV-negative youth, HIV-infected youth performed significantly more poorly on tests of verbal IQ, full scale IQ, processing speed, finger tapping, verbal memory, expressive language, cognitive flexibility, and inhibition. HIV-infected youth were also more likely to have impaired total competence on the Child Behavior Checklist. Using the criteria for HAND, we found that 45.35% of the 86 HIV-infected youth could be diagnosed with an ND. Furthermore, youth with HIV encephalopathy (HIVE) were 9.4 times more likely to have a diagnosis of a major ND compared to HIV-infected youth without HIVE.

- **Conclusions**: The HAND criterion designed for adults was able to identify youth with important functional cognitive impairments who do not fit the criteria for HIVE and would therefore not have been identified otherwise. This has major clinical implications regarding the importance of identifying such cognitive impairments in HIV-infected youth.

### The Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): Executive summary of recommendations for specialty care [^112sjf8n]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

In most cases, the goal of the evaluation process is to determine whether the patient has an identifiable brain disease affecting cognition or behavior, formulated in three steps. For any given individual, differentiation of what is cognitively behaviorally impaired versus an unimpaired state requires clinical judgment.

The first step of the diagnostic formulation is to determine whether a person has subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild behavioral impairment, or dementia (or mild vs. major neurocognitive disorder in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition terminology; see Table 1 of companion article for primary care). This first‐level diagnosis requires the clinician to integrate reliable history regarding the types, trajectory, and impact of changes in cognitive, behavioral, and daily activity functions with the patient's performance on tests of cognitive function in multiple domains (attention, memory, language, executive function, visual function, socio‐emotional behavior).

The patient's symptoms and performance on tests are both influenced by a variety of individual factors that have to be considered, including education, occupation, culture, living situation, family or other relationship dynamics, developmental history, and medical and psychiatric comorbidities. This first step is critical for the clinician to be able to evaluate whether the patient needs or may need specific support, including a surrogate decision-maker(s).

### EFNS guidelines for the diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease [^1156i2xt]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). High credibility.

The EFNS 2010 guidelines emphasize the importance of assessing cognitive decline's impact on activities of daily living as a critical component of the diagnostic criteria for dementia. This assessment should be included in the diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease, focusing on potential cognitive impairment.
