## Question

what should i do with a rectal abscess

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do about a rectal (anorectal) abscess. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and assessing severity. Then, I should determine urgency and timing of intervention. Next, I will plan source control with incision and drainage, including anatomic approach and wound care. After that, I need to decide about antibiotics and when they are indicated. I will then evaluate whether to address a concomitant fistula at the time of drainage. I should also consider special populations such as immunocompromised patients and those with Crohn's disease. Finally, I will outline postoperative care, recurrence prevention, and follow-up, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity through history and examination, because anorectal abscess is primarily a clinical diagnosis and I need to ensure I'm not missing mimics or deeper disease. I should ask about pain, swelling, fever, and urinary retention, and inspect for erythema, fluctuance, and induration, while palpating gently to localize tenderness and assessing for systemic toxicity; deeper supralevator or high ischiorectal abscesses may present with referred perineal, buttock, or low back pain and minimal local findings, so I should keep a high index of suspicion in those scenarios [^1175VPj3] [^111ZtJ9H].

> Wait, let me verify whether imaging is needed now or later. Routine imaging is not required for straightforward perianal or ischiorectal abscesses, but I should obtain MRI, CT, or endoanal ultrasound if the presentation is atypical, if I suspect a supralevator component, if the patient is immunocompromised, or if there is recurrent or complex disease suggesting fistula; MRI is particularly helpful for mapping complex fistulas and secondary extensions, and combining modalities can improve accuracy when Crohn's disease is suspected [^112a4E6N] [^111bviTr] [^111D73BA] [^112QHLxA].

> Next, I should review urgency and timing. I need to ensure prompt surgical drainage for any anorectal abscess, ideally within 24 hours of presentation when the patient is stable, because delays increase recurrence and complications; if there is sepsis, necrotizing soft tissue infection risk, or immunocompromise, I should not delay and must proceed emergently after initiating sepsis care and broad-spectrum antibiotics when indicated [^1171Dzox] [^115kbXLr] [^1114Wpcr].

> Hold on, I should verify the source control strategy by anatomy. For most perianal and ischiorectal abscesses, I will perform incision and drainage through the overlying skin, keeping the incision as close to the anal verge as feasible to shorten any potential fistula tract; for intersphincteric abscesses, I should drain internally into the anal canal or intersphincteric groove; for supralevator abscesses, I must determine origin — if from cephalad extension of an ischiorectal abscess, I drain externally, whereas if from an intersphincteric source, I drain internally through the rectal wall to avoid creating a complex extrasphincteric fistula; for horseshoe abscesses, I should avoid primary lay-open fistulotomy and consider a modified Hanley approach with posterior midline partial sphincterotomy and seton placement to preserve function [^115tUE9N] [^1162reht].

> I need to check the role of antibiotics carefully. Routine antibiotics after uncomplicated drainage in immunocompetent patients do not improve healing or prevent recurrence, so I should avoid them; however, I should give antibiotics when there is surrounding cellulitis, systemic infection, immunosuppression, diabetes with poor control, or high-risk features, and I should consider MRSA coverage in the right epidemiology; if used, typical regimens target gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic flora, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or metronidazole plus a fluoroquinolone, tailored to local resistance and patient factors [^112Ppxfq] [^112cnWiA] [^1153wkw9] [^113xx2J3].

> But wait, what if a fistula is present at the time of drainage? I should confirm whether the fistula is simple and low, because concomitant fistulotomy can be considered in carefully selected patients with a simple, low transsphincteric or intersphincteric fistula and normal sphincter function, as it reduces recurrence at the cost of a small risk of continence disturbance; however, for complex fistulas, high fistulas, anterior fistulas in women, or any uncertainty, I should avoid immediate fistulotomy and instead place a loose draining seton to control sepsis and defer definitive repair; I must also avoid aggressive probing during the acute drainage to prevent iatrogenic false tracts [^115doqEc] [^111dP4Bm] [^1115yLc7] [^115oWPSD].

> Let me consider special populations, especially Crohn's disease. I should double-check for proctitis and rectal involvement at the time of drainage, because active proctitis worsens outcomes and changes management; in Crohn's-associated abscess or fistula, I should drain sepsis and place a loose seton before initiating anti-TNF therapy, as combined surgical and medical therapy improves healing and reduces recurrence; anti-TNF agents such as infliximab have robust evidence for fistula closure, and I should coordinate with gastroenterology for multidisciplinary care and rectal assessment during EUA or with imaging when needed [^114U6DhP] [^116S2r44] [^1171b9c7] [^11428WRW].

> I should confirm postoperative wound care. Routine packing is not recommended; if needed for hemostasis, I can use initial packing and then transition to dry dressings, keeping the wound open to heal by secondary intention; sitz baths and analgesia support comfort and hygiene, and I need to counsel on recurrence risk and signs of early failure such as persistent pain, swelling, or drainage that might herald a missed loculation or evolving fistula [^115wCgbY] [^1114Wpcr].

> Next, I should review recurrence prevention and follow-up. Recurrence after drainage can approach 44%, particularly with inadequate drainage, loculations, horseshoe configuration, or failure to address the underlying fistula; I should arrange follow-up in 2 to 4 weeks to reassess for fistula and consider MRI or endoanal ultrasound if anatomy is uncertain or disease recurs, and I should maintain vigilance for Crohn's disease in younger patients, those with complex or recurrent fistulas, or atypical features, using fecal calprotectin, colonoscopy, or small-bowel imaging as indicated [^113VZBFQ] [^111bviTr] [^112rcX98].

> Hold on, I should verify that my antibiotic stance aligns with evolving guidance. While older studies suggested a possible reduction in fistula formation with post-drainage antibiotics, more recent randomized data do not show a consistent benefit, and current guidelines restrict antibiotics to complicated cases; therefore, I should individualize based on cellulitis, systemic signs, host factors, and local epidemiology, and avoid reflexive antibiotics in uncomplicated, immunocompetent patients after adequate drainage [^112Ppxfq] [^1176WiSp].

> In summary, I need to ensure the core steps are explicit: diagnose clinically with selective imaging, drain promptly with an anatomic approach, avoid routine antibiotics, manage fistulas selectively with setons for complex disease, tailor care for Crohn's and immunocompromised patients, and follow closely for recurrence and fistula evolution, adjusting the plan based on response and new findings [^1171Dzox] [^112a4E6N] [^112Ppxfq] [^114U6DhP] [^113VZBFQ].

For a rectal abscess, **prompt surgical drainage is essential** [^116r9gJR] to prevent progression to sepsis or fistula formation [^113xx2J3]. Antibiotics are only used if there is **cellulitis, systemic infection, or immunosuppression** [^112cnWiA] [^111Q8Drm]. After drainage, **wound care** with sitz baths, hygiene, and pain control is standard; routine packing is not recommended [^115wCgbY]. Recurrence is common, so monitor for fistula and arrange follow-up; if a fistula is found, refer for definitive repair [^113VZBFQ] [^111aNsK3].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Rectal abscesses typically present with:

- **Pain**: Severe, localized, worsening with defecation or sitting [^notfound].
- **Swelling**: Perianal erythema, induration, or fluctuance [^114njSMX].
- **Systemic signs**: Fever, chills, malaise, especially with deeper abscesses [^113xx2J3].
- **Urinary retention**: Due to pain and swelling [^111ZtJ9H].

Diagnosis is primarily **clinical** [^1175VPj3], supported by digital rectal examination and anoscopy. Imaging (MRI, CT, or endoanal ultrasound) is reserved for complex, recurrent, or unclear cases [^112a4E6N] [^111D73BA].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgical drainage is indicated for all rectal abscesses because delayed treatment increases the risk of recurrence, chronic fistula, and systemic infection [^1171Dzox]. Urgency depends on severity: **emergent drainage** is required for sepsis, immunosuppression, diabetes, or necrotizing infection, whereas **urgent drainage within 24 hours** is appropriate for stable patients without sepsis [^1162reht] [^1114Wpcr].

---

## Surgical techniques

| **Abscess type** | **Recommended surgical technique** |
|-|-|
| Perianal | - Incision and drainage (I&D) [^1171Dzox] <br/> - Local anesthesia <br/> - Outpatient [^116rzRgQ] |
| Ischiorectal | - I&D <br/> - General anesthesia <br/> - Hospital admission [^notfound] |
| Intersphincteric | - Internal drainage via intersphincteric groove or internal sphincterotomy [^115tUE9N] |
| Supralevator | - Internal drainage if intersphincteric origin <br/> - External drainage if ischiorectal origin [^115tUE9N] |
| Horseshoe abscess | - Modified Hanley procedure with posterior midline partial sphincterotomy and seton placement [^115tUE9N] |

---

## Role of antibiotics

Antibiotics are **not routinely indicated** after uncomplicated drainage in immunocompetent patients [^112Ppxfq]. Use antibiotics when there is **cellulitis, systemic infection, or immunosuppression** [^112cnWiA] [^111Q8Drm]. Typical regimens cover Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate or metronidazole plus ciprofloxacin) [^113xx2J3].

---

## Postoperative care and wound management

- **Pain control**: NSAIDs or acetaminophen; opioids if needed.
- **Hygiene**: Sitz baths, gentle cleansing, and dry dressings [^1114Wpcr].
- **Wound packing**: Not routinely recommended; use only for hemostasis [^1114Wpcr].
- **Activity**: Avoid prolonged sitting; return to normal activities gradually.

---

## Potential complications

- **Recurrence**: Up to 44%, often within 1 year [^113VZBFQ].
- **Fistula formation**: 30–50% after drainage [^111aNsK3].
- **Incontinence**: Rare but possible, especially with complex fistulas [^115doqEc].
- **Delayed healing**: Common in immunocompromised or diabetic patients.

---

## Follow-up and recurrence prevention

Follow-up should occur within 2–4 weeks to assess healing and screen for fistula [^notfound]. Recurrence prevention relies on adequate drainage, addressing underlying fistulas, and patient education on hygiene and early presentation [^113VZBFQ].

---

## Special considerations

In **Crohn's disease**, management is multidisciplinary, with setons and anti-TNF therapy to control sepsis and promote healing [^114U6DhP] [^1171b9c7]. In **immunocompromised patients**, use a lower threshold for antibiotics and closer follow-up [^111Q8Drm]. For **pediatric patients**, management is similar to adults, with a higher index of suspicion for underlying disease [^114njSMX].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Prompt surgical drainage**: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence (1C) [^116r9gJR].
- **Antibiotics**: Only for cellulitis, systemic infection, or immunosuppression (1C) [^112cnWiA].
- **Wound care**: Sitz baths, hygiene, no routine packing (1C) [^115wCgbY].
- **Follow-up**: 2–4 weeks to assess healing and fistula (1C) [^notfound].

---

Rectal abscesses require **prompt surgical drainage** [^1171Dzox], with antibiotics reserved for select cases and structured postoperative care to minimize recurrence and complications [^112cnWiA].

Crohn's disease — lay-open fistulotomy for simple low fistulas: Symptomatic, simple, low anal fistulas in carefully selected patients with Crohn's disease may be treated by lay-open fistulotomy. Grade of recommendation: weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C. Fistulotomy may be safely performed in appropriately selected patients with an uncomplicated low fistula (ie, less than 30% involvement of the external anal sphincter) in the absence of proctitis. Healing rates after fistulotomy range from 62% to 100%, and 6% to 12% of patients report mild incontinence, however, some studies report higher rates of postoperative incontinence (up to 50%), especially in patients with active proctitis, underscoring the importance of patient selection. Recognizing the benefits and risks associated with fistulotomy in the setting of Crohn's disease, the grade of this recommendation has been changed from a 1C grade in the 2016 clinical practice guidelines to a 2C grade.

The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons is dedicated to assuring high-quality patient care by advancing the science, prevention, and management of disorders and diseases of the colon, rectum, and anus. The Standards Committee is composed of Society members who are chosen because they have demonstrated expertise in the specialty of colon and rectal surgery. This Committee was created to lead international efforts in defining quality care for conditions related to the colon, rectum, and anus. This is accompanied by developing Clinical Practice Guidelines based on the best available evidence. These guidelines are inclusive, and not prescriptive. Their purpose is to provide information on which decisions can be made, rather than dictate a specific form of treatment. These guidelines are intended for the use of all practitioners, health care workers, and patients who desire information about the management of the conditions addressed by the topics covered in these guidelines. It should be recognized that these guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure must be made by the physician in light of all of the circumstances presented by the individual patient.

This article provides a current overview on clinical anatomy, pathophysiology, workup and surgical management of anorectal abscesses. Based on the three-dimensional nature of anorectal abscesses, a novel treatment-based classification is proposed. It examines the basis of a philosophic shift from simple drainage to concomitant definitive treatment of abscesses and their underlying primary fistulous trajectories. Complications are discussed specifically in this context.

Crohn's disease — asymptomatic fistula management: Patients with Crohn's disease who present with an asymptomatic fistula secondary to Crohn's disease or a cryptoglandular infection without signs of local sepsis do not require surgical intervention as these tracts may remain quiescent for extended periods of time. Under these circumstances, proceeding with surgery and risking postoperative morbidity including nonhealing wounds or incontinence are not typically recommended.

Initial evaluation of anorectal abscess and fistula — A disease-specific history and physical examination should be performed evaluating symptoms, relevant history, abscess and fistula location, and presence of secondary cellulitis, with grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Anorectal abscess is usually diagnosed on the basis of a patient's history and physical examination, with anal pain and swelling common with superficial abscesses, whereas spontaneous drainage and fever occur less often. Deeper abscesses, including those in the supralevator or high ischiorectal spaces, may present with pain referred to the perineum, lower back, or buttocks.

Rectovaginal fistula (RVF) initial nonoperative care — Nonoperative management is typically recommended for the initial care of obstetrical rectovaginal fistula and may also be considered for other benign and minimally symptomatic fistulas. Grade of recommendation: weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C. In most cases, the initial management of RVFs, especially those of obstetric cause, is nonoperative and may include baths, wound care, debridement as needed, antibiotics in cases of infection, and stool-bulking fiber supplements for a period usually of 3 to 6 months, and a nonoperative approach under these circumstances may result in healing rates ranging from 52% to 66%; benign, minimally symptomatic RVFs unrelated to obstetrical injury may also be successfully managed with nonoperative therapy, although follow-up is limited.

The following constitutes key background information on anorectal abscess:

- **Definition**: Anorectal abscess is defined as a localized collection of pus in the anorectal region, which is typically caused by an infection in the anal glands.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of anorectal abscess usually involves an obstruction of the anal glands, which leads to bacterial overgrowth and subsequent infection. The infection can then spread to the surrounding tissues, causing an abscess to form.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of anorectal abscess in the United Kingdom is estimated at 20.2 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of anorectal abscess include severe pain in the anorectal area, swelling, redness, and sometimes systemic signs of infection such as fever. In some cases, the abscess may rupture and drain spontaneously and complications can also occur, including the formation of a fistula.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of anorectal abscess is generally good with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which typically involves surgical drainage of the abscess.

Anal fistula — fistulotomy for simple fistulas: Patients with a simple fistula-in-ano and normal sphincter function may be treated with lay-open fistulotomy, with a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence (1B). Primary fistulotomy is associated with fistula resolution rates more than 90%, and when used for simple, low-lying fistulas involving less than one-third of the external anal sphincter, the risk of clinically significant fecal incontinence is minimal in appropriately selected patients. A multicenter retrospective series of 537 patients with low fistulas undergoing fistulotomy reported a 28% incidence of major postoperative fecal incontinence. For high-lying or otherwise complex fistulas, fistulotomy may result in significant postoperative incontinence in 10% to 40% of patients, with risk factors including preoperative fecal incontinence, recurrent fistula, female sex, complex fistulas, and previous anorectal surgery; interventions other than fistulotomy are generally recommended in patients with these risk factors to preserve function.

Crohn's disease–associated anorectal fistula management — "Anorectal fistula associated with Crohn's disease is typically managed with a combination of surgical and medical approaches. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B". The mainstay of medical management is biological therapy, with randomized controlled trials showing initial fistula healing rates of 38% to 55% in patients treated with infliximab and long-term healing occurring in 39% of patients. For adalimumab, a randomized double-blind trial demonstrated 33% healing versus 13% with placebo (p < 0.05). For certolizumab, anal fistulas healed in 36% versus 17% with placebo (p = 0.03), but when success required 50% or more closure at 2 consecutive visits ≥ 3 weeks apart, no difference was found between the 2 groups. In many instances, medical therapy is combined, at least initially, with a draining seton, and in patients who do not require drainage, treatment with metronidazole and fluoroquinolones has demonstrated improvement in symptoms (at least temporarily) in more than 90% of patients. Patients with severe refractory anorectal fistulizing disease may ultimately require proctectomy and permanent fecal diversion.

Crohn's disease — endorectal advancement flaps and LIFT: Endorectal advancement flaps and the LIFT procedure may be used to treat fistula-in-ano associated with Crohn's disease. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Patients with Crohn's disease and a fistula, ideally, isolated to a single dominant tract without associated sepsis, anal stenosis, proctitis, or interfering scarring from previous anorectal disease or operations, may be considered for an operative repair. In cases in which localized sepsis is present, a draining seton is typically recommended before surgical intervention to improve the likelihood of successful fistula repair.

Methods

To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the boards of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST), to develop questions on seven main topics that thoroughly cover the field of this pathology (retained anorectal bodies, perineal necrotizing fasciitis, complicated hemorrhoids, acute anal fissure, anorectal abscess, bleeding anorectal varices, complicated anorectal prolapse). Leading specialists in the field then were asked to perform a thorough search on each of these topics in different databanks (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE) for relevant papers between 1985 and November 2019 and a systematic review of the available literature. They were asked to focus their search to provide evidence-based answers to every question with immediate practical application and to summarize them in statements. Furthermore, the references were kept up to date and the last literature search was performed in January 2021. All the statements were presented and discussed during the WSES - AAST - WJES Consensus Conference on Anorectal Emergencies held in Parma, Italy, on December 12, 2019, and for each statement, a consensus among the WSES - AAST panelists was reached. An international expert panel discussed the different issues in subsequent rounds. At each round, the manuscript was revised and improved. The final version about which agreement was reached resulted in the present manuscript. All the members contributed to the development of the manuscript.

The questions were created according to the PICO criteria, and the following guidelines adopt the GRADE methodology.

Topics and questions

For clarity, we report the seven topics together with the relative questions. The statements are summarized in Table 1.

Anorectal abscess — antibiotics after incision and drainage: Routine postoperative antibiotics for a routine, uncomplicated abscess in a healthy patient do not improve healing or recurrence and are typically not recommended; antibiotics may be used selectively for abscesses with cellulitis, systemic illness, or immunosuppression, and the recommendation grade was changed from 2C to 2B. Supporting data include a retrospective series of 172 patients undergoing incision and drainage with (n = 64) or without (n = 108) 5 to 7 days of oral antibiotics reporting 9% repeat surgery with no significant group difference; a single-blinded randomized trial of 307 patients found at 3 months that fistula developed in 14% with a 7-day ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole course versus 30% in controls (p < 0.001), whereas a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded multicenter trial of 334 patients showed no protective effect. Additional considerations are that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has been reported in up to 33% of patients, for which a combination of drainage and antibiotics is typically recommended for patients with systemic signs of sepsis, leukocytosis, or leukopenia; microbial cultures should also be considered for recurrent infection or nonhealing wounds; and in immunosuppressed settings, patients with a higher absolute neutrophil count (ie, > 1000/mm3) and fluctuance typically do well with drainage, whereas those with lower counts and lack of fluctuance may initially be treated with antibiotics alone.

The management of anorectal abscess and anal fistula has changed markedly with time. Invasive methods with high resulting rates of incontinence have given way to sphincter-sparing methods that have a much lower associated morbidity. There has been an increase in reports in the medical literature describing the success rates of the varying methods of dealing with this condition. This article reviews the various methods of treatment and evidence supporting their use and explores advances that may lead to new therapies.

Anorectal abscess/fistula — diagnostic imaging use: Routine use of diagnostic imaging is not typically necessary for patients with anorectal abscess or fistula; however, imaging may be considered in selected patients with an occult anorectal abscess, recurrent or complex anal fistula, immunosuppression, or anorectal Crohn's disease, with grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. CT for suspected abscess showed an overall sensitivity of 77% and 70% in immunosuppressed patients; MRI correctly identified all abscesses and 82% of fistulas in anorectal Crohn's disease, and in a 2014 prospective study of 50 patients with suspected anorectal fistula MRI had a 95% sensitivity, 80% specificity, and 97% positive predictive value; a retrospective study of 136 patients reported that MRI identified "significant" findings defined as secondary (blind) tracts, horseshoe abscesses, or abscesses undiagnosed by physical examination.

Operative management — acute pilonidal abscess: Patients with an abscess should be treated with incision and drainage (I&D) regardless of whether it is primary or recurrent, with a Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate‑quality evidence, 1B. For first‑episode abscesses, overall successful healing reaches 60%, but simple I&D carries an estimated 15% to 40% recurrence rate; I&D also appears to have a protective effect on recurrence after surgical excision at 20‑year follow‑up. An unroofing (lay open) and curettage procedure is a 1‑step option that potentially avoids the need for a second procedure, and in a randomized trial curettage achieved greater complete healing at 10 weeks (96% versus 79%).

Simple anal fistula at time of abscess drainage — concomitant fistulotomy may be used selectively: Abscess drainage with concomitant fistulotomy may be performed in selected patients with simple anal fistulas. Grade of recommendation: weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B. Although 30% to 70% of patients with anorectal abscesses present with a concomitant fistula-in-ano, the role of primary fistulotomy at the time of abscess drainage remains controversial. In a randomized controlled trial, of 36 patients treated with primary fistulotomy and partial internal sphincterotomy only 3% had recurrence, whereas 39% reported postoperative sphincter disturbance at a median follow-up of 42 months; meanwhile, of 34 patients treated with incision and drainage alone, 41% had recurrence and 21% reported postoperative functional disturbance. A 2010 Cochrane review (479 patients from 6 randomized trials) found sphincter division at incision and drainage decreased abscess/fistula persistence and reoperation (relative risk, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.07–0.24) but increased, albeit not significantly, continence disturbance at 1 year. A retrospective review of 128 patients reported major incontinence was more common with complex fistulas (13%) than simple fistulas (5%). For low transsphincteric fistulas, a staged strategy beginning with partial fistulotomy and draining seton (26 patients; 23 male) followed by completion fistulotomy showed that at 1 year, all 24 patients who underwent staged fistulotomy reported no fistula or abscess recurrence or incontinence. When a simple fistula is encountered during incision and drainage of an anorectal abscess, fistulotomy may be performed in selected patients provided that the anticipated benefit of healing outweighs the potential risk of fecal incontinence, whereas placing a draining seton to treat a fistula discovered at incision and drainage requires a staged procedure.

Intra-abdominal and anorectal abscesses are common pathologies seen in both inpatient and outpatient settings. To decrease morbidity and mortality, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. After adequate drainage via a percutaneous or incisional approach, patients need to be monitored for worsening symptoms or recurrence and evaluated for the underlying condition that may have contributed to abscess formation.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^115kbXLr]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, CT, MRI, and EUS could have a role in the diagnosis of perianal abscesses, with the principal aims of excluding related conditions and correctly determining the regional anatomy and extent of the disease; the choice of the appropriate imaging investigation should take into account multiple factors, such as patient's past medical history, clinical presentation, local availability of resources, and skills. After the resolution of the acute phase, routine imaging after incision and drainage of the anorectal abscess is usually not required. An imaging follow-up is otherwise suggested in cases of recurrence, in the presence of suspected IBD and when there is evidence of a fistula and/or non-healing wound.

1.C - In patients with an anorectal abscess, what are the indications for surgical treatment and what is the appropriate timing for surgery?

In patients with anorectal abscess, we recommend a surgical approach with incision and drainage (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C).

In patients with anorectal abscess, we suggest to base the timing of surgery on the presence and severity of sepsis (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In fit, immunocompetent patients with a small perianal abscess and without systemic signs of sepsis we suggest considering an outpatient management (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

The primary treatment of anorectal abscesses remains surgical drainage, with the timing being dictated by the severity and nature of any sepsis. In general, the incision should be kept as close as possible to the anal verge to minimize the length of a potential fistula, while still providing adequate drainage and avoiding sphincteral damage. It is important to stress the high rate of recurrence after drainage, which can be as high as 44%. The risk factors associated with recurrence are inadequate drainage, loculations, horseshoe-type abscess, and time from disease onset to incision. The high recurrence rate and the associated risk factors emphasize the need for a complete and accurate drainage of the abscess. A recent randomized prospective study on needle aspiration treatment vs. incision and drainage of acute simple perianal abscess emphasized the importance of a complete drainage of the perianal abscess, with recurrence rates of 41% following needle aspiration compared to 15% after incision and drainage.

Benign anorectal conditions produce anal pain, rectal bleeding, or discharge from the perianal region, which are highly prevalent symptoms in the general population. Hemorrhoidal disease, anal fissure, perianal abscess, proctalgia syndromes, and pruritus anii are the most common clinical disorders. Well-trained physicians, irrespective of their specialty, can treat most of these disorders and refer them to a specialist in proctology only when necessary. The aim of this review is to provide a practical guide to the management of benign anorectal disorders in terms of their initial management and the criteria for specialist referral.

Crohn's disease–related anorectal disease — incidence and pathogenesis: Distinct from cryptoglandular processes, anorectal abscess and fistula-in-ano can be manifestations of Crohn's disease. Among patients with Crohn's disease, fistula-in-ano has an incidence rate of 10% to 20% in population-based studies and 50% in longitudinal studies; meanwhile, nearly 80% of patients with Crohn's disease who were cared for at tertiary referral centers may have a history of fistula-in-ano. In Crohn's disease, anorectal abscesses and fistulas seem to result from penetrating inflammation rather than from infection of an anorectal gland, and patients with fistulas related to Crohn's disease are typically managed with a multidisciplinary approach.

Penetrating Crohn's disease with abscess — antibiotics, percutaneous drainage (PD), and surgery: Patients with penetrating Crohn's disease with abscess formation may be managed with antibiotics with or without drainage followed by interval elective resection or medical therapy depending on the clinical situation and patient preferences (Weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B). Smaller abscesses (< 3 cm) can generally be treated with antibiotics alone, whereas larger abscesses are typically treated with antibiotics and PD. Successful PD, defined as abscess resolution and avoidance of subsequent surgery, occurs in 23% to 78% of patients; abscess recurrence is significantly higher after PD alone versus surgical intervention (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.03–4.54; p = 0.04), and factors associated with PD failure include concomitant steroid use, colonic disease, and large, multiloculated, or multifocal abscesses. Preoperative PD combined with antibiotics typically improves postoperative outcomes and shortens length of stay; in a meta-analysis of 513 patients with spontaneous abscesses, postoperative complications were significantly lower with PD followed by surgery versus surgery at presentation (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23–0.83; p = 0.03).

Anorectal abscess — drainage approach by location should follow on-page guidance: Abscess location generally determines whether a patient should have internal versus external drainage, and intersphincteric abscesses should typically be drained through the intersphincteric groove or into the anal canal via an internal sphincterotomy; it is usually preferable to drain supralevator abscesses originating from an intersphincteric abscess internally by incising the rectal wall, whereas supralevator abscesses because of cephalad extension of an ischiorectal abscess should typically be drained externally through the perianal skin, approaches that may help prevent complex fistula formation; for horseshoe abscesses, primary lay-open fistulotomy should typically be avoided, the Hanley procedure is effective but may negatively impact anal sphincter function, and a modified Hanley technique with posterior midline partial sphincterotomy plus seton placement has a high rate of abscess resolution and has been reported to better preserve anorectal function.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^113xx2J3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of complex abscesses (perianal and perirectal, and abscesses in intravenous drug injection sites)?

Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. We recommend antibiotic therapy if systemic signs of infection are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or in cases of abscess with significant cellulitis (recommendation 1C).

We recommend empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with coverage of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Common sites of origin of complex abscesses may be perineal or perianal, perirectal, and abscesses at intravenous drug injection sites. Complicated skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage with adjuvant antibiotic therapy.

Perianal and perirectal abscesses originate most often from an obstructed anal crypt gland, with the resultant pus collecting in the subcutaneous tissue, intersphincteric plane, or beyond (ischiorectal space or supralevator space) where various types of anorectal abscesses form. Once diagnosed, anorectal abscesses should be promptly drained surgically. An undrained anorectal abscess can continue to expand into adjacent spaces as well as progress to generalized systemic infection. Anorectal abscess occurs more often in males than females. Most patients present between the ages of 20 to 60 with the mean age of 40 in both sexes.

The diagnosis of anorectal abscess is usually based on the patient's history and physical examination. The most common symptom of anorectal abscess is pain. As such, it has to be differentiated from other causes of anal pain including anal fissure, thrombosed hemorrhoids, levator spasm, sexually transmitted diseases, proctitis, and cancer. Low (intersphincteric, perianal, and ischiorectal) abscesses are usually associated with swelling, cellulites, and exquisite tenderness, but few systemic symptoms. High (submucosal, supralevator) abscesses may have few local symptoms, but significant systemic symptoms. Deeper abscesses, such as those that form in the supralevator or high ischiorectal space, may also present with pain referred to the perineum, low back, or buttocks.

Rectovaginal fistula from colorectal anastomotic complications — Rectovaginal fistulas that result from colorectal anastomotic complications often require a transabdominal approach for repair. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Fistulation of a colorectal anastomosis to the vagina was reported to occur in up to 2.2% of cases, and under these circumstances, fecal diversion is generally recommended as the initial step to facilitate resolution of acute inflammation and associated symptoms; however, in selected cases with an immediate or early postoperative RVF, reoperation and repeat colorectal anastomosis may be preferable. Fistula healing with diversion alone has also been reported, with 6 of 16 patients (37%) with a RVF from a failed colorectal anastomosis healed with diversion alone; patients with persistent fistulas were treated with repeat colorectal anastomosis, endorectal advancement flap, or a transperineal interposition flap.

Assessment of rectal mucosa at the time of EUA is important. Largely observational data, but with a large effect size, from the pre-biologics era show that outcomes are worse for perianal fistulising disease associated with rectal inflammation. A study from St Mark's of perianal fistulising Crohn's disease patients diagnosed in 1993–4 showed that 29% of those with rectal involvement had proctectomy compared with 4% of those with no rectal involvement.

4.9.2 Seton insertion

Statement 64. We recommend that setons should be placed to prevent re-accumulation of perianal sepsis in fistulising Crohn's disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). The optimal timing of seton removal is uncertain (Agreement: 97.1%).

EUA permits drainage of abscesses and placement of setons, with evidence that placing setons prior to starting anti-TNF therapy improves rates of healing and reduces recurrence rates. A recent meta-analysis confirmed the benefits of combined surgical and medical therapy in improving healing and makes recurrent abscess less likely. The exception to routine insertion of setons would be patients with rectovaginal fistulae in the absence of an abscess or collection. In this situation, setons may make faecal discharge per vagina worse.

Evidence for the timing of seton removal is unclear. Early studies removed setons at or shortly after the second infliximab infusion. More recent studies suggest later removal, either after completing infliximab induction therapyor after at least five infusions. Setons need to be removed to permit complete healing of fistula tracks, but if active inflammation is ongoing, then seton removal may result in recurrent abscess. The optimal timing and assessment method remain unclear, and some patients may require long-term setons to avoid or delay proctectomy. Further trials are needed to better understand the optimal management of perianal fistulae in Crohn's disease.

4.9.3 Anti-TNF therapy post-surgery for complex perianal fistulae

Statement 65. We recommend that infliximab is used as the first-line biological therapy for complex perianal fistulae, and should be started as soon as adequate drainage of sepsis is achieved (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Fistula-in-ano — endorectal advancement flap is supported with a strong recommendation and shows moderate healing rates with defined risk factors and technical considerations. Fistula-in-ano may be treated with endorectal advancement flap, with grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Healing after an initial endorectal advancement flap for cryptoglandular fistula has been reported in 66% to 87% of patients, and when repeated after a failed flap or after failed initial approaches including LIFT, healing rates range between 57% and 100%. Factors associated with endorectal advancement flap failure include history of pelvic radiation therapy, underlying Crohn's disease, active proctitis, history of abscess drainage, RVF, smoking, malignancy, obesity, and having had more than 1 previous attempted repair, and a diverting stoma has not been shown to improve outcomes and is not typically recommended. Technical effects can include decreased manometric resting and squeeze pressures in up to 35% of patients, and when the internal opening is distal to the dentate line, endorectal advancement flap may result in mucosal ectropion; other approaches should be considered in these circumstances.

Young, fit patients without any signs of sepsis may have their surgery undertaken in an ambulatory setting, and small simple perianal abscesses may be treated under local anesthesia. While perianal and ischioanal abscesses should be treated via incision and drainage of the overlying skin, intersphincteric abscess should be drained into the rectal lumen and a limited internal sphincterotomy may be required. Supralevator abscess may require drainage via the rectal lumen (if extension of an intersphincteric abscess) or externally via the skin (if extension of ischioanal abscess).

The timing for surgery is dictated by the patient's clinical condition and comorbidities: the presence of sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock, immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, and diffuse cellulitis should prompt an emergent drainage. In the absence of these factors, the surgical drainage should ideally be performed within 24 h.

This review summarizes the relevant literature for the selection of the initial imaging in 4 clinical scenarios in patients with suspected inflammatory disease or postoperative complication of the anorectum. These clinical scenarios include suspected perianal fistula or abscess; rectovesicular or rectovaginal fistula; proctitis or pouchitis; and suspected complication following proctectomy, coloproctectomy, or colectomy with a pouch or other anastomosis. The appropriateness of imaging modalities as they apply to each clinical scenario is rated as usually appropriate, may be appropriate, and usually not appropriate to assist the selection of the most appropriate imaging modality in the corresponding clinical scenarios of anorectal disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Fistula-in-ano — definition, frequency, and classification: Fistula-in-ano is an epithelialized tract that connects the perianal skin with the anal canal. In patients with an anorectal abscess, 30% to 70% present with a concomitant fistula-in-ano, and, of those who do not, approximately 30% to 50% will ultimately be diagnosed with a fistula in the months to years after abscess drainage. A fistula-in-ano is classified in terms of its relationship with the internal and external anal sphincters (eg, the Parks classification; Table 1), and intersphincteric and transsphincteric fistulas are more frequently encountered than suprasphincteric, extrasphincteric, and submucosal tract locations. Anal fistulas may also be classified as "simple" or "complex", with complex anal fistulas including transsphincteric fistulas that involve greater than 30% of the external sphincter, while simple anal fistulas generally include intersphincteric and low transsphincteric fistulas that involve less than 30% of the external sphincter; recurrent or branching fistulas and anterior fistulas in women may also be considered complex.

Microbiology sampling is of limited value in the management of anorectal abscess and antibiotic use is not required in patients undergoing incision and drainage for uncomplicated anorectal abscess. A rigid sigmoidoscopy could be considered. It may detect underlying rectal inflammation.

Level of evidence: IV

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)

There is very little evidence to recommend one drainage technique over another. Expert opinion supports all of the above techniques. Proctitis diagnosed at the time of EUA may point towards a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is present in 3% of patients undergoing drainage of a primary abscess in the UK.

Recommendation: Evidence of necrotizing soft tissue infection — operate within 30 min. Evidence of systemic features or risk factors for necrotizing soft tissue infections (diabetes, systemic immunosuppression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, cellulitis) — operate within 6 h of decision. If patient is systemically well with no features or risk factors for necrotizing soft tissue infections — operate within 24 h of decision.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: GP

Consensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)

Question 9.6

Should packing be used after drainage of perianal abscess?

Recommendation: There is insufficient evidence to recommend regular packing of perianal abscesses. Initial haemostatic packing can be used if there is bleeding. Dry dressing only can then be used.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: D/GP

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)

Traditionally, abscess cavities have been 'packed' (had internal dressings applied) after drainage of the abscess, to ensure that the aperture remains open until the cavity has healed by secondary intention.

### Anal abscess and fistula [^1154UNPF]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Benign anorectal diseases, such as anal abscesses and fistula, are commonly seen by primary care physicians, gastroenterologists, emergency physicians, general surgeons, and colorectal surgeons. It is important to have a thorough understanding of the complexity of these 2 disease processes so as to provide appropriate and timely treatment. We review the pathophysiology, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment options for both anal abscesses and fistulas.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons' clinical practice guidelines for the management of pilonidal disease [^112AQ994]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). High credibility.

Management of recurrent pilonidal disease — operative strategies for recurrent pilonidal disease should distinguish between the presence of an acute abscess and chronic disease, considering the experience and expertise of the surgeon. Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Proper hygiene, to include a trial of shaving, may remain a cornerstone in the outpatient management of recurrent disease, and recurrent abscesses should be surgically drained as if they were sentinel presentations; in the face of nonacute recurrence or chronically recurring pilonidal sinus disease, the goal should be a treatment strategy that allows the patient to resume a normal lifestyle as quickly as possible. Definitive flap-based procedures may be indicated if previous local excisions or multiple drainage procedures have been performed previously or if a minimally invasive approach may be entertained, with no strong evidence for either strategy; randomized data in recurrent patients comparing a modified asymmetric flap with a classical rhomboid flap demonstrated a lower wound infection rate (3% vs 23%), lower recurrence rate, shorter hospital stay, and faster return to work using the asymmetric flap. Thus, we recommend that patients be managed based on both the underlying presentation (ie, acute abscess, cellulitis, sinus, or subcutaneous tracts) and the goals, experience, and expertise of the surgeon, and it is recommended that known modifiable risk factors for surgical site occurrence, such as nutritional status, smoking cessation, glycemic control, and obesity, be optimized before embarking on repeat procedures.

Anorectal abscess and fistula — physical examination and probing: Digital rectal examination and anoscopy/proctoscopy are occasionally needed to clarify the diagnosis. Inspection of the perineum should involve noting the specific findings of an abscess, surgical scars, anorectal deformities, signs of possible anorectal Crohn's disease, and the presence of an external fistula opening. Gentle probing of an external opening, when tolerated, may help confirm the presence of a fistula tract but should be done with care to avoid creating false tracts. Goodsall's rule, that an anterior fistula-in-ano has a radial tract and a posterior fistula has a curvilinear tract to the anus, has generally proven to be accurate for anterior fistulas but is less accurate in cases with a posterior fistula.

Perianal abscess — assessment and treatment algorithm begins with assessment of intestinal disease with history and physical, colonoscopy to evaluate rectal inflammation, perianal assessment to examine for pain, fluctuance, erythema, and digital rectal exam for stricture; if pain, fluctuance or stricture is present, perform EUA ± EUS or MRI pelvis, whereas absence of pain, fluctuation or stricture leads to proceed to perianal fistula algorithm. For superficial abscess, management includes incision and drainage and, if associated with low perianal fistula, a noncutting seton may be placed, plus antibiotics; for deep abscess, use incision and drainage and antibiotics. If a high perianal fistula is identified, place a noncutting seton, and if a perianal fistula is not identified, place a mushroom catheter; provide antibiotics for cellulitis if present and treat intestinal disease with Anti-TNFα, Azathioprine/6MP, and Methotrexate.

Haemorrhoids are common and often asymptomatic, but 30 000 interventions are nevertheless undertaken annually in the UK. Prolapsing haemorrhoids are those which are likely to present acutely with pain, usually caused by strangulation or thrombosis. Management is usually conservative.

Rectal prolapse or procidentia is an intussusception of the rectum externally through the anal sphincter complex. It should be distinguished from an internal rectal intussusception and solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. Whether internal rectal intussusception and rectal prolapse form a spectrum of conditions or are two separate conditions is still widely debated.

Although it is a benign condition, rectal prolapse can be debilitating, mainly due to the discomfort associated with the physical presence of the prolapse, passage of mucous and blood, together with the symptoms of faecal leakage and incontinence and on occasions constipation.

Rectal prolapse is most commonly seen at the extremes of age. In children it usually presents under the age of 4 years and is seen equally in boys and girls. The peak incidence in adults is in the seventh decade of life with in excess of 90% of cases occurring in women. Although it is seen less commonly in men, its age of incidence in men is under 40 years of age. It rarely presents as an emergency.

Pilonidal disease without abscess — fibrin glue — may be effective as primary or adjunctive therapy, but overall benefit remains uncertain. The guideline states: in chronic pilonidal disease without abscess, fibrin glue may be effective, with a Grade of Recommendation 2B. Observational series included 6 to 50 patients and described healing at 2 to 6 weeks, with most patients able to return to normal activities within 2 weeks. A randomized trial of 32 patients reported that all in the fibrin glue group healed without evidence of recurrence at 8 months and had decreased wound drainage and hospital stay. Another randomized trial of 50 patients showed equal efficacy but decreased hospital stay (2 vs 4 d) and increased wound fluid collections (24% vs 8%) in the fibrin group. A 2017 Cochrane review concluded that the evidence for benefit is uncertain.

### Diagnosis and management of fistulizing Crohn's disease [^114XXBZR]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

The transmural inflammation characteristic of Crohn's disease predisposes patients to the formation of fistulas. Up to 50% of patients with Crohn's disease are affected by fistulas, which is a major problem given the considerable morbidity associated with this complication. Appropriate treatment of fistulas requires knowledge of specific pharmacological and surgical therapies. Treatment options depend on the severity of symptoms, fistula location, the number and complexity of fistula tracts, and the presence of rectal complications. Internal fistulas, such as ileoileal or ileocecal fistulas, are mostly asymptomatic and do not require intervention. By contrast, perianal fistulas can be painful and abscesses may develop that require surgical drainage with or without seton placement, transient ileostomy, or in severe cases, proctectomy. This Review describes the epidemiology and pathology of fistulizing Crohn's disease. Particular focus is given to external and perianal fistulas, for which treatment options are well established. Available therapeutic options, including novel therapies, are discussed. Wherever possible, practical and evidence-based treatment regimens for Crohn's disease-associated fistulas are provided.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^116EmP2a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Systemic antibiotic treatment alone is usually the most appropriate treatment for patients with a small (< 4 cm in diameter) diverticular abscess and image guided percutaneous drainage is for those with a large (> 4 cm in diameter) one (Recommendation 2 B).

For patients in whom diverticulitis is complicated by peridiverticular abscess formation, the size of the abscess is an important determinant of the need for percutaneous drainage. Many patients who have small pericolic abscesses (4 cm or less in diameter) without peritonitis (Hinchey stage 1) can be treated conservatively with bowel rest and broad-spectrum antibiotics. For patients with peridiverticular abscesses that are larger than 4 cm in diameter (Hinchey stage 2), observational studies indicate that CT-guided percutaneous drainage can be beneficial. This procedure typically eliminates or reduces the size of the abscess, with a reduction in pain, resolution of leukocytosis, and defervescence usually seen within several days. Percutaneous drainage may allow for elective rather than emergency surgery, increasing the likelihood of a successful one-stage procedure. Patients whose abscess cavities contain gross feculent material tend to respond poorly, and early surgical intervention is usually required.

Elective colon resection should typically be advised if an episode of complicated diverticulitis is treated non-operatively (Recommendation 2 C).

After percutaneous drainage of a diverticular abscess, a later colectomy usually should be planned, because 41 percent of patients will otherwise develop severe recurrent sepsis. Some, but not all, retrospective studies suggest that the number of recurrences is associated with the chance that emergency surgery will be required at some point in the future.

The resection should be carried proximally to the compliant bowel and extend distally to the upper rectum (Recommendation 1 C).

It is usually sufficient to remove only the most severely affected segment; however, the proximal margin of resection should be in an area of pliable colon without hypertrophy or inflammation. Not all of the diverticula-bearing colon must be removed. Usually a sigmoid colectomy will suffice; however, occasionally the proximal resection margin must extend well into the descending colon or to the left transverse colon. Distally, the margin of resection should be where the taenia coli splay out onto the upper rectum. After sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis, an important predictor of recurrent diverticulitis is a colosigmoid rather than a colorectal anastomosis.

Anorectal emergencies are rare presentations of common anorectal disorders, and surgeons are often called on to assist in their diagnosis and management. Although most patients presenting with anorectal emergencies can be managed nonoperatively or with a bedside procedure, surgeons must also be able to identify surgical anorectal emergencies, such as gangrenous rectal prolapse. This article provides a review of pertinent anatomy; examination techniques; and workup, diagnosis, and management of common anorectal emergencies including thrombosed hemorrhoids, incarcerated hemorrhoids, anal fissure, anorectal abscess, rectal prolapse, and pilonidal abscess and unique situations including rectal foreign body and anorectal sexually transmitted infections.

The authors expect that the exceptional efforts towards vaccination will lower the burden on health care. Fear among patient populations seeking medical attention will be lowered. This will lead to normalization of routine clinical practice and elective procedures. Non-pharmacological preventive measures including facial masks, hand sanitization, and social distancing should be continued during this period because there is no data showing that vaccination reduces transmission from asymptomatic individuals.

In summary, coronavirus disease 2019 had impacted health care and disrupted the management of all acute and chronic diseases (Figure 3). Although COVID-19 presents predominantly with respiratory symptoms, many patients present with pre-existing anorectal disease or develop new lower GI symptoms. Patients with GI manifestations have delayed diagnosis and potentially severe disease. The literature about the management of anorectal diseases during the pandemic is limited. Telemedicine can play vital role in educating patients about risk factor mitigation and provide information about warning signs. Improvement in PPE availability, maneuvers to remove surgical smoke during laparoscopic procedures, and noninvasive management of mild emergency conditions, can all help limit the virus spread. Emergency anorectal conditions, including acute hemorrhoidal thrombosis, with or without prolapse, anorectal abscess and bleeding rectal varices, foreign body, and obstructed cancers require prompt surgery or transfer to a facility with appropriate capacity. Cancer management is delayed during the pandemic, which will increase disease burden and patient discomfort in future. Anorectal cancer screening and treatment recommendations need to be re-defined based on large multicenter studies, which will guide patients and clinicians to optimize care.

Imaging for anal fistula and anorectal Crohn's disease — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), endoanal ultrasound (EAUS), and transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) — shows complementary performance: "MRI provided significant findings more frequently for complex fistulas than for simple fistulas (54% vs 5%; p < 0.001)", and a "prospective trial published in 2019, including 126 patients", reported that "MRI had significantly higher sensitivity evaluating secondary extensions in complex fistulas (97% vs 74%; p = 0.04)". EAUS can align with operative findings as studies "demonstrate concordance between EAUS and operative findings in 73% to 100% of cases", and in a retrospective series "109 patients" who underwent preoperative EAUS versus "230 patients" without were compared "at a mean follow-up of 34 weeks". In a blinded Crohn's cohort, "EAUS was accurate in 91% of patients, MRI was accurate in 87% of patients, and examination under anesthesia was accurate in 91% of patients, whereas 100% accuracy was achieved when any 2 techniques were combined". For TPUS, "a prospective study of 23 patients with Crohn's disease… found that the diagnostic accuracy of all 3 modalities was nearly identical", although "this imaging technique has not gained widespread popularity".

Instead, in the context of primary abscess drainage, IO should not be sought and neither fistulotomy nor seton insertion (which also condemns the patient to the risks of future fistula treatment, or of lifelong fistula persistence) should be performed.

Postoperative antibiotics do not seem to prevent fistulas.

Question 9.8

Should an underlying fistula be sought and treated at the time of recurrent abscess drainage?

Recommendation: In recurrent abscesses, insertion of a seton should be the routine management of the underlying fistula, unless it is clearly superficial. An MRI is recommended if no fistula is found.

Level of evidence IV

Grade of recommendation GP

Consensus: 100% (SA 100%)

In the context of recurrent abscess in the same location, it has been demonstrated that the underlying fistula will not resolve spontaneously and should be treated. In active inflammation, appropriate assessment of fistula anatomy is more difficult and full assessment of the risk of continence impairment which would follow fistulotomy is more difficult, so seton insertion rather than immediate fistulotomy may be safer if there is any uncertainty.

Question 9.9

What, if any, investigation for underlying disease (e.g. Crohn's) should be undertaken after abscess drainage?

Recommendation: Crohn's disease should be considered in patients with risk factors for Crohn's disease, complex fistula or fistula presenting at a younger age. Investigations where the risk of Crohn's is thought to be elevated include faecal calprotectin, luminal investigation and histological analysis of perianal fistula biopsy specimens.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: GP

Consensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)

There are limited data to support a recommendation in this area. Up to 5% of perianal Crohn's disease may be isolated and up to 10% of Crohn's disease may present with perianal symptoms. Recent HES data analysis found that luminal disease presented a median of 14 months later. Risk factors for Crohn's disease including family history of IBD, complex fistula in younger patients and the presence of luminal symptoms should be sought. Options for identifying luminal disease include faecal calprotectin, colonoscopy and small bowel imaging. Isolated perianal Crohn's can be confirmed on the finding of granulomas in biopsy specimens. The frequency of this finding in confirmed Crohn's disease is unknown.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^1171b9c7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease — abscess drainage and seton use are emphasized before advanced therapy: Drainage of perianal abscesses with appropriate placement of setons to facilitate drainage should be undertaken before treating perianal fistulizing disease with advanced therapy to increase treatment effectiveness. Before initiating advanced therapy, pyogenic complications such as abscess should be excluded with cross-sectional imaging. If abscesses are present, they should be treated initially with drainage before initiation of biologic therapy or immunosuppression. Setons are the most common method to allow for continued drainage of infection from the inflammatory tracts and should be performed before initiation of immunosuppression. The combination of a seton with infliximab has demonstrated a better overall fistula healing response, longer duration of fistula closure and prevention of repeated abscess, and lower overall fistula recurrence rate. In the setting of significant refractory disease, a proximal diversion to enable rectal and/or perianal healing may be necessary; however, a systematic review suggests that the long-term success of diverting ostomy for perianal CD is very low, and in very severe circumstances, proctectomy or total proctocolectomy with permanent stoma may be necessary. Surgical advancement flaps play a role in the improvement of long-term healing rates in combination with an anti-TNF.

### Medical and surgical management of perianal Crohn's disease [^113eZBG7]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Surgical management

The fistula anatomy, disease activity and presence of complicating features (proctitis, abscess) influence surgical options. The AGA empirically distinguishes fistulas as simple or complex, with the former having higher rates of healing. Simple fistulas are classified as superficial or low intersphincteric/transsphincteric with a single external opening, no pain or fluctuation to suggest perianal abscess, no evidence of a rectovaginal fistula, and no evidence of anorectal stricture. Complex fistulas (Fig. 2A, B), in contrast, are high fistulas (intersphincteric / transsphincteric / extrasphincteric / suprasphincteric) and may be associated with multiple external openings, presence of pain or fluctuation to suggest a perianal abscess, presence of a rectovaginal fistula, presence of an anorectal stricture, or presence of active rectal disease at endoscopy.

Management of fistulizing PCD has evolved from a focus on definitive surgical repair to multidisciplinary management, with surgical drainage in preparation for medical treatment. In many circumstances surgery can be a good adjunct to symptom palliation. Diversion or ablation are offered in the case of failure.

Examination under anesthesia (EUA) with drainage of collections / seton insertion

EUA and drainage is the first-line treatment for acute abscess so as to control local sepsis prior to initiating medical treatment. Loose setons maintain patency of fistula tracts, limiting recurrent abscess formation. When the goal of medical treatment is fistula closure, the seton must be removed, often towards the end of anti-TNF treatment induction, although the optimal timing of removal is unknown. Loose setons may be left in situ permanently to control local sepsis and reduce symptoms, although on occasion they may need to be replaced. Loose setons also serve as a bridge between optimization of medical therapy and definitive surgical treatment. Cutting setons, by contrast, are a method of fistulotomy and risk sphincter injury and the authors do not advocate this in perianal Crohn's fistula.

Anorectal emergencies

The American College of Surgeons recognize acute hemorrhoidal thrombosis/necrosis, peri- anal/perirectal abscess, and Fournier gangrene (perineal necrotizing fasciitis) as surgical emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The conditions should be managed with emergency surgery as there is no substitute treatment, and any delay in the procedure will increase hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality. If there are limited resources in hospital during the pandemic, then these cases should be transferred early to facilities with the capacity to perform emergency surgery. Other notable emergent conditions are bleeding rectal varices, foreign body, and rectal obstruction with cancers. The management of these conditions should not deviate from standard treatments.

Urgent hemorrhoidectomy is recommended for acute hemorrhoid thrombosis and strangulation. The perianal/perirectal abscess should be drained in the operating theater if the abscess is deep. If the operating room is unavailable then outpatient percutaneous drainage should be considered. Early surgical debridement with intravenous hydration and antibiotics are the standard treatment for perineal necrotizing fasciitis. Diversion colostomy is required in few cases to avoid fecal contamination.

Rectal varices can sometimes present with massive lower GI bleeding, requiring emergent volume resuscitation, correction of coagulopathy, and blood transfusion. The endoscopic management of rectal varices can be challenging, and is usually done with band ligation or sclerotherapy with high recurrence rate. The trans-jugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) procedure is considered in severe cases to decrease portal pressure.

The rectal foreign body is also seen as a traumatic rectal emergency. It can be caused due to accident, sexual pleasure, and/or assault. Diagnosis can be difficult as sometimes patients do not provide the complete history. It can complicate to rectal perforation, infection, pain, and bleeding. Rectal examination and radiology testing can be helpful. The foreign body should be removed trans-anally, endoscopically, or surgically with goal of minimizing trauma.

### Invited commentary: management of low colorectal / coloanal anastomotic leak: results of a French national inter-groups practice survey [^112zBcNq]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Anastomotic leakage (AL) persists as the most significant postoperative complication following low anterior resection (LAR) or coloanal anastomosis (CAA) in the surgical management of rectal cancer. Despite considerable advancements in surgical techniques and perioperative management protocols, AL continues to adversely affect both immediate postoperative outcomes and long‐term oncological and functional results. Contemporary literature demonstrates that the incidence of this complication remains at approximately 10%–15%, even within high‐volume tertiary referral centers with specialized colorectal units.

Although various diagnostic modalities — such as C‐reactive protein (CRP) monitoring, high‐resolution computed tomography (CT), early‐onset pain as a clinical predictor, and drain‐fluid amylase measurement — have proven useful, clinical practice still lacks standardized guidelines.

Pastier et al. addressed this gap by surveying 203 French colorectal surgeons on 24 standardized clinical scenarios and distilling the first consensus‐driven algorithm that spans both diagnosis and treatment of AL in patients with a diverting ileostomy. Four easily monitored warning signs — CRP > 250 mg/L, fever ≥ 38.5°C, tachycardia > 100 bpm, and diffuse abdominal pain — were endorsed as triggers for urgent contrast‐enhanced CT without rectal contrast, considered reliable only from postoperative day 3 in two‐thirds of respondents; once any sign is present, 87% recommend immediate imaging.

The treatment algorithm is equally explicit: isolated extra‐digestive air or uncollected effusion is managed with antibiotics alone in 61%–78% of surgeons; a peri‐anastomotic abscess prompts examination under anesthesia, permitting transanal drainage when indicated, in 70%; negative‐pressure endoluminal vacuum therapy is viewed as useful by a slim majority (51%), reflecting its growing acceptance as an organ‐preserving adjunct; and drains are removed when follow‐up imaging confirms resolution of the collection in 64%, illustrating a structured "image‐guided" endpoint. Nearly all participants (97%) prescribe at least 7 days of systemic antibiotics alongside any drainage modality, highlighting consensus on infection control.

Future reports detailing clinical outcomes — such as the success rates of transanal drainage and endoluminal vacuum therapy, rates of anastomotic reconstruction, and stoma avoidance — will further enhance the value of this work. Given its grounding in real‐world data and applicability to everyday practice, Pastier et al.'s study may play a key role in standardizing anastomotic leak management.

### Progress and challenges in the management of diverticular disease: which treatment? [^111MqwYM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of complicated AD (Hinchey stages Ib to IV)

Hinchey Ib or II includes pericolic or mesocolic (< 5 cm) abscess or intra-abdominal, pelvic, or retroperitoneal abscess, or abscess distant from the primary inflammation. Only 15% of patients suffering an episode of AD will develop a complicated episode with pericolic/distant confined abscess or worse. In these cases, inpatient management should be indicated, and treatment varies with the size of the abscess. Conservative treatment with nothing other than a broad-spectrum antibiotic has a success rate up to 70% in abscesses smaller than 4 cm, leaving image-guided percutaneous drainage for previous treatment failures and larger abscesses with a successful treatment rate in up to 80% of cases. Surgery should be planned when conservative treatment fails.

Hinchey III or IV includes generalized purulent peritonitis/fecal peritonitis. Data show a mortality rate of 14% in patients with complicated Hinchey III and IV in AD. In the vast majority of hemodynamically stable cases, early surgery with primary anastomosis with or without fecal diversion is preferable when the patient's clinical condition can influence different surgery treatments. Hartmann's surgery procedure is performed in hemodynamically unstable patients.

There is debate concerning the best surgical strategy in complicated AD. Laparoscopic surgery seemed to offer better outcomes than open surgery in AD in a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-arm RCT of 104 patients with Hinchey I, IIa, or IIb, symptomatic stricture, or severe rectal bleeding. Laparoscopic surgery was associated with a 15.4% reduction in major complication rates, less pain, improved quality of life, and shorter hospitalization. Both the short-term and long-term results of the Sigma trial show a 27% reduction in major morbidity for patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for diverticular disease. A multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, open-label trial, however, showed no superiority of laparoscopic lavage compared with sigmoidectomy in patients with purulent perforated diverticulitis. In a recent case–control study of 1175 patients undergoing surgery for Hinchey III or IV peritonitis, preoperative assessment based on an Apgar scoring system integrated with peritonitis exposure in complicated diverticulitis offered the best surgical management strategy for reducing local infection, complications, and the need for ostomy.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^111ZtJ9H]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

An anorectal abscess is characterized by an infection in the soft tissue around the anus. However, depending on the different anatomical locations of the infectious process, the manifestations, and the treatment of anorectal abscesses vary widely. It is important to remember the anatomical classification of intersphincteric, perianal, ischiorectal, or supralevator abscesses. Anorectal abscesses are associated with anal fistulas in approximately a third of patients, and the classification of fistulae depends on their anatomical location as well. The clinical presentation is typically characterized by perianal pain, swelling, and fever, but deeper abscesses may also present with pain referred to the perineum, low back, and buttocks or with symptoms that mimic an intra-abdominal condition; discharge of pus could also be present and occasionally patients with anorectal abscesses will present with urinary retention. It is a common disease and constitutes a common presentation to emergency general surgeons; the most common age for presentation is 20–40 years, with men more commonly affected than women. The majority are idiopathic in nature, with the cryptoglandular hypothesis being most commonly accepted, but a proportion may present as part of another disease process, most commonly Crohn's disease. The differential diagnosis of anorectal abscesses is wide and comprises other significant diseases such as anal cancer and precancerous conditions, Crohn's disease, and tuberculosis. In fact, an anorectal abscess will develop in approximately one third of patients with Crohn's disease. Furthermore, it is important to make an early distinction from Fournier's gangrene/necrotizing fasciitis. The most common anatomical locations are perianal and ischio-rectal, with intersphincteric and supralevator being less common. The management of patients with known Crohn's disease goes beyond the aims of these guidelines, but it is mandatory to exclude the presence of undiagnosed underlying Crohn's disease in every patient presenting with an anorectal abscess, especially if recurrent. For this reason, a focused and detailed medical history is of utmost importance and complete physical examination should include a careful inspection of the perineum checking for surgical scars, anorectal deformities, other signs of perianal Crohn's disease, the presence of secondary cellulitis, or the presence of external opening of an anal fistula. A complete anorectal examination, including digital rectal examination, is usually feasible, but in some cases, sedation or anesthesia may be needed due to the intense pain. The patient's history and physical examination are usually enough to diagnose small and superficial abscesses, while deeper abscesses can be challenging to diagnose; in these cases, rectal examination usually reveals a tender, indurated area above the anorectal ring.

### Clinical overview of melioidosis… [^115FCkBk]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Types of melioidosis infection Generally, symptoms appear 1 to 4 weeks after exposure to B. pseudomallei bacteria. Melioidosis can be localized or disseminated, and sub-clinical infections are also possible. A localized infection often presents as an ulcer, nodule, or skin abscess. Symptoms generally include fever and myalgias. Melioidosis most commonly presents as a pulmonary infection, which may include: Patients generally present with acute illness, but around 10 percent present with chronic melioidosis, an ongoing illness of at least two months. Both acute and chronic melioidosis can lead to disseminated infection and rapid-onset septicemia can occur. These conditions are more common in patients with underlying risk factors including diabetes and renal insufficiency. Abscesses may be found throughout the body, notably in the liver, spleen, or prostate. Involvement of joints, bones, viscera, lymph nodes, skin, or brain are also possible.

Testing and reporting Melioidosis is diagnosed by isolating B. pseudomallei from blood, urine, sputum, skin lesions, cerebrospinal fluid, oropharyngeal swab, rectal swab, or abscesses, or by detecting an antibody response to the bacteria. Eradication therapy lasts 3 months to more than 6 months:

- **First choice**: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, every 12 hours with folic acid to prevent or reduce antifolate toxicity OR
- Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, every 8 hours OR
- Doxycycline, once daily ORevery 12 hours If antibiotics are not taken for the length of time prescribed, early recrudescence or subsequent relapse can occur, usually within 1 to 2 years. In the event of a public health emergency involving B. pseudomallei infection, PEP should be given to anyone potentially exposed. Administer PEP should for 21 days. Oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the agent of first choice if tolerated.

If the organism is resistant to TMP-SMX or the patient has an allergy to it, the second-line choices are amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or doxycycline.

### The proper treatment of intraperitoneal abscess in the lower abdomen… [^114p3qLP]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The successful treatment of any intraperitoneal accumulation of pus depends on proper drainage. In women it is a well-established fact that drainage through the vagina is at times better than draining through the anterior abdominal wall. Mr. Pollard has said that occasionally in his experience drainage through the rectum has been better even than vaginal drainage because it reaches a lower point in the peritoneal cavity. In dealing with an accumulation of pus in the peritoneum the proper method to pursue is to treat the rectovesical or recto-uterine pouch as though it were always infected, for even though it does not contain pus in the early stages of localized peritonitis, it is very likely to become infected later, as we all have seen in a great many instances. The extension of pus to near-by peritoneum, and especially to the bottom of the pouch, is not a dangerous accident if proper. MACLAREN A.
