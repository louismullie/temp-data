## Question

What are the most effective topical corticosteroids for treating inverse psoriasis in sensitive areas?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which topical corticosteroids are most effective for treating inverse psoriasis in sensitive areas. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the unique pathophysiology and risk profile of inverse psoriasis in thin, occluded skin. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines recommend for potency, duration, and vehicle in intertriginous sites. Next, I will review direct and indirect efficacy data, including any trials in inverse or facial psoriasis, and consider steroid-sparing maintenance options. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-conscious recommendation with monitoring and tapering plans, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risks. Inverse psoriasis involves erythematous, minimally scaly plaques in skin folds where the stratum corneum is thin and occlusion increases percutaneous absorption, raising risks of atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, and even systemic effects with potent agents, so potency and duration must be conservative in these areas [^1162AKGa] [^1129Q6xg] [^116Wp8v2].

> Wait, let me verify guideline direction on potency. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on using lower-potency corticosteroids in intertriginous and facial sites, typically class 5–7, for short courses to mitigate atrophy and other local adverse effects, whereas higher-potency agents are reserved for brief rescue in select cases under close supervision [^111wVvGA] [^116uNXib] [^116Wp8v2].

> I should confirm duration limits. For sensitive areas, expert guidance supports 1–2 weeks of low- to mid-potency corticosteroid, with a hard cap around 2–4 weeks, followed by taper or transition to steroid-sparing agents. Prolonged continuous use is discouraged due to atrophy risk and tachyphylaxis concerns, though the latter remains debated and may reflect adherence issues in some cases [^112nawmb] [^115zeXDU] [^111wVvGA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "most effective" meaning highest potency. I need to check whether any head-to-head data exist specifically in inverse psoriasis. There are no robust head-to-head trials comparing different corticosteroid potencies exclusively in inverse psoriasis, so recommendations are extrapolated from general psoriasis data and guideline consensus emphasizing efficacy balanced against safety in thin, occluded skin [^112nawmb].

> Let me consider indirect efficacy signals. Systematic reviews and guidelines show that corticosteroids outperform placebo and are comparable to vitamin D analogs for plaque psoriasis, with potent and very potent agents yielding larger standardized mean differences than low-potency agents; however, these data are not specific to inverse sites, and the safety trade-off is unfavorable in intertriginous areas, so extrapolation must be cautious [^111ioMy3] [^113DTrnR] [^1173s18a].

> I should double-check steroid-sparing options for maintenance. Calcineurin inhibitors are guideline-supported for inverse psoriasis, with tacrolimus 0.1% and pimecrolimus recommended off-label for 4–8 weeks and considered for longer-term maintenance to reduce steroid exposure, and they avoid corticosteroid-induced atrophy, though transient burning or stinging can occur [^111ngGUP] [^112nawmb] [^116UyGs9].

> Next, I should review vehicle and application technique. Creams or lotions are generally preferred in folds for ease of application and reduced occlusion compared with ointments, and fingertip-unit dosing helps avoid under- or over-application. Emollients can be layered to improve tolerability and barrier function, which is particularly helpful in sensitive areas [^116Wp8v2] [^117LvASS].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For a typical flare of inverse psoriasis, a short, time-limited course of a low- to mid-potency corticosteroid such as hydrocortisone 2.5%, desonide 0.05%, or triamcinolone 0.025% applied once or twice daily for 1–2 weeks, not exceeding 2–4 weeks, is reasonable. Then taper frequency or transition to tacrolimus 0.1% or pimecrolimus for maintenance, reserving higher-potency agents for brief rescue under dermatologist supervision if inflammation is severe and refractory [^116uNXib] [^112nawmb] [^111ngGUP].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a higher-potency agent from elsewhere? I need to ensure we de-escalate potency in intertriginous sites and avoid occlusion, because even short courses of potent steroids in folds can cause rapid atrophy. If a potent steroid was inadvertently used, stop it and switch to a low-potency option with a planned taper and steroid-sparing maintenance [^116uNXib] [^1129Q6xg].

> I should confirm monitoring and counseling points. Reassess at 1–2 weeks for response and adverse effects, watch for atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, and infection, and educate on fingertip-unit dosing, tapering, and when to pivot to calcineurin inhibitors or nonsteroidal options. Document baseline and serial photos to track improvement and detect early atrophy [^116Wp8v2] [^113dATUJ].

> In summary, I need to emphasize that "most effective" in inverse psoriasis is not about maximal potency but about the best balance of efficacy and safety. Low- to mid-potency corticosteroids for short courses are the most appropriate first-line choice in sensitive intertriginous areas, with calcineurin inhibitors as preferred maintenance to minimize steroid-induced atrophy and other local adverse effects [^116uNXib] [^112nawmb] [^111ngGUP].

For inverse psoriasis in sensitive areas, **low- to mid-potency topical corticosteroids** (e.g. hydrocortisone 1–2.5%, desonide 0.05%, triamcinolone 0.1%) are most effective for short-term control [^112nawmb] because they balance efficacy with a lower risk of atrophy and other adverse effects in thin, occluded skin [^116uNXib]. Use for **≤ 2–4 weeks** [^112nawmb], then taper or switch to steroid-sparing agents (calcipotriene, tacrolimus, or pimecrolimus) for maintenance [^111ngGUP] [^114NQAKU]. Avoid high-potency steroids unless absolutely necessary and only for very short courses under close supervision [^116uNXib] [^113anTgC].

---

## Recommended potency and formulations

- **Low-potency corticosteroids**: Hydrocortisone 1–2.5%, desonide 0.05%, and alclometasone dipropionate 0.05% are preferred for sensitive areas due to their favorable safety profile [^116uNXib].

- **Mid-potency corticosteroids**: Triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% or fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% may be used cautiously for short-term flares if low-potency agents are insufficient [^notfound].

- **High-potency corticosteroids**: Generally avoided in sensitive areas due to increased risk of atrophy, striae, and systemic absorption [^1129Q6xg] [^116Wp8v2]. If absolutely necessary, use for ≤ 1–2 weeks with close monitoring [^111wVvGA].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting efficacy

- **Low-potency corticosteroids**: Clinical experience and guidelines support their effectiveness for short-term control of inverse psoriasis with minimal adverse effects [^112nawmb] [^1154VhTt].

- **Mid-potency corticosteroids**: Provide additional anti-inflammatory effect when low-potency agents are inadequate, but should be used sparingly and for short durations [^112nawmb].

- **Combination therapy**: Combining corticosteroids with calcipotriene or calcineurin inhibitors enhances efficacy and reduces steroid exposure, thereby minimizing adverse effects [^117WBQyS] [^115QqTYP].

---

## Safety considerations and adverse effects

- **Skin atrophy**: Higher risk in sensitive areas due to thinner skin and occlusion; limit potency and duration to mitigate this risk [^1129Q6xg] [^116Wp8v2].

- **Striae and telangiectasia**: Common with prolonged use of mid- to high-potency steroids in intertriginous areas [^1129Q6xg].

- **Systemic absorption**: Increased risk with high-potency steroids, large surface area, or prolonged use; monitor for HPA axis suppression, especially in children and when treating large areas [^113qfpde] [^113anTgC].

---

## Recommended duration and application guidelines

- **Initial treatment**: Apply once or twice daily for 2–4 weeks, then reassess and taper frequency or switch to maintenance therapy [^112nawmb] [^113dATUJ].

- **Maintenance therapy**: Transition to calcipotriene, tacrolimus, or pimecrolimus to maintain control and reduce steroid-related adverse effects [^112nawmb] [^111ngGUP].

- **Application technique**: Use the fingertip unit method to ensure appropriate dosing and minimize excess application [^116Wp8v2].

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

- **Calcineurin inhibitors**: Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment or pimecrolimus 1% cream are effective steroid-sparing options for maintenance therapy in sensitive areas [^111ngGUP] [^115YjwhW].

- **Vitamin D analogs**: Calcipotriene or calcitriol can be used alone or in combination with corticosteroids to enhance efficacy and reduce steroid exposure [^117WBQyS] [^114n66Ui].

- **Emollients**: Regular use improves barrier function, reduces irritation, and enhances comfort in sensitive areas [^notfound].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Potency** | **Recommended agents** | **Duration** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Low | Hydrocortisone 1–2.5%, desonide 0.05%, alclometasone 0.05% | ≤ 2–4 weeks | First-line therapy for sensitive areas |
| Mid | Triamcinolone 0.1%, fluocinolone 0.025% | ≤ 1–2 weeks | Short-term use if low-potency inadequate |
| High | Clobetasol 0.05%, betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% | ≤ 1 week | Reserve for severe flares; close monitoring |

---

Low- to mid-potency topical corticosteroids are most effective for inverse psoriasis in sensitive areas, providing short-term control with a favorable safety profile when used appropriately. Limit duration, avoid high-potency steroids, and transition to steroid-sparing agents for maintenance to minimize adverse effects [^112nawmb] [^111ngGUP].

### Topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis [^111ioMy3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis, and it is characterised by redness, thickness, and scaling. First-line management of chronic plaque psoriasis is with topical treatments, including vitamin D analogues, topical corticosteroids, tar-based preparations, dithranol, salicylic acid, and topical retinoids.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis, relative to placebo, and to similarly compare vitamin D analogues (used alone or in combination) with other topical treatments.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to February 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1948), EMBASE (from 1980), Science Citation Index (from 2008), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (from 2008), BIOSIS (from 1993), Dissertation Abstracts via DialogClassic (all publication years), and Inside Conferences (all publication years). We identified ongoing and unpublished studies from the UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials. We checked the bibliographies of published studies and reviews for further references to relevant trials, and we contacted trialists and companies for information about newly published studies. A separate search for adverse effects was undertaken in February 2011 using MEDLINE and EMBASE (from 2005). Final update searches for both RCTs and adverse effects were undertaken in August 2012. Although it has not been possible to incorporate RCTs and adverse effects studies identified through these final searches within this review, we will incorporate these into the next update.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing active topical treatments against placebo or against vitamin D analogues (used alone or in combination) in people with chronic plaque psoriasis.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author extracted study data and assessed study quality. A second author checked these data. We routinely contacted trialists and companies for missing data. We also extracted data on withdrawals and on local and systemic adverse events. We defined long-term trials as those with a duration of at least 24 weeks.

Main Results

This update added 48 trials and provided evidence on 7 new active treatments. In total, the review included 177 randomised controlled trials, with 34,808 participants, including 26 trials of scalp psoriasis and 6 trials of inverse psoriasis, facial psoriasis, or both. The number of included studies counted by Review Manager (RevMan) is higher than these figures (190) because we entered each study reporting a placebo and an active comparison into the 'Characteristics of included studies' table as 2 studies. When used on the body, most vitamin D analogues were significantly more effective than placebo, with the standardised mean difference (SMD) ranging from -0.67 (95% CI -1.04 to -0.30; 1 study, 119 participants) for twice-daily becocalcidiol to SMD -1.66 (95% CI -2.66 to -0.67; 1 study, 11 participants) for once-daily paricalcitol. On a 6-point global improvement scale, these effects translate into 0.8 and 1.9 points, respectively. Most corticosteroids also performed better than placebo; potent corticosteroids (SMD -0.89; 95% CI -1.06 to -0.72; I² statistic = 65.1%; 14 studies, 2011 participants) had smaller benefits than very potent corticosteroids (SMD -1.56; 95% CI -1.87 to -1.26); I² statistic = 81.7%; 10 studies, 1264 participants). On a 6-point improvement scale, these benefits equate to 1.0 and 1.8 points, respectively. Dithranol, combined treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid, and tazarotene all performed significantly better than placebo. Head-to-head comparisons of vitamin D for psoriasis of the body against potent or very potent corticosteroids had mixed findings. For both body and scalp psoriasis, combined treatment with vitamin D and corticosteroid performed significantly better than vitamin D alone or corticosteroid alone. Vitamin D generally performed better than coal tar, but findings relative to dithranol were mixed. When applied to psoriasis of the scalp, vitamin D was significantly less effective than both potent corticosteroids and very potent corticosteroids. Indirect evidence from placebo-controlled trials supported these findings. For both body and scalp psoriasis, potent corticosteroids were less likely than vitamin D to cause local adverse events, such as burning or irritation. Combined treatment with vitamin D/corticosteroid on either the body or the scalp was tolerated as well as potent corticosteroids, and significantly better than vitamin D alone. Only 25 trials assessed clinical cutaneous dermal atrophy; few cases were detected, but trials reported insufficient information to determine whether assessment methods were robust. Clinical measurements of dermal atrophy are insensitive and detect only the most severe cases. No comparison of topical agents found a significant difference in systemic adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroids perform at least as well as vitamin D analogues, and they are associated with a lower incidence of local adverse events. However, for people with chronic plaque psoriasis receiving long-term treatment with corticosteroids, there remains a lack of evidence about the risk of skin dermal atrophy. Further research is required to inform long-term maintenance treatment and provide appropriate safety data.

### Are ointments better than other vehicles for corticosteroid treatment of psoriasis? [^116WeUEs]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are the most common treatment agent for psoriasis in the United States (U.S.). Conventional dermatologic wisdom holds that ointment preparations provide the highest potency (due to their occlusive nature and moisturizing ability) and are best suited for psoriasis. This article presents evidence challenging the conventional belief that ointment vehicles are necessarily best for psoriasis. A previous systematic review of the efficacy of clinical trials of potent topical corticosteroids did not support greater efficacy or greater delivery of potent topical corticosteroids with ointment vehicles compared to other topical preparations. Moreover, preference studies demonstrate that psoriasis patients often find application of ointment to be messy, raising concerns about both short-term and long-term adherence to treatment. Recent compliance studies demonstrate that poor compliance to topical treatment is common among psoriasis patients and contributes to poor psoriasis treatment outcomes. Non-ointment topical corticosteroid products exhibit excellent efficacy in clinical practice. Much of the poor outcomes in psoriasis, even tachyphylaxis, likely relate less to actual medication failure and more to failure to apply the medication. Topical psoriasis treatment is likely to be more successful when physicians and patients discuss what type of vehicle the patient will use and plan treatment accordingly.

### Topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis: an abridged cochrane systematic review [^113DTrnR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis and is characterized by redness, thickness, and scaling. First-line management is with topical treatments.

Objective

We sought to undertake a Cochrane review of topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis.

Methods

We systematically searched major databases for randomized controlled trials. Trials reported improvement using a range of related measures; standardized, pooled findings were translated onto a 6-point improvement scale.

Results

The review included 177 randomized controlled trials with 34,808 participants, including 26 trials of scalp psoriasis and 6 trials of inverse and/or facial psoriasis. Typical trial duration was 3 to 8 weeks. When compared with placebo (emollient base), the average improvement for vitamin-D analogues and potent corticosteroids was approximately 1 point, dithranol 1.2 points, very potent corticosteroids 1.8 points, and combined vitamin-D analogue plus steroid 1.4 points once daily and 2.2 points twice daily. However, these are indicative benefits drawn from heterogeneous trial findings. Corticosteroids were more effective than vitamin D for treating psoriasis of the scalp. For both body and scalp psoriasis, potent corticosteroids were less likely than vitamin D to cause skin irritation.

Limitations

Reporting of benefits, adverse effects, and safety assessment methods was often inadequate. In many comparisons, heterogeneity made the size of treatment benefit uncertain.

Conclusions

Corticosteroids are as effective as vitamin-D analogues and cause less skin irritation. However, further research is needed to inform long-term maintenance treatment and provide appropriate safety data.

Psoriasis topical therapy — role and mechanisms of topical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids are the cornerstone of treatment for the majority of patients with psoriasis, particularly those with limited disease, and they are available in many strengths and formulations, which allows for versatility of use. The mechanisms of action of corticosteroids include anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, immunosuppressive, and vasoconstrictive effects, mediated through their binding to intracellular corticosteroid receptors and regulation of gene transcription of numerous genes, particularly those that code for proinflammatory cytokines.

Topical corticosteroid selection and use in psoriasis should consider severity, site, patient preference, and age; lower potency corticosteroids should generally be used for limited periods on the face, intertriginous areas, areas with thin skin, and in infants, whereas in other areas and in adults, mid- or high-potency agents are generally recommended as initial therapy; patients with thick, chronic plaques often require the highest potency corticosteroids; for class I corticosteroids, the available data allow for 2 to 4 weeks of use with increased risk if used continuously for longer periods; when topical corticosteroids are used, it is recommended that a gradual reduction in frequency of usage following clinical response be instituted; many factors can alter efficacy including vehicle, area, occlusion, patient preference, and age; topical steroids range from 1% hydrocortisone to superpotent clobetasol propionate.

### Consensus statements on the use of corticosteroid-containing topical medications in psoriasis [^112acsNp]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

This article aims to provide consensus statements on the use of corticosteroid-containing topical medications for the management of psoriasis. This Psoriasis Expert Group (PEG) includes dermatologist voting members with expertise in psoriasis who convened and evaluated the use of topical medications and previously published guidelines. A modified Delphi process was conducted to reach consensus results. Two rounds of voting were conducted for each topic and panel consensus was determined.&nbsp; Nine statements were developed regarding topical medication efficacy, patient quality of life, frequency of application, medication "feel", and safety and tolerability. Dermatologist experts voted on the statements separately. Patients were not polled. All items received agreement: 15 with high consensus and 1 with moderate consensus.&nbsp; For the treatment of psoriasis, the PEG agreed that patients and physicians prefer topical medications that are effective, provide long-lasting results, have a quick onset of action, and "feel good on the skin" with few adverse effects. The developed consensus statements provide guidance on the topical treatment of psoriasis, including combination therapies, such as a vitamin D and topical corticosteroid analog. These recommendations will be continuously reviewed and updated as more evidence continues to emerge.&nbsp; April W. Armstrong AW, Reddy R, Khan S, et al.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Topical treatment of inverse/intertriginous and genital psoriasis — Inverse psoriasis can involve the axillae, inframammary areas, abdominal, inguinal, and gluteal folds, groin, genitalia, perineum, and perirectal area, with lesions that are erythematous, less indurated, and well demarcated with minimal scale, and genital psoriasis causes a significant psychological impact. In flexural areas, penetration of medications is facilitated by ambient humidity but the irritation and risk of atrophy from more potent topical corticosteroids is significantly increased, so care is needed to minimize irritation and toxicity by using lower potencies of topical corticosteroids, diluting calcipotriene with a moisturizer or using calcitriol, and calcineurin inhibitors (topical tacrolimus and topical pimecrolimus) are helpful in inverse and genital psoriasis.

### Psoriasis: recognition and management strategies [^1114opn4]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for psoriasis, more specifically with respect to topical therapy, corticosteroids, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to offer topical corticosteroids as first-line therapy in patients with any form of mild-to-moderate psoriasis.

### An update on topical therapies for mild-moderate psoriasis [^113WfuCp]. Dermatologic Clinics (2015). Low credibility.

Topical therapies are the mainstream treatment of psoriasis because most patients have mild disease. First-line treatments are vitamin D derivatives and corticosteroids. These treatments are usually given in combination schedules. For topical treatments the selection of the most appropriate vehicle is of major importance, thus improving adherence to the treatment, which frequently is impaired by the complexities of topical therapeutic choices. Evidence for efficacy and safety of topical treatments is readily available for vitamin D treatments and short-term treatment with corticosteroids. However, the scientific evidence for longer-term treatments is limited. Multiple new small molecules are in various stages of development and are reviewed.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. section 3. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies [^115zeXDU]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis topical corticosteroids — trial duration, relapse, and tachyphylaxis: The short duration of treatment of only several weeks in most clinical trials limits assessment of long-term efficacy and risks, and psoriasis invariably recurs after discontinuation of topical corticosteroid treatment; in studies where the class II corticosteroid betamethasone dipropionate ointment was discontinued abruptly, the mean duration of remission was 2 months. Tachyphylaxis, defined as the loss of effectiveness with continued use, may affect long-term results, but whether this reflects true loss of effectiveness or loss of compliance remains controversial, and further investigation is encouraged.

### Treatment of inverse / intertriginous psoriasis: updated guidelines from the medical board of the National Psoriasis Foundation [^1154VhTt]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Inverse or intertriginous psoriasis commonly involves skin fold areas including the axillae, perianal skin, intergluteal cleft, inframammary, genital/inguinal, abdominal, and retroauricular folds. After reviewing the literature for new treatments, a task force was convened to update a consensus on inverse psoriasis therapy. Short-term treatment continues to be low-potency topical steroids. In order to avoid steroid-induced adverse effects, long-term therapy includes topical immunomodulators, calcitriol, and calcipotriene. Second and third-line therapies include antimicrobials, emollients, and tar-based products. Inverse psoriasis resistant to topical therapy has been shown to respond to botulinum toxin injections, excimer laser therapy, and certain systemic agents (such as anti-TNF and anti-IL12/IL23 therapy). Based on promising results from case reports and prior clinical experience, these systemic agents should be strongly considered in inverse psoriasis resistant to topical therapy. However, they need further evidence-based evaluation. The use of randomized trials and objective severity indices may allow for more robust therapeutic data. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(8):760–766. </em>.

Combination topical therapy — corticosteroids with vitamin D analogues shows greater efficacy with generally fewer side effects: "The combination of topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues appears to be more efficacious than either therapy alone, with fewer side effects noted in most, but not all, studies". Supporting evidence notes, "This point has been demonstrated for several different corticosteroid-calcipotriol combinations".

Combination topical therapy — corticosteroids with salicylic acid may be beneficial but should be potency-limited: "The combination of topical corticosteroids and salicylic acid may be valuable because of the ability of salicylic acid to enhance the efficacy of corticosteroids by increasing penetration", and to avoid toxicity, "it is recommended that this combination be limited to no more than medium-potency (class 3–4) topical corticosteroids". This aligns with the general statement that "combination regimens, utilizing medications from different categories, have been studied and shown to be potentially beneficial".

### Treatment of intertriginous psoriasis: from the medical board of the National Psoriasis Foundation [^112nawmb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Involvement of areas of the skin fold is common in patients with psoriasis although the exact incidence is unknown. This report summarizes studies regarding the therapy of intertriginous psoriasis.

Objective

A task force of the National Psoriasis Foundation Medical Board was convened to evaluate treatment options. Our aim was to arrive at a consensus on therapy for intertriginous or inverse psoriasis.

Methods

Reports in the literature were reviewed regarding psoriasis affecting the skin-fold areas and its therapy.

Limitations

There are few evidence-based studies on the treatment of intertriginous psoriasis.

Results

The recommended short-term (2–4 weeks) therapy for inverse psoriasis is low- to mid-potency topical steroids. For long-term therapy, topical calcipotriene (calcipotriol) or one of the immunomodulating agents, pimecrolimus or tacrolimus, is favored.

Conclusions

Low- to mid-potency topical steroids are recommended as first-line, short-term treatment. It is recommended that their use should either be of limited duration (less than 2–4 weeks) or that the lowest effective strength be used intermittently for long-term care to minimize the potential for risks. Calcipotriene (calcipotriol), pimecrolimus, and tacrolimus, while not as highly efficacious as topical steroids, are associated with fewer long-term risks and are therefore recommended for long-term therapy when feasible.

Topical corticosteroids — classification and selection in adult psoriasis — are classified into 7 categories based on skin vasoconstrictive activity, ranging in strength from ultra-high (class 1) to low (class 6 and 7), and choosing potency and vehicle should be based on disease severity, disease location, patient preference, and age. In adults, corticosteroids in classes 2 through 5 are generally recommended as initial therapy; lower potency corticosteroids should be used on the face, intertriginous areas, and areas that are susceptible to steroid atrophy (eg, forearms) and other adverse effects, while areas with thick, chronic plaques often require treatment with class 1 (ultrahigh-potency) corticosteroids.

### Topical treatments for scalp psoriasis [^112eya4y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

People with chronic plaque psoriasis often have lesions on the scalp. Hair makes the scalp difficult to treat and the adjacent facial skin is particularly sensitive to topical treatments.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of topical treatments for scalp psoriasis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to August 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2015, Issue 7), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched five trials registers, screened abstracts of six psoriasis-specific conferences and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel-group, cross-over or within-patient design of topical treatments for people of all ages with scalp psoriasis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment. Disagreements were settled by reference to a third author. To assess the quality of evidence, we focused on the following outcomes: 'clearance' or 'response' as assessed by the investigator global assessment (IGA), improvement in quality of life, adverse events requiring withdrawal of treatment and 'response' as assessed by the patient global assessment (PGA). We expressed the results of the single studies as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. If studies were sufficiently homogeneous, we meta-analysed the data by using the random-effects model. Where it was not possible to calculate a point estimate for a single study, we described the data qualitatively. We also presented the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB). We categorised topical corticosteroids according to the German classification of corticosteroid potency as mild, moderate, high and very high.

Main Results

We included 59 RCTs with a total of 11,561 participants. Thirty studies were either conducted or sponsored by the manufacturer of the study medication. The risk of bias varied considerably among the included studies. For instance, most authors did not state the randomisation method and few addressed allocation concealment. Most findings were limited to short-term treatments, since most studies were conducted for less than six months. Only one trial investigated long-term therapy (12 months). Although we found a wide variety of different interventions, we limited the grading of the quality of evidence to three major comparisons: steroid versus vitamin D, two-compound combination of steroid and vitamin D versus steroid monotherapy and versus vitamin D. In terms of clearance, as assessed by the IGA, steroids were better than vitamin D (RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.18; four studies, 2180 participants, NNTB = 8; 95% CI 7 to 11; moderate quality evidence). Statistically, the two-compound combination was superior to steroid monotherapy, however the additional benefit was small (RR 1.22; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.36; four studies, 2474 participants, NNTB = 17; 95% CI 11 to 41; moderate quality evidence). The two-compound combination was more effective than vitamin D alone (RR 2.28; 95% CI 1.87 to 2.78; four studies, 2008 participants, NNTB = 6; 95% CI 5 to 7; high quality evidence). In terms of treatment response, as assessed by the IGA, corticosteroids were more effective than vitamin D (RR 2.09; 95% CI 1.80 to 2.41; three studies, 1827 participants; NNTB = 4; 95% CI 4 to 5; high quality evidence). The two-compound combination was better than steroid monotherapy, but the additional benefit was small (RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.25; three studies, 2444 participants, NNTB = 13; 95% CI 9 to 24; moderate quality evidence). It was also more effective than vitamin D alone (RR 2.31; 95% CI 1.75 to 3.04; four studies, 2222 participants, NNTB = 3; 95% CI 3 to 4; moderate quality evidence). Reporting of quality of life data was poor and data were insufficient to be included for meta-analysis. Steroids caused fewer withdrawals due to adverse events than vitamin D (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.42; four studies, 2291 participants; moderate quality evidence). The two-compound combination and steroid monotherapy did not differ in the number of adverse events leading withdrawal (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.88; three studies, 2433 participants; moderate quality evidence). The two-compound combination led to fewer withdrawals due to adverse events than vitamin D (RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.36; three studies, 1970 participants; high quality evidence). No study reported the type of adverse event requiring withdrawal. In terms of treatment response, as assessed by the PGA, steroids were more effective than vitamin D (RR 1.48; 95% CI 1.28 to 1.72; three studies, 1827 participants; NNTB = 5; 95% CI 5 to 7; moderate quality evidence). Statistically, the two-compound combination was better than steroid monotherapy, however the benefit was not clinically important (RR 1.13; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.20; two studies, 2226 participants; NNTB = 13; 95% CI 9 to 26; high quality evidence). The two-compound combination was more effective than vitamin D (RR 1.76; 95% CI 1.46 to 2.12; four studies, 2222 participants; NNTB = 4; 95% CI 3 to 6; moderate quality evidence). Common adverse events with these three interventions were local irritation, skin pain and folliculitis. Systemic adverse events were rare and probably not drug-related. In addition to the results of the major three comparisons we found that the two-compound combination, steroids and vitamin D monotherapy were more effective than the vehicle. Steroids of moderate, high and very high potency tended to be similarly effective and well tolerated. There are inherent limitations in this review concerning the evaluation of salicylic acid, tar, dithranol or other topical treatments.

Authors' Conclusions

The two-compound combination as well as corticosteroid monotherapy were more effective and safer than vitamin D monotherapy. Given the similar safety profile and only slim benefit of the two-compound combination over the steroid alone, monotherapy with generic topical steroids may be fully acceptable for short-term therapy. Future RCTs should investigate how specific therapies improve the participants' quality of life. Long-term assessments are needed (i.e. 6 to 12 months).

### Topical therapies for the treatment of plaque psoriasis: systematic review and network meta-analyses [^113DP85b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The majority of people with psoriasis have localized disease, where topical therapy forms the cornerstone of treatment. We set out to summarize evidence on the relative efficacy, safety and tolerability of different topical treatments used in plaque psoriasis. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized trial data of U.K.-licensed topical therapies. The primary outcome was clear or nearly clear status stratified for (i) trunk and limbs; and (ii) scalp. Network meta-analyses allowed ranking of treatment efficacy. In total, 48 studies were available for trunk and limb psoriasis, and 17 for scalp psoriasis (22,028 patients in total); the majority included people with at least moderate severity psoriasis. Strategies containing potent corticosteroids (alone or in combination with a vitamin D analogue) or very potent corticosteroids dominated the treatment hierarchy at both sites (trunk and limbs, scalp); coal tar and retinoids were no better than placebo. No significant differences in achievement of clear or nearly clear status were observed between twice- and once-daily application of the same intervention or between any of the following: combined vitamin D analogue and potent corticosteroid (applied separately or in a single product), very potent corticosteroids, or potent corticosteroids (applied twice daily). Investigator and patient assessment of response differed significantly for some interventions (response rates to very potent corticosteroids: 78% and 39%, respectively). No significant differences were noted for tolerability or steroid atrophy, but data were limited. In conclusion, corticosteroids are highly effective in psoriasis when used continuously for up to 8 weeks and intermittently for up to 52 weeks. Coal tar and retinoids are of limited benefit. There is a lack of long-term efficacy and safety data available on topical interventions used for psoriasis.

### Psoriasis [^114nk7xr]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is often associated with systemic manifestations. It affects about 2 percent of U.S. adults, and can significantly impact quality of life. The etiology includes genetic and environmental factors. Diagnosis is based on the typical erythematous, scaly skin lesions, often with additional manifestations in the nails and joints. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Atypical forms include guttate, pustular, erythrodermic, and inverse psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Topical therapies such as corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs, and tazarotene are useful for treating mild to moderate psoriasis. More severe psoriasis may be treated with phototherapy, or may require systemic therapy. Biologic therapies, including tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, can be effective for severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, but have significant adverse effect profiles and require regular monitoring. Management of psoriasis must be individualized and may involve combinations of different medications and phototherapy.

### Choosing topical corticosteroids [^117ViBdX]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are one of the oldest and most useful treatments for dermatologic conditions. There are many topical steroids available, and they differ in potency and formulation. Successful treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis and consideration of the steroid's delivery vehicle, potency, frequency of application, duration of treatment, and side effects. Although use of topical steroids is common, evidence of effectiveness exists only for select conditions, such as psoriasis, vitiligo, eczema, atopic dermatitis, phimosis, acute radiation dermatitis, and lichen sclerosus. Evidence is limited for use in melasma, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and alopecia areata.

### Corticosteroids: options in the era of steroid-sparing therapy [^111tkvzf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids remain the most commonly used topical treatments for inflammatory dermatoses, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Topical corticosteroids are available in a variety of vehicles-creams, ointments, lotions, gels, and, more recently, foam. The vehicle used can substantially affect the individual agent's clinical action, potency, and acceptability to the patient. Moreover, some vehicles are better suited for specific body areas. Selection of the appropriate product should be determined by area of usage, physician experience, cost, and patient preference, particularly regarding vehicle. Although topical corticosteroids are associated with several side effects, including skin atrophy, telangiectases, purpura, and striae formation, appropriate usage can minimize these occurrences. Judicious use includes short-term, appropriate application as initial monotherapy or in combination strategies with other therapeutic agents that ideally possess complementing mechanisms of action. Examples include pulsing with high-potency topical corticosteroids and combination regimens with other topical agents such as topical calcineurin inhibitors, calcipotriene, or tazarotene. Appropriate education of patients and caregivers alike will facilitate the optimal use of these medications.

### Tacrolimus ointment is effective for facial and intertriginous psoriasis [^115YjwhW]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Intertriginous and facial involvement are manifestations of psoriasis that require a different approach than is used for typical plaque psoriasis on other skin areas. Topical corticosteroids are the primary treatment for psoriasis; however, the side effects of corticosteroids are magnified on intertriginous and facial skin. Topical tacrolimus offers the potential for anti-inflammatory effect without the atrophy or other local side effects associated with the use of topical corticosteroids.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of facial or intertriginous psoriasis.

Methods

One hundred sixty-seven patients 16 years or older were evaluated in an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multi-center study. Upon entry into the study, patients were randomized 2:1 to apply the tacrolimus ointment 0.1% or vehicle twice daily to all psoriatic lesions of the face or intertriginous areas for 8 weeks. The physician's global assessment was used to assess improvement from baseline. The inverse psoriasis severity for patients was measured using a 6-point scale from clear to very severe.

Results

As early as day 8, more patients (P = 0.004) had cleared or achieved excellent improvement in the 0.1% tacrolimus ointment group compared to the vehicle group (24.8% vs 5.8%). At the end of the 8-week treatment period 65.2% of the tacrolimus ointment group and 31.5% of the vehicle were clear or almost clear (P < .0001) based on a Static Severity Score. Adverse events were similar in the 0.1% tacrolimus ointment and vehicle groups. Conclusion Tacrolimus ointment is an effective treatment for psoriasis of the face or intertriginous areas.

### Topical treatments for scalp psoriasis: summary of a cochrane systematic review [^11264ZH9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

People with chronic plaque psoriasis often have lesions on the scalp that are difficult to treat. This report is a summary of a Cochrane review on the efficacy and safety of topical treatments for scalp psoriasis. For quality-of-evidence assessment, we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group approach. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion. We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS; ongoing trials; indexes of included studies and screened abstracts of six psoriasis-specific conferences up to August 2015. We included 59 RCTs, with 11 561 participants overall. Most findings were limited to short-term treatments (< 6 months). According to the clinician and patients' self-assessment, a corticosteroid-vitamin D combination (e.g. betamethasone dipropionate plus calcipotriol) and corticosteroids of high and very high potency were better than vitamin D. The two-compound combination was superior to the corticosteroid alone, but the additional benefit was small. Reporting of quality-of-life data was insufficient. The two-compound combination and corticosteroids caused fewer withdrawals due to adverse events than vitamin D. There was no difference between the two-compound combination and corticosteroid monotherapy concerning this outcome. Overall the evidence was of moderate quality. Evaluation of other topical treatments was limited. Given the comparable safety profile and only slim benefit of the two-compound combination over the corticosteroid alone, monotherapy with generic topical corticosteroids of high and very high potency may be fully acceptable for short-term therapy. More quality-of-life data and long-term assessments are needed.

### Psoriasis: recognition and management strategies [^115rKeML]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin and systemic disorder that affects 3.2% of the U.S. population, including 1% of children. It is an immune-mediated process triggered by an interplay of genetic, environmental, physical (e.g., skin trauma), and infectious factors. Associated comorbidities include cardiovascular disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory bowel disease. Psoriasis presents in various forms, including plaque, guttate, erythrodermic, pustular, inverse, nail, and psoriatic arthritis. The most common form is plaque psoriasis, which affects 90% of adults with psoriasis. Psoriasis is diagnosed clinically based on the presence of characteristic erythematous, scaly skin plaques in typical locations, with associated history and systemic symptoms. Treatment strategies are similar for most forms of psoriasis and based on body surface area involved. Topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, and tazarotene are used to treat mild to moderate disease. Systemic treatment with nonbiologic and biologic agents and ultraviolet B phototherapy are used for moderate to severe disease, with the exception of apremilast, a systemic agent approved for mild psoriasis. Disease management is improved with maintaining ideal body weight, avoiding tobacco products, limiting alcohol, and practicing stress reduction techniques. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index is a tool to assess severity and monitor treatment effectiveness over time. Special consideration is needed for treatment of children and patients who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or trying to conceive.

### Dermatologists' knowledge of and preferences regarding topical steroids [^117EovbC]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Topical corticosteroids are the standard-of-care treatment for dermatitis, mild psoriasis, and other inflammatory skin diseases. Prescribing practices rely on knowledge of topical corticosteroid potency, as well as potential side effects including steroid allergies.

Purpose

The primary aim of this study is to determine how dermatologists classify particular topical corticosteroids according to potency, and which products they prefer in cases when allergenicity is a concern,

Methods

The data were collected and analyzed from 105 US-based dermatologists surveyed at the 2011 Summer American Academy of Dermatology meeting.

Results

The majority of dermatologists were in agreement on the potency ranking of many commonly prescribed topical corticosteroids. Two thirds of the surveyed dermatologists expressed concern about allergy to topical corticosteroids. In cases of a suspected allergy, desoximetasone was the leading product dermatologists would choose to prescribe.

Limitations

The survey was limited to attendees of an educational conference, possibly leading to an overestimation of dermatologist knowledge of topical steroids.

Conclusions

This study shows that dermatologists are generally knowledgeable about group classifications of corticosteroids in terms of potency and that they can appropriately select a topical product with low potential for allergy

### Topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis [^111TJnRK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis and is characterised by redness, thickness and scaling. First line management of chronic plaque psoriasis is with topical treatments, including vitamin D analogues, topical corticosteroids, tar-based preparations, dithranol, salicylic acid and topical retinoids.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness, tolerability and safety of topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis with placebo; to compare vitamin D analogues with other topical treatments.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Skin Group's Trials Register was searched (2004/12). To update an unpublished 2002 review we also searched CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (Issue 1,2005); MEDLINE (to 2005/02); EMBASE (to 2005/08); Science Citation Index (to 2005); Biosis (to 2005); Dissertation Abstracts (all publication years); Inside Conferences (all publication years); SIGLE (to 2005); National Research Register (all projects with a start date of 2001 to 2005); metaRegister of Current Controlled Trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing treatments against placebo or against vitamin D analogues in people with chronic plaque psoriasis.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author extracted study data and assessed study quality. A second author checked these data. We routinely contacted triallists and companies for missing data. We extracted data on withdrawals and adverse events.

Main Results

The review included 131 RCTs with 21,448 participants. Vitamin D was significantly more effective than placebo, although there was a wide variation in effect size with the standardised mean difference (SMD) ranging from -0.82 (95% CI -1.34 to -0.29) to -1.90 (95% CI -2.09 to -1.71). With one exception, all corticosteroids performed better than placebo, with potent corticosteroids (SMD: -0.95 (95% CI: -1.11 to -0.80; I(2): 61.1%; 17 studies; 2386 participants)) having smaller benefits than very potent corticosteroids (SMD: -1.29 (95% CI: -1.45 to -1.13; I(2): 53.2%; 11 studies; 1571 participants)). Dithranol and tazarotene performed better than placebo. Head-to-head comparisons of vitamin D against potent or very potent corticosteroids found no significant differences. However, combined treatment with vitamin D /corticosteroid performed significantly better than either vitamin D alone or corticosteroid alone. Vitamin D performed better than coal tar, but findings relative to dithranol were mixed. Potent corticosteroids were less likely than vitamin D to cause local adverse events. No comparison of topical agents found a significant difference in systemic adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroids perform as well as vitamin D analogues and are associated with a lower incidence of local adverse events. Further research is required to inform long-term maintenance treatment.

### The biological rationale for use of vitamin D analogs in combination with corticosteroids for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis [^115QqTYP]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs are well established as safe and effective first-line treatments for mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. They act via distinct and complementary mechanisms of action: vitamin D analogs primarily counter epidermal dysregulation, inhibiting epidermal hyperproliferation and inducing keratinocyte differentiation, whereas corticosteroids act primarily as immunosuppressors, targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Furthermore, both agents have additional activity that may complement their main effects: vitamin D analogs have some immunomodulatory properties and corticosteroids may impact on keratinocyte differentiation. Based on their dominant mechanisms of action, there is a strong scientific rationale for the combination of corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs in the treatment of plaque psoriasis. Indeed, the combination has been shown to have a greater effect on the immune-mediated mechanisms of psoriasis than either monotherapy used alone. There is also a strong biological rationale for decreased side effects with the combination. Vitamin D may restore epidermal barrier function, which is impaired with corticosteroid use, and counteract steroid-induced skin atrophy. Corticosteroids may reduce perilesional skin irritation induced by vitamin D analogs. Although clinical data strongly support improved efficacy and tolerability with a combination of calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate, additional studies are needed to further investigate their underlying mechanisms.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. section 3. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies [^113qfpde]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis topical corticosteroids — precautions, dosing limits, and systemic effects: Local cutaneous side effects, which occur more frequently than systemic side effects, are more commonly seen at steroid-sensitive sites, including the face and intertriginous areas, as well as in any areas that are treated over the long term; these include skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae distensae, acne, folliculitis, and purpura, and rebound can occur wherein disease recurs worse than the pretreatment baseline after discontinuation. Systemic side effects, although infrequent, may occur, with the greatest risk when ultra-high-potency or high-potency corticosteroids are used over a large surface for a prolonged period or under occlusion; the continuous use of class I topical corticosteroids should normally be limited to no more than twice daily for up to 2 to 4 weeks and no more than 50 g/wk. Although symptomatic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression is a relatively uncommon side effect, laboratory evidence is more common with more potent agents, and in two distinct studies, 20% of patients treated with clobetasol ointment (class I) had laboratory evidence for HPA suppression compared to 3% with desonide ointment (class VI). Infants and younger children are at increased risk of local and systemic side effects, all topical corticosteroids are pregnancy category C and of unknown safety in nursing women, and approaches to minimize side effects include transitioning to weaker potency agents after clinical improvement and intermittent usage (weekend only).

### Topical psoriasis therapy… [^113X6nLG]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Salicylic acid in concentrations of 5 to 10 percent compounded in petrolatum, acid mantle cream or even mid-strength topical corticosteroids can be used twice daily for several weeks at a time on thick keratotic plaques. Stronger concentrations of keratolytics can be applied for about two weeks to remove the thick scale to enable other topical therapies to better penetrate the skin. Urea-containing preparations and alphahydroxy acids, such as glycolic and lactic acids, are also effective keratolytic agents. However, it appears to have antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory actions, and clinical use has demonstrated its efficacy. Not only is coal tar beneficial when used alone in patients with mild to moderate psoriasis, it is also useful in combination with ultraviolet B radiation and has been successful in cases that were refractory to other treatment modalities.
11.

Calcipotriene, a topical vitamin D analog, has been available in the United States since
1993. Short-term clinical trials have demonstrated that it is at least as effective as betamethasone 17 valerate ointment 17, 18 and superior to short-contact anthralin cream 19 or 15 percent coal tar. 20 Long-term studies have also shown that the short-term response to calciprotriene can be maintained for up to 12 months.
21. Calcipotriene, applied twice daily, is generally well tolerated, although the face and groin areas should be avoided since it may cause irritant dermatitis. Topical retinoids were developed to avoid many of these systemic side effects. In June 1997, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration labeled tazarotene for the treatment of psoriasis involving up to 20 percent of the body surface area. Applied topically, tazarotene is rapidly metabolized in the skin and converted to to the active metabolite, tazarotenic acid.

Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of both 0. 05 and
0. 1 percent tazarotene gel. 25, 26 Study results suggest that tazarotene use may lead to an extended response, providing long-term improvement and maintenance therapy. 26 The gel formulation is suitable for the treatment of scalp psoriasis. Unlike calcipotriene, tazarotene can be used to treat psoriasis of the face.

### The power of combination topical therapy for psoriasis [^112rrcLh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease where the use of topical corticosteroids is a mainstream treatment. However, the continuous use of high potency topical corticosteroids is limited by a variety of well known adverse events which include, atrophy, and telangiectasia. Also, inhibition of lipid synthesis by steroids can cause impairment of the epidermal barrier, which is already disrupted in most of the inflammatory cutaneous disorders such as psoriasis. This will further lead to increase transepidermal water loss (TEWL), decreased hydration, dry skin, and irritation. On the other hand, topical vitamin D analogs directly affect keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation as well as modulation of epidermal lipids and antimicrobial peptides. Although the exact mechanism of action of topical vitamin D analogs is not well understood in the treatment of psoriasis, their efficacy and safety has been shown in several clinical trials over the years and they are widely used for psoriasis. Therefore, combination of topical steroids and vitamin D analogs may be a logical option for the treatment of psoriasis.

### A phase I, randomized, double-blind study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the topical RORC2 inverse agonist PF-06763809 in participants with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis [^114DwPK6]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study was approved by Ethik‐Kommission der Ärztekammer Hamburg, Germany, and all participants provided written informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was in compliance with the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines, and all local regulatory requirements were followed.

Study design

This study (trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03469336) was conducted between 24 April 2018 and 20 March 2019 at two sites in Germany. This was a randomized, double‐blind, vehicle‐ and active comparator‐controlled, multiple‐dose study in participants with psoriasis. Each participant received the following six treatments on up to three comparable plaques (six treatment areas) once daily for 18 days: three topical doses (2.3%, 0.8% and 0.23%) of PF‐06763809, the PF‐06763809 vehicle and two active comparators [0.1% betamethasone 1 mg/g and calcipotriol 0.005% (50 µg/mL)]. All of the treatments were in solution formulations, and further details of the dose selection are included in the supplementary information (Data S1).

Participants were screened within 28 days prior to the application of the investigational product. Participation in the study was for approximately 7–11 weeks, including the interval from screening to the follow‐up call visit on Day 49 (Fig. 1). Participants, investigator site staff and the sponsor study team were blinded to the study treatment. Blinded investigators performed all efficacy and safety assessments; however, a small number of unblinded nurses were designated at each site to ensure that the biopsies were obtained from the correct treatment areas.

### Topical treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis of the scalp: a systematic review [^1131AccJ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis and is characterized by redness, thickness and scaling. First-line management is with topical treatments.

Objectives

Our objective was to establish the effectiveness, tolerability and safety of topical treatments for people with chronic plaque psoriasis of the scalp, assessing placebo-controlled trials of all treatments and head-to-head trials that assessed vitamin D analogues.

Methods

As part of a Cochrane review of topical treatments for psoriasis, we systematically searched electronic databases for randomized controlled trials. The review included 26 randomized controlled trials of treatments for psoriasis of the scalp with 8020 participants. Trials used several measures to assess changes in psoriasis severity: these were combined using the standardized mean difference metric and interpreted by reporting as a six-point global improvement score.

Results

On effectiveness grounds, very potent or potent steroid treatments should be preferred to vitamin D3 analogue with approximately an average 10% additional improvement on a six-point scale. Vitamin D3 analogue combined with potent steroid appears slightly more effective than potent steroid monotherapy (3% additional improvement on a six-point scale). Rates of withdrawal from treatment and adverse events in trials were generally low and similar to those for placebo. There remains uncertainty about the atrophic potential of corticosteroid treatments for scalp psoriasis.

Conclusions

Corticosteroids are more effective than vitamin D analogues and similarly tolerated. However, further research is needed to inform long-term maintenance treatment and provide appropriate safety data.

### Mechanisms of action of topical therapies and the rationale for combination therapy [^112VLeJN]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The advent of new topical agents such as topical calcineurin inhibitors, as well as the reformulations of older agents in new vehicles, has broadened the treatment approaches to psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. The clinician must now consider additional novel physiologic pathways and mechanisms of action as well as expanding options for combination therapy. Combination therapy is especially beneficial when the selected agents possess differing mechanisms of action that provide additive or synergistic efficacy, reducing the required doses of the individual agents compared with monotherapy and potentially limiting side effects. Therapeutic approaches also can be rotated or used in various sequences for maintenance therapy. In psoriasis, a number of trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of combination therapy. Although combination therapy has not been extensively studied in atopic dermatitis, many practitioners combine topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors in their clinical practice because the two drug classes have different and possibly complementary mechanisms of action. For both diseases, the decision as to what agents are combined must also be tempered by patient type, disease presentation or severity, and patient preferences.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis are two common chronic inflammatory skin diseases that have a negative impact on the quality of life of patients. Affecting both children and adults, AD is characterized by red, inflamed, eczematous lesions and pruritus, with up to 90% of patients presenting with mild-to-moderate disease. In infants and young children, the face, neck, and extensor skin areas are frequently involved, while older children and adults often present with flexural fold involvement of the extremities (i.e. antecubital and popliteal fossae). In addition to disease involvement in sensitive skin areas, patients with AD have higher skin sensitivity (e.g. stinging, burning, itching, pain) to cosmetics and environmental factors. Psoriasis can occur at any stage of an individual's life, and is often characterized by red plaques of thickened skin covered in silver or white scales that may affect any area of the body, with the knees, elbows, lower back, and scalp being the most common sites. While plaque psoriasis (also known as psoriasis vulgaris) is the most common type of psoriasis (approximately 90% of all cases), other site-specific variants also exist, such as inverse psoriasis, which is often smooth, red, and shiny in appearance, affecting sensitive skin fold areas (e.g. groin, gluteal cleft, axillae, and genitals).

Although chronic inflammatory skin diseases such as AD and psoriasis can be effectively treated with topical treatments, a number of safety concerns warrant special consideration. In psoriasis, cutaneous irritation may develop following treatment with topical retinoids and vitamin D analogs. Topical corticosteroids (TCSs) and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are effective treatment options for AD, but use of TCS on thin-skinned areas such as the face, intertriginous areas, and genitals are limited by potential adverse effects. TCIs are associated with application-site reactions (e.g. burning or stinging sensations), particularly in sensitive skin areas, and contain a boxed warning citing cases of malignancy. Additionally, the American Academy of Dermatology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology has issued guidelines recommending that the application of TCSs on the face, eyelids, genitalia, and intertriginous areas be avoided or administered with caution to avoid increased risk of systemic absorption and subsequent systemic adverse effects.

### Topical therapies for the treatment of localized plaque psoriasis in primary care: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^112QpQ76]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Topical therapies are a mainstay of psoriasis treatment, but they vary substantially in terms of cost.

Objectives

To determine the cost-effectiveness and optimal treatment sequence for psoriasis of the trunk, limbs and scalp.

Methods

Probabilities of response from a network meta-analysis were used to determine the short-term efficacy of topical therapies. Longer-term outcomes, including relapse, were informed by published evidence and clinical opinion. Benefits of treatment were measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Direct costs included topical agents, primary and secondary care visits and second-line therapies for treatment failures.

Results

For the trunk and limbs, initial treatment with a two-compound formulation (TCF) product containing vitamin D and potent corticosteroid provided the most QALYs, followed by separate morning and evening application of vitamin D and potent corticosteroid [two-compound application, TCA (am/pm)], and then twice-daily potent corticosteroids. The use of twice-daily potent corticosteroids was the most cost-effective first-line strategy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio £ 20,000 per QALY), followed by TCA (am/pm) (£ 22,658 per QALY) and TCF product (£ 179,439 per QALY). For scalp psoriasis, initial treatment with very potent corticosteroids generated the most QALYs, followed by TCF product and then potent corticosteroids. Very potent corticosteroids were the most cost-effective treatment but, if too aggressive, potent corticosteroids were optimal followed by TCF product (£ 219,846 per QALY). The cost-effectiveness of second- and third-line topical agents varied with the assumptions made.

Conclusions

Potent corticosteroids, used alone or in combination with vitamin D, are the most cost-effective treatment for patients with psoriasis of the trunk and limbs. Potent or very potent corticosteroids are the most cost-effective treatment for patients with scalp psoriasis.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. section 3. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies [^114SwC4G]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis topical therapy — combination use, potency strategy, supervision, and adherence: Topical medications can sometimes be used concurrently to take advantage of varied mechanisms of action, and calcipotriene can be used in combination with topical corticosteroids; however, calcipotriene should not be used concurrently with products that can alter the pH of its base, such as topical lactic acid. Use of topical agents can be both intermittent and long-term, and it is recommended that more potent agents be used on a short-term basis to allow for response, after which patients should be instructed to use these agents intermittently for long-term management; alternatively, patients who require continuous topical treatment should be instructed to use the least potent agent that allows for disease control or be transitioned to a topical agent that is associated with the lowest long-term risk, and unsupervised use of potent topical medications is not recommended. Adherence to topical treatment of psoriasis is a major issue, being generally poor in the majority of patients, and measures to improve patient adherence, including choosing topical medications with enough potency to achieve a favorable clinical response and individualizing the vehicle to allow for patient tolerance, are strongly encouraged.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. section 3. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies [^116QrLfv]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory, multi-system disease with predominantly skin and joint manifestations affecting approximately 2% of the population. In this third of 6 sections of the guidelines of care for psoriasis, we discuss the use of topical medications for the treatment of psoriasis. The majority of patients with psoriasis have limited disease (< 5% body surface area involvement) and can be treated with topical agents, which generally provide a high efficacy-to-safety ratio. Topical agents may also be used adjunctively for patients with more extensive psoriasis undergoing therapy with either ultraviolet light, systemic or biologic medications. However, the use of topical agents as monotherapy in the setting of extensive disease or in the setting of limited, but recalcitrant, disease is not routinely recommended. Treatment should be tailored to meet individual patients' needs. We will discuss the efficacy and safety of as well as offer recommendations for the use of topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, tazarotene, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, emollients, salicylic acid, anthralin, coal tar, as well as combination therapy.

### Increasing use of more potent treatments for psoriasis [^115hqcbD]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Psoriasis therapy has evolved during the past 25 years as newer and more effective medications become available. Furthermore, various combination regimens and approaches have been advocated.

Objective

We sought to describe patterns of psoriasis treatment from 1986 to 2005.

Methods

Visits to dermatologists for treatment of psoriasis were identified using National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data, a representative survey of visits to physician offices in the United States. We focused on medications listed at these visits during the 1986-to-2005 interval to determine how treatment for psoriasis has changed.

Results

There were an estimated 23.9 million visits for psoriasis during the 20-year study period. As a category, the most common medications used for psoriasis were topical steroids. Dermatologists are prescribing more potent topical steroids compared with nondermatologists. The use of these potent drugs has increased from 1986 to 2005. There has been growing use of systemic treatments, with biologic therapies introduced in the 2001-to-2005 time period.

Limitations

National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data represent national trends in psoriasis treatment and cannot be used to evaluate smaller subpopulations of patients with psoriasis. These data are used to speculate why certain trends in treatment are seen.

Conclusion

The primary treatment for psoriasis in the late 1980s and early 1990s was mid-potency corticosteroids. Since then, the primary therapies for psoriasis have evolved to include class I ultrapotent topical corticosteroids, vitamin-D analogs, and systemic medications such as methotrexate and biologic agents. These changes in psoriasis management are consistent with patient desire for better disease control.

### Treatment of psoriasis with topical agents: recommendations from a tuscany consensus [^112YiW3P]. Dermatologic Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory skin disease, clinically characterized by erythematous and scaly plaques. Treatment approach is mainly driven by disease severity, though several factors should be considered in order to identify the optimal therapeutic choice. Mild psoriasis may be treated with a wide array of topical agents including corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs, keratolytics, and calcipotriol/betamethasone propionate compound. Because guidelines may not provide practical indications regarding the therapeutic approach, the use of topical agents in psoriasis is more individually tailored. In order to homogenize the standard of care, at least in a local setting, we collected the real-life-based recommendations for the use of topical therapies from an expert panel, the Tuscany Consensus Group on Psoriasis, representing all leading centers for psoriasis established in Tuscany. With this document, this consensus group sought to define principles guiding the selection of therapeutic agents with straightforward recommendations derived from a real-life setting.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Topical therapy for limited psoriasis — corticosteroids, occlusion effects, risks, tachyphylaxis, and vitamin D analogs — is summarized as follows: topical corticosteroids of varying strengths are a first-line treatment for limited psoriasis and are generally used either as monotherapy or in conjunction with nonsteroidal topical agents; potency can be enhanced with different vehicles and by occlusion, but caution must be exercised with occlusive methods because potency may significantly increase — for example, 0.1% flurandrenolide functions as a class 5 topical corticosteroid when used as a cream but as a class 1 when used as a tape; limitations include potential for inducing skin atrophy and systemic absorption, especially with higher potency corticosteroids over larger BSA, and in many cases low-potency topical corticosteroid for standard plaque psoriasis offers little benefit; although tachyphylaxis has been commonly described, in a 12-week study of continuous treatment with topical corticosteroids none of the patients exhibited tachyphylaxis, and a more recent explanation for perceived tachyphylaxis is poor patient adherence; vitamin D analogs — calcipotriene, calcipotriol, and calcitriol — are other first-line topical agents with proven efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis.

### Emerging paradigm shift toward proactive topical treatment of psoriasis: a narrative review [^1117ePsJ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic inflammatory disease with a global prevalence between 0.14 and 2.0%and commonly follows a relapsing–remitting course of disease flares interspersed with periods of quiescent disease. Given its variability, PsO requires multifaceted long‐term management that may include safe and effective therapies as well as nonmedicinal strategies: moisturizers, avoidance of triggers, treatment adherence optimization, and scheduled follow‐up.

"Maintenance therapy" is used interchangeably with "long‐term management", and is defined as ongoing treatment to retain disease control following successful initial therapy. In the context of PsO, initial therapy often includes first‐line topical agents such as topical corticosteroids (TCS), vitamin D 3 analogs, or a combination of both. Adherence to product labels for steroid‐containing therapies generally limits use to 4 weeks of consecutive treatment, although in practice treatment duration is often longer. While most patients experience symptomatic relief during initial therapy, a significant proportion experience a relapse or worsening (i.e. flare) of their symptoms after treatment is discontinued. Furthermore, rebounds (i.e. return of disease with greater severity after treatment discontinuation) and tachyphylaxis (i.e. decreasing response to treatment over time) remains a challenge for both physicians and patients. It comes as no surprise that there remains a population of patients who are unsatisfied or undertreated with current topical treatment paradigms.

The goals of maintenance therapy in PsO are multifaceted and include sustaining a maximal response to therapy, reducing the risk and frequency of relapses, flares, and rebounds, minimizing drug exposure, optimizing long‐term safety, and managing the risk of tachyphylaxis. Other important long‐term management goals of PsO include enhancing patient outcomes, health‐related quality of life, and treatment adherence.

Maintenance therapy is not a new concept to dermatology with several approaches commonly used in clinical practice. However, expert opinions and guidelines provide limited direction to inform clinical decisions on how and when to transition from acute to long‐term therapy, and on the safety and efficacy of different approaches to maintenance treatment of PsO with topical agents.

The goal of this review is to explore evidence from controlled clinical trials that inform on strategies to optimize the many facets of maintenance PsO therapy. Notably, the recently published PSO‐LONG trial suggests that a proactive approach to maintenance therapy sustains response with optimal drug exposure and without increasing the risk of adverse effects compared to intermittent reactive management.

### Asian consensus on assessment and management of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis with topical therapy [^114PLDHu]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies

All patients with psoriasis need a long‐term management plan. Approximately 80% of patients have mild to moderate disease and topical therapy plays a significant role in their treatment plan. The majority of them can be treated with topical agents which have both high efficacy and safety. 35 In topical therapy, treatment starts within a few weeks of the initial phase (clearing phase) followed by a longer maintenance period.

A recent survey among international psoriasis experts reported that topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs, potent corticosteroids in combination with vitamin D analogs and calcineurin inhibitors were commercially available in almost all 20 countries represented in the survey. Conversely, the availability of therapies such as tars, retinoids, dithranol (anthralin) and balneotherapy varied and topical retinoids were available in only 11 of the 20 countries. 36

After a thorough assessment of disease severity and disease burden including the impact on QoL, a topical treatment plan needs to be agreed between the treating physician and the patient. It is recommended to personalize the topical treatment to meet the needs of the patient depending on disease severity, QoL, psychosocial impact, the patient's expectations and, more importantly, the patient's willingness and ability to actively follow the instructions on frequency and correct procedure of local applications. The patient's understanding and willingness to be actively involved in the management plan can be critical in the success of treatment.

The rapid control of plaques is the goal of the initial phase and it demands a potent fast‐acting topical application. The duration of the initial phase varies 4–8 weeks depending on the rapidity of response and effectiveness of medication. 37 The goal of the maintenance phase is to prevent relapses. Twice a week application (or during the weekend) may help to achieve this goal. 38 Augustin et al. 38 recommend the application of two‐compound products of corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs once or twice a week during the maintenance phase because of favorable risk–benefit ratio and cost‐effectiveness.

### Asian consensus on assessment and management of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis with topical therapy [^116rRHyb]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Potent or super‐potent corticosteroids or vitamin D analog monotherapy or fixed‐dose combination of the two is considered the topical treatment of choice for mild to moderate psoriasis. 39 In some Asian countries, however, many patients are still treated with traditional medications including tar derivatives because of social and financial reasons.

Corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs are directed at different targets in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Findings from preclinical and clinical studies support the complementary and additive effects of ingredients of a fixed‐dose combination compared with monotherapy alone. 40 This 2017 review by Segaert et al. 40 summarizes these complementary and synergistic effects and discusses how they are translated into clinical outcomes.

Another 2016 systematic review that included 10 randomized clinical trials comparing topical application of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate with topical calcipotriol or betamethasone alone in patients with psoriasis vulgaris showed that combination of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate was more effective than monotherapy with individual drugs. 41 Similar observations were made by Augustin et al. in 2014. 38 There is consistent evidence to suggest a fixed‐dose combination of potent corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs is more effective and well tolerated compared with monotherapy. 42

Adverse effects of topical medications

Long‐term use of potent topical corticosteroids has safety concerns. Adverse effects of topical corticosteroids are underreported and addressed only in few clinical trials. 43 Long‐term use of potent topical corticosteroid can lead to skin atrophy. However, the incidence of skin atrophy has not been well documented. Skin atrophy was not evident among 204 patients treated with daily application of halobetasol 0.05% for 2 weeks in two clinical trials. 44 This may be because of the short duration of the treatment. Another study with 12 weeks of treatment reported skin atrophy in two patients out of 59 when moderate to severe psoriatic patients were treated with once‐daily application of a fixed combination of halobetasol propionate 0.01% with (HP/TAZ) or without (HP) tazarotene 0.045%. 45 A randomized study that investigated the safety of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate in patients with psoriasis reported an incidence of 1.9% of skin atrophy in 52 weeks of treatment. 46 The authors suggest that skin atrophy may be a result of previous topical corticosteroid use. Another study that investigated the safety and efficacy of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate scalp formulation in the long‐term management of scalp psoriasis found no skin atrophy after 52 weeks of treatment. 47

### Topical corticosteroids: choice and application [^116Wp8v2]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are an essential tool for treating inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Topical corticosteroids are classified by strength and the risk of adverse effects such as atrophy, striae, rosacea, telangiectasias, purpura, and other cutaneous and systemic reactions. The risk of adverse effects increases with prolonged use, a large area of application, higher potency, occlusion, and application to areas of thinner skin such as the face and genitals. When prescribing topical corticosteroids for use in children, lower potencies and shorter durations should be used. Topical corticosteroids can work safely and effectively in patients who are pregnant or lactating. They are available in formulations such as ointments, creams, lotions, gels, foams, oils, solutions, and shampoos. The quantity of corticosteroid prescribed depends on the duration of treatment, the frequency of application, the skin location, and the total surface area treated. Correct patient application is critical to successful use. Patients may be taught application using the fingertip unit method. One fingertip unit is the amount of medication dispensed from the tip of the index finger to the crease of the distal interphalangeal joint and covers approximately 2% body surface area on an adult. Topical corticosteroids are applied once or twice per day for up to three weeks for super-high-potency corticosteroids or up to 12 weeks for high- or medium-potency corticosteroids. There is no specified time limit for low-potency topical corticosteroid use.

Potential biases in the review process

The categorisation of topical corticosteroid potency is contentious. There is no one source of potency categorisation, and there are discrepancies between the different sources. Therefore, to ensure transparency and minimise bias, we developed a hierarchy of sources to assign potency to each topical corticosteroid (Table 9). We most frequently determined potencies using the British National Formulary 2018 and WHO 1997. If we could not establish potency using these sources, we reviewed regional guidelines and the wider scientific literature, and consulted regional experts until we could reach a decision. Although these sources are the most appropriate choice for this review, the evidence behind each potency classification is not always clear and manufacturers do not always state the potency of products in the Summary of Product characteristics.

Although the search included the terms for topical corticosteroids, it also included a comprehensive list of generic topical corticosteroid names. It is possible that this list was incomplete and therefore some trials missed from the search if they had not also included the term topical corticosteroids.

We have presented odds ratios (OR) rather than risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous analyses because for some comparisons a high proportion of the trials (up to 50% in some cases) had a within‐participant design, and presenting a RR is inappropriate when the generic inverse variance method (GIV) with Becker‐Balagtas correction is used to incorporate these within‐participant trials. To ensure consistency across comparisons, we presented all meta‐analyses as OR including those with no within‐participant trials. The exception to this is the comparison of weekend (proactive) therapy versus no topical corticosteroid, where meta‐analyses of dichotomous data were reported as RR to be comparable to a previous systematic review (Schmitt 2011).

It was not always clear how the total number of participants in the analyses had been arrived at in some trials and this was compounded by the design of trials in which participants withdrew when the flare was controlled. Where the number of participants at later time points was unclear, we have assumed the number randomised, or the sample size reported for the previous visit if available, which may have resulted in overestimation in some instances.

Topical corticosteroids — efficacy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for psoriasis — show that for ultrahigh-potency (class 1) agents, efficacy rates vary from 58% to 92%, including an RCT of 279 patients where after 2 weeks of clobetasol foam (class 1), 68% achieved a Physician's Static Global Assessment (PSGA) score of 0 or 1 versus 21% with vehicle, and another double-blind RCT of 81 patients reported 58% versus 15% achieving moderate or marked improvement, or almost or completely clear psoriasis after 2 weeks. For high-potency (class 2 and 3) corticosteroids, efficacy rates vary from 68% to 74%; in a double blind-RCT, 0.25% desoximetasone cream (class 2) for 3 weeks yielded 68% versus 23% improvement, and two RCTs of fluticasone propionate 0.005% (class 3) showed 68% to 69% versus 29% to 30% after 4 weeks. For moderate-potency (class 4 and 5) corticosteroids, efficacy rates vary from 70% to 83%; in scalp psoriasis, fluocinolone acetonide 0.01% oil (class 5) achieved 83% vs 36% after 3 weeks, and fluticasone propionate 0.05% cream (class 5) was superior to hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% cream (class 7) with 79% vs 68% after 3 weeks. A systematic review revealed that potent and super-potent topical corticosteroids were more efficacious than mild or moderately potent corticosteroids.

### Systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis: a network meta-analysis [^111GAuib]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with either skin or joints manifestations, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. The relative benefit of these treatments remains unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head-to-head, which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of non-biological systemic agents, small molecules, and biologics for people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis using a network meta-analysis, and to provide a ranking of these treatments according to their efficacy and safety.

For this update of the living systematic review, we updated our searches of the following databases monthly to October 2021: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic treatments in adults over 18 years with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, compared to placebo or another active agent. The primary outcomes were: proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin, that is, at least Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90; proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) at induction phase (8 to 24 weeks after randomisation).

Data Collection and Analysis

We conducted duplicate study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and analyses. We synthesised data using pairwise and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare treatments and rank them according to effectiveness (PASI 90 score) and acceptability (inverse of SAEs). We assessed the certainty of NMA evidence for the two primary outcomes and all comparisons using CINeMA, as very low, low, moderate, or high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing. We used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to infer treatment hierarchy, from 0% (worst for effectiveness or safety) to 100% (best for effectiveness or safety).

Main Results

This update includes an additional 19 studies, taking the total number of included studies to 167, and randomised participants to 58,912, 67.2% men, mainly recruited from hospitals. Average age was 44.5 years, mean PASI score at baseline was 20.4 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most studies were placebo-controlled (57%). We assessed a total of 20 treatments. Most (140) trials were multicentric (two to 231 centres). One-third of the studies (57/167) had high risk of bias; 23 unclear risk, and most (87) low risk. Most studies (127/167) declared funding by a pharmaceutical company, and 24 studies did not report a funding source. Network meta-analysis at class level showed that all interventions (non-biological systemic agents, small molecules, and biological treatments) showed a higher proportion of patients reaching PASI 90 than placebo. Anti-IL17 treatment showed a higher proportion of patients reaching PASI 90 compared to all the interventions, except anti-IL23. Biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23 and anti-TNF alpha showed a higher proportion of patients reaching PASI 90 than the non-biological systemic agents. For reaching PASI 90, the most effective drugs when compared to placebo were (SUCRA rank order, all high-certainty evidence): infliximab (risk ratio (RR) 50.19, 95% CI 20.92 to 120.45), bimekizumab (RR 30.27, 95% CI 25.45 to 36.01), ixekizumab (RR 30.19, 95% CI 25.38 to 35.93), risankizumab (RR 28.75, 95% CI 24.03 to 34.39). Clinical effectiveness of these drugs was similar when compared against each other. Bimekizumab, ixekizumab and risankizumab showed a higher proportion of patients reaching PASI 90 than other anti-IL17 drugs (secukinumab and brodalumab) and guselkumab. Infliximab, anti-IL17 drugs (bimekizumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab and brodalumab) and anti-IL23 drugs (risankizumab and guselkumab) except tildrakizumab showed a higher proportion of patients reaching PASI 90 than ustekinumab and three anti-TNF alpha agents (adalimumab, certolizumab and etanercept). Ustekinumab was superior to certolizumab; adalimumab and ustekinumab were superior to etanercept. No significant difference was shown between apremilast and two non-biological drugs: ciclosporin and methotrexate. We found no significant difference between any of the interventions and the placebo for the risk of SAEs. The risk of SAEs was significantly lower for participants on methotrexate compared with most of the interventions. Nevertheless, the SAE analyses were based on a very low number of events with low- to moderate-certainty for all the comparisons (except methotrexate versus placebo, which was high-certainty). The findings therefore have to be viewed with caution. For other efficacy outcomes (PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1), the results were similar to the results for PASI 90. Information on quality of life was often poorly reported and was absent for several of the interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review shows that, compared to placebo, the biologics infliximab, bimekizumab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab were the most effective treatments for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis on the basis of high-certainty evidence. This NMA evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes measured from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation), and is not sufficient for evaluating longer-term outcomes in this chronic disease. Moreover, we found low numbers of studies for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean 44.5 years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20.4 at baseline) may not be typical of patients seen in daily clinical practice. We found no significant difference in the assessed interventions and placebo in terms of SAEs, and the safety evidence for most interventions was low to moderate quality. More randomised trials directly comparing active agents are needed, and these should include systematic subgroup analyses (sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, psoriatic arthritis). To provide long-term information on the safety of treatments included in this review, an evaluation of non-randomised studies and postmarketing reports from regulatory agencies is needed. Editorial note: This is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available.

Topical corticosteroids — tapering, maintenance strategies, pregnancy/lactation precautions, and tachyphylaxis are detailed as follows: Topical corticosteroids can be tapered off by reducing use to every other day, then eventually 2 times a week, and finally discontinuation if psoriasis is well controlled and stable during the whole process, and to minimize adverse effects, transitioning to lower-potency agents after improvement, using intermittent therapy, and combining treatment with noncorticosteroidal agents can also be considered. Topical corticosteroids are safe during pregnancy when low cumulative doses (< 60 g/wk) are used (expert consensus), though in rare cases, low fetal birth weight has been reported with prolonged potent topical corticosteroid use during pregnancy, and the use of a super potent corticosteroid in the nipple and the areola area should be avoided in nursing mothers. Because psoriasis generally recurs after discontinuation of topical corticosteroid treatment, steroid-sparing agents may be used to supplement and reduce over-reliance on topical corticosteroids as monotherapy, and an example regimen for mild psoriasis flares could include 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with a topical corticosteroid twice daily followed by maintenance with a steroid-sparing agent twice daily on weekdays and a corticosteroid agent twice daily on weekends; proactive treatment typically involves twice-weekly treatment of clinically quiescent areas to reduce the frequency of flares. Tachyphylaxis is defined as the loss of effectiveness of topical corticosteroids with continued use and may compromise effectiveness in certain patients when used for an extended period > 12 weeks.

### Factors affecting prescription of ultra-high potency topical corticosteroids in skin disease: an analysis of US national practice data [^1173ccsa]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Of the topical preparations available, the ultra-high potency corticosteroids have an important role in treating psoriasis. However, the use of these agents in many other conditions and patient populations may not be appropriate. This study examines the prescribing patterns of Class I topical corticosteroids in patients with skin disease by analyzing data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1990–2000). Of the nearly 718 million visits for skin disease, Class I topical corticosteroids were prescribed in nearly 3% of all skin disease-related visits, with prescription rates being highest in psoriasis (22%). The study found greater prescription rates of Class I topical steroids by dermatologists compared to non-dermatologists [Odds Ratio (OR) = 4.39 (95% CI: 2.15, 8.99)]. However, there were also a large number of questionable prescriptions for other conditions, which could be construed as misuse of these medications. Despite limitations and the potential dubious use seen here, Class I topical corticosteroid use is relatively commonplace. Education efforts and novel preparations of Class I agents will help to ensure the best possible care for patients suffering from significant skin diseases like psoriasis.

### Comparison of skin concentrations following topical versus oral corticosteroid treatment: reconsidering the treatment of common inflammatory dermatoses [^113t2yME]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Topical corticosteroids are often considered to have greater safety and poorer efficacy than oral corticosteroids in treating psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. There are limited data for assessing relative efficacy of topical and systemic corticosteroids, however. The concentration of corticosteroid in skin, adjusted for the relative potency of the active compound, may be a predictor of clinical efficacy and can be estimated for both topical and oral administration.

Purpose

To analyze the assumption that oral corticosteroid therapy should be more potent than topical therapy by comparing relative corticosteroid concentrations in the skin expected with topical versus systemic administration.

Methods

The estimated skin concentration of prednisone following oral dosing was calculated based on data showing 70–100% bioavailability and an even tissue distribution. Data on the concentration of corticosteroids found in skin after topical application were obtained from the literature. The relative potencies of corticosteroid molecules were then used to compare skin concentrations of corticosteroid following topical versus oral treatment.

Results

Data derived from the existing literature demonstrated that hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment, triamcinolone 0.1% ointment, and clobetasol 0.05% foam achieved effective skin concentrations greater than the effective concentration achieved by oral prednisone. Betamethasone 0.1% cream achieved effective concentrations in skin within the range created by oral prednisone.

Limitations

This analysis was limited by the paucity of data regarding cutaneous concentrations of corticosteroids after topical application, and by the differing experimental designs utilized in the available studies.

Conclusion

Most topical corticosteroids have the potential to achieve greater effective drug levels in the superficial layers of skin than those achieved with standard doses of oral prednisone. The apparently greater efficacy of oral corticosteroid therapy may be attributable, in part, to poor patient compliance with topical therapy. Systemic alterations in immune function following oral, but not topical, corticosteroid use may also play a role.

### Topical corticosteroids: choice and application… [^111wVvGA]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Adverse Effects Topical corticosteroids may cause cutaneous and systemic adverse effects. A larger area of application and higher potency of corticosteroid increases the risk of adverse effects. The use of lower-potency corticosteroids and reduction in application frequency can significantly decrease the risk of adverse effects. Thin skin and the skin of children are more susceptible to adverse effects.
17. The most common adverse effects of topical corticosteroids include atrophy, striae, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, acneiform eruption, and purpura. 20 Other cutaneous adverse effects include folliculitis, periocular dermatitis, delayed wound healing, gluteal granulomas, telangiectasias and erythema, hypopigmentation, hypertrichosis, masking or aggravation of dermatophyte infection, secondary infection, and contact dermatitis. 17 Mucocutaneous infections are also common with topical corticosteroid use.

20 The inflammatory suppression from topical corticosteroids can contribute to the prolongation, progression, and atypical presentation of cutaneous infections. Contact sensitization to topical corticosteroids can also occur but is rare. Differentiation from hypersensitivity to other components of the topical treatment is important if contact sensitization is suspected. 22 Topical corticosteroid use has not been associated with adverse effects in patients who are lactating. 20 There is no evidence that topical corticosteroids lose effectiveness over time. 23 However, corticosteroid withdrawal can occur upon cessation after prolonged use on the face and genitals, causing erythema, scaling, stinging, burning, papules, pustules, and edema.
24. Duration and Frequency of Treatment The duration of treatment depends on the strength of the corticosteroid and the condition being treated.

In general, super-high-potency topical corticosteroids should be used for no more than three weeks at a time. High- and medium-potency corticosteroids should be used for no more than 12 weeks at a time. For treatments of longer duration, a potent corticosteroid may be used intermittently or transitioned to a milder corticosteroid for ongoing control. Lesions on the face, groin, and skinfolds may be treated in one- to two-week intervals. Therapy may be discontinued when the lesions resolve.

### Expert consensus: time for a change in the way we advise our patients to use topical corticosteroids [^113LBWjF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids form the mainstay of treatment for many skin conditions. If used appropriately, they are safe and effective, and side-effects are generally uncommon. Current advice to patients to apply topical corticosteroid preparations 'sparingly' or 'thinly' contributes to 'steroid phobia', increasing the risk of poor clinical response and treatment failure. Such cautionary advice also overlooks the fact that the vast majority of patients are prescribed topical corticosteroids of mild potency for which the evidence suggests that the risk of harm is minimal. In the patient's mind, the current advice groups all steroids together regardless of their potential for adverse effects. The advice also tends to reinforce an erroneous concern that the risks from topical corticosteroids may be similar to those from systemic corticosteroids. We propose a change to make the pharmacy labelling of topical corticosteroids more accurately reflect the low risk of harm from corticosteroids of low to moderate potency and the importance of applying sufficient medication to achieve a satisfactory clinical response. This change could provide the focus for updated, evidence-based education for healthcare professionals in prescribing of topical corticosteroids and help in the provision of more appropriate advice to patients. We recommend that patients are informed that treatment should not exceed prescribed quantities, and continuing treatment should be under careful medical supervision. We also recommend that topical corticosteroid products include clear 'fingertip unit' instructions, preferably with images of a 'fingertip unit' and a chart to show the number of units required for specific areas of the body.

### A phase I, randomized, double-blind study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the topical RORC2 inverse agonist PF-06763809 in participants with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis [^1124zrk4]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The active comparator calcipotriol also did not cause a significant decrease in psoriatic skin infiltrate thickness, which was unexpected. Contact dermatitis was observed in four participants on the calcipotriol‐treated areas. A sensitivity analysis excluding these four participants increased the numerical difference between calcipotriol and the vehicle, but such a difference did not reach statistical significance (data not shown). However, a notable initial decrease in mean EPB was seen on Day 7 with calcipotriol, which diminished at subsequent timepoints, indicating the potential irritant effect of the calcipotriol's liquid formulation. It is plausible that the calcipotriol solution did not only lead to clinically apparent irritant dermatitis but also led to initial subclinical dermatitis that presented as the return of the EPB to baseline values. Irritation may also have been enhanced by the occlusive application used in this study and potentially explains the lack of effect on EPB. Depending on the vehicle, approximately 6% of conventional calcipotriol ointment and 0.05–0.3% of betamethasone ointment is expected to be absorbed systemically when applied to psoriasis plaques. 24, 25

2.3 Intertriginous (inverse)

Inverse psoriasis typically presents as smooth, well‐demarcated, inflamed areas, with little‐to‐no scaling and possible superficial erosion and maceration. These lesions result in intense itching, irritation from sweating, and soreness. Traditionally, inverse psoriasis was thought to be uncommon, but recent findings place the prevalence at 21–30% of patients with psoriasis (Merola, Li, et al. 2016). For patients with inverse psoriasis, the groin is the most commonly affected area and the external genitalia are involved in almost 80% of patients (Wang, Li, Gao, & Liu, 2005).

Treatment of inverse psoriasis must be approached with special care due to increased percutaneous absorption of steroids, phenols, and alcohols in the affected areas (Wozel, 2008). Thus, ideal treatment options should be odorless, cosmetically acceptable, chemically and physically stable, not irritating, and have no systemic absorption (Wozel, 2008). A review of treatment options for inverse psoriasis indicated that data were limited by a lack of clinical trials and the poor quality of published studies (Kalb et al. 2009). With the evidence available, low‐ to mid‐potency topical steroids were identified as first‐line options for short‐term treatment and calcipotriol or pimecrolimus/tacrolimus for long‐term therapy. However, calcipotriol can be irritating when used in skin folds (Kalb et al. 2009). QoL data focused on patients with inverse disease are limited, but it likely represents a substantial burden in interpersonal interactions (Cohen et al. 2016).

Severe inverse psoriasis resistant to topical treatment could necessitate the use of traditional oral systemic therapies, newer biologic therapies, or the phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor, apremilast. Additionally, targeted excimer laser therapy can be used for patients with psoriasis in defined focal areas.

### Highlights of the updated Dutch evidence-and consensus-based guideline on psoriasis 2017 [^116zdY3h]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Topical therapy

Recommendations Topical corticosteroids are useful in the treatment of paediatric psoriasis, with class II–III potency recommended. Dependent on the disease severity, a combination with vitamin D3 analogues is recommended. Since the combination calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate contains a class III corticosteroid, it is recommended that this treatment be prescribed only for short‐term therapy (a maximum of 4 weeks) if possible.

For maintenance therapy vitamin D3 analogues (especially calcipotriol) are first choice, given the effect and favourable side‐effects. If necessary a class II corticosteroid can be added.

If, in recalcitrant psoriasis, a combination with class III steroid is necessary, intermittent use is strongly recommended.

Tacrolimus (0.03% or 0.1%) ointment is suggested to treat resistant psoriasis of the face and intertriginous folds. If treatment with (a combination of) topical corticosteroids or vitamin D3 analogues fails in paediatric psoriasis (and adherence is ensured), dithranol in a day care setting should be seriously considered before phototherapy or systemic therapy is started.

Phototherapy

Recommendations It is recommended that narrowband‐ultraviolet B phototherapy is only used to a limited extent in paediatric psoriasis. It should be used cautiously, particularly in young (age < 12 years) and in fair‐skinned children. It is the opinion of the guideline working group, that children should not be treated with home ultraviolet B. Given the proven carcinogenic effect, psoralen–ultraviolet A therapy is contraindicated in paediatric psoriasis.

Systemic therapy

Recommendations The effect of antibiotics in children with guttate psoriasis remains controversial. In the case of a suspect medical history of tonsillitis and positive throat culture, treatment with antibiotics can be considered.

Acitretin is suggested for paediatric psoriasis (including pustular or erythrodermic forms). Treatment in adolescent women is advised against because of the teratogenic potential of acitretin. Ciclosporin is recommended in exceptional situations and for short‐term treatment only, given the potential nephrotoxicity. Methotrexate is recommended in a dose range between 0.2 and 0.4 mg kg −1 weekly. Folic acid 5–10 mg 24 h after ingestion of methotrexate is recommended. If fumarates are used for paediatric psoriasis, one should be aware of prolonged leucocytopenia/lymphocytopenia and follow the recommendations described in the section on fumarates in this guideline.

Limited psoriasis — an algorithm for treatment lists topical corticosteroids, topical calcipotriene/calcitriol, a topical calcipotriene-steroid combination, topical tazarotene (preferably in combination with a topical steroid), topical calcineurin inhibitors (flexures and face), and targeted phototherapy (limited, resistant plaques), and also lists "Short Term Use of Systemic Agent". The footnote specifies that the use of more potent topical corticosteroids must be limited to the short term, ie, < 4 weeks, with gradual weaning to 1–2 times a week usage once adequate control is obtained, and that the introduction of a secondary agent, eg, vitamin D3 preparations, should be used for long term control.

### Tolerability of crisaborole ointment for application on sensitive skin areas: a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in healthy volunteers [^111rGET4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

The primary goals of treatment for AD are to improve skin barrier function, suppress inflammation, and ultimately relieve the signs and symptoms associated with the disease. Given the prominence of pruritus in AD, which decreases quality of life and often results in exacerbation of symptoms, relief from this distressing symptom is also an important treatment goal. Topical formulations of AD medications should also emolliate and improve skin barrier function. In addition, topical medications offer the ability to locally target skin inflammation with a lower risk of systemic adverse events.

Effective topical therapies are available for the treatment of AD and psoriasis, but the treatment of these conditions in sensitive skin areas, such as the face, neck, genitals, and flexural folds of the extremities, can be challenging. Application of TCS to these thin skin sites is often avoided due to the increased risk of systemic absorption and subsequent development of systemic side effects [e.g. hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression]. TCSs should also be used with caution in pediatric patients who have a greater BSA-to-weight ratio, which increases the degree of TCS absorption. Although TCIs do not carry the same risks as TCSs with sensitive skin areas, their use is often associated with application-site reactions (stinging/burning/itching), with 8.5–10.4% of Elidel™-treated (Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Whippany, NJ, USA) patients and 43–58% of Protopic™-treated (Astellas Pharma US, Inc. Deerfield, IL, USA) patients experiencing application-site burning in vehicle-controlled phase III studies. For psoriasis, topical vitamin D analogs and retinoids are associated with cutaneous irritation. Furthermore, currently available topical medications for the treatment of psoriasis subtypes, such as inverse and genital psoriasis, should be used with care to minimize the risk of cutaneous irritation and toxicity. Patient concern for these potential adverse effects of topical therapies for both AD and psoriasis may reduce treatment adherence or compliance. There is a need for new alternative topical treatment options that can be applied safely with minimal tolerability issues, particularly in sensitive skin areas.

### Latest combination therapies in psoriasis: narrative review of the literature [^116eLFeD]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biological drugs and in particular modern interleukin (IL) inhibitors revolutionized the treatment of plaque psoriasis in terms of high efficacy and safety. However, monotherapy is not always sufficient for the global control of the disease, for example in case of episodes of relapse of the disease beyond the therapy, or in case of concomitant psoriatic arthritis (PsA), or in case of involvement of sensitive areas such as scalp, inverse areas, palmoplantar or genital, or in case of concomitant atopy.

Regarding traditional therapies, the combination of different types of topical therapies or traditional systemic therapies is widespread. For example, as a combination of two topical therapies, the use of steroids along with steroid‐sparing agents such as calcipotriene and tazarotene is diffuse. These drugs used separately have less efficacy than steroids but used together can maximize efficacy with fewer side effects.

Phototherapy, including ultraviolet B (UVB) and psoralen plus ultraviolet A, is also often used for patients with psoriasis not controlled by topical therapies alone. It is used in combination with the same topical therapies such as vitamin D, vitamin A derivatives, or coal tar, or in combination with systemic therapies such as acitretin, methotrexate, or apremilast. This combination is used, for example, in cases of psoriasis of difficult areas, such as palmoplantar psoriasis in which acitretin and phototherapy have been shown to be more effective than single treatments. While the combination of two conventional systemic treatments, such as acitretin and methotrexate, is usually not recommended due to the increased number of side effects, the combination of phototherapy or conventional systemic therapies with biologic therapies is often performed. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF‐alpha) inhibitors adalimuamb and etanercept and IL 12/23 inhibitor, have been shown to achieve higher skin clearance in less time when used in combination with nb‐UVb phototherapy. In addition, the combination of etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab with methotrexate is widely used especially in cases of concomitant psoriasis and PsA for a better control of arthritic symptoms.

However, much less evidence exists on the combination of two biologic drugs or the combination of biologic drugs and small molecules.

The aim of this review is to analyze in which cases these combinations have been used and in which cases they can be effective.

### Asian consensus on assessment and management of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis with topical therapy [^1146MbgS]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Psoriasis is associated with a multitude of systemic and psychological comorbidities requiring detailed assessment, including measures of the QoL. Care given to patients with psoriasis can be compromised due to a variety of factors including limited health‐care facilities and less time spent on patient evaluation. Patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis can effectively be managed with topical applications. Corticosteroids or vitamin D analog monotherapy or fixed‐dose combination of the two are the preferred topical applications. Studies have shown that fixed‐dose combinations are more effective and well‐tolerated compared with monotherapy in both initial and maintenance periods. Involvement of the patient in the management plan is imperative in achieving treatment goals. Non‐pharmacological measures such as education and motivation of the patient with frequent two‐way communications should be done regularly to control this chronic disease adequately.

### What's new in psoriasis? Analysis of the clinical significance of new guidelines and systematic reviews on psoriasis published in 2008 and 2009 [^111uZVfF]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

This review summarizes the clinical importance of 18 systematic reviews and guidelines on psoriasis published or indexed between November 2008 and October 2009. The topics covered include guidance on the use of topical, systemic and biological therapies for the treatment of psoriasis; comorbidities associated with psoriasis; and complementary therapies for psoriasis. A similar and more detailed review to this appeared in the 2009 Annual Evidence Update on Psoriasis from NHS Evidence - Skin Disorders in November 2009.

### Underdiagnosed and undertreated psoriasis: nuances of treating psoriasis affecting the scalp, face, intertriginous areas, genitals, hands, feet, and nails [^115YnLF4]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

2 METHODS

PubMed literature searches were conducted with the following terms: psoriasis and face/facial, psoriasis and palmoplantar, psoriasis and intertriginous or inverse, psoriasis and genital, psoriasis and scalp, and psoriasis and nail. Abstracts from English‐language articles in the last 10 years were screened for relevance.

2.1 Scalp

Scalp involvement occurs in 45–56% of individuals with psoriasis (Merola, Li, et al. 2016). It is typically among the first affected areas of the body, with the frequency of lesion formation increasing with disease duration. The diagnosis of scalp psoriasis can be delayed due to overlapping features with other papulosquamous disorders of the scalp, particularly seborrheic dermatitis (Treadwell, 2011). Psoriasis lesions on the scalp are usually asymmetrical and sharply demarcated, and exhibit silvery‐white scaling.

The symptoms of scalp psoriasis can result in decreased QoL by causing pain, itching, bleeding, feelings of embarrassment, and restricting clothing choices (Sampogna, Linder, et al. 2014). QoL is more adversely affected in women than men, and individuals younger than 40 years are more adversely affected compared with patients 60 years or older (Sampogna, Linder, et al. 2014).

Common treatment options for patients with scalp psoriasis include topical agents such as vitamin D analogs, corticosteroids, and coal tar. However, these agents are challenging to use on the scalp because hair makes application burdensome, and many patients find them cosmetically unacceptable (Menter et al. 2011). These issues can lead to nonadherence and dissatisfaction with treatment options.

In a recent systematic review of topical therapies for chronic plaque psoriasis of the scalp, vitamin D and corticosteroid combination therapy, and corticosteroid monotherapy were found to be more effective and safer than vitamin D monotherapy (Schlager et al. 2016). However, monotherapy with generic topical steroids may be acceptable for short‐term therapy due to the slim efficacy benefit of vitamin D and corticosteroid combination therapy over steroid therapy alone. Targeted phototherapy with an excimer laser can provide an effective alternative to topical therapy when used with a blower device that displaces hair (Menter et al. 2010).

2.4 Genital

Genital psoriasis is found in about 30–40% of patients with psoriasis and is more common in men (Meeuwis et al. 2010; Meeuwis, de Hullu, Massuger, van de Kerkhof, & van Rossum, 2011). Additionally, 63% of patients with psoriasis report ever having experienced genital psoriasis (Ryan et al. 2015). Not all cases of genital psoriasis fall under the inverse category, with some cases demonstrating plaque disease.

Over two‐thirds of patients with genital psoriasis have never applied treatment to their genital lesions (Meeuwis, van de Kerkhof, Massuger, de Hullu, & van Rossum, 2012). Such undertreatment is likely due, at least in part, to patients not receiving options for managing the condition because 45% of patients who discussed genital lesions with their physician reported not receiving treatment (Meeuwis, de Hullu, van de Nieuwenhof et al. 2011). Genital psoriasis has a significant negative effect on QoL and sexual health (Meeuwis, de Hullu, van de Nieuwenhof et al. 2011; Ryan et al. 2015).

In a systematic literature review, only 7 studies on the treatment of genital psoriasis were identified, and these primarily consisted of case reports (Meeuwis, de Hullu, Massuger, et al. 2011). Based on these limited results, low‐potency topical corticosteroids were identified as first‐line therapy followed by vitamin D preparations or tar‐based treatments. Pimecrolimus cream may be beneficial when used to treat the glans penis. Additionally, topical tacrolimus, another immunomodulator, has been identified as a treatment option for males with genital psoriasis (Bissonnette, Nigen, & Bolduc, 2008). Currently, a trial to determine the efficacy of ixekizumab toward genital psoriasis is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02718898).

In clinical practice, intermittent flares of genital psoriasis are treated with low‐potency topical steroids, vitamin D analogs, calcineurin inhibitors, retinoids, or retinoid analogs (e.g. tazarotene). As with inverse psoriasis, severe cases of genital psoriasis can be treated with traditional systemic therapies, newer biologic therapies, or apremilast; however, specific data are lacking for the efficacy of biologic and small‐molecule inhibitors in genital psoriasis.

Tazarotene — precautions and mitigation of irritation are described: "The most common side effect of tazarotene is local irritation in lesional and perilesional skin". "Irritation may be reduced by use of the cream formulation, use of the lower concentration product, combination use with moisturizers, application on alternate days, short-contact (30 to 60 minutes) treatment, and applying in combination with topical corticosteroids (see below)". Tazarotene is "potentially photosensitizing (due to thinning of the epidermis)".
