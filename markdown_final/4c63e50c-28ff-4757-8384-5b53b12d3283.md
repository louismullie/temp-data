## Question

LDL target for patient with previous CVA

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the LDL cholesterol target should be for a patient with a previous cerebrovascular accident (stroke). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's stroke mechanism and risk category because the LDL target depends on atherosclerotic disease. Then, I should verify the core trial evidence supporting an LDL target. Next, I will align the recommendation with major society guidelines and confirm nuances such as when to consider a lower target and when not to treat aggressively. After that, I should translate this into a practical, stepwise pharmacologic plan including monitoring and escalation. Finally, I will address safety, special populations, and synthesize a clear recommendation with the target value and strength of evidence [^113k2KyR] [^111ELFGi].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: stroke mechanism and risk category. I need to ensure we distinguish atherosclerotic from non-atherosclerotic etiologies because LDL-lowering targets are driven by the presence of cerebrovascular or coronary atherosclerosis, whereas cardioembolic strokes due to atrial fibrillation or other sources are managed differently for lipids. The Treat Stroke to Target (TST) trial specifically enrolled patients with recent ischemic stroke or TIA who had evidence of cerebrovascular or coronary atherosclerosis, which is the population to whom the LDL target applies, and this distinction is reinforced by guideline commentaries acknowledging that not every ischemic stroke patient will derive the same benefit from an LDL < 70 mg/dL target [^111ELFGi] [^116bC6bj].

> Next, I should review the direct trial evidence before jumping to conclusions. The TST randomized 2,860 patients with recent ischemic stroke or TIA and documented atherosclerosis to an LDL target of < 70 mg/dL versus 90–110 mg/dL and found a 22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events with the lower target (8.5% vs 10.9%; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61–0.98), with no significant increase in intracranial hemorrhage or new diabetes, which supports adopting the < 70 mg/dL target in atherosclerotic stroke [^111ELFGi]. Wait, let me verify a potential misstatement I initially considered: I almost said the absolute risk reduction was 2.4% and the number needed to treat was about 42, but that calculation would be off by a factor of 10; with 2.4% absolute risk reduction, the NNT is roughly 42, so I should correct that to an NNT of about 42 for the composite endpoint over the median 3.5 years of follow-up [^111ELFGi].

> I will now examine supportive and related evidence to ensure consistency. The SPARCL trial demonstrated that high-intensity atorvastatin reduced recurrent stroke and major cardiovascular events after stroke or TIA, establishing the benefit of intensive statin therapy even though it did not test a specific LDL target per se, which dovetails with the target-based strategy tested in TST [^116TwjsN]. Meta-analyses also show that more intensive LDL-C lowering reduces recurrent stroke and major vascular events in patients with atherosclerotic stroke, and that the relative risk reduction per 1 mmol/L LDL-C lowering is about 19% across major vascular outcomes, supporting the "lower is better" paradigm in this population [^116H9kSm] [^116CntJK].

> Now, I should align with major guidelines. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) 2021 secondary stroke prevention guideline recommends intensive lipid management with a statin, adding ezetimibe if needed, to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who have evidence of atherosclerotic disease, and it supports considering PCSK9 inhibitors if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated therapy [^113k2KyR] [^116Ct1h9]. The European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) similarly recommends intensive LDL-C lowering in patients with ASCVD including ischemic stroke, typically to < 55 mg/dL for very high-risk patients with recurrent events, which represents an even lower target in select subgroups, and emphasizes at least a 50% LDL-C reduction as an alternative or adjunctive goal [^113dqs3n] [^111DDNMT]. I should confirm the AHA/ACC position: they endorse high-intensity statins with a ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and add nonstatins when LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL, which is concordant with using the < 70 mg/dL target in clinical practice for atherosclerotic stroke [^113V14kD] [^114LtvgY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal application. I need to check where the evidence is strongest and where it is lacking. The benefit of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL is clearest in patients with atherosclerotic stroke phenotypes such as large artery atherosclerosis, symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis, carotid disease, and aortic arch atheroma, whereas the data are less definitive for small vessel (lacunar) stroke without demonstrable atherosclerosis, although most guidelines still extrapolate secondary prevention targets to all ischemic stroke given overlapping vascular risk, with some societies acknowledging uncertainty and favoring individualized risk assessment in non-atherosclerotic mechanisms [^113k2KyR] [^1178PDYw] [^116bC6bj].

> Translating this into a practical plan, I should start with high-intensity statin therapy when tolerated, for example atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, aiming for at least a 50% LDL-C reduction and an on-treatment LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. If LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin, I should add ezetimibe, which is a Class I recommendation in this setting and typically achieves the < 70 mg/dL target in most patients when combined with a statin. If LDL-C is still ≥ 70 mg/dL on statin plus ezetimibe, I should consider adding a PCSK9 inhibitor after discussing benefit, safety, and cost, as this further reduces LDL-C and cardiovascular events in very high-risk ASCVD, including stroke patients with atherosclerosis [^113V14kD] [^111EowPm] [^114LtvgY]. I should double-check monitoring: reassess lipids and liver enzymes 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose change, then every 3–12 months to ensure adherence and safety [^114YxEPD].

> But wait, what about special situations and safety? In patients with prior hemorrhagic stroke, I should individualize because the net benefit of very aggressive LDL-C lowering is less certain, even though contemporary data do not show a clear increase in hemorrhagic stroke with LDL-C < 70 mg/dL and meta-analyses suggest no increase in hemorrhagic stroke with more intensive statin-based therapy. In older adults, especially > 75 years, I should balance benefits and risks and often favor moderate-intensity therapy if high-intensity is not tolerated, while still targeting < 70 mg/dL when feasible. For statin intolerance, I should confirm true intolerance, try alternate statins or dosing strategies, and then proceed with nonstatin options like ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors as indicated [^117Gs6MP] [^114eC6AP] [^1114nMiT] [^1168ZqDy].

> I should also consider the magnitude of LDL-C reduction as a complementary goal. A post hoc analysis from TST suggests that achieving > 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline in the < 70 mg/dL target arm conferred greater risk reduction than smaller reductions, reinforcing that both absolute level and relative reduction matter. This aligns with the broader principle that risk reduction is proportional to LDL-C lowering, supporting the strategy to push LDL-C as low as safely possible in atherosclerotic stroke [^117KAdwD] [^116CntJK].

> Let me reconsider the final synthesis to ensure internal consistency. For patients with ischemic stroke or TIA attributable to atherosclerotic disease, the recommended LDL-C target is < 70 mg/dL, implemented with high-intensity statin therapy, adding ezetimibe if needed, and escalating to a PCSK9 inhibitor if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated therapy. For patients with non-atherosclerotic mechanisms, I should still treat cardiovascular risk but may individualize the intensity and target, recognizing that the strongest evidence for < 70 mg/dL is in atherosclerotic phenotypes. This approach is supported by TST, corroborated by SPARCL and meta-analyses, and endorsed by AHA/ASA and ESC/EAS guidelines, with the caveat that very high-risk patients with recurrent events may merit consideration of even lower targets such as < 55 mg/dL in European guidance [^111ELFGi] [^116TwjsN] [^116H9kSm] [^113k2KyR] [^111DDNMT].

For patients with prior ischemic stroke or TIA, the recommended LDL-C target is **< 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L)** [^113k2KyR] to reduce recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events [^115KLz8X]. If the patient is very high risk (e.g. recurrent events or polyvascular disease), consider a **< 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L)** target [^113dqs3n] [^111DDNMT]. Use high-intensity statins first-line [^113V14kD]; add ezetimibe [^111EowPm] if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL, and consider PCSK9 inhibitors [^114LtvgY] if LDL-C is still ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated therapy. Monitor lipids 4–12 weeks after initiation or adjustment [^114YxEPD], then every 3–12 months [^113k2KyR].

## Recommended LDL-C targets

- **General target**: < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) for patients with prior ischemic stroke or TIA [^111ELFGi] [^116Ct1h9].
- **Very high-risk patients**: < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) for those with recurrent events or polyvascular disease [^113jpqtz] [^111DDNMT].
- **Alternative target**: ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline if specific targets are not achieved [^113V14kD] [^1143Du2v].

---

## Evidence supporting LDL-C targets

- **Treat Stroke to Target (TST) trial**: LDL-C < 70 mg/dL reduced major cardiovascular events vs 90–110 mg/dL (HR 0.78) [^111ELFGi].
- **SPARCL trial**: High-intensity statins reduced recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events [^116TwjsN] [^111zwx5L].
- **Meta-analyses**: Intensive LDL-C lowering reduces recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events [^116H9kSm] [^116CntJK].

---

## Pharmacological management strategies

| **Step** | **Therapy** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | High-intensity statin (atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) | First-line therapy [^113V14kD] [^116Ct1h9] |
| 2 | Add ezetimibe | If LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL on statin [^111EowPm] [^113V14kD] |
| 3 | Add PCSK9 inhibitor (alirocumab or evolocumab) | If LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL on statin + ezetimibe [^113k2KyR] [^111EowPm] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **lipid assessment 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose change** [^114YxEPD], then every 3–12 months [^113k2KyR]. Also assess adherence and safety at each visit [^notfound].

---

## Clinical considerations and special populations

- **Elderly patients**: Individualize therapy; consider tolerance and comorbidities [^1114nMiT].
- **Hemorrhagic stroke**: Use caution; balance bleeding risk vs atherosclerotic benefit [^117Gs6MP].
- **Statin intolerance**: Use ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors as alternatives [^1132uHXp].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Target LDL-C**: < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) for prior ischemic stroke or TIA [^111ELFGi] [^116Ct1h9].
- **Very high-risk**: Consider < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) [^113jpqtz] [^111DDNMT].
- **Therapy**: High-intensity statin first-line; add ezetimibe, then PCSK9 inhibitor if needed [^113V14kD] [^111EowPm] [^114LtvgY].
- **Monitoring**: Lipids at 4–12 weeks, then every 3–12 months [^114YxEPD] [^113k2KyR].

---

The recommended LDL-C target after ischemic stroke or TIA is **< 70 mg/dL**, with a lower target of **< 55 mg/dL** for very high-risk patients. Use high-intensity statins first-line, escalate to ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors as needed, and monitor lipids regularly to ensure target attainment and safety.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to patients with ASCVD (ischemic stroke), EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate intensive LDL-C-lowering therapy in patients with a history of ischemic stroke or TIA, particularly recurrent ischemic stroke, as they are at very high risk of ASCVD.

### Lipoprotein (a) and the risk for recurrent Ischemic stroke events [^116TwjsN]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Stroke is the leading cause of disability worldwide and the fifth most common cause of death in the United States. Among stroke events, 23% are recurrent strokes. Secondary prevention of ischemic stroke, the most frequent type of stroke, includes the lifestyle interventions of smoking cessation, reducing, or eliminating alcohol consumption, a healthy diet with salt restriction, weight reduction in overweight patients, and regular exercise. Treatment with antiplatelet therapy, blood pressure control, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering with high-intensity statin therapy is also recommended.

Evidence for LDL-C lowering in stroke survivors is based on 2 pivotal trials of high-intensity statin therapy. The SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels) trial was the first to demonstrate that statin therapy reduced the risk of recurrent stroke. The trial included 4,731 patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and LDL-C 100 to 190 mg/dL who were randomized to receive atorvastatin 80 mg daily or placebo. After a median 4.9 years of follow-up, treatment with atorvastatin reduced the risk of fatal or nonfatal stroke (11.2% vs 13.1%; adjusted HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.71–0.99), all coronary heart disease events (5.2% vs 8.6%; HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.46–0.73), and all cardiovascular events (22.4% vs 29.0%; HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.66–0.83). The TST (Treat Stroke to Target) trial investigated prespecified LDL-C targets in patients with a recent ischemic stroke or TIA who had LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL if taking a statin or ≥ 100 mg/dL if not taking a statin. The trial included 2,860 patients were randomly assigned to a lower target LDL-C < 70 mg/dL or to a higher target LDL-C of 90 to 110 mg/dL. The composite primary end point of major cardiovascular events (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, new symptoms leading to urgent coronary or carotid revascularization, or cardiovascular death) was reduced in the lower target LDL-C group compared with the higher target group (8.5% vs 10.9%; adjusted HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.61–0.98).

### Treat stroke to target trial design: first trial comparing two LDL targets in patients with atherothrombotic strokes [^116TRjaU]. European Stroke Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with non-cardio-embolic stroke, atorvastatin 80 mg/day reduced the relative risk of recurrent stroke by 16%, and a post hoc analysis showed that achieving an LDL-c of less than 70 mg/dL reduced the relative risk by 28% as compared to an on-treatment LDL of 100 mg/dL or more. Current guidelines from the French drug agency recommend treating with a statin after an ischaemic stroke to a target of less than 100 mg/dL, but no study directly tested LDL-c targets. The Treat Stroke to Target (TST) trial will compare the efficacy of achieving an LDL-c of less than 70 mg/dL versus an achieved LDL-c of 100 ± 10 mg/dL for secondary prevention in patients with recent ischaemic stroke of atherosclerotic origin. Main hypothesis: An achieved on-treatment LDL-c of less than 70 mg/dL will reduce by 25% the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, urgent coronary or carotid revascularisation following new symptoms requiring hospitalisation, and vascular death compared with on-treatment LDL-c of 100 ± 10 mg/dL.

Design

Patients are randomised to either LDL-c levels, and the investigator who is not blinded can use the lipid-lowering agent of his/her choice available on the market (including statins and ezetimibe), in order to achieve the assigned LDL-c level. To be eligible for enrolment, patients have a recent ischaemic stroke or TIA of atherosclerotic origin with at least one arterial stenosis of a cerebral artery, enrolled between acute phase of the qualifying stroke (once the neurological deficit is stabilised) and three months. The initial planned sample size of 3760 participants followed three years was amended to allow follow-up of all enrolled patients until 385 primary efficacy outcome events have occurred, and no later than 31 December 2019. Patients will be recruited in 76 sites in two countries (France and South Korea) between March 2010 and December 2018 (last included patient followed up to one year). Safety outcomes will include haemorrhagic strokes and new onset diabetes. All primary endpoints will be adjudicated by an endpoint committee, blinded to the assigned LDL-c level. Two sub-studies assess (1) the relative effect of assigned LDL-c levels on occurrence of new atherosclerotic plaque as detected by carotid ultrasound during follow-up, using M'ATH software for repositioning and (2) the genetic and biomarker drivers of recurrent primary endpoints according to assigned LDL-c lowering arm, in atherosclerotic strokes.

Summary

The TST trial is evaluating the benefits of achieving an LDL-c less than 70 mg/dL for secondary stroke prevention in ischaemic stroke patients of atherosclerotic origin. Main results are anticipated in 2020 or earlier (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01252875).

AACE dyslipidemia — evidence summary for LDL-C target < 70 mg/dL: Only 1 trial directly compared LDL-C targets in secondary prevention, assigning patients to a target LDL-C of < 70 mg/dL or 90 to 100 mg/dL; a systematic review informed comparisons of < 70 mg/dL versus ≥ 70 mg/dL and reported that peripheral vascular disease events were not reported. Benefits included anticipated absolute risk differences of 5 fewer deaths per 1000 individuals for all-cause mortality (95% CI 10 fewer to 1 fewer deaths) and 5 fewer per 1000 for CV-related mortality (95% CI 8 fewer to 1 fewer CV-related deaths), with a small decrease of 12 fewer myocardial infarctions per 1000 individuals (95% CI 27 fewer to 6 fewer). Ischemic stroke was evaluated in 9 RCTs with 98 167 participants, with no clinically meaningful change in risk and a relative risk reduction of 0.77 (95% CI 0.69–0.85) and an absolute reduction of 4 fewer per 1000 individuals (95% CI 6 fewer to 3 fewer); there is probably an increased number of individuals stopping medications in the lower LDL-C group.

### Response to letter by prof christian nolte and colleagues [^116bC6bj]. European Stroke Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

We thank the authors for their letter. This is a crucial point and one we are keen to address.

We interpret that the key concern is whether every person with ischaemic stroke or TIA should aim for an LDL cholesterol level of < 1.8 mmol/l. The guideline on pharmacological interventions for long term secondary prevention after ischaemic stroke or TIA is not intended to cover in detail specific types of stroke, such as cervical artery dissection or specific types of cardioembolic stroke. These are covered in already published guidelines or in guidelines that are under development (see). The balance between making recommendations in a guideline, which is a general set of rules or piece of advice, and the required detail and nuance to manage individual patients is challenging to find. There is no better example of this than the issue they raise.

We agree there is a need for greater clarity. The authors correctly highlight that the main evidence supporting a recommendation for a lower LDL cholesterol target comes from the Treat Stroke to Target trial. To be included in this trial, participants had to have evidence of extracranial or intracranial stenosis, aortic arch plaque or a known history of coronary artery disease. We also agree that the benefit of high intensity statin therapy, or a lower LDL target, will be greatest in people with large artery disease, at least in absolute terms. In the SPARCL trial, while an eligible TIA was required to be assumed to have an atherosclerotic cause, this was not the case for stroke. Thus, people without proven atherosclerosis could have been included, provided they did not have atrial fibrillation. We believe the totality of evidence for intensive lipid lowering goes beyond those with a confirmed large artery stroke but agree it does not apply to every person.

We agree that there will be people for whom an LDL target of < 1.8 mmol/l is not appropriate and where the benefit of this is not yet quantified. We could have raised this more specifically in the discussion where we discussed these principles in the last paragraph. We hope that the guideline consolidates the need to consider more aggressive management of blood pressure, lipids and blood glucose (in people with diabetes). Thus, we agree with the authors that clinicians should be familiar with whom these targets apply, but that overall the evidence suggests the approach to secondary prevention should be more intensive. We believe this is an important step away from one size fits all, or 'fire and forget' approaches to management of cardiovascular risk factors.

### 2015 ACC / AHA focused update of secondary prevention lipid performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^111rbJ4R]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) performance measure denominator and evidence — The target population for the ASCVD PM includes women and men between 18 and 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, which includes the following: ACS, history of MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary (including PCI) or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or PAD, and patients with clinical ASCVD represent 1 of 4 major groups identified by the writing committee of the Cholesterol Guidelines. For these patients, treatment with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, commonly known as a statin, is clearly beneficial, and the potential for reduction of risk for ASCVD with statins in these patients clearly exceeds the potential for adverse effects. Meta-analyses of individual participant data from 26 RCTs demonstrated reduction in all-cause mortality, and of the 26 RCTs included, 5 trials (39 612 subjects, all of whom had CAD) compared more versus less intensive statin regimens, with more intensive regimens producing a highly significant 15% further reduction in major vascular events. On extensive examination of clinical studies from the literature, the current clinical evidence does not support the notion that titrating lipid therapy to achieve proposed low LDL-C levels is beneficial or safe, whereas compelling evidence supports near-universal empirical statin therapy for patients at high cardiovascular risk regardless of their LDL-C levels. The recommendation to initiate statins for secondary prevention is based on strong evidence in which benefit far exceeds risk.

### Chinese stroke association guidelines for clinical management of cerebrovascular disorders: executive summary and 2019 update of the management of high-risk population [^113jpqtz]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

For patients at high or very high risk of atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, in addition to therapeutic lifestyle changes, statin treatment is recommended for the primary prevention of stroke (class I; level of evidence A).
Patients need to set goals for lipid-lowering treatments. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is recommended to be the primary treating target (class I; level of evidence A).
Target LDL-C is rated according to the rating scales of cerebrovascular disease. LDL-C < 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) for very-high-risk patients (class IIb; level of evidence B), and those with high bleeding risk should be treated with extra care: LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) for high-risk patients (class IIb; level of evidence B). LDL-C < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for middle-risk patients, LDL-C < 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL) for low-risk patients (class IIb; level of evidence B).
Treatment for high-risk or very-high-risk patients can be started with moderate-intensity statin, and modify treatment intensity according to their therapeutic effect and tolerance. Other lipid-lowering drugs can be added if target cholesterol levels cannot be reached (class I; level of evidence B).
Niacin can be taken into consideration for patients with low HDL cholesterol or high lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)), but the efficacy in primary prevention of stroke is still lack of evidence (class IIb; level of evidence B).
For patients who cannot tolerate statins or reach their cholesterol targets, non-statin lipid-lowering drugs like fibric acid derivatives and bile acid sequestrants, or ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors can be added, but their efficacy in preventing stroke is not evidenced (class IIb; level of evidence C).

### Guideline-directed low-density lipoprotein management in high-risk patients with ischemic stroke: findings from get with the guidelines-stroke 2003 to 2012 [^111tWLek]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Limited information is available on stroke prevention in high-risk patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Our aim was to use admission low-density lipoprotein (LDL) values to evaluate differences in the attainment of National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines goals at the time of the index event in high-risk patients with stroke and preexisting cardio- or cerebrovascular disease.

Methods

Observational study, using data from the Get-With-The-Guidelines-Stroke Registry including 913 436 patients with an acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack from April 2003 to September 2012. Participants were classified as high risk if they had history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke (cardiovascular disease), and coronary artery disease (CAD).

Results

Of the 913 436 patients admitted with an acute stroke or TIA, 194 557 (21.3%) had previous stroke/TIA, 148 833 (16.3%) had previous CAD, and 88 605 (9.7%) had concomitant CAD and cardiovascular disease. Overall, only 68% of patients with stroke were at their preadmission National Cholesterol Education Program III guideline-recommended LDL target; 51.3% had LDL < 100 mg/dL; and only 19.8% had LDL < 70 mg/dL. Among those presenting with a recurrent stroke, > 45% had LDL > 100 mg/dL. When compared with patients with CAD, patients with previous TIA/stroke were less likely to have LDL < 100 or < 70 mg/dL. In multivariable analysis, older age, men, white race, lack of major vascular risk factors, previous use of cholesterol-lowering therapy, and care provided in larger hospitals were associated with meeting LDL targets on admission testing.

Conclusions

Management of dyslipidemia in high-risk patients with preexistent CAD or stroke continues to be suboptimal. Only 1 in 5 patients with prior TIA/stroke had LDL levels < 70 mg/dL.

### A comparison of two LDL cholesterol targets after ischemic stroke [^111ELFGi]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

The use of intensive lipid-lowering therapy by means of statin medications is recommended after transient ischemic attack (TIA) and ischemic stroke of atherosclerotic origin. The target level for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular events after stroke has not been well studied.

Methods

In this parallel-group trial conducted in France and South Korea, we randomly assigned patients with ischemic stroke in the previous 3 months or a TIA within the previous 15 days to a target LDL cholesterol level of less than 70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) (lower-target group) or to a target range of 90 mg to 110 mg per deciliter (2.3 to 2.8 mmol per liter) (higher-target group). All the patients had evidence of cerebrovascular or coronary-artery atherosclerosis and received a statin, ezetimibe, or both. The composite primary end point of major cardiovascular events included ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, new symptoms leading to urgent coronary or carotid revascularization, or death from cardiovascular causes.

Results

A total of 2860 patients were enrolled and followed for a median of 3.5 years; 1430 were assigned to each LDL cholesterol target group. The mean LDL cholesterol level at baseline was 135 mg per deciliter (3.5 mmol per liter), and the mean achieved LDL cholesterol level was 65 mg per deciliter (1.7 mmol per liter) in the lower-target group and 96 mg per deciliter (2.5 mmol per liter) in the higher-target group. The trial was stopped for administrative reasons after 277 of an anticipated 385 end-point events had occurred. The composite primary end point occurred in 121 patients (8.5%) in the lower-target group and in 156 (10.9%) in the higher-target group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.98; P = 0.04). The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage and newly diagnosed diabetes did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

After an ischemic stroke or TIA with evidence of atherosclerosis, patients who had a target LDL cholesterol level of less than 70 mg per deciliter had a lower risk of subsequent cardiovascular events than those who had a target range of 90 mg to 110 mg per deciliter.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111gx62w]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Aortic arch atherosclerosis — treatment recommendations state that in patients with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and evidence of an aortic arch atheroma, intensive lipid management to an LDL cholesterol target of < 70 mg/dL is recommended to prevent recurrent stroke, and that in similar patients, antiplatelet therapy is recommended to prevent recurrent stroke.

### More than 50 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol in patients with target LDL [^117KAdwD]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether a strategy to target an LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol < 70 mg/dL is more effective when LDL is reduced > 50% from baseline rather than < 50% from baseline has not been investigated.

Methods

The Treat Stroke to Target trial was conducted in France and South Korea in 61 sites between March 2010 and December 2018. Patients with ischemic stroke in the previous 3 months or transient ischemic attack within the previous 15 days and evidence of cerebrovascular or coronary artery atherosclerosis were randomly assigned to a target LDL cholesterol of < 70 mg/dL or 100 ± 10 mg/dL, using statin and/or ezetimibe as needed. We used the results of repeated LDL measurements (median, 5 [2–6] per patient) during 3.9 years (interquartile range, 2.1–6.8) of follow-up. The primary outcome was the composite of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, new symptoms requiring urgent coronary or carotid revascularization, and vascular death. Cox regression model including lipid-lowering therapy as a time-varying variable, after adjustment for randomization strategy, age, sex, index event (stroke or transient ischemic attack), and time since the index event.

Results

Among 2860 patients enrolled, patients in the lower target group who had > 50% LDL cholesterol reduction from baseline during the trial had a higher baseline LDL cholesterol and a lower LDL cholesterol achieved as compared to patients who had < 50% LDL cholesterol reduction (155 ± 32 and 62 mg/dL versus 121 ± 34 and 74 mg/dL, respectively, P < 0.001 for both). In the < 70 mg/dL target group, patients with > 50% LDL reduction had a significant reduction in the primary outcome as compared to the higher target group (hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.43–0.88]; P = 0.007) and patients with < 50% LDL reduction from baseline had little reduction (hazard ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.73–1.26]; P = 0.75).

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis of the TST trial, targeting an LDL cholesterol of < 70 mg/dL reduced the risk of primary outcome compared with 100 ± 10 mg/dL provided LDL cholesterol reduction from baseline was superior to 50%, thereby suggesting that the magnitude of LDL cholesterol reduction was as important to consider as the target level to achieve.

### 2018 AHA / ACC / AACVPR / AAPA / ABC / ACPM / ADA / AGS / APhA / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline on the management of blood cholesterol: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^113V14kD]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Synopsis — overall ASCVD management approach: Clinical ASCVD encompasses ACS, those with history of MI, stable or unstable angina or coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, TIA or PAD including aortic aneurysm, all of atherosclerotic origin. As a primary recommendation, high-intensity statin therapy is indicated for clinical ASCVD, but if this cannot be used, moderate-intensity statin therapy can be initiated. The first goal is to achieve a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C levels, and if LDL-C levels remain ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated statin therapy, adding ezetimibe may be reasonable. In patients > 75 years of age with ASCVD, potential benefits versus adverse effects of statin therapy should be considered before initiation of statin therapy.

### Applying the evidence: do patients with stroke, coronary artery disease, or both achieve similar treatment goals? [^115wuCiK]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The importance of early and aggressive initiation of secondary prevention strategies for patients with both coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is emphasized by multiple guidelines. However, limited information is available on cardiovascular protection and stroke prevention in an outpatient setting from community-based populations. We sought to evaluate and compare differences in treatment patterns and the attainment of current guideline-recommended targets in unselected high-risk ambulatory patients with CAD, CVD, or both.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, cohort study was conducted from December 2001 to December 2004 among ambulatory patients in a primary care setting. The prospective Vascular Protection and Guidelines-Oriented Approach to Lipid-Lowering Registries recruited 4933 outpatients with established CAD, CVD, or both. All patients had a complete fasting lipid profile measured within 6 months before enrollment. The primary outcome measure was the achievement of blood pressure (BP) < 140/90 mm Hg (or < 130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes) and LDL cholesterol < 2.5 mmol/L (< 97 mg/dL) according to the Canadian guidelines in place at that time (similar to the National Cholesterol Education Program's value of 100 mg/dL). Secondary outcomes include use of antithrombotic, antihypertensive, and lipid-modifying therapies.

Results

Of the 4933 patients, 3817 (77%) had CAD only; 647 (13%) had CVD only; and 469 (10%) had both CAD and CVD. Mean ± SD age was 67 ± 10 years, and 3466 (71%) were male. Mean systolic and diastolic BPs were 130 ± 16 and 75 ± 9 mm Hg, respectively. Minor but significant differences were observed on baseline BP, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol measurements among the 3 groups. Overall, 83% of patients were taking a statin and 93% were receiving antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents). Compared with patients with CAD, those with CVD only were less likely to achieve the recommended BP (45.3% vs 57.3%, respectively; P < 0.001) and lipid (19.4% vs 30.5%, respectively; P < 0.001) targets. Among patients with CVD only, women were less likely to achieve the recommended BP and lipid targets compared with their male counterparts (for LDL cholesterol < 2.5 mmol/L, 18.7% vs 23.8%, respectively; P = 0.048). In multivariable analysis, patients with CVD alone were less likely to achieve treatment success (BP or lipid targets) after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, and use of pharmacologic therapy.

Conclusions

Despite the proven benefits of available antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapies, current management of hypertension and dyslipidemia continues to be suboptimal. A considerable proportion of patients failed to achieve guideline-recommended targets, and this apparent treatment gap was more pronounced among patients with CVD and women. Quality improvement strategies should target these patient subgroups.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113k2KyR]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Hyperlipidemia treatment for secondary stroke prevention — recommendations specify that in patients with ischemic stroke with no known coronary heart disease, no major cardiac sources of embolism, and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) > 100 mg/dL, atorvastatin 80 mg daily is indicated to reduce risk of stroke recurrence; in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and atherosclerotic disease (intracranial, carotid, aortic, or coronary), lipid-lowering therapy with a statin and also ezetimibe, if needed, to a goal LDL-C of < 70 mg/dL is recommended to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events; in very high–risk ischemic stroke patients on maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy with an LDL-C > 70 mg/dL, it is reasonable to treat with PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor therapy to prevent ASCVD events; and for monitoring in stroke or TIA with hyperlipidemia, adherence and effects of LDL-C–lowering medication should be assessed by fasting lipids and safety indicators 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment and every 3 to 12 months thereafter.

### Intensive LDL cholesterol-lowering treatment beyond current recommendations for the prevention of major vascular events: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials including 327 037 participants [^116CntJK]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Background

The benefits of LDL cholesterol-lowering treatment for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are well established. However, the extent to which these effects differ by baseline LDL cholesterol, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, and the presence of comorbidities remains uncertain.

Methods

We did a systematic literature search (MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from inception up to June 15, 2019) for randomised controlled trials of statins, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors with at least 1000 patient-years of follow-up. Random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regressions were done to assess for risk of major vascular events (a composite of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal ischaemic stroke, or coronary revascularisation) per 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol concentrations.

Findings

327037 patients from 52 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Each 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol was associated with a 19% relative risk (RR) reduction for major vascular events (RR 0.81 [95% CI 0.78–0.84]; p < 0.0001). Similar reductions (per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol) were found in trials with participants with LDL cholesterol 2.60 mmol/L or lower, 2.61–3.40 mmol/L, 3.41–4.10 mmol/L, and more than 4.1 mmol/L (p = 0.232 for interaction); and in a subgroup of patients who all had a baseline LDL cholesterol less than 2.07 mmol/L (80 mg/dL; RR 0.83 [95% CI 0.75–0.92]; p = 0.001). We found greater RR reductions in patients at lower 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk (change in RR per 10% lower 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 0.97 [95% CI 0.95–0.98]; p < 0.0001) and in patients at younger age across a mean age of 50–75 years (change in RR per 10 years younger age 0.92 [0.83–0.97]; p = 0.015). We found no difference in RR reduction for participants with or without diabetes (p = 0.878 for interaction) and chronic kidney disease (p = 0.934 for interaction).

Interpretation

For each 1 mmol/L LDL cholesterol lowering, the risk reduction of major vascular events is independent of the starting LDL cholesterol or the presence of diabetes or chronic kidney disease. Patients at lower cardiovascular risk and younger age might have a similar relative reduction in risk with LDL-cholesterol lowering therapies and future studies should investigate the potential benefits of earlier intervention.

### Lipid-lowering therapy use when indicated and subsequent ischemic stroke severity [^115uzoTe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Nearly 800 000 patients are diagnosed with stroke annually, of which 87% are ischemic. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditure. A major causative mechanism of AIS is atherosclerosis of blood vessels in the head and neck. Lipid‐lowering therapy (LLT) such as statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors decrease low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) and has demonstrated efficacy for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) including AIS. As a result, initiating LLT in high‐risk individuals is recommended for primary and secondary stroke prevention by numerous organizations including the American Heart Association (AHA) and American Stroke Association. Guidelines on cholesterol management shifted in 2013, with less emphasis on specific LDL‐C targets and more focus on statin intensity and LDL‐C reduction relative to baseline, which broadened eligibility for LLT. These guidelines were further updated in 2018 to inform shared decision‐making on LLT initiation. Notably, individuals without history of established ASCVD, but with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk > 7.5%, were encouraged to have a risk–benefit discussion and consider starting LLT based on risk enhancers.

Despite these recommendations, LLT is currently underused in clinical practice, with reports indicating that as many as 80% of eligible patients are not prescribed LLT. The impact of underuse of LLT among eligible patients before an AIS upon stroke severity is uncertain. Previous studies have demonstrated decreased stroke severity in patients on LLT; however, no study to date has evaluated the association between prestroke LLT use when indicated by current guidelines and stroke severity. Such information could be useful during shared decision‐making discussions about medication initiation between LLT‐eligible patients and their clinicians who are weighing the risks and benefits of an LLT, particularly for individuals with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk between 7.5% and 19.9% given the emphasis on risk discussion. Additionally, this information may improve the patient's adherence to LLT when indicated.

### Chinese stroke association guidelines for clinical management of cerebrovascular disorders: executive summary and 2019 update of clinical management of ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases [^1132uHXp]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Routine measurement of blood cholesterol levels is not recommended for all patients with atherosclerotic ischaemic stroke who are not on high-intensity statins (class III, level of evidence B).
For patients with ischaemic stroke during statins, it is reasonable to continue statins in the acute phase of stroke (class IIa, level of evidence B).
For patients who meet the requirements for statins, it is reasonable to start statins during the hospital stay (class IIa, level of evidence C).
It is suggested that LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) should be used as a reference target for cholesterol-lowering therapy (class IIa, level of evidence C).
Atrial fibrillation is not a reason for not using statins in patients with ischaemic stroke (class IIa, level of evidence B).
High-intensity statins should be started or continued as a first-line treatment in females and ≤ 75 years of age males with ASCVD, unless there are contraindications (class I, level of evidence A).
In patients with atherosclerotic ischaemic stroke who have already optimised statins, measuring blood cholesterol levels may help identify those who can benefit from proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) treatment (class IIb, level of evidence B).
For patients with poor lipid-lowering effect or intolerable of statins, lipid-lowering treatment can be combined with ezetimibe but regular monitoring of transaminase and physical examination should be done (class IIb, level of evidence B).
Patients with ASCVD with ischaemic stroke and other complications should be managed through lifestyle improvements, dietary advice and drug treatment (class I, level of evidence A).
For patients with ASCVD, it was originally intended to be treated with high-intensity statins. But when patients have contraindications or possible adverse reactions to statins, moderate-intensity statins should be used as a second option (class I, level of evidence A).
For patients over 75 years of age with clinical ASCVD, the benefits of reducing ASCVD risk, adverse drug reactions, drug-drug interactions and patient's wishes should be evaluated when initiating moderate-intensity or high-intensity statins. It is reasonable to continue statins in patients who can tolerate (class IIb, level of evidence C).

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113bbJAt]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Lipids — primary prevention recommendations: In adults who qualify for lipid-lowering therapy per the 2019 ACC/AHA primary prevention guideline (for example, 20–75 years with LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) level ≥ 190 mg/dL [4.9 mmol/L], 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk ≥ 20%, or 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%– < 20% plus ≥ 1 risk enhancers), treatment with a statin is recommended to reduce the risk of a first stroke; in adults without CVD who meet similar criteria but cannot reach goals or tolerate other therapies such as statins, the benefit of alirocumab or evolocumab compared with other active lipid-lowering therapy for reducing first-stroke risk is uncertain; in adults who do not tolerate statins and have LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL with elevated cardiovascular risk, treatment with bempedoic acid to reduce first-stroke risk is not well established; and in adults with moderate or low intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, supplementation is not recommended to reduce the risk of a first stroke.

### Impact of lower versus higher LDL cholesterol targets on cardiovascular events after ischemic stroke in patients with diabetes [^111sigvi]. Diabetes (2021). Medium credibility.

After an ischemic stroke with evidence of atherosclerosis, lipid-lowering treatment with a target LDL cholesterol of < 70 mg/dL compared with 100 ± 10 mg/dL reduced the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. In this analysis, we explored the effect in the subgroup of patients with diabetes compared with the subgroup without, as well as in those with newly diagnosed diabetes. Patients with ischemic stroke in the previous 3 months or transient ischemic attack within the previous 15 days and evidence of cerebrovascular or coronary artery atherosclerosis were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to a target LDL cholesterol of < 70 mg/dL or 100 ± 10 mg/dL using statin or ezetimibe. The primary outcome was the composite of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, new symptoms requiring urgent coronary or carotid revascularization, and death resulting from vascular disease. We performed a prespecified analysis to evaluate the effect in patients with diabetes. Of 2,860 patients enrolled, 643 had diabetes at baseline, with a mean age of 66.2 years and baseline LDL cholesterol of 127 mg/dL, and were followed for a median of 3 years. The primary composite end point occurred in 27 (8.2%) of 328 patients in the lower-target group and in 44 (14.0%) of 315 patients in the higher-target group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.56; 95% CI 0.34–0.89; P = 0.016). In patients without diabetes, the HR was 0.87 (95% CI 0.66–1.14; P = 0.31; interaction P = 0.15). In those with diabetes, there were three intracranial hemorrhages in both randomization groups (0.9% vs. 1.0%, respectively). Newly diagnosed diabetes occurred in 98 (9.2%) of 1,070 and in 80 (7.4%) of 1,085 patients in the lower- and higher-target groups, respectively (HR 1.27; 95% CI 0.94–1.71; P = 0.11), and baseline higher HbA 1c was the unique multivariable predictor. In conclusion, after an ischemic stroke with evidence of atherosclerosis, targeting an LDL cholesterol of < 70 mg/dL compared with 100 ± 10 mg/dL consistently reduced the risk of subsequent stroke and other major vascular events in patients with and without diabetes, but the higher risk in those with diabetes yielded a higher absolute risk reduction, with number needed to treat of 17.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115KLz8X]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Statin therapy after ischemic stroke/TIA — SPARCL and TST trials: The SPARCL trial included adults with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack in the prior 1 to 6 months and LDL-C 100 to 190 mg/dL, randomized to atorvastatin 80 mg or placebo, with median 4.9 years follow-up showing stroke in 11.2% versus 13.1% (adjusted HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71–0.99]); the TST trial enrolled adults with cerebral infarction in the prior 3 months or high-risk TIA (arm and leg motor deficit or speech disturbance lasting > 10 minutes) in the prior 15 days with documented atherosclerotic disease, randomly assigned to LDL-C targets of < 70 mg/dL versus 90 to 110 mg/dL, and over a median 3.5 years the primary composite major cardiovascular event occurred in 8.5% versus 10.9% (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.61–0.98]); additionally, a secondary IMPROVE-IT analysis found a significantly lower risk of ischemic stroke with ezetimibe in addition to simvastatin among patients with prior MI.

### Serum lipid profile on admission for ischemic stroke: failure to meet national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel (NCEP-ATPIII) guidelines [^116QWcty]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the characteristics of patients with stroke/TIA whose admission low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were above goals defined by National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATPIII) guidelines.

Methods

From January 1, 2003, to June 30, 2005, there were 1,212 discharges (1,033 stroke, 179 TIA), of whom 1,040/1,212 (86%) had lipid measurement. The preadmission individual LDL goal was determined using 2001 NCEP-ATPIII guidelines.

Results

There were 284/1,040 (27%) whose measured LDL was greater than the individual preadmission LDL goal. Failure to be at goal was common even among those with previously diagnosed dyslipidemia (159/527, 30%) and those taking lipid-lowering agents (LLA) (71/370, 19%). LLA would have been indicated in 121/213 (57%) of those above LDL goal who were not already taking LLA, with optional consideration in 77/213 (36%). Lower LDL therapeutic targets were the strongest predictor, in a multivariable model, of failure to be at goal. Compared to LDL target < 160 (reference), the OR for LDL target < 130 was 6.4 (95% CI 3.4 to 12.0, p < 0.0001) and for LDL target < 100 was 26.2 (95% CI 13.3 to 51.5, p < 0.0001). An increased likelihood of being at goal was associated with preadmission LLA (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.9 to 6.2, p < 0.0001) and increasing calendar time (OR 1.09 per 3-month period, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.15, p = 0.004).

Conclusions

Many patients hospitalized with ischemic stroke/TIA, including those with known dyslipidemia and those taking lipid lowering agents, have measured low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that is higher than recommended by national guidelines. Patients at the greatest risk of cardiovascular events are the least likely to be at guideline-recommended LDL levels.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### Statin treatment and adherence to national cholesterol guidelines after ischemic stroke [^114rgoge]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

National cholesterol guidelines have defined high vascular risk individuals as those who could potentially benefit most from statin therapy. The authors aimed to determine the rate of statin use, its predictors, and the achievement of national guideline target lipid goals among ischemic stroke survivors.

Methods

The authors abstracted data from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) study database from the United States and Canada to incorporate into algorithms for initiating statin therapy according to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines for high-risk individuals. The authors applied these algorithms to all study subjects. Univariate as well as multivariate associations for target lipid levels and statin implementation were then evaluated utilizing pertinent demographic, clinical, and laboratory data.

Results

Of 2,894 subjects in the analysis dataset, 38% were women; 71% were recruited in the United States and 29% in Canada. Of 769 high-risk subjects, 262 (34%) had a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level ≥ 130 mg/dL and 124 of these (47%) were not on statin. Among those high-risk persons on statin treatment, only 42% had an LDL ≤ 100 mg/dL. Subjects in the overall cohort were more likely to be on a statin if they were treated in the United States or had a history of hypertension or coronary artery disease.

Conclusions

Approximately one out of three guideline-eligible high vascular risk ischemic stroke patients in this study had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations above qualifying levels for pharmacologic therapy, but half of these patients were not taking a statin, and of those receiving statin treatment, less than half were within recommended lipid goals.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^111U8ELZ]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of recommendations

Recommendations for the use of statin medication, cholesterol targets and the frequency of monitoring are presented in table 3.

Table 3
Summary of recommendations

Treatment recommendations

All of the guidelines presented recommendations for the treatment of the secondary prevention population, with all recommending statins as the primary therapy. Only UK/Scottish guidelines suggested the specific drug and dose, namely, atorvastatin 80 mg, with many instead recommending the maximally tolerated high-intensity doses in general, with lower doses considered when contraindications were present, or they were poorly tolerated by the patients. Few caveats were stated regarding the prescription of statins. For example, all stroke guidelines recommended statins only when the cause of the stroke was likely to be atherosclerotic, with the South African Stroke Society additionally only recommending them in the case of total cholesterol > 3.5 mmol/L, and the Australia Stroke Society only considering them appropriate when the patient's life expectancy was considered reasonable. For the secondary prevention population as a whole, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society (ESCEAS) tailored their recommendations for patients whose baseline LDL was < 1.4 mmol/L at baseline, respectively, with therapy considered rather than offered to these patients. Finally, the 2018 American Consensus (ACD) guidelines stated that the benefit–risk ratio should be considered when offering medication to patients over the age of 75 years.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113gSHHk]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) — risk factor control and lipids show that achieving a mean SBP < 140 mmHg in follow-up was associated with lower stroke and vascular events in analyses from WASID (N = 567), SAMMPRIS medical arm (n = 227), and CICAS (N = 2426), whereas some small studies suggest patients with hemodynamic impairment or those treated to SBP < 120 mmHg early after stroke may not benefit and the lower threshold is unknown; high-intensity statins lowered cerebrovascular events, an RCT demonstrated benefit of an LDL target < 70 mg/dL in patients with stroke and atherosclerosis though an optimum LDL target for ICAS has not been determined, and moderate physical activity at least 3 to 5 times per week was most strongly associated with lower recurrent events in medically treated SAMMPRIS patients.

### Management of LDL-cholesterol after an acute coronary syndrome: key comparisons of the American and European clinical guidelines to the attention of the healthcare providers [^111DDNMT]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

3.3 European perspectives

In secondary prevention of very high‐risk patients, an LDL‐C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL‐C goal < 55 mg/dL are both recommended (class I, level A). A reduction in LDL‐C by 50% from baseline with high‐intensity statin is a first common step in both guidelines. However, European guideline recommends intensifying lipid‐lowering treatment even in patients who achieve on LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL, whereas the addition of nonstatin agent is recommended in the US guideline only for those above the threshold ≥ 70 mg/dL. In the European guidelines, patients with ASCVD who experienced a second vascular event within 2 years while taking maximally statin therapy, an LDL‐C goal of < 40 mg/dL (< 1 mmol/L) may be considered (class IIb, level B). Compared to the US guideline, the European guideline supports even lower LDL‐C goals with further intensification of therapy in patients with a recurrent ASCVD event with an LDL‐C of 55 to 70 mg/dL. The concept of goals implies that therapeutic options will be added sequentially to achieve a specific recommended LDL‐C level.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in real-world patients treated with evolocumab [^115DgqTb]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States (US). 1 The costs of CVD are rising, driven by high‐risk patients, and are expected to nearly double to $1 trillion from 2015 to 2035. 2 Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is a well‐established causal risk factor for atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). 3, 4 Accordingly, reduction of LDL‐C significantly reduces the risk of major CV events, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and it is now recognized that lower LDL‐C is better, with a progressive reduction in major CV events and no increase in safety events even at very low LDL‐C levels of < 7.7 mg/dL (< 0.2 mmol/L). 13

The 2018 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Multisociety blood cholesterol guideline introduced the stratification of "very high‐risk" (VHR) ASCVD patients, defined as those with a history of multiple major ASCVD events (ie, recent acute coronary syndrome [ACS], history of myocardial infarction [MI], history of ischemic stroke [IS], or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease [PAD]) or a single major ASCVD event and multiple high‐risk conditions. 14 For patients with VHR ASCVD, the 2018 ACC/AHA guideline recommends using an LDL‐C threshold of 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) to initiate the addition of nonstatins (ie, ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to maximally tolerated statin therapy. 14 The European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guidelines recommend a ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction from baseline and a goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L), with a lower goal of < 40 mg/dL (< 1.0 mmol/L) for patients who experience a second vascular event within 2 years while taking maximally tolerated statin therapy. 15 The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) and American College of Endocrinology (ACE) now recommend LDL‐C goals of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L) and < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) for VHR and extreme‐risk patients, respectively. 16

Figure 1
Trend of Older Adults Who Achieved a Goal of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL and of Lipid-Lowering Therapy Use in Older Adults

(A) Trend of older adults who achieved a goal of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. (B) Trend of older adults taking lipid-lowering therapies. LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

In this representative sample of older adults with a history of MI or stroke in the United States, we identified a persistent treatment gap in the achievement of LDL-C targets (< 70 mg/dL). Despite the increasing trend of controlled LDL-C in older adults over the course of 2 decades, approximately 80% of this demographic still exhibited suboptimal LDL-C levels. This underscores a pronounced disparity between evidence and practice in lipid-lowering interventions for a particularly high-risk population.

Older adults face an elevated risk of major vascular events, which can lead to debilitating outcomes and contribute to disability, functional impairment, and a diminished quality of life. Despite uncertainty around the use of primary prevention lipid-lowering therapies (LLTs) in older adults, the use of LLTs for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in older adults is firmly established based on randomized controlled trial evidence. The improvement in statin use observed over time among older adults in the present study aligns with a large analysis of more than 500,000 MI hospitalizations that saw the high-intensity statin prescription fills nearly triple in older adults from 2011 to 2019. A meta-analysis including 244,090 patients from 29 trials demonstrated a substantial reduction in cardiovascular mortality (15%), MI (20%), and stroke (27%) per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C in older patients.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology guidelines for management of dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease-executive summary [^117Hizjs]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The development of these guidelines is mandated by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) Board of Directors and American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Board of Trustees and adheres with published AACE protocols for the standardized production of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs).

Methods

Each Recommendation is based on a diligent review of the clinical evidence with transparent incorporation of subjective factors.

Results

The Executive Summary of this document contains 87 Recommendations of which 45 are Grade A (51.7%), 18 are Grade B (20.7%), 15 are Grade C (17.2%), and 9 (10.3%) are Grade D. These detailed, evidence-based recommendations allow for nuance-based clinical decision making that addresses multiple aspects of real-world medical care. The evidence base presented in the subsequent Appendix provides relevant supporting information for Executive Summary Recommendations. This update contains 695 citations of which 202 (29.1%) are evidence level (EL) 1 (strong), 137 (19.7%) are EL 2 (intermediate), 119 (17.1%) are EL 3 (weak), and 237 (34.1%) are EL 4 (no clinical evidence).

Conclusion

This CPG is a practical tool that endocrinologists, other healthcare professionals, regulatory bodies and health-related organizations can use to reduce the risks and consequences of dyslipidemia. It provides guidance on screening, risk assessment, and treatment recommendations for a range of patients with various lipid disorders. These recommendations emphasize the importance of treating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in some individuals to lower goals than previously recommended and support the measurement of coronary artery calcium scores and inflammatory markers to help stratify risk. Special consideration is given to patients with diabetes, familial hypercholesterolemia, women, and pediatric patients with dyslipidemia. Both clinical and cost-effectiveness data are provided to support treatment decisions.

Symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (sICAS) lipid management — Clinicians should recommend high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a goal LDL < 70 mg/dL in patients with sICAS to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and vascular events (Level B). This aligns with evidence that a target low-density lipoprotein level < 70 mg/dL among patients with stroke and atherosclerotic disease reduced major cardiovascular events compared with a target LDL < 100 mg/dL.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111EowPm]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Very high-risk ASCVD after stroke/TIA — LDL-C–lowering beyond statins and recommendation: In very high-risk patients, additional benefit from LDL-C lowering when LDL-C is > 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) or non–high-density lipoprotein > 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) by ezetimibe and 2 PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab and alirocumab) was demonstrated by 3 RCTs; this guideline strongly recommends (COR 1) that ezetimibe be added to maximally tolerated statin as a first step to further lower LDL-C, noting that ezetimibe was allowed at entry with statin therapy in both PCSK9 inhibitor trials but only 3% and 5% received ezetimibe during these trials, and that 2 simulation studies showed ezetimibe plus statin therapy lowers LDL-C to < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) in most patients, leaving a minority eligible for a PCSK9 inhibitor.

Extracranial carotid stenosis — supportive evidence and adjunctive medical therapy: A combined analysis of the original carotid endarterectomy (CEA) trials found robust benefit for CEA in severe (70%–99%) ICA stenosis with a 16.0% absolute benefit over 5 years. Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, and antihypertensive therapy and statins are recommended; a trial of 2 lipid targets showed that an LDL target of < 70 mg/dL reduced vascular events compared with a target of 90 to 110 mg/dL and included patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. Additional analyses found benefit in 50% to 69% ICA stenosis quantified as 4.6% over 5 years, with the number needed to treat to prevent 1 stroke higher in women than men (36 versus 9). In pooled carotid artery stenting (CAS) versus CEA analyses of 4754 patients from 4 clinical trials, within 120 days of study entry the hazard ratio for those aged 65 to 69 years was 1.61 (95% CI, 0.90–2.88).

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^1143Du2v]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Plasma lipid recommendations

Seventeen of the guidelines provided at least one target, with all except one of these providing an LDL cholesterol goal. Target values ranged between 1.0 and 2.6 mmol/L, although the most frequently recommended was < 1.8 mmol/L (n = 12). Many guidelines additionally suggested that a 50% reduction in LDL could be used as an alternative where this target may be unattainable or for patients whose baseline values were already < 3.5 mmol/L (n = 7). A non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol target was also common (n = 8), with target values ranging from 2.5 to 3.4 mmol/L, with 2.6 mmol/L the most frequent (n = 5). These targets were usually given in combination with a target for LDL cholesterol, though in the case of the Japan Atherosclerosis Society, the non-HDL target was considered only relevant when a patient's triglycerides were elevated. Meanwhile, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence did not provide a numerical target for non-HDL, recommending a 40% reduction from the patient's baseline only. Only two guidelines referred to other lipid parameters in their recommendations. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCSG) provided an apolipoprotein B target as an alternative for LDL, and the International Diabetes Federation provided additional targets for triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. There were no apparent differences in recommendations for stroke or diabetes-specific guidelines, although some guidelines for all secondary prevention populations provided different targets for those patients with additional comorbidities (n = 2), or specific cardiovascular events (n = 2).

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of recurrent vascular events in Chinese patients with ischemic stroke with and without significant atherosclerosis [^116ELZDc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Current international guidelines recommend the use of intensive lipid‐lowering therapy in patients with a transient ischemic attack (TIA)/ischemic stroke of atherosclerotic origin as secondary prevention. However, the optimal low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) target for secondary stroke prevention remains uncertain. Recently, the TST (Treat Stroke to Target) trial demonstrated that in patients with TIA/ischemic stroke with evidence of atherosclerosis, those who had a target LDL‐C level < 1.80 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) were associated with a lower risk of subsequent cardiovascular events compared with those who had a target range of 2.30 to 2.80 mmol/L (90–110 mg/dL).

However, findings from the TST trial were mainly driven by the 2148 White patients in the study. Its subgroup analysis of 712/2860 Korean patients with stroke failed to demonstrate the same prognostic benefits with an LDL‐C target of < 1.80 mmol/L, and this has been attributed to the short follow‐up period (median 2 years) of these individuals. On the other hand, the optimal LDL‐C target in patients with TIA/ischemic stroke without evidence of atherosclerosis remains uncertain, and whether similar recommended LDL‐C targets for patients with stroke with atherosclerotic origin should be adopted for this group of individuals has not been studied previously.

Therefore, in a large prospective cohort of 904 Chinese patients with ischemic stroke and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the intra‐ and cervicocranial arteries, we evaluated the long‐term prognostic implications of patients who achieved a mean LDL‐C < 1.80 mmol/L compared with ≥ 1.80 mmol/L, stratified by the presence or absence of significant intra‐ and cervicocranial large‐artery disease (LAD).

Choice of statin intensity for patients with clinical ASCVD — In patients who are 75 years of age or younger with clinical ASCVD, high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 50% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels; if high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or causes statin-associated side effects, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels.

### Drug insight: translating evidence on statin therapy into clinical benefits [^116LrcNS]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial showed that, in patients who had experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack, treatment with high-dose atorvastatin over a 5-year period significantly reduced the risk of a subsequent stroke. SPARCL also showed that the benefits of an intensive statin regimen in these patients extended beyond reduction of secondary stroke to include significant reductions in future major vascular events. SPARCL has established statin treatment as a key component of a multimodal vascular risk reduction strategy after an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. It is recommended that the vast majority of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular events should be started on statin therapy, preferably before discharge from acute hospitalization for their index event, with the goal of achieving and maintaining consensus guideline cholesterol targets as soon and for as long as possible.

### Comparison of statins for secondary prevention in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112yP6Jd]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke is the second most common cause of death in industrialized countries and the leading cause of permanent acquired disability. Although a transient ischemic attack (TIA) does not leave any impairment, affected individuals are at a high risk for future ischemic events, particularly in the days and weeks immediately following symptom resolution. On average, the annual risk of future ischemic stroke after an initial stroke or TIA is 3 to 5%. Patients with ischemic stroke or TIA are also at a higher risk for subsequent myocardial infarction and death from vascular causes.

Since the risk of ischemic stroke is higher in the early period after the acute event, prompt initiation of tailored prevention strategies is essential. It has been estimated that at least 80% of recurrent ischemic events in patients with previous ischemic stroke may be prevented through the use of a comprehensive approach that includes dietary modification, exercise, antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy, effective strategies for treatment of hypertension, and statins.

Historically, the role of statin therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular disease has been well received by the medical and scientific communities, with numerous guidelines promoting their use. Specifically, the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline recommends the use of statins to reduce the risk of stroke and cardiovascular events in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin. Possible adverse events that have been associated with statin therapy are myopathy and hemorrhagic stroke.

Despite the widespread use of statins, however, the relative safety and efficacy of different statin drugs have not been clearly defined. In fact, no head-to-head trial has directly addressed the effectiveness of these therapies or has clearly defined the choice of a specific statin, dose (low, moderate, or high), and target (all ischemic stroke and TIA or non-cardioembolic only or high LDL cholesterol only).

A more accurate understanding of the effectiveness and safety of different statins is required to make appropriate drug choices, both at an individual and public health level, informing drug prescribing and procurement. In this network meta-analysis, we aim to summarize the current evidence for statin use in secondary prevention of patients with ischemic stroke or TIA by estimating the relative efficacy and safety of various statins and providing a final ranking of the different molecules. Our results may inform clinicians in their daily practice as well as scientific societies and agencies developing best practice guidelines.

Regarding specific circumstances for transient ischemic attack, more specifically with respect to patients with aortic arch atherosclerosis, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate intensive lipid management with an LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL to prevent recurrent stroke in patients with a TIA and evidence of an aortic arch atheroma.

### Comparative effectiveness of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin in acute ischemic stroke treatment [^1127DbQw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The determination of statin type and intensity is important for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, including stroke. In our study, even in patients with large artery atherosclerosis, high‐intensity statin therapy was administered in 69% of patients after stroke among patients with available statin dose information (57% of patients with small vessel occlusion, and 48% of patients with cardioembolic stroke). These findings suggest a potential need for increased efforts in guideline implementation to enhance secondary stroke prevention in the future. European guidelines currently provide recommendations for targeting LDL‐C levels without specifying a particular treatment intensity. Additionally, a recent TST (Treat Stroke to Target) study indicated that achieving a target LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL in patients with stroke was more beneficial for secondary prevention. Hence, reaching the LDL‐C target after statin therapy may influence the results of study. Considering that patients with stroke may already be older, have a history of prior stroke (especially hemorrhagic stroke), or exhibit frailty, the practical use of high‐intensity statin therapy in the real world for patients with stroke may not be common. Due to the heterogeneity of stroke, the appropriateness of high‐intensity statin use in patients with the cardioembolism, undetermined cause, and small vessel occlusion subtypes remains questionable. Additionally, it is unclear whether high‐intensity statin therapy is necessary when the LDL‐C level is already < 100 mg/dL or 70 mg/dL (in cases where the target LDL‐C level has been reached) at the onset of the index stroke, necessitating further investigation through prospective studies. Nevertheless, rosuvastatin appears to trend toward superiority over atorvastatin, even in subgroup analyses, which provides meaningful insight, suggesting its relevance in clinical considerations.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^1159b5fB]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Carotid atherosclerosis — lipid management and statins: In patients with known coronary or other atherosclerosis, the risk of stroke decreased by > 15% for every 10% reduction in serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and other analyses showed that statin therapy reduces the risk of stroke by 15% to 30%, with atorvastatin reducing stroke rate by 16% over 5 years after a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). In an analysis of a large (> 9200) series, elevation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was associated with a reduction of stroke risk by a factor of 0.86, whereas an elevated total cholesterol/HDL ratio increased stroke risk by a factor of 1.22. Statin agents are recommended, targeting LDL of 100 mg/ dL for those with coronary heart disease or symptomatic atherosclerotic disease and LDL of 70 mg/dL for very high-risk persons with multiple risk factors.

### Achievement of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol targets in primary and secondary prevention: analysis of a large real practice database in Italy [^111F3q4A]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Target and intensity of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapy should be tailored according to the individual global cardiovascular (CV) risk. We aimed at retrospectively evaluating real-life LDL-C goal attainment and predictive factors for predefined LDL-C therapeutic goals both in primary and secondary prevention.

Methods

We collected data from a large cohort of outpatients aged 40–65 years, followed by general practitioners, cardiologists and diabetologists in Italy. All data were centrally analysed for global CV risk assessment and rates of control of major CV risk factors, including LDL-C. Study population was stratified according to the presence or absence of previous CV events, including coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD) or stroke/TIA. CV risk profile characterization was based on the European SCORE. Predefined therapeutic goals were set according to the European guidelines on dyslipidaemia: LDL-C levels < 70 mg/dl for very high CV risk patients in primary prevention and for those in secondary prevention; < 100 mg/dl LDL-C levels for high CV risk patients in primary prevention. Logistic regression analysis with clinical covariates was used to identify predictive factors for achieving these goals; lipid lowering therapy entered in the analysis as continuous (model 1) or categorical variable (model 2).

Results

We included 4,142 outpatients (43,7% female, age 58.0 ± 5.2 years, BMI 28.5 ± 5.0 kg/m 2) among whom 2,964 (71.6%) in primary and 1,178 (28.4%) in secondary prevention. In primary prevention, none of the patients at very high CV risk had LDL-C < 70 mg/dl and 8.9% of patients at high CV risk showed LDL-C < 100 mg/dl. Only 5.8% of patients in secondary prevention had LDL-C levels < 70 mg/dl, specifically 6.5% of patients with CAD, 2.6% of patients with PAD and 4.7% of patients with CVD (p < 0.001). Beyond diabetes and lipid lowering therapy, high risk SCORE estimation resulted a strong and independent predictor for the lack of achieving all predefined therapeutic targets, including LDL-C < 100 mg/dl [OR: 0.806 (0.751–0.865)); p < 0.001], and LDL-C < 70 mg/dl [OR: 0.712 (0–576–0.880); p = 0.002], in primary prevention.

Conclusions

Despite high or very high SCORE risk and use of lipid lowering therapies, we observed poor achievement of LDL-C targets in this large cohort of outpatients followed in a setting of real practice in Italy.

### Blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol targets for prevention of recurrent strokes and cognitive decline in the hypertensive patient: design of the European Society of Hypertension-Chinese hypertension league stroke in hypertension optimal treatment randomized trial [^112nXrNs]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The SBP values to be achieved by antihypertensive therapy in order to maximize reduction of cardiovascular outcomes are unknown; neither is it clear whether in patients with a previous cardiovascular event, the optimal values are lower than in the low-to-moderate risk hypertensive patients, or a more cautious blood pressure (BP) reduction should be obtained. Because of the uncertainty whether 'the lower the better' or the 'J-curve' hypothesis is correct, the European Society of Hypertension and the Chinese Hypertension League have promoted a randomized trial comparing antihypertensive treatment strategies aiming at three different SBP targets in hypertensive patients with a recent stroke or transient ischaemic attack. As the optimal level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level is also unknown in these patients, LDL-C-lowering has been included in the design.

Protocol Design

The European Society of Hypertension-Chinese Hypertension League Stroke in Hypertension Optimal Treatment trial is a prospective multinational, randomized trial with a 3×2 factorial design comparing: three different SBP targets (1, < 145–135; 2, < 135–125; 3, < 125 mmHg); two different LDL-C targets (target A, 2.8–1.8; target B, < 1.8 mmol/l). The trial is to be conducted on 7500 patients aged at least 65 years (2500 in Europe, 5000 in China) with hypertension and a stroke or transient ischaemic attack 1–6 months before randomization. Antihypertensive and statin treatments will be initiated or modified using suitable registered agents chosen by the investigators, in order to maintain patients within the randomized SBP and LDL-C windows. All patients will be followed up every 3 months for BP and every 6 months for LDL-C. Ambulatory BP will be measured yearly.

Outcomes

Primary outcome is time to stroke (fatal and non-fatal). Important secondary outcomes are: time to first major cardiovascular event; cognitive decline (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and dementia. All major outcomes will be adjudicated by committees blind to randomized allocation. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board has open access to data and can recommend trial interruption for safety.

Sample Size Calculation

It has been calculated that 925 patients would reach the primary outcome after a mean 4-year follow-up, and this should provide at least 80% power to detect a 25% stroke difference between SBP targets and a 20% difference between LDL-C targets.

### Effect of statin therapy on cardiovascular outcome in stroke patients with low baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^115nbehq]. Annals of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate whether post-stroke statin therapy reduces subsequent major vascular events in statin-naïve patients with pretreatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) below the recommended target (≤ 70mg/dL for atherosclerotic stroke and ≤ 100mg/dL for non-atherosclerotic stroke) at stroke onset.

Methods

Patients from an ongoing stroke registry who had an ischemic stroke between 2011 and 2020 were screened. Statin naïve patients with baseline LDL-C below the target were assessed. The effect of post-stroke statin therapy on major vascular events (composite of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and death) was investigated using weighted Cox regression analyses using stabilized inverse probability treatment weighting.

Results

The baseline LDL-C level of the 1,858 patients (mean age 67.9 ± 15.3years, 61.4% men, 13.2% atherosclerotic stroke) included in the study was 75.7 ± 17.0mg/dL. Statins were prescribed to 1,256 (67.7%) patients (low-to-moderate intensity, 23.5%; high intensity, 44.1%). Post-stroke statin therapy was associated with a lower risk of major vascular events during 1-year follow-up (weighted hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.42–0.71). In a subgroup of patients who were at very high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with LDL-C < 55mg/dL or patients who were not at very high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with LDL-C < 70mg/dL, post-stroke statin therapy was also associated with a reduction in major vascular events (weighted hazard ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.29–0.70). The intensity of the most beneficial statin varied by subtype of stroke.

Interpretation

Statin therapy may improve vascular outcomes after ischemic stroke, even in cases of LDL-C below the target without pre-stroke lipid-lowering therapy. ANN NEUROL 2024;95:876–885.

### Editorial: minor stroke is not minor [^116CLDu8]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

The best primary and secondary prevention strategies for minor stroke and TIA include management of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and diabetes, and healthy lifestyles. For instance, targeting the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level to be < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) is recommended to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events for all ischaemic stroke and TIA of atherosclerotic origin, in the 2021 secondary stroke prevention guideline from American Heart Association/American Stroke Association. Particularly in non-cardioembolic minor stroke and TIA patients, the higher risk of ischaemic stroke in those with higher baseline LDL-C level could be neutralised by lipid-lowering treatment. In the CHANCE trial, baseline LDL-C ≥ 2.6 mmol/L was associated with an increased risk of ischaemic stroke in patients without lipid-lowering treatment (adjusted HR 1.35; p < 0.001), but not in those with lipid-lowering treatment (adjusted HR 0.99; p = 0.91; p for interaction = 0.007).

The objective of this scientific statement is to evaluate contemporary evidence that either supports or refutes the conclusion that aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering or lipid lowering exerts toxic effects on the brain, leading to cognitive impairment or dementia or hemorrhagic stroke. The writing group used literature reviews, references to published clinical and epidemiology studies, clinical and public health guidelines, authoritative statements, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence and to identify gaps in current knowledge. Although some retrospective, case control, and prospective longitudinal studies suggest that statins and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering are associated with cognitive impairment or dementia, the preponderance of observational studies and data from randomized trials do not support this conclusion. The risk of a hemorrhagic stroke associated with statin therapy in patients without a history of cerebrovascular disease is nonsignificant, and achieving very low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol does not increase that risk. Data reflecting the risk of hemorrhagic stroke with lipid-lowering treatment among patients with a history of hemorrhagic stroke are not robust and require additional focused study.

Abbreviations: CAD, coronary artery disease; CVA, cerebrovascular accident; CVD, cardiovascular disease; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; PVD, peripheral vascular disease.

In a secondary analysis, 42.1% (7955 of 18 904) of patients who did accept statin therapy vs 21.0% (1114 of 5308) of patients who did not accept statin therapy achieved an LDL cholesterol level of less than 100 mg/dL within 12 months (P < .001). In multivariable analysis, nonacceptance of statin therapy was associated with an odds ratio (OR) for achieving LDL cholesterol control within 12 months of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.30–0.35) (P < .001); findings of a secondary analysis using LDL decrease by 50% as the outcomes were similar (eAppendix 5 in Supplement 1). Women (independently from other characteristics) were less likely to achieve LDL cholesterol control within 12 months (OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.80–0.90]; P < .001).

Factors Associated With Statin Therapy Acceptance

In multivariable analysis (Figure 3), women were less likely to agree to take a statin when first recommended by a clinician (OR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.78–0.88]; P < .001). Presence of cardiovascular disease, higher baseline LDL cholesterol, and history of smoking were associated with a greater probability of statin acceptance. All of these associations were statistically significant after adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing.

### Lipid management in the prevention of stroke: review and updated meta-analysis of statins for stroke prevention [^111zwx5L]. The Lancet: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Despite the inconsistent or weak association between cholesterol and stroke, lowering of cholesterol concentrations with statins reduces the risk of stroke in high-risk populations and in patients with non-cardioembolic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Statin therapy is the most important advance in stroke prevention since the introduction of aspirin and antihypertensive treatments. Meta-analysis of randomised trials of statins in combination with other preventive strategies, including 165 792 individuals, shows that each 1 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) decrease in LDL cholesterol equates to a reduction in relative risk for stroke of 21.1% (95% CI 6.3–33.5, p = 0.009). In secondary prevention of non-cardioembolic stroke, intense reduction of LDL cholesterol by statins also significantly reduced the risk of recurrent stroke (relative risk 0.84, 0.71–0.99, p = 0.03) and major cardiovascular events (0.80, 0.69–0.92, p = 0.002). Future directions include assessment of a target LDL cholesterol concentration of less than 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL), the effects of triglyceride-lowering therapy alone or in combination with statins, and the effects of treatments to raise HDL cholesterol concentrations.

Additional information

The Heart Protection Study included 3280 patients with cerebrovascular disease (defined as non-disabling stroke, TIA or having had a carotid endarterectomy) in whom treatments with simvastatin 40 mg versus placebo reduced subsequent major vascular events over 5 years follow up n = 406 (24.7%) versus 488 (29.8%); p = 0.001. Although patients with lacunar stroke are likely to have been recruited to this study there is no mention of the proportion with lacunar stroke.

Similarly, in the Treat Stroke to Target Trial 2860 patients with recent stroke or TIA and 'atherosclerotic disease' were randomised in France and South Korea to receive lipid lowering medication (statin, ezetimibe or both) with a lower target (LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL)) or higher target (2.3–2.8 mmol/L (90–110 mg/dL)). The composite primary end point (MACE) occurred in 121 patients (8.5%) in the lower-target group and in 156 (10.9%) in the higher-target group (aHR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61, 0.98; p = 0.04) suggesting benefit to a lower target. Again, stroke was not subtyped.

International US, European, and local guidelines (UK/Ireland, Sweden) recommend intensive LDL-C lowering therapy in patients following ischaemic stroke with the AHA and UK guidance specifying atorvastatin 80 mg od and to consider other agents based upon co-morbidities with the AHA recommending a target level of LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) (Table 1). Where documented, there was good representation of patients with lacunar stroke in the background trials and there is no convincing evidence that patient with lacunar stroke subtypes should be treated differently from other ischaemic stroke subtypes with regards to management of lipid profiles.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) risk–reduction magnitude — within the studied range, there was no evidence of an LDL-C threshold; larger LDL-C reductions, for example 2 to 3 mmol/L (77.4–116.1 mg/dL), could yield up to 40% to 50% relative risk reduction for ASCVD.

Dyslipidaemia

The available evidence on role of dyslipidaemia for pathogenesis of stroke is moderately robust, but most of the data (Supplementary material online, Table S6) indicate that lowering LDL-C is the primary target in IS, and each 1 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) decrease in LDL-C levels reduces the risk of any stroke by 21.1%. First-line drugs are statins. In patients with initial LDL-C levels which are much higher than the target LDL-levels, ezetimibe could be started right away as an add-on treatment to statins. Although the related evidence is low, especially when compared to the role of immediate onset of statin treatment in patients with acute MI, we suggest that statins with or without ezetimibe is instituted early in the acute phase, as this strategy reduced risk of recurrent stroke in TIA patients with carotid stenosis. Long-term statin use reduced reoccurrence of fatal or non-fatal stroke in patients after stroke or TIA (in the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels study HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.71–0.99), and higher statin adherence reduced risk of recurrent stroke in patients with recent IS without AF (HR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63–0.97) and with AF (HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.43–0.81). Initial reports had generated the hypothesis that statins and other lipid-lowering drugs may perhaps increase the of haemorrhagic stroke, but this was not confirmed in plenty of large-scale epidemiological studies. Patients with IS are at very high cardiovascular risk and should be subject to at least 50% reduction of LDL-C with target LDL-C value of 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL). Patients with IS or TIA which is attributed to a specific aetiology that is not related to cardiovascular risk factors like cervical artery dissection, patent foramen ovale (PFO), endocarditis, and atrial myxoma should not be a priori considered as of very high risk for stroke recurrence and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. For such patients, it is suggested that lipid lowering treatment should be based on a personalized 10-year cardiovascular risk, estimated by the calibrated country-specific SCORE. Figure 3 shows the proposed management of dyslipidaemia in IS.

### Low LDL-C level and intracranial haemorrhage risk after ischaemic stroke: a prospective cohort study [^111kb9rr]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For secondary prevention, patients who had an ischaemic stroke (IS) have been recommended to receive lipid-lowering therapy to reduce the recurrence risk, with evidence from the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study. Previously, it remained controversial about the target level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) control in secondary prevention for IS of atherosclerotic origin. Recently, data from Treat Stroke to Target trial demonstrated that to stipulate patients who had an IS with a target LDL-C level of less than 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) can significantly reduce risk of subsequent cardiovascular events than those with a target range of 2.4–2.9 mmol/L (90–110 mg/L). Furthermore, guidelines for lipid management also updated new target value for LDL-C lowering therapy of 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) for patients with high cardiovascular risk.

Therefore, it is plausible to speculate a more strict target level than 1.8 mmol/L for secondary prevention of patients who had an IS. However, conflicting opinions still exist and several studies have indicated that the aggressive cholesterol reduction may cause side effects, of which, intracranial haemorrhage, as the major haemorrhagic complication following acute IS, often causes clinical deterioration by aggravating brain tissue damage. Previously, one post-hoc analysis of the SPARCL study also demonstrated that haemorrhagic stroke was frequently observed in those treated with atorvastatin. Therefore, for patients who had an IS, it is necessary to elucidate the correlation between the low LDL-C level and risk of intracranial haemorrhagic events following IS. However, evidence on this clinically concerned matter remains limited.

In this study, we aimed to elucidate whether the low LDL-C level (< 1.40 mmol/L, 1.40–1.79 mmol/L) may increase the risk of intracranial haemorrhage following IS, using the data from real world with nearly 800 000 participants.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^114EB8LN]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Risk assessment markers for ASCVD — Primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD require an accurate estimation of risk of both future and recurrent cardiovascular events, and the LDL-C level is the focus of this article and is a highly relevant biomarker (indicator) of ASCVD risk, with high LDL-C generally indicative of high ASCVD risk and very low LDL-C levels generally indicative of low ASCVD risk (in the absence of other major risk factors). In individuals with hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes, obesity, or metabolic syndrome, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apo B) offer superior risk assessment by accounting for all atherogenic particles, and the National Lipid Association (NLA) and other major guidelines recommend consideration of apo B or non–HDL-C as secondary targets, particularly in high-risk patients or when triglyceride levels are elevated; the level of ASCVD risk should inform intensity of treatment to lower LDL-C.

### Association of major blood lipids with post-stroke dementia: a community-based cohort study [^113y3kun]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

The current American guideline recommends intensive statin therapy to reduce the blood low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) level following ischaemic stroke for prevention of future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease but does not stipulate a target level of LDL‐C due to limited evidence. European guidelines recommend a more intensive target of LDL‐C < 1.4 mmol/l in very high risk patients compared with the previous target of < 1.8 mmol/l. Whilst atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and dementia share many cardiovascular risk factors, whether lipid levels affect the risk of dementia has not been established, with only low‐quality evidence available on the effect of lipid‐lowering treatment on the risk of dementia in the general population.

Relevant evidence is scarce in stroke patients, who are more likely to have hyperlipidaemia and develop subsequent dementia than the general population. According to a recent systematic review, only one randomised controlled trial, the Prevention of Decline in Cognition after Stroke Trial (PODCAST), has investigated the effect of lowering LDL‐C on post‐stroke dementia (PSD). This small‐scale trial found that an intensive target (LDL‐C < 1.3 mmol/l vs. < 3.0 mmol/l) significantly improved some cognitive test scores amongst 77 stroke patients during a 2‐year follow‐up, with a statistically non‐significant protective effect on PSD (odds ratio 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01–3.98). The same systematic review found no trials or observational studies for assessing the risk of PSD with different levels of high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) or triglycerides. It is unclear whether target levels of LDL‐C recommended in the guidelines, or different levels of other blood lipids, would have an impact on the occurrence of PSD.

This study was to examine the association of LDL‐C, HDL‐C and triglycerides with dementia in people with stroke.

### Association between intensity of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction with statin-based therapies and secondary stroke prevention: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114eC6AP]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

The lowest LDL-C level among patients in the included trials was 31 mg/d, as shown in a trial with a PCSK9 inhibitor plus statins; there was a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of recurrent stroke, and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke was not increased. Another included trial found LDL-C levels of 51 mg/dL among patients who received ezetimibe plus simvastatin vs 68 mg/dL among those who received simvastatin alone; ezetimibe plus simvastatin compared with simvastatin alone was associated with a reduced risk of recurrent stroke and a nonsignificantly increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. The TST Trial compared lower-target with higher-target groups and found LDL-C levels of 65 mg/dL in the lower-target group vs 96 mg/dL in the higher-target group; the lower-target group compared with higher-target group was associated with a reduced risk of MACE, as well as a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of recurrent stroke and a nonsignificantly increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Based on these findings, it might be reasonable to lower LDL-C below 70 mg/dL with statin-based therapies for patients with ischemic stroke and evidence of atherosclerosis. However, the lowest level below which it is not recommended to lower LDL-C might not be known based on the evidence currently available.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^116VZyqu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^116U8Lqy]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Non–HDL–C and LDL–C — The NLA Expert Panel's consensus view is that non–HDL–C (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) is a better primary target for modification than LDL–C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and non–HDL–C is listed first to emphasize its primary importance. LDL–C comprises ~75% of the cholesterol in circulation carried by lipoprotein particles other than HDL. Epidemiologic studies have shown that non–HDL–C is a stronger predictor of ASCVD morbidity and mortality than LDL–C. Using non–HDL–C as a target for intervention also simplifies the management of patients with high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), and an elevated triglyceride concentration confounds the relationship between LDL–C and ASCVD risk, but this appears to be less of an issue with non–HDL–C.

Asymptomatic cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), including silent cerebral infarcts (SCI) — Primary prevention recommendations state that in adults with asymptomatic CSVD, including silent infarcts, assessment and management of risk factors are recommended to reduce stroke risk; in adults with silent cerebral infarcts who do not have an indication for statin therapy according to the 2019 ACC/AHA guideline (e.g., 20–75 years of age with LDL-C level > 190 mg/dL [> 4.9 mmol/L], 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 20%, or 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%– < 20% plus ≥ 1 risk enhancers), use of low-dose statin therapy may be considered to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke; and in adults with SCI, the benefit of antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke is uncertain, with scope limited because more than 90% of silent infarcts are subcortical and these recommendations do not apply to individuals with silent cortical infarcts that are less likely to be related to CSVD.

### Hit or miss: the new cholesterol targets [^111HmLvz]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Drug treatment to reduce cholesterol to new target levels is now recommended in four moderate- to high-risk patient populations: patients who have already sustained a cardiovascular event, adult diabetic patients, individuals with low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥ 190mg/dL and individuals with an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk ≥ 7.5%. Achieving these cholesterol target levels did not confer any additional benefit in a systematic review of 35 randomised controlled trials. Recommending cholesterol lowering treatment based on estimated cardiovascular risk fails to identify many high-risk patients and may lead to unnecessary treatment of low-risk individuals. The negative results of numerous cholesterol lowering randomised controlled trials call into question the validity of using low density lipoprotein cholesterol as a surrogate target for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Effect of alirocumab on stroke in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES [^111S4L91]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Lowering of atherogenic lipoproteins, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), reduces the risk of ischemic stroke. However, concerns have been raised about very low LDL-C levels and a potential increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. ODYSSEY OUTCOMES compared the PCSK9 inhibitor alirocumab with placebo in 18 924 patients with recent acute coronary syndrome and elevated atherogenic lipoproteins, despite intensive statin therapy, targeting LDL-C levels of 25 to 50 mg/dL and avoiding sustained LDL-C < 15 mg/dL. This prespecified analysis was designed to assess the effect of alirocumab on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. We hypothesized that for patients treated with alirocumab there would be a reduction in risk of ischemic stroke without increasing hemorrhagic stroke, irrespective of baseline LDL-C and of history of cerebrovascular disease.

Methods

Patients were randomized to alirocumab or placebo 1 to 12 months after acute coronary syndrome. The risk of nonfatal or fatal ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke was evaluated, stratified by baseline LDL-C concentration and history of cerebrovascular disease. A potential association of very low achieved LDL-C with alirocumab treatment at month 4 and subsequent hemorrhagic stroke was assessed.

Results

Median follow-up was 2.8 years. In total, 263 ischemic and 33 hemorrhagic strokes occurred. Alirocumab reduced the risk of any stroke (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.57–0.91]) and ischemic stroke (HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.57–0.93]) without increasing hemorrhagic stroke (HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.42–1.65]). In total, 7164 (37.9%), 6128 (32.4%), and 5629 (29.7%) patients had a baseline LDL-C of < 80, 80 to 100, and > 100 mg/dL, respectively. The treatment effect on stroke appeared numerically greater for patients with higher baseline LDL-C, but there was no formal evidence of heterogeneity (P interaction = 0.31). The effect of alirocumab on stroke was similar among 944 patients (5.0%) with a history of previous cerebrovascular disease and among those without a history of cerebrovascular disease (P interaction = 0.37). There was no apparent adverse relation between lower achieved LDL-C and incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the alirocumab group.

Conclusions

In patients with recent acute coronary syndrome and dyslipidemia despite intensive statin therapy, alirocumab decreased the risk of stroke, irrespective of baseline LDL-C and history of cerebrovascular disease, over a median follow-up of 2.8 years. Furthermore, risk of hemorrhagic stroke did not depend on achieved LDL-C levels within the alirocumab group.

### Benefit of targeting a LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol [^115Z5S8F]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- The TST trial (Treat Stroke to Target) evaluated the benefit of targeting a LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol of < 70 mg/dL to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in 2860 patients with ischemic stroke with atherosclerotic stenosis of cerebral vasculature or aortic arch plaque > 4 mm, in a French and Korean population. The follow-up lasted a median of 5.3 years in French patients (similar to the median follow-up time in the SPARCL trial [Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Level]) and 2.0 years in Korean patients. Exposure duration to statin is a well-known driver for cardiovascular risk reduction. We report here the TST results in the French cohort. Methods- One thousand seventy-three French patients were assigned to < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) and 1075 to 100 ± 10 mg/dL (90–110 mg/dL, 2.3–2.8 mmol/L). To achieve these goals, investigators used the statin and dosage of their choice and added ezetimibe on top if needed. The primary outcome was the composite of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, new symptoms requiring urgent coronary or carotid revascularization and vascular death. Results- After a median follow-up of 5.3 years, the achieved LDL cholesterol was 66 (1.69 mmol/L) and 96 mg/dL (2.46 mmol/L) on average, respectively. The primary end point occurred in 9.6% and 12.9% of patients, respectively (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.57–0.94]; P = 0.019). Cerebral infarction or urgent carotid revascularization following transient ischemic attack was reduced by 27% (P = 0.046). Cerebral infarction or intracranial hemorrhage was reduced by 28% (P = 0.023). The primary outcome or intracranial hemorrhage was reduced by 25% (P = 0.021). Intracranial hemorrhages occurred in 13 and 11 patients, respectively (HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.53–2.62]; P = 0.70). Conclusions- After an ischemic stroke of documented atherosclerotic origin, targeting a LDL cholesterol of < 70 mg/dL during 5.3 years avoided 1 subsequent major vascular event in 4 (number needed to treat of 30) and no increase in intracranial hemorrhage.

### Recent update to the US cholesterol treatment guidelines: a comparison with international guidelines [^1113ZDzD]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol guideline advocated several changes from the previous Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Assuming full implementation, the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline would identify ≈13 million Americans as newly eligible for consideration of statin therapy. Three features of the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline primarily responsible for these differences are the specific risk assessment tool endorsed, the risk threshold considered sufficient to warrant primary prevention statin therapy, and the decision not to include cholesterol treatment targets. There is no consensus among international guidelines on the optimal approach to these 3 components. The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline recommends assessing absolute risk with the Pooled Cohort equations, which were developed to improve on previous risk assessment models by including stroke as an outcome and by broadening racial and geographic diversity. Each of the leading international guidelines recommends a different equation for absolute risk assessment. The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline advises consideration of statin therapy for an estimated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease of ≥ 7.5%, which is lower than the thresholds recommended by other leading international guidelines. Lastly, the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline does not endorse a treat-to-target strategy but instead specifies the appropriate intensity of statin for each risk category. This approach is shared by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines but differs from other international guidelines. In this review, we summarize the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline recommendations and compare them with recommendations from Adult Treatment Panel III and other leading international guidelines.

Lipid guidelines comparison — LDL role, on‑treatment targets, and combination therapy are contrasted as follows: KDIGO states "does not consider LDL in treatment decision", while ACC/AHA specifies "If CVD history, do not consider LDL; if LDL ≥ 190, treat; if LDL 70–189, depends on risk", and 2014 ADA notes "LDL not used for treatment initiation, though there are target LDL levels on treatment", whereas AACE advises "As part of risk assessment, recommend that all adults at risk for CAD to reach optimum lipid values". For treatment targets, ACC/AHA indicates "Reasonable to target 50% reduction if LDL ≥ 190, otherwise no"; 2014 ADA specifies "Without CVD, LDL < 100; with CVD, LDL < 70 is an option; can use reduction by 30%–40% as alternative target if on maximum statin", and AACE lists "LDL < 100 with goal < 70 for very high risk, also targets HDL and triglycerides". For combination pharmacologic therapy, AACE allows "Yes if cholesterol markedly elevated and target not achieved with monotherapy, for mixed dyslipidemia, or to use lower doses of ≥ 2 drugs to decrease toxicity risk". LDL levels are reported in mg/dL.

### Statin treatment in patients with stroke with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below 70 mg / dL [^115ySFcd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels increase the risk of stroke and vascular events. Lipid‐lowering therapy using statins could reduce the risk of stroke recurrence and vascular events. A meta‐analysis of 26 statin trials demonstrated that further reductions in LDL‐C levels definitely further reduced the risk of vascular events, which was consistent across baseline LDL‐C levels. Most of the trials have enrolled patients with cardiovascular disease, but only a small proportion of patients had acute ischemic stroke and low baseline levels of LDL‐C (< 70 mg/dL). Moreover, conflicting results have been reported in previous studies, which revealed no evidence of the benefit of further LDL‐C reduction in patients with baseline LDL‐C levels < 66 mg/dL or more intensive LDL‐C lowering (versus less intensive LDL‐C lowering) in patients with baseline LDL‐C levels < 100 mg/dL.

For secondary prevention of ischemic stroke, high‐intensity statins, such as atorvastatin 80 mg, reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke with initial LDL‐C levels > 100 mg/dL. A target LDL‐C level < 70 mg/dL is recommended to reduce the risk of vascular events in acute ischemic stroke. However, an issue that still needs further research is whether statin treatment could reduce the risk of early vascular events when baseline LDL‐C levels are already low, at < 70 mg/dL, at the time of index stroke. In a recent prospective study, a significant association between lower LDL‐C levels and a higher risk of intracerebral hemorrhage was observed when LDL‐C levels were < 70 mg/dL. These factors may cause physicians to be reluctant to use statins in patients with acute ischemic stroke with low LDL‐C levels at baseline.

Therefore, we investigated whether early statin treatment could reduce the risk of early vascular events in patients with first‐ever ischemic stroke with baseline LDL‐C levels < 70 mg/dL.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to management of dyslipidemia, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate lipid-lowering therapy with a statin, and ezetimibe if needed, with a goal of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and atherosclerotic disease (intracranial, carotid, aortic, or coronary).

### Association between intensity of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction with statin-based therapies and secondary stroke prevention: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^116H9kSm]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are more intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)–lowering statin-based therapies beneficial for secondary stroke prevention compared with less intensive LDL-C lowering?

Findings

In this meta-analysis that included 11 randomized clinical trials comprising 20 163 patients with stroke, the risk of recurrent stroke was 8% with more intensive LDL-C lowering vs 9% with less intensive LDL-C lowering, a statistically significant difference. The benefits associated with more intensive LDL-C lowering might be found only in patients with ischemic stroke with evidence of atherosclerosis.

Meaning

This study suggests that more intensive LDL-C–lowering statin-based therapies might be warranted for patients with ischemic stroke with evidence of atherosclerosis.

### Effect of alirocumab on stroke in ODYSSEY OUTCOMES [^1132JqEF]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Editorial, see p

Lowering of atherogenic lipoproteins with statin treatment reduces the risk of first or recurrent stroke, – and the benefit has been shown by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialist meta-analysis to be directly proportional to the degree of absolute lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Accordingly, international guidelines recommend statin treatment for patients at high cardiovascular risk or with established cardiovascular disease with or without a history of cerebrovascular disease, to prevent major cardiovascular events, including ischemic stroke.

Although some data have raised a potential association of very low LDL-C levels and risk of hemorrhagic stroke, the decrease in ischemic stroke outweighed the potential increase in hemorrhagic stroke. The advent of inhibitors of PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin−kexin type 9) provided an opportunity to lower LDL-C to levels not previously achievable in most patients with statins and/or ezetimibe. Two large cardiovascular outcomes trials have compared the effect of a fully human PCSK9 inhibitor with placebo on the risk of stroke in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and elevated atherogenic lipoproteins despite background statin treatment. In both trials, treatment with the PCSK9 inhibitor lowered LDL-C by more than 50% below the statin-treated baseline. The FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Patients With Elevated Risk)compared evolocumab with placebo in patients with established, stable, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Evolocumab treatment reduced the risk of ischemic stroke without a significant effect on hemorrhagic stroke. The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab)compared alirocumab with placebo in 18 924 patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and showed a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events with alirocumab compared with placebo. This prespecified analysis was designed to assess the effect of alirocumab on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. We hypothesized that for patients treated with alirocumab, there would be a reduction in risk of ischemic stroke without increasing hemorrhagic stroke, irrespective of baseline LDL-C and of history of cerebrovascular disease.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and lipid-modifying therapy prescription patterns in the real world: an analysis of more than 33, 000 high cardiovascular risk patients in Japan [^116DZG3Y]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a key modifiable risk factor in the development of cardiovascular (CV) disease. In 2012, the Japan Atherosclerosis Society (JAS) issued guidelines recommending statins as first-line pharmacotherapy for lowering LDL-C in patients at high risk for CV events. This study assessed achievement of recommended LDL-C goals and lipid-modifying therapy (LMT) use in a high CV risk population in Japan.

Methods

Patients from the Medical Data Vision (MDV) database, an electronic hospital-based claims database in Japan, who met the following inclusion criteria were included in this study: LDL-C measurement in 2013; ≥ 20 years of age; ≥ 2 years representation in the database; and a high CV risk condition (recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS), other coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic stroke, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) or diabetes). LDL-C goal attainment was assessed based on LDL-C targets in the JAS guidelines.

Results

A total of 33,325 high CV risk patients met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 68% of the cohort achieved guideline recommended LDL-C targets, with only 42% receiving current treatment with statins. Attainment of LDL-C goals was 68% for ACS, 55% for CHD, and 80% each for ischemic stroke, PAD, and diabetes patients. Concomitant use of non-statin LMTs was low.

Conclusions

In a high CV risk population in a routine care setting in Japan, guideline recommended LDL-C goal attainment and utilization of statins and other LMT was low. In addition, physicians appeared to be more likely to consider the initiation of statins in patients with higher baseline LDL-C levels.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention — evidence base for BP targets summarizes randomized and meta-analytic data. Data from 4 RCTs and recent meta-analyses support the benefit of treating patients with prior stroke or TIA to achieve a BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg. Trials compared intensive control (SBP targets < 120 to < 130 mm Hg) with standard control (SBP targets < 140 to < 150 mm Hg). A meta-analysis of these trials showed a significant reduction in recurrent stroke risk with an intensive versus standard target (relative risk: 0.78 [95% CI: 0.64–0.96]). An independent Cochrane analysis reported a pooled relative risk for recurrent stroke of 0.80 [95% CI: 0.63–1.00]. The largest meta-analysis to date included > 40,000 patients from 14 RCTs.

Aortic arch atherosclerosis — supportive evidence notes that complex aortic arch plaque identified by transesophageal echocardiography is independently and strongly associated with ischemic stroke, with prospective studies showing increased recurrence among patients with aortic plaques ≥ 4 mm, particularly with ulceration or mobile components; there are no strong data that management should differ from general secondary prevention strategies. For lipid lowering, there is evidence that treating to an LDL target of < 70 mg/dL is more effective than less intensive lipid management; in the ARCH study, the event rate was only 20% to 30% of the > 12% expected from observational studies, and mean LDL-C was reduced by ≈40 mg/dL to 83 to 84 mg/dL. For antithrombotic therapy, there were 6 vascular deaths (3.4%) in the warfarin arm and none in the dual antiplatelet arm (log-rank test, P = 0.013); there is strong evidence that aspirin is effective in secondary prevention, and in the absence of compelling evidence for a superior alternative, long-term monotherapy with aspirin is recommended, while minor strokes meeting POINT study criteria also should be treated with short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel.

### What are the priorities for managing cholesterol effectively? [^111sySEP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Many studies have confirmed the risk of coronary artery disease associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The precise role of other lipids, however, is still under investigation. The relation between elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is complex, and the results of clinical trials evaluating interventions to lower triglycerides or increase levels of HDL-C have been equivocal. Based on the data currently available, LDL-C remains the primary target for treatment. Ongoing clinical trials will help to answer the question of how low we should set our goals for lowering cholesterol in patients at risk.

### Guideline-directed low-density lipoprotein cholesterol management after acute ischemic stroke: findings from a national health care service [^112xUvja]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with ischemic stroke are at high risk for future cardiovascular events and should be treated intensively with lipid-modifying agents. Combination lipid-lowering therapies are often needed to achieve updated guideline-directed treatment goals. However, real-world data on intensification of lipid-lowering therapies and attainment of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets early after ischemic stroke are limited. We extracted data from the largest healthcare provider in Israel on patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke between January 2020 and February 2022. Included were 3,027 patients surviving ≥ 1 year after stroke, with documented LDL-C levels and lipid-lowering medications at 2 time periods (0 to 3 months and 6 to 12 months after discharge). Participants were classified according to preexisting stroke and/or coronary artery disease. The use of combination lipid-lowering therapy (ezetimibe and/or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [monoclonal antibodies] inhibitor plus statin) in the study population increased between the 2 timepoints from 3.6% to 5.1%, reaching 10.5% in those with previous coronary artery disease and stroke. LDL-C levels < 70 and < 55 mg/100 mL were attained by 42.3% and 22.9% of patients early after hospitalization, and in 49.5% and 27.1% during 6 to 12 months after hospitalization, respectively. Attainment of guideline-recommended LDL-C goals was higher in patients treated with combination lipid-lowering therapies and in those with preexisting cardiovascular disease. In conclusion, despite the advances in drug development and the availability of several mechanisms to lower cholesterol levels, the attainment of guideline-recommended LDL-C targets after acute ischemic stroke is suboptimal. Intensification of treatment with combination lipid-lowering therapies after hospitalization is uncommonly performed in clinical practice, even in those with preexisting cardiovascular disease.

### Strategies for primary and secondary stroke prevention [^111pEx9S]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Of the 55 million deaths that occur annually, 1 in 10 is attributable to stroke. As a consequence, cerebrovascular disease is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and stroke is among the most devastating consequences of vascular disease, causing long-term disability and incurring high personal, societal, and financial costs. However, stroke is a highly preventable disease in the majority of patients. The goal of stroke prevention strategies is to identify high-risk patients through the presence of modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors and to target these modifiable risk factors through the use of appropriate pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Clinical and epidemiologic studies point toward three major risk-reducing pharmacologic therapies that together may dramatically reduce stroke risk. First, landmark clinical trials have demonstrated that the reduction of blood pressure in persons at risk for cerebrovascular disease significantly reduces stroke risk. Second, ample evidence supports the use of antiplatelet therapy, such as aspirin, in patients at high risk for a cerebrovascular event. Third, an abundance of data suggests that lipid-lowering therapy with a statin reduces stroke risk in most moderate- to high-risk patients regardless of baseline cholesterol levels. Together, these data suggest that intensive therapy with agents from multiple drug classes that target two or more risk factors for cerebrovascular disease may provide additive-or even synergistic-reductions in stroke risk.

### Secondary prevention in patients with stroke versus myocardial infarction: analysis of 2 national cohorts [^112yNEDX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The primary finding of our study is that preventive therapy measures and goals in participants with a history of stroke are inadequately achieved in comparison to the participants with a history of MI. Analyzing data from 14 760 UKB participants, we identified that individuals with a history of MI demonstrated superior control of LDL, blood pressure, statin use, and antiplatelet use compared with their counterparts with stroke. These results were confirmed by another analysis including 7315 participants from the AoU, an ongoing study that has enrolled 370 000 Americans to date. There are significant public health implications for the inadequate management and control of vascular risk in stroke survivors and a missed opportunity for individual patients. The management of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, decreases the risk of stroke and systemic vascular event recurrence considerably. Therefore, our findings underscore the need for improved secondary prevention strategies for participants with stroke. Furthermore, we must understand the root causes that explain diminished use of secondary prevention strategies in stroke survivors compared with those with MI.

### Effect of coexisting vascular disease on long-term risk of recurrent events after TIA or stroke [^117TVjYB]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with TIA and ischemic stroke also have a substantial long-term risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiac death, and there is also increasing evidence that tighter control of cholesterol levels than the current guideline target (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] < 2.6 mmol/L) may be necessary, with randomized controlled trials of LDL reduction to < 1.8 mmol/L ongoing. Trials of new cholesterol-lowering therapies, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors, also focused on populations with stable cardiovascular disease and reported significant reductions in LDL cholesterol and in MI, as compared with placebo, in patients on high-dose statins with LDL level > 1.8 mmol/L. There was less evidence for a reduction in risk of ischemic stroke with PCSK-9 inhibitors, but dyslipidemia is estimated to account for a higher proportion of the risk of coronary events than of the risk of ischemic stroke. However, although PCSK-9 inhibitors reduced the relative risk of MI by 27% in the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trialand by 13% in the Randomized Evaluation of the Effects of Anacetrapib Through Lipid-modification (REVEAL) trial, the drugs are very costlyand may only be cost-effective in high-risk subgroups. The annual risk of MI was only 1%–2% in the trials, which is again lower than reported after TIA and ischemic stroke in patients with coexisting coronary or peripheral artery disease.

Given the potential that more intensive antithrombotic treatment or lipid-lowering might reduce the long-term risk of recurrent stroke and coronary events in patients with TIA or stroke with coexisting stable cardiovascular disease, we aimed to determine the prognosis of this subgroup on current standard preventive treatment for both recurrent ischemic events and for major bleeding. Up-to-date estimates of event rates will help clinicians assess potential benefits of more intensive treatment and facilitate the planning of future trials.

### Management of LDL-cholesterol after an acute coronary syndrome: key comparisons of the American and European clinical guidelines to the attention of the healthcare providers [^113UMQAo]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

2 SECONDARY PREVENTION RISK STRATIFICATION

2.1 General comments

In the European guideline, all patients with an ACS are classified as very high risk, whereas in American guideline, a patient with ACS must also have multiple high‐risk features or more than one previous atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event (Figure 3).

FIGURE 3
Differences in risk stratification for patients with acute coronary syndromes as recommended by the American guideline for the management of cholesterol and European guideline for the management of dyslipidaemias. 1, 2 ACS, acute coronary syndromes; ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CABG, coronary artery bypass graft; LDL‐C, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention

2.2 American perspectives

The 2018 ACC/AHA guideline defines patient management groups of risk with specific algorithms for treatment (Figure 2). Secondary prevention for ASCVD is indicated in patients with a history of ACS (unstable angina or MI), stable angina or coronary revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or peripheral artery disease including aortic aneurysm. Among the patients with established ASCVD, very high‐risk patients were defined by the presence of multiple major ASCVD events (recent ACS plus another event) or one major (recent ACS) and multiple high‐risk conditions (Figure 3).

2.3 European perspectives

The 2019 ESC guideline considers all patients with previous ACS (MI or unstable angina) as very high‐risk (Figure 3). Other patients with established ASCVD at very high‐risk included patients with stable angina, and those with previous documented coronary revascularization, stroke, TIA, or peripheral artery disease (Figure 1). 2

### A focused update to the 2019 NLA scientific statement on use of lipoprotein (a) in clinical practice [^1163C7X8]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

NLA focused update — Lp(a) screening and risk across populations: We recommend measuring Lp(a) in every adult at least once for cardiovascular risk assessment (see Table 1; COR I, LOE B-NR). The risk for ASCVD events that is associated with Lp(a) is independent of LDL-C and is attributed to the atherogenic, proinflammatory, and prothrombotic properties of Lp(a), and Lp(a) is associated with an increased risk of incident ASCVD even in the absence of a family history of heart disease. Systematic universal Lp(a) screening can improve health outcomes by increasing awareness of, and enabling precision in, ASCVD prevention strategies and individualization of therapy selection. Elevated Lp(a) remains a risk factor for ASCVD even with aggressive LDL-C lowering by statins and nonstatins (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors, bempedoic acid, and ezetimibe), and early, and more-intensive management of modifiable risk factors, including LDL-C and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels, is warranted in at-risk patients who have elevated Lp(a). This update also notes that elevated Lp(a) is not a risk factor for venous thromboembolism and that in the pediatric population (children < 18 years of age) elevation of Lp(a) has been linked to the occurrence of arterial ischemic stroke.

### Vascular quality of care assessment: clinicians' adherence to lipid-lowering therapy for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113LYtcN]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lipid-lowering medication can considerably lessen the risk for cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Despite well-publicized guidelines and the accessibility of effective therapies, many patients do not attain their lipid goals and remain at high cardiovascular risk. Guidelines recommend statins as first-line therapy to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in ASCVD. We aimed to analyze admission lipid levels in a broad contemporary population of patients with ASCVD attending a vascular clinic or admitted to an inpatient vascular unit.

Methods

Patients with known ASCVD, current cholesterol levels, and lipid-lowering medications were documented and compared with published current Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines recommendations for achieving < 2.0 mmol/L or > 50% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Cholesterol levels (current and previous), demographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, and medical therapy were assessed from available patient records.

Results

Two hundred eight adult patients were identified. The mean age of the patients was 72 (± 10) years, and 76% were men. About half had peripheral arterial disease (n = 118, 56.7%), one-third had coronary artery disease (n = 78, 37.5%), and one-third had diabetes (n = 76, 36.5%). Most were hypertensive (n = 140, 67.3%) and half gave a history of dyslipidemia (n = 103, 49.5%). Most patients (n = 183, 88%) were taking a statin and the majority at a moderate-intensity dose (n = 79, 43.2%) or high-intensity dose (n = 101, 55.2%). However, 32.7% of patients (n = 68) did not reach target of LDL-C level of < 2.0 mmol/L or had ≤ 50% reduction from the baseline level. Of the patients who did not reach goals, 7 (10.3%) did not fill their statin prescriptions in the last 3 months. Only 26 patients (12.5%) were also on ezetimibe, a guideline-recommended second-line therapy if targets are not reached with maximally tolerated statin therapy. One patient, who was able to reach target LDL-C, was on evolocumab monotherapy, a PCSK9 inhibitor, a contemporary nonstatin therapy that could be considered in ASCVD in those not at LDL-C goal. Of the 16 patients who were not prescribed any lipid-lowering therapy and did not reach target, 8 (50%) did not have any identified or documented reasons. Of the remaining 8 patients, 7 (87.5%) reported intolerance or side effects to statins only, and could benefit from nonstatin LDL-lowering therapy.

Conclusions

In this observational study, we established suboptimal adherence to guideline recommendations for statin therapy and hesitancy to use nonstatin LDL-lowering agents in high-risk patients with ASCVD. These treatment gaps have an enormous effect on achieving improved cardiovascular clinical outcomes and must be tackled.

### Achieving target cholesterol goals after stroke… [^115pPeaP]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Statin initiation during hospitalization for an ischemic cerebrovascular event is associated with high rates of adherence to treatment, lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and higher rates of achieving national cholesterol guidelines. For this study, inclusion criteria were that the patient was not receiving a statin at time of admission and that the patient had 1 of the following indications for statin initiation: acute cerebral ischemic event mechanism attributed to large-vessel atherosclerosis or intracranial branch atherosclerosis or lipohyalinosis. Data on fasting lipid panels comprising low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and non–HDL-C levels, as well as liver enzyme levels, were collected for each patient the morning after hospital admission and again at 3-month follow-up.

Values for each component of the cholesterol profiles were compared at baseline and follow-up for each patient by using a paired-samples t test. Categorical treatment goal values were compared by using logistic regression. Results were deemed significant at P <.
05. The study was approved by the local institutional review board. The national cholesterol treatment LDL-C goal of less than l00 mg/dL was achieved in 88% of patients at 3-month follow-up, a substantial increase compared with baseline. We also found that statin implementation in patients with stroke and TIA before hospital discharge was associated with a 35% reduction in LDL-C levels and a substantial improvement in the proportion of patients achieving target national guideline LDL-C goals 3 months after hospitalization.

Similarly, at follow-up, we noted that the non–HDL-C level, which is a secondary cholesterol goal in persons at high risk of vascular disease, 2 also was reduced significantly. A major limitation of this study is the lack of a control group of patients who did not receive in-hospital statin treatment. However, results from a recent study in patients discharged from the hospital without lipid-lowering treatment after acute ischemic stroke indicated an increase in LDL-C levels from baseline to 3 months. 10 This finding may suggest that the significant reduction in LDL-C levels observed in our study likely was caused by statin initiation.

### Small reduction in cardiovascular outcome after ischemic stroke… [^111bFtpr]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does a lower low-density lipoprotein target following ischemic stroke reduce the likelihood of major adverse cardiovascular events. Bottom Line A lower LDL target slightly reduced the likelihood of a broad composite outcome, largely by reducing nonfatal strokes. The benefit was seen only in patients whose index event was a stroke; risk may be increased in those with transient ischemic attack. They also had an LDL level greater than 100 mg per dL if not taking a statin or greater than 70 mg per dL if already taking a statin. The 2, 860 patients were then randomized to an LDL target of 70 mg per dL or an LDL target of 90 to 110 mg per dL using any type or dose of statin preferred by their physicians.

The total number of patients recruited was less than the authors' stated target of 3, 786. The included patients were followed for a median of
5. 3 years in France but only 2. 0 years in South Korea. The mean age of participants was 67 years, 67% were men, 64% had hypertension, and their baseline LDL level was 135 mg per dL with approximately one-half already taking a statin. Groups were balanced, and analysis was by intention to treat. The patients hit their mean LDL targets: 65 mg per dL in the low target group and 96 mg per dL in the higher target group. The authors had a broad primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or urgent coronary or carotid revascularization, which was lower in the low LDL target group (8. 5% vs.
10. 9%;. Editor's Note: Dr.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in adults with coronary artery disease in the US… [^113VZ6C2]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Primary outcomes were the percentages of participants not achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at guideline-recommended goals, defined as at least 70 mg/dL and at least 55 mg/dL. 1, 2 We also evaluated the percentage of participants not achieving LDL-C levels at higher thresholds, including at least 100 mg/dL and at least 130 mg/dL. In secondary analyses, we evaluated the percentage of participants who did not meet LDL-C guideline goals among those receiving and not receiving statin therapy. We could not evaluate participants receiving both statin and ezetimibe therapy due to limited sample size. Medication use was based on adults showing the interviewer all prescription medications taken or self-report. Among adults reporting CAD not receiving statin therapy, 10. 9% were receiving ezetimibe.

The age-adjusted mean LDL-C level was 120. 4 mg/dL, with
91. 0% having an LDL-C level greater than or equal to 70 mg/dL and 98. 2% having an LDL-C level greater than or equal to 55 mg/dL. The percentages of participants not achieving higher LDL-C thresholds are shown in the Figure. Achievement of guideline-directed targets for LDL-C among adults with reported CAD was low, with almost 3 in 4 participants not meeting ACC/AHA guideline targets and 9 in 10 not meeting ESC guideline targets. Rates of statin use in adults with reported CAD were suboptimal. Even among adults receiving statins, rates of achieving guideline goals for LDL-C were low. This is concerning because evidence suggests LDL-C levels are improving in the overall population.

4 Factors contributing to low rates of attaining guideline goals may include inadequate statin treatment intensification, 5 insufficient add-on therapy use, and low use of novel therapies. 6 Low rates of statin use and intensification may relate to prescriber or patient hesitation.

### AHA and ASA release guideline for prevention of future… [^113nQH4h]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

- Statin therapy is recommended in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who have a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 100 mg per dL or greater with or without evidence of other arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of less than 100 mg per dL even with no evidence of other arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
- Starting aspirin and clopidogrel might be considered within 24 hours of a stroke or TIA and continued for 90 days.
- Obesity screening, increased physical activity, reduced sodium intake, and a Mediterranean diet are reasonable for patients willing to participate. From the AFP Editors. The American Heart Association and American Stroke Association have updated their guideline on prevention of future stroke in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Currently, the average annual rate of future stroke in these patients is at a historic low.

This is a result of new approaches and improvement of existing approaches to treating these patients. The following recommendations are new or substantially revised from the previous AHA/ASA guideline. Recommendations HYPERTENSION Blood pressure therapy should be initiated in previously untreated patients with stroke or TIA if, after the first few days, blood pressure is 140 mm Hg systolic or greater, or 90 mm Hg diastolic or greater. Resumption of treatment is recommended for previously treated patients with known hypertension in the first several days after stroke or TIA. The target blood pressure is unclear and should be individualized. However, it is reasonable to keep blood pressure below 140 mm Hg systolic and 90 mm Hg diastolic. In patients with a recent lacunar stroke, a target of less than 130 mm Hg may be reasonable.

DYSLIPIDEMIA Statin therapy with intensive lipid-lowering effects is recommended in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA thought to be of atherosclerotic origin who have a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 100 mg per dL or greater with or without evidence of other arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Statin therapy is also recommended in those who have a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of less than 100 mg per dL and no evidence of other arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

### LDL cholesterol levels: is lower always better? [^114vHvnZ]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels attained by therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors have provided primary and secondary prevention of coronary events. The justification for targeting LDL cholesterol to its lowest possible level, however, is less clearly evidence-based. There is significant epidemiologic evidence indicating that the relationship between levels of total or LDL cholesterol and risk for coronary artery disease is curvilinear, or log-linear. Thus, in most persons with normal or mildly elevated serum cholesterol levels, lipid-lowering therapies are likely to produce progressively less benefit in terms of reducing the rate of coronary events. Jacobson reviewed the argument that "the lower the better" is appropriate in cholesterol treatment in patients with or without baseline coronary artery disease.

The three landmark trials that established the secondary preventive value of lipid reduction, the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events trial and the Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease study, tested statins in patients with previous myocardial infarction. These trials provide evidence supporting the institution of therapy with these agents even when the cholesterol level is not markedly elevated. Subgroup analysis, however, shows diminishing absolute reductions in the risk for recurrent coronary artery disease in patients with initially lower cholesterol levels. In primary prevention of coronary vascular disease, two major studies, the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study and the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention study, also demonstrated that lowering the LDL cholesterol level by more than 24 percent or doubling the statin dosage did not further diminish risk.

The data in these studies are also compatible with the curvilinear relationship between LDL cholesterol level and coronary artery disease risk. The Second Joint Task Force of European and other Societies on Coronary Prevention established a target LDL cholesterol level of 115 mg per L. Patients at the absolute highest risk for coronary heart disease with nonlipid risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and smoking should be targeted for treatment. The author concludes that evidence seems to contradict the "lower is better" argument for LDL cholesterol management. Special populations such as persons with diabetes may be exceptions and, according to the new American Diabetes Association guidelines, the target LDL cholesterol level for patients with diabetes is 100 mg per L or less, regardless of whether the patient has evidence of coronary artery disease.
