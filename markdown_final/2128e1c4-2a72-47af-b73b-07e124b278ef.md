## Question

How could inherited RBC Disorders Panel effect patient care?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how an inherited red blood cell (RBC) Disorders next‑generation sequencing (NGS) panel could affect patient care by improving diagnosis, management, counseling, and health system performance across this heterogeneous group of conditions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical challenge and diagnostic delays in inherited RBC disorders. Then, I should define what a clinical‑grade NGS panel entails and how it is validated. Next, I will assess diagnostic yield and precision advantages over conventional testing. After that, I will translate molecular diagnoses into concrete management changes, including transfusion planning, splenectomy decisions, and disease‑specific therapies. I will then consider family screening and reproductive counseling, system efficiency and feasibility, genotype‑specific surveillance, and finally limitations and implementation requirements, making sure to verify points against high‑quality guidelines and studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical challenge. Inherited RBC disorders are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous and can present with overlapping hemolytic features, so conventional stepwise diagnostics — electrophoresis, enzyme assays, membrane testing — often stretch over months to years and require specialist laboratories; this contributes to delays, misclassification, and inappropriate interventions such as ill‑advised splenectomy in certain membranopathies, so I need to emphasize that diagnostic uncertainty is not trivial and has management consequences [^111z6yPq] [^111H77xK]. Wait, let me verify the timeline claim; reports suggest protracted pathways and potential multi‑year delays in congenital anemia workups prior to NGS, though some of these estimates come from lower‑credibility cohort reports and should be interpreted cautiously [^115RTLeK].

> Now, I should define the technical solution precisely. A clinical‑grade inherited RBC Disorders Panel simultaneously interrogates dozens of causal genes with validated analytic sensitivity and safeguards against false negatives via base‑level coverage assessment; for example, one 33‑gene panel reported 100% specificity and 99.7% sensitivity with an open‑source coverage tool to distinguish true negatives from undercovered loci, and a 28‑gene panel spanning coding, splice, deep intronic, and regulatory regions enabled high‑throughput diagnosis where routine tests were indeterminate; I should confirm broader clinical NGS validation data also show near‑complete concordance with Sanger for single‑nucleotide and small indel detection to support clinical adoption [^114fCnpP] [^111H77xK]. Hold on, I should verify platform performance across diseases; cross‑disease laboratory validations demonstrate feasibility and high analytic accuracy for targeted panels in clinical labs, which supports translatability to RBC indications when coupled with rigorous coverage analytics [^111fKLq1].

> Next, I will examine diagnostic impact and precision. Targeted panels have increased yield across multiple inherited hematology contexts; for instance, a pediatric IBMFS panel delivered 7.8% definitive diagnoses and 3.7% alternate diagnoses while flagging secondary cancer‑predisposition findings, and real‑world HHA panel programs analyzing approximately 2000 individuals underscore clinical utility in routine referrals; smaller RBC anemia panels have reported yields near 39% in selected cohorts, but I should note these are lower‑credibility reports and may overestimate yield due to referral bias [^1135ftir] [^111WUkxf]. But wait, what if hemoglobinopathy phenotypes are confounded by coinheritance; in such cases molecular testing resolves masked genotypes — such as α‑thalassemia with concurrent β‑thalassemia — beyond the limits of protein‑based methods, supporting the role of DNA testing when routine studies are inconclusive or complex [^113VNYBf] [^112Ggkrj].

> I will now translate molecular diagnoses into transfusion management. Extended RBC antigen matching is recommended for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia — specifically ABO, RhDCcEe, and K — regardless of existing alloantibodies, and molecular information assists in selecting antigen‑negative units and identifying high‑risk patients; however, I need to check the certainty of evidence because the updated guideline acknowledges observational evidence with moderate‑to‑critical bias and highlights research gaps, so recommendations are graded with caution, especially outside high‑resource settings where donor–recipient antigen disparities and infrastructure constraints limit feasibility [^113WVens] [^112eTvRt]. Hold on, I should verify complementary cautions; additional guideline commentary reiterates heterogeneity of studies, the need for better comparative data, and the reality that alloantibodies can still form despite extended matching, emphasizing patient education, data sharing, and pragmatic adaptation to regional donor pools [^112DLHSX] [^113BuwBK].

> Let me consider surgical decision‑making next. Molecular confirmation in membranopathies prevents missteps; for example, splenectomy is contraindicated in hereditary stomatocytosis due to thrombotic risk, and in hereditary spherocytosis the benefit is not universal, so genotyping and careful phenotype correlation are essential before proceeding; I should double‑check that contemporary reviews explicitly caution against a one‑size‑fits‑all surgical approach [^111z6yPq] [^114T4r7Z].

> Treatment selection should also be genotype‑informed. In pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, expert guidelines recommend individualized decisions regarding supportive care, splenectomy, and consideration of disease‑modifying or curative options based on genotype–phenotype correlations and disease burden; in Diamond‑Blackfan anemia, early molecular confirmation can steer timing and selection of transfusions versus glucocorticoids in infants and identify candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, although I should acknowledge these DBA management data are largely consensus‑based and observational [^111fw121] [^115LiKCG]. Next, I should review bone marrow failure interfaces; comprehensive panels help distinguish IBMFS from immune‑mediated aplastic anemia, inform surveillance and transplant planning, and should be integrated promptly without delaying urgent therapy when clinical features point to acquired severe aplastic anemia [^1129fDRy] [^1174vjkM].

> Family screening and reproductive counseling follow logically. For hemoglobinopathies, best‑practice guidance emphasizes initial hematologic/biochemical carrier detection with DNA analysis for complex cases, followed by options such as preimplantation genetic diagnosis or conventional prenatal diagnosis once parental variants are characterized; non‑invasive prenatal diagnosis for monogenic disorders is now an accredited clinical service in some regions and avoids invasive risks; newborn screening coupled with targeted genetic counseling improves parental knowledge and reduces anxiety, and molecular results allow cascade testing in families at risk [^115W24Xp] [^113fJCeQ]. I should confirm broader screening recommendations; national and specialty guidelines support structured antenatal and newborn screening pathways for significant hemoglobinopathies with timely laboratory reporting and appropriate referral for counseling [^112Ggkrj].

> I should not overlook long‑term surveillance and modifier biology. Certain genotypes confer specific risks requiring proactive monitoring, such as iron overload in hereditary xerocytosis amenable to surveillance and chelation; IBMFS testing can unmask germline predisposition to hematologic malignancy, prompting tailored surveillance; and coinheritance of non‑hemoglobin RBC disorders like PKLR deficiency or hereditary spherocytosis can exacerbate complications even in sickle cell trait, necessitating more vigilant monitoring and counseling about exertional, renal, and thrombotic risks [^111z6yPq] [^1135ftir]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should verify trait counseling; authoritative reviews confirm clinically meaningful risks in sickle cell trait that modify standard counseling recommendations [^114ZweUo] [^111XLQE3].

> Next, I should review health system efficiency and feasibility. By consolidating numerous sequential tests into a single assay, targeted NGS can shorten diagnostic odysseys and reduce repeat investigations when phenotyping is indeterminate, with laboratory validations and real‑world programs demonstrating scalable implementation; however, I need to ensure we do not overstate cost‑effectiveness, as formal health‑economic analyses remain limited and context‑dependent across health systems, especially where blood bank genotyping and extended matching are constrained by resources [^111fKLq1] [^111H77xK]. Hold on, I should verify global applicability; guidelines addressing transfusion support in low‑ and lower‑middle‑income countries emphasize pragmatic strategies given donor–recipient antigen disparities, limited supplies, and testing infrastructure, which should temper universal prescriptions for extended matching and underscore the triage value of molecular diagnosis for prioritizing scarce resources [^113axe6v].

> But wait, I need to ensure limitations and implementation requirements are explicit. Targeted panels must document coverage and analytical performance to avoid false negatives, and interpretation demands rigorous phenotype correlation to resolve variants of uncertain significance; for hemoglobinopathies, initial screening should still use hematology/biochemistry with DNA testing reserved for complex or confirmatory scenarios; ancestry‑specific allele frequencies and population structure can influence variant interpretation and penetrance estimates, and persistent diagnostic gaps due to noncoding or structural variants support periodic panel updates or escalation to exome/genome, especially in disorders like DBA where noncoding pathogenic variants account for a sizable undiagnosed fraction [^111z6yPq] [^112Ggkrj]. I should double‑check supporting genomics data; large multi‑ancestry WGS resources reveal ancestry‑skewed RBC trait variants, and case reports now highlight noncoding etiologies detectable only with genome‑scale methods, reinforcing the need for evolving test menus and expert multidisciplinary review networks for rare anemias [^117KJQxg] [^116uiWfg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about replacing first‑line phenotyping; at first I almost concluded that NGS should precede conventional testing in all suspected hemoglobinopathies, but I should correct that stance — best‑practice guidance still recommends hematologic and biochemical screening as the initial approach, with DNA analysis used for complex, indeterminate, or confirmatory purposes, while in non‑hemoglobin RBC disorders and IBMFS a lower threshold for early NGS is reasonable given the breadth of implicated genes and overlapping phenotypes [^115W24Xp] [^1135ftir].

> In sum, I need to ensure the conclusion reflects both promise and pragmatism. A clinically validated inherited RBC Disorders NGS panel meaningfully increases diagnostic precision, accelerates time to answer, and delivers actionable information that shapes transfusion strategies, averts harmful procedures, guides disease‑specific therapy, enables reproductive planning, and tailors surveillance to genotype‑defined risks; these benefits are maximized when panels are analytically robust, results are interpreted in multidisciplinary context, and testing is integrated thoughtfully with phenotype‑driven algorithms and regional resource realities [^111H77xK] [^1135ftir].

Inherited RBC Disorders Panels improve patient care by enabling early, accurate diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, and enzymopathies, supporting targeted management and reducing diagnostic delays [^111H77xK]. They guide individualized transfusion strategies, including extended antigen matching, to reduce alloimmunization and transfusion reactions [^112eTvRt] [^113WVens]. Panels also inform genetic counseling, carrier detection [^1133XZGx], and reproductive planning [^112Ggkrj] and help avoid unnecessary treatments, such as inappropriate splenectomy or iron therapy [^111z6yPq]. Overall, they enable earlier intervention, prevent complications, and improve quality of life [^114fCnpP] [^111fw121].

---

## Early and accurate diagnosis

Diagnostic precision improves as panels provide rapid, accurate molecular diagnoses [^111H77xK] for hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, and enzymopathies, reducing reliance on sequential, inconclusive tests [^111WUkxf]. Reduced diagnostic delay results from **early molecular diagnosis**, which shortens diagnostic odysseys and enables timely intervention while helping prevent complications [^114fCnpP] [^115RTLeK].

---

## Personalized treatment strategies

Targeted therapy is feasible because molecular diagnosis enables **individualized management** [^114fCnpP], including tailored transfusion regimens, iron chelation, and consideration of curative options such as HSCT or gene therapy [^111fw121]. Avoidance of inappropriate treatments is achieved through **accurate diagnosis**, which prevents unnecessary interventions — such as inappropriate splenectomy [^114T4r7Z] or iron therapy — and reduces patient harm and healthcare costs [^111z6yPq].

---

## Improved transfusion management

Extended antigen matching is guided by panels to include **ABO, RhDCcEe, and Kell** [^112eTvRt] for patients with hemoglobinopathies, reducing alloimmunization and transfusion reactions [^113WVens]. This approach **reduces alloimmunization** by lowering risk and improving transfusion safety and outcomes [^112DLHSX].

---

## Genetic counseling and family planning

Panels enable **carrier detection**, supporting informed reproductive decisions and prenatal diagnosis [^1133XZGx] [^112Ggkrj]. Additionally, **family screening** through genetic counseling identifies at-risk relatives, supporting early intervention and prevention [^113XiqeW].

---

## Prevention of complications

Early intervention is possible because early diagnosis and targeted management can **prevent complications** such as iron overload [^111z6yPq], organ damage, and hemolytic crises [^111fw121]. Panels also guide **monitoring and surveillance** strategies, enabling timely detection and management of complications [^116ApezM].

---

## Cost-effectiveness and healthcare resource utilization

Reduced healthcare costs result from early diagnosis and targeted management, which decrease hospitalizations, transfusions, and complications, thereby improving **resource utilization** [^111H77xK]. Furthermore, **efficient diagnostic pathways** are achieved as panels streamline testing [^114fCnpP], reducing unnecessary tests and procedures [^115RTLeK].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Variants of uncertain significance (VUS)**: Panels may identify VUS, requiring careful interpretation and counseling [^111z6yPq] [^117VA6gv].

- **Ethical considerations**: Genetic testing raises ethical issues, including informed consent, privacy, and potential discrimination [^113fJCeQ].

- **Access and equity**: Limited access to genetic testing and counseling services may exacerbate healthcare disparities [^113axe6v].

### A novel 33-gene targeted resequencing panel provides accurate, clinical-grade diagnosis and improves patient management for rare inherited anaemias [^114fCnpP]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of rare inherited anaemias is challenging, requiring a series of complex and expensive laboratory tests. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been used to investigate these disorders, but the selection of genes on individual panels has been narrow, and the validation strategies used have fallen short of the standards required for clinical use. Clinical-grade validation of negative results requires the test to distinguish between lack of adequate sequencing reads at the locations of known mutations and a real absence of mutations.

To achieve a clinically reliable diagnostic test and minimize false-negative results, we developed an open-source tool (CoverMi) to accurately determine base coverage and the 'discoverability' of known mutations for every sample. We validated our 33-gene panel using Sanger sequencing and microarray. Our panel demonstrated 100% specificity and 99.7% sensitivity. We then analysed 57 clinical samples: molecular diagnoses were made in 22 out of 57 (38.6%), corresponding to 32 mutations, of which 16 were new. In all cases, accurate molecular diagnosis had a positive impact on clinical management.

Using a validated NGS-based platform for routine molecular diagnosis of previously undiagnosed congenital anaemias is feasible in a clinical diagnostic setting. It improves precise diagnosis and enhances management and counselling of the patient and their family.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: An updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^113WVens]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) antigen matching beyond ABO and RhD is commonly recommended for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassaemia. We present an updated systematic literature review to inform evidence‐based guidelines on RBC matching. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool was used to develop recommendations.

Six new observational studies (four prospective, two retrospective) were identified. The six studies reported on 583 patients in total, including cross‐over designs, with sample sizes from 10 to 343. Studies were heterogeneous, utilizing varying degrees of RBC matching and different definitions for 'extended' matching. All reported on alloimmunisation. One study reported on molecular matching. The reported prevalence of alloimmunisation using limited matching was 0%–50% and with extended matching was 0%–24%. Eighty‐two patients were alloimmunised before study entry. The risk of bias across studies was moderate to critical.

The guideline panel recommends that ABO, RhDCcEe, and K‐compatible RBCs are selected for individuals with SCD and thalassaemia, even in the absence of alloantibodies, and that RBCs which are antigen‐negative to already existing clinically significant antibodies are chosen. There is a need for comparative research to define the benefit, impact, cost‐effectiveness, and feasibility of extended RBC matching strategies to prevent alloimmunisation.

### Diagnosis and clinical management of red cell membrane disorders [^111z6yPq]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). High credibility.

Heterogeneous red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders and hydration defects often present with the common clinical findings of hemolytic anemia, but they may require substantially different management based on their pathophysiology. An accurate and timely diagnosis is essential to avoid inappropriate interventions and prevent complications. Advances in genetic testing availability within the last decade, combined with extensive foundational knowledge on RBC membrane structure and function, now facilitate the correct diagnosis in patients with a variety of hereditary hemolytic anemias (HHAs). Studies in patient cohorts with well-defined genetic diagnoses have revealed complications such as iron overload in hereditary xerocytosis, which is amenable to monitoring, prevention, and treatment, and demonstrated that splenectomy is not always an effective or safe treatment for any patient with HHA. However, a multitude of variants of unknown clinical significance have been discovered by genetic evaluation, requiring interpretation by thorough phenotypic assessment in clinical and/or research laboratories.

Here we discuss genotype-phenotype correlations and corresponding clinical management in patients with RBC membranopathies and propose an algorithm for the laboratory workup of patients presenting with symptoms and signs of hemolytic anemia, with a clinical case that exemplifies such a workup.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^1133XZGx]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Within the context of managing the health burden of the haemoglobinopathies, laboratory diagnosis plays a key role, identifying carrier couples and offering them reproductive choices. Haemoglobinopathies are unique among all genetic diseases in that detection of carriers is possible by haematological and biochemical tests rather than DNA analysis. Thus, it is recommended that, with currently available technologies, carrier detection should be mandatory using haematological and biochemical tests. However, DNA analysis should be employed for the determination of carrier status in complex cases or when the haematological/biochemical results are unclear.

Depending on acceptable practices in each society, at-risk couples can then be offered the reproductive choice to avoid the birth of affected children, or helped to prepare for the possible birth of a severely affected child. Among the available options to avoid having affected children are, before marriage, a change in partner choice; or, after marriage, by remaining childless, opting for gamete donation, or adoption. However, couples rarely take these options. Instead, it is more common for at-risk couples to avoid the birth of an affected child by opting for a conventional prenatal diagnosis in early pregnancy, or before pregnancy by choosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Both conventional prenatal diagnosis and PGD involve prior variant characterization in the parents and subsequent fetal (or embryo) DNA analysis. Thus, genetic services for haemoglobinopathies require close collaboration.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, specifically concerning genetic testing, the EASL 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining genetic testing for hemochromatosis. This should occur after informed consent for genetic testing has been acquired in adult patients with a positive family history of first-degree relatives with hemochromatosis.

### Delivering an accredited non-invasive prenatal diagnosis service for monogenic disorders and recommendations for best practice [^113fJCeQ]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2018). High credibility.

The identification of cell-free fetal DNA circulating in maternal blood, combined with technological developments — particularly next-generation sequencing — is enabling the development of safer prenatal diagnosis. While this technology has been widely applied as a highly sensitive screening test for aneuploidy, there has been relatively little clinical application for the diagnosis of monogenic disorders.

In the UK, we have established non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) as a clinical service for a range of inherited disorders. The results from NIPD do not require confirmation by invasive testing and are welcomed by patients and health professionals alike. Here, we describe the technical approaches used and outline recommendations for best practice when delivering an NIPD service from an accredited laboratory.

### Red cell membrane disorders: Structure meets function [^114Qx2xX]. Blood (2020). High credibility.

The mature red blood cell (RBC) lacks a nucleus and organelles characteristic of most cells, yet it is elegantly structured to perform the essential function of delivering oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from all other cells while enduring the shear stress imposed by navigating small vessels and sinusoids. Over the past several decades, efforts by biochemists, cell and molecular biologists, and hematologists have increased appreciation for the complexity of RBC membrane structure. Studies of RBC membrane disorders have offered valuable insights into structure-function relationships.

Within the last decade, advances in genetic testing and its increased availability have significantly built upon this foundational knowledge. Although disorders of the RBC membrane due to altered structural organization or altered transport function are heterogeneous, they often present with common clinical findings of hemolytic anemia. However, they may require substantially different management depending on the underlying pathophysiology. Accurate diagnosis is essential to avoid the emergence of complications or inappropriate interventions.

We propose an algorithm for laboratory evaluation of patients presenting with symptoms and signs of hemolytic anemia, focusing on RBC membrane disorders. Here, we review the genotypic and phenotypic variability of RBC membrane disorders to raise the index of suspicion and highlight the need for correct and timely diagnosis.

### Clinical experience with multigene carrier panels in the reproductive setting [^111qgmXn]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2018). Low credibility.

This retrospective study comprises the experience of one commercial laboratory. Indications for testing were not evaluated, and some patients may have been tested due to family history, resulting in a higher likelihood of a positive result. Business factors, such as increased sales in certain geographic regions, may shift the demographic characteristics of the tested population and skew the view of ordering patterns. This laboratory experience was limited to samples tested within the United States, and there may be limited ability to generalize findings to other countries.

Positivity rates are impacted by detection rates, and like all carrier testing panels, detection rates are not uniform across all diseases tested. The assay used for this study is not diagnostic, and follow‐up information was not collected. Specifically, some positive hemoglobinopathy evaluations may have been due to iron deficiency anemia and not alpha‐thalassemia trait status. Therefore, it cannot be stated with certainty that all patients with positive hemoglobinopathy results were true carriers. However, they were treated as at risk since follow‐up testing to further define their carrier status was recommended. This supports the conclusion that increased clinical support and education should be a consideration when choosing panel testing.

While population‐based carrier testing for some diseases has been a routine part of prenatal care since the 1970s, the increasing use of expanded carrier testing panels and the latest carrier testing recommendations by ACOG are driving further developments.

### Uncovering the genetic etiology of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes using a custom-designed next-generation sequencing panel [^1135ftir]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2024). High credibility.

Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) are a group of heterogeneous disorders that account for approximately 30% of pediatric cases of bone marrow failure and are often associated with developmental abnormalities and cancer predisposition. This article reports the laboratory validation and clinical utility of a large-scale, custom-designed next-generation sequencing panel, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) IBMFS panel, for the diagnosis of IBMFS in a cohort of pediatric patients. This panel demonstrated excellent analytic accuracy, with 100% sensitivity, ≥ 99.99% specificity, and 100% reproducibility on validation samples.

In 269 patients with suspected IBMFS, this next-generation sequencing panel was used for identifying single-nucleotide variants, small insertions/deletions, and copy number variations in mosaic or nonmosaic status. Sixty-one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (54 single-nucleotide variants/insertions/deletions and 7 copy number variations) and 24 hypomorphic variants were identified, resulting in the molecular diagnosis of IBMFS in 21 cases (7.8%) and exclusion of IBMFS with a diagnosis of a blood disorder in 10 cases (3.7%). Secondary findings, including evidence of early hematologic malignancies and other hereditary cancer-predisposition syndromes, were observed in 9 cases (3.3%).

The CHOP IBMFS panel was highly sensitive and specific, with a significant increase in the diagnostic yield of IBMFS. These findings suggest that next-generation sequencing-based panel testing should be a part of routine diagnostics in patients with suspected IBMFS.

### Significant haemoglobinopathies: A guideline for screening and diagnosis: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^112Ggkrj]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Antenatal screening/testing of pregnant women should be conducted according to the guidelines of the National Health Service (NHS) Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Screening Programme. Newborn screening, along with necessary follow-up testing and referral, should adhere to these guidelines. All babies under one year of age arriving in the United Kingdom should be offered screening for sickle cell disease (SCD).

Preoperative screening for SCD should be performed in patients from ethnic groups with a significant prevalence of the condition. Emergency screening using a sickle solubility test must always be followed by definitive analysis. Laboratories performing antenatal screening should utilize methods capable of detecting significant variants and quantitating haemoglobins A2 and F, in accordance with the cut-off points required by the national antenatal screening programme. The laboratory must ensure that a provisional report is available for antenatal patients within three working days from sample receipt.

### Improving diagnostic precision, care and syndrome definitions using comprehensive next-generation sequencing for the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes [^116R9gQZ]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Phenotypic overlap among the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFSs) frequently limits the ability to establish a diagnosis based solely on clinical features. Over 70 IBMFS genes have been identified, which often renders genetic testing prolonged and costly. Since correct diagnosis, treatment, and cancer surveillance often depend on identifying the mutated gene, strategies that enable timely genotyping are essential.

- **Methods**: To overcome these challenges, we developed a next-generation sequencing assay to analyse a panel of 72 known IBMFS genes. Cases fulfilling the clinical diagnostic criteria of an IBMFS but without identified causal genotypes were included.

- **Results**: The assay was validated by detecting 52 variants previously found by Sanger sequencing. A total of 158 patients with unknown mutations were studied. Of 75 patients with known IBMFS categories (e.g. Fanconi anaemia), 59% had causal mutations. Among 83 patients with unclassified IBMFSs, we found causal mutations and established the diagnosis in 18% of the patients. The assay detected mutant genes that had not previously been reported to be associated with the patient phenotypes. In other cases, the assay led to amendments of diagnoses. In 20% of genotype cases, the results indicated a cancer surveillance programme.

- **Conclusions**: The novel assay is efficient, accurate, and has a major impact on patient care.

### Clinical validation of targeted next-generation sequencing for inherited disorders [^111fKLq1]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Although next-generation sequencing (NGS) can revolutionize molecular diagnostics, several hurdles remain in the implementation of this technology in clinical laboratories. This study aimed to validate and implement an NGS panel for the genetic diagnosis of more than 100 inherited diseases. These include neurologic conditions, congenital hearing loss and eye disorders, developmental disorders, nonmalignant diseases treated by hematopoietic cell transplantation, familial cancers, connective tissue disorders, metabolic disorders, disorders of sexual development, and cardiac disorders. The diagnostic gene panels ranged from 1 to 54 genes, with most panels containing 10 genes or fewer.

We used a liquid hybridization-based, target-enrichment strategy to enrich 10,067 exons in 568 genes, followed by NGS using a HiSeq 2000 sequencing system (Illumina, San Diego, California). We successfully sequenced 97.6% (9,825 of 10,067) of the targeted exons, obtaining a minimum coverage of 20× at all bases. There was a demonstrated 100% concordance in detecting 19 pathogenic single-nucleotide variations and 11 pathogenic insertion-deletion mutations ranging in size from 1 to 18 base pairs across 18 samples that were previously characterized by Sanger sequencing. Using four pairs of blinded, duplicate samples, we demonstrated a high degree of concordance (> 99%) among the blinded, duplicate pairs.

We have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using the NGS platform to multiplex genetic tests for several rare diseases and the use of cloud computing for bioinformatics analysis.

### Lessons learnt in the screening and diagnosis of haemoglobinopathies [^115cx8aM]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Low credibility.

For this paper, cases reported formally and anecdotally to the authors in their screening and diagnostic roles have been selected to demonstrate areas where errors have occurred, and caution should be exercised. The cases demonstrate that it is vital that the performance and limitations of the techniques used, along with the phenotypic presentation of cases where haemoglobin variants and/or thalassaemias are coinherited, are understood by those performing result interpretation. Those who deliver the service, as well as those who receive reports and give results and counselling, should be aware of the complexity of the topic.

### The current state of sickle cell trait: Implications for reproductive and genetic counseling [^114ZweUo]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). High credibility.

Sickle cell trait (SCT) is unique among the carrier states identified during newborn screening. Unlike other heterozygous states for rare recessive diseases, SCT is exceedingly prevalent throughout various regions worldwide, making sickle cell disease one of the most common monogenetic diseases. Because of this high frequency, reproductive counseling is of paramount importance.

In addition, unlike other carrier states, SCT appears to be a risk factor for several clinical complications, such as extreme exertional injury, chronic kidney disease, and venous thromboembolism. Increasing knowledge about these clinical outcomes can help inform genetic counseling recommendations. Expanding research and clinical efforts are necessary to ensure that the promises of modern and precision medicine are delivered to the millions of SCT carriers and their children.

### Managing sickle cell disease and related complications in pregnancy: Results of an international Delphi panel [^111j33QU]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Panelists were not aligned on the hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit levels to target when recommending prophylactic transfusion therapy for a pregnant patient with sickle cell disease (SCD). Consensus was reached on a pretransfusion target with 9 out of 12 panelists (75.0%) agreeing. While 8 out of 12 panelists (66.7%) would not choose automated red blood cell exchange (aRBCx) over simple transfusion (ST) and modified/partial RBC exchange (mRBCx) to prevent alloimmunization, assuming the same method of RBC phenotyping/genotyping, consensus was not reached.

Consensus was reached on recommending sickle trait-negative blood products (10 out of 12, 83.3%) and leukocyte-reduced (pre-storage) blood products (9 out of 12, 75.0%) for pregnant individuals with SCD. For prophylactic transfusions, most panelists (10 of 12, 83.3%) would recommend peripheral venous access whenever possible. Consensus (9 out of 12, 75.0%) was also reached that even if venous access is difficult, the same transfusion modality would be recommended using different access; none of the panelists would change their decision to recommend transfusion in this case.

Most panelists (9 out of 12, 75.0%) believed that…

### Modified Delphi panel consensus recommendations for management of severe aplastic anemia [^113ggeWF]. Blood Advances (2024).

We recommend obtaining PNH flow cytometry and single-nucleotide polymorphism array genetic testing for chromosome arm 6p loss of heterozygosity clone, because both of these findings are highly predictive of the diagnosis of immune-mediated AA and can be helpful for exclusion of an IBMF. PNH granulocyte clones of > 1% have ∼100% positive predictive value for AA, whereas PNH granulocyte clones of > 0.1% were estimated to have 95% specificity and a 91% positive predictive value for the diagnosis of AA. In contrast, rare PNH-like cells and PNH populations of < 0.1% are less specific and have been observed in patients with confirmed IBMF.

- **Testing for IBMF**: In patients aged ≤ 40 years, we recommend chromosome breakage analysis for Fanconi anemia (FA) and telomere length analysis for telomere biology disorders, two of the most common groups of IBMFs. In patients aged 41 to 60 years, these tests can be considered depending on individual patient circumstances, family history, or clinical presentation. Germ line genetic testing is warranted in patients with a high index of suspicion for an IBMF. These include patients who have a clinical diagnosis of FA based on a positive chromosome breakage test and patients that have a high clinical suspicion of FA but have a negative chromosome breakage test. An estimated 10% to 25% of patients with FA have somatic reversion mosaicism and have a less severe hematologic presentation; these patients may be missed because of a false-negative chromosome breakage test on peripheral blood lymphocytes and require further testing.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary spherocytosis [^114T4r7Z]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with regard to clinical severity, protein defects, and mode of inheritance. It is relatively common in Caucasian populations; most affected individuals have mild or only moderate haemolysis. There is usually a family history and a typical clinical and laboratory picture, so the diagnosis is often easily made without additional laboratory tests.

Atypical cases may require measurement of erythrocyte membrane proteins to clarify the nature of the membrane disorder. In the absence of a family history, occasionally, molecular genetic analysis will help determine whether inheritance is recessive or non-dominant. It is particularly important to rule out stomatocytosis, where splenectomy is contraindicated due to the thrombotic risk.

Mild HS can be managed without folate supplements and does not require splenectomy. Moderately and severely affected individuals are likely to benefit from splenectomy, which should be performed after the age of 6 years with appropriate counselling about the infection risk. In all cases, careful dialogue between the doctor, patient, and family is essential. Laparoscopic surgery, when performed by experienced surgeons, can result in a shorter hospital stay and less pain.

### Sickle cell disease: Current activities, public health implications, and future directions [^113zoPsX]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder caused by abnormal hemoglobin that damages and deforms red blood cells (RBCs). The abnormal red cells break down, causing anemia, and obstruct blood vessels, leading to episodes of severe pain and multiorgan ischemic damage. SCD affects millions of people throughout the world and is particularly common among individuals whose ancestors come from sub-Saharan Africa. Sickle cell trait (SCT) is an inherited condition in which both normal hemoglobin and sickle hemoglobin are produced in RBCs. SCT is not a type of sickle cell disease, and people with SCT are generally healthy.

In SCD, clinical severity varies, ranging from mild and sometimes asymptomatic states to severe symptoms requiring hospitalization. Although symptomatic treatments exist, there is no cure for SCD. Despite extensive clinical and basic science research in SCD, many public health issues remain unaddressed. These include blood safety surveillance, compliance with immunizations, follow-up of newborns with positive screening tests, stroke prevention, pregnancy complications, pain prevention, quality of life, and thrombosis in people with SCT.

Efforts are currently underway to strengthen SCD-related activities within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). At the time of writing, several activities are being or have been conducted by centers within the CDC, including quality assurance of newborn screening tests for SCD, morbidity and mortality studies, genetic studies, and studies focusing on the protective effects of SCT for malaria.

### A novel 33-gene targeted resequencing panel provides accurate, clinical-grade diagnosis and improves patient management for rare inherited anaemias [^112GAPSf]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of rare inherited anaemias is challenging, requiring a series of complex and expensive laboratory tests. Targeted next-generation sequencing has been used to investigate these disorders, but the selection of genes on individual panels has been narrow and the validation strategies used have fallen short of the standards required for clinical use. Clinical-grade validation of negative results requires the test to distinguish between a lack of adequate sequencing reads at the locations of known mutations and a real absence of mutations. To achieve a clinically reliable diagnostic test and minimize false-negative results, we developed an open-source tool (CoverMi) to accurately determine base coverage and the 'discoverability' of known mutations for every sample.

We validated our 33-gene panel using Sanger sequencing and microarray. Our panel demonstrated 100% specificity and 99.7% sensitivity. We then analyzed 57 clinical samples: molecular diagnoses were made in 22 out of 57 cases (38.6%), corresponding to 32 mutations, of which 16 were new. In all cases, accurate molecular diagnosis had a positive impact on clinical management. Using a validated-based platform for routine molecular diagnosis of previously undiagnosed congenital anaemias is feasible in a clinical diagnostic setting, improves precise diagnosis, and enhances management and counselling of the patient and their family.

### Genetic predisposition to hematologic malignancies: Management and surveillance [^115f8RGi]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

As individuals with germ line predisposition to hematologic malignancies are diagnosed with increasing frequency, the need for clinical surveillance has become apparent. Unfortunately, few prospective data are available, so recommendations are based on collective experience and expert consensus. There is general agreement to advocate for expert consultation or referral of patients to centers with expertise in these syndromes, since presentations and disease progression can be subtle, and treatment strategies must be tailored. Here, we summarize and integrate expert consensus recommendations and medical management considerations for the patient newly diagnosed with a leukemia predisposition disorder. Indications to consider additional studies and referral for allogeneic stem cell transplantation are also discussed.

### Real-world insights from a cohort of approximately 2000 individuals who were analysed using a freely available next-generation sequencing anaemia screening programme [^111WUkxf]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Diagnostic techniques for hereditary haemolytic anaemias (HHAs) are diverse, including red blood cell (RBC) indices, reticulocyte counts, osmotic fragility, and eosin-maleimide binding tests or measurement of RBC enzyme activity. However, some methods are technically complex or unavailable to non-specialist centres, making definitive diagnoses difficult. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) may provide a platform to diagnose a range of HHAs and overlapping clinical entities through extensive, simultaneous evaluation of multiple disease-causing genes. Inaccurate diagnosis of HHAs can have serious implications, highlighting the potential clinical utility of NGS in supplementing routine diagnostic techniques.

A real-world diagnostic programme for patients with suspected HHA disease or carrier status, excluding haemoglobinopathies, has been available since 2018 (ARUP Laboratories® 2018–2020, AnemiaID®/Revvity, Inc.® 2020–present) to provide a diagnosis using an NGS panel of HHA-associated genes. Here, we describe genetic testing results from this real-world programme to evaluate the clinical utility of NGS in supporting the diagnosis of suspected HHAs. In total, this programme evaluated 2003 individuals between 3 December 2020 and 23 February 2023.

Clinical indication for testing varied among patients, ranging from unexplained or unspecified anaemia or hyperbilirubinaemia to specific diagnoses indicated by prior clinical testing. It also included patients with a family history of haemolytic anaemia. Individuals were referred for testing based on clinicians' judgment.

### Using red blood cell genomics in transfusion medicine [^113suWBA]. Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Blood types, or blood group antigens, are heritable polymorphic antigenic molecules located on the surface of blood cells. These were among the first human Mendelian traits identified, and the genetic basis of nearly all the hundreds of blood types is known. Clinical laboratory methods have proven useful in identifying selected blood group gene variants. Use of genetic blood type information is becoming widespread.

However, the breadth and complexity of clinically relevant blood group genetic variation pose challenges. With recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, a more comprehensive DNA sequence-based genetic blood typing approach is now feasible. This chapter introduces the practitioner to high-resolution genetic blood typing by providing an overview of the genetics of blood group antigens, the clinical problem of allosensitization, blood type testing methods, and discussing next-generation sequencing and its application to the problem of genetic blood typing.

### Exome sequencing in 116 patients with inherited thrombocytopenia that remained of unknown origin after systematic phenotype-driven diagnostic workup [^1151FNMH]. Haematologica (2023). High credibility.

Inherited thrombocytopenias (IT) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a low platelet count, leading to a variable degree of bleeding tendency. In these disorders, thrombocytopenia can be isolated or associated with additional congenital defects. Moreover, some cases of IT have a predisposition to develop additional diseases over time, such as hematologic malignancies, bone marrow aplasia, and renal failure.

Until recently, diagnosing IT required a complex multi-step clinical and laboratory characterization of patients, followed by resequencing of candidate genes. The introduction of next-generation sequencing revolutionized this approach, allowing the analysis of virtually all known genes simultaneously through exome sequencing (ES). This application led to the identification of many novel genes underlying IT, revealing substantial genetic heterogeneity, with at least 40 genes implicated. However, it is notable that only a few genes account for most cases, while most genes explain less than 2% of cases each. Despite recent progress, almost half of familial IT patients still lack a definite molecular diagnosis, which is crucial for clinical management and counseling.

ES of large numbers of patients, coupled with the clustering of results according to standardized clinical or functional phenotypes, has proven effective in describing novel forms of IT and identifying новые генетические причины.

### Molecular diagnosis of thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies: An ACLPS critical review [^113VNYBf]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Use of molecular diagnostic techniques for patients with hemoglobin disorders is crucial. A clinical scenario showcases the importance of molecular diagnosis for genetic counseling. Detailed are the various globin disorders, diagnostic techniques, and the role of molecular genetic testing in patient management.

Hemoglobin disorders, including thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies, rank among the most common genetic diseases. The clinical laboratory plays an essential role in diagnosing these abnormalities. Most disorders can be identified using protein-based techniques, such as electrophoresis and chromatography. When severe syndromes arise from the inheritance of multiple globin genetic disorders, genetic counseling becomes crucial to avert adverse outcomes. Protein-based methods cannot always detect serious thalassemia disorders; for instance, α-thalassemia may be obscured by the presence of β-thalassemia. Furthermore, deletional forms of β-thalassemia may pose challenges for definitive diagnosis using standard methods.

Molecular genetic testing is vital for identifying individuals who carry thalassemia traits that may lead to adverse outcomes in their offspring. Additionally, prenatal genetic testing can detect fetuses with severe globin phenotypes.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: An updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^112grSX2]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

This updated literature review and evidence-based clinical practice guideline continue to struggle to make recommendations for a beneficial role of extended matching of RBCs for patients with SCD and thalassemia, a group with significant transfusion exposure and a high burden of clinically relevant alloimmunization. This largely results from the lack of high-quality evidence and uncertainty about whether extended matching reduces the risk of alloimmunization or HTRs in this patient population.

Our review has highlighted multiple research needs. Above all, well-designed studies with clear analysis plans for reporting alloimmunization rates in the context of pre-study baseline transfusion information are required. Research priorities should include:

- **Improving our understanding**: How patient factors, such as ethnicity and genetic modifiers of alloimmunization risk (which may vary globally) and the clinical context in which transfusions are administered (e.g. episodic or chronic, elective or during acute illness) may influence the role of extended matching.

- **Identifying which patients**: Who benefit most from extended prophylactic matching and whether subgroups of patients might be better suited to different policies for extended matching.

- **Evaluating the clinical and operational impact**: Implementing policies for extended prophylactic matching on patients with existing alloantibodies.

- **Assessing the advent of genotyping technologies**: How it may impact the ability to deliver extended matched RBCs and better define the need/ability to match for variants, particularly in this patient population.

### The carrier state for sickle cell disease is not completely harmless [^111XLQE3]. Haematologica (2019). High credibility.

Compound heterozygosity for HbS and genetic variants causing non-hemoglobin red cell (i.e. membrane and enzyme) disorders, while uncommon, can have important modifying effects on the clinical outcome of SCT. Two cases of HbS carriers experiencing typical SCD complications — chronic hemolytic anemia, acute pain, recalcitrant leg ulceration, and end-stage renal disease — have been reported. Each of the probands had co-inherited mutations in the PKLR gene, causing a deficiency of pyruvate kinase protein. Pyruvate kinase is a key enzyme in the final step of glycolysis; it converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, generating 50% of the total red cell ATP that is essential for red blood cell metabolism. Of particular relevance to SCD, a reduction in pyruvate kinase activity also leads to the accumulation of upstream enzyme substrates, including 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, which decreases oxygen affinity and favors the polymerization of deoxy-HbS. In one case, fresh blood was available for in-vitro functional assays that supported the role of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate as a key factor in HbS polymerization.

Another example is the co-inheritance of hereditary spherocytosis, implicated as the cause of splenic infarction in a handful of SCT cases. The presence of hereditary spherocytosis is believed to increase mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and intracellular HbS concentration, thereby increasing the propensity for HbS polymerization. Along the same lines, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, a common red cell enzyme deficiency, may further contribute to the exacerbation of SCD complications.

### Diagnostic evaluation in bone marrow failure disorders: What have we learnt to help inform the transplant decision in 2024 and beyond [^1129fDRy]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

Aplastic anemia (AA) is the prototypical bone marrow failure syndrome. In the era of readily available molecular annotation, the application of comprehensive next-generation sequencing panels has generated novel insights into underlying pathogenetic mechanisms, potentially leading to improvements in personalized therapeutic approaches. New evidence has emerged regarding the role of somatic loss of HLA class I allele expression in immune-mediated AA, associated molecular aberrations, and risk of clonal evolution. A deeper understanding has emerged regarding the role of myeloid gene mutations in this context, translating patho-mechanistic insights derived from wider clinical and translational research within the myeloid disorder arena.

Here, we review contemporary tools which aid in the confirmation of a diagnosis of AA, with an additional focus on their potential in guiding therapeutic options. A specific emphasis is placed upon the interpretation and integration of this detailed diagnostic information and how this may inform optimal transplantation strategies.

### Diagnosis and clinical management of enzymopathies [^112fShRx]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Low credibility.

At least 16 genetically determined conditions qualify as red blood cell enzymopathies. They range in frequency from ultra-rare to rare, with the exception of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, which is very common. Nearly all these enzymopathies manifest as chronic hemolytic anemias, with an onset often in the neonatal period.

The diagnosis can be quite easy, such as when a child presents with dark urine after eating fava beans, or it can be quite difficult, such as when an adult presents with mild anemia and gallstones. In general, four steps are recommended:

1. **Recognizing chronic hemolytic anemia**:
	- Exclude acquired causes.
	- Exclude hemoglobinopathies and membranopathies.

2. **Pinpointing the deficient red blood cell enzyme**: Step 4 requires one or many enzyme assays; alternatively, DNA testing against an appropriate gene panel can combine steps 3 and 4.

Most patients with a red blood cell enzymopathy can be managed by good supportive care, including blood transfusion, iron chelation when necessary, and splenectomy in selected cases. However, some patients have serious extraerythrocytic manifestations that are difficult to manage. In the absence of these, red blood cell enzymopathies are, in principle, amenable to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy/gene editing.

### Advances in understanding the mechanisms of erythropoiesis in homeostasis and disease [^11469hHp]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Anaemia, or decreased blood haemoglobin, is the most common blood disorder, often characterized by reduced red blood cell (RBC) numbers. RBCs are produced from the differentiation and commitment of haematopoietic stem cells to the erythroid lineage through a process called erythropoiesis. Coordination of erythropoietin receptor signalling with several erythroid transcription factors, including GATA1, is essential for this process.

A number of additional players have been identified in recent years as critical for RBC production. Major technological advances, such as the development of RNA interference, genetically modified animals (including zebrafish), and imaging flow cytometry have led to these discoveries. The emergence of omics approaches, combined with the optimization of ex vivo erythroid cultures, has produced a more comprehensive understanding of erythropoiesis.

Here, we summarize studies describing novel regulators of erythropoiesis that modulate erythroid cell production in the context of human erythroid disorders involving hypoxia, iron regulation, immune-related molecules, and the transcription factor FOXO3.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: An updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^115bZ2tB]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Transfusion requirement after the introduction of molecular typing was reported only by Putzulu et al. but there was no comparison to pre-intervention requirement. Only one study (Belsito et al.) reported mortality, which was 0% in both groups. Personal communication with the author also confirmed 0% mortality in both groups in the study by Van Buren et al.

- **Limitations of the included studies**: The study by Putzulu et al. describes its intervention in detail, but it is unclear what standard of care transfusions this, presumably, heavily transfused patient cohort received prior to study entry. The study by Campbell-Lee et al, which compared transfusion strategies in two time periods, found no statistically significant difference in primary alloimmunisation between periods 1 and 2 but did not include a full analysis of subsequent alloimmunisation rates during both time periods. Patients in the study by Belsito et al. had received a large number of transfusions prior to study entry (mean pretransfusion period of ~14 years in a transfusion-dependent population), and patients with pre-existing alloantibodies were excluded from analysis. No new alloantibodies were formed during the study period. In the study by Watanaboonyongcharoen et al, the majority of patients (20/22) were alloimmunised at study entry, with 16 patients multiply alloimmunised for a total of 61 antibodies. Patients had received numerous transfusions prior to study entry, with no additional antibodies formed in either group during the study period. The study by Romphruk et al. excluded patients (7.

### Genetic counseling following the detection of hemoglobinopathy trait on the newborn screen is well received, improves knowledge, and relieves anxiety [^113XiqeW]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The primary purpose of newborn screening for hemoglobinopathies is the presymptomatic diagnosis and early treatment of sickle cell disease. Hemoglobinopathy traits detected on the newborn screening provide an opportunity for genetic counseling of families regarding the trait and information that may impact reproductive decisions of the parents. We describe the results of a study to determine the impact of newborn screening and genetic counseling on the lives of families in which an abnormal hemoglobin trait had been identified.

From June 2003 to December 2009, families of children with trait attending a clinic visit and receiving professional genetic counseling were asked to participate in a semistructured follow-up survey regarding their experience and the impact of genetic counseling on their families.

Of the 300 patients seen in clinic during the specified time period, 209 consented to be recontacted and 114 have completed the survey. Eighty-five percent of responders reported knowing that the newborn screen had been performed, but only 55% understood the purpose of newborn screening. When asked about the effect of finding out that the trait was present in their baby, 19% reported feeling guilty or upset, whereas 4% believed that their partner blamed them for the child's results. That genetic counseling was found to be beneficial was indicated by the fact that 99% reported that their questions were answered, 82% reported feeling less anxious, and 78% discussed the trait with their partner after the appointment.

### A novel 33-gene targeted resequencing panel provides accurate, clinical-grade diagnosis and improves patient management for rare inherited anaemias [^114TbJHC]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Here, we report the development and application of a novel clinical-grade open-source tool for evaluation of 'per-base coverage' in a 33 gene-targeted NGS panel (Oxford Red Cell Panel, ORCP), used to provide a clinical diagnosis to patients with unexplained anaemia.

- **Objectives**: We aimed to (i) demonstrate the feasibility of achieving clinical-grade validation of a targeted re-sequencing panel for congenital anaemias; (ii) develop a clinical-grade open-source tool for evaluation of read coverage; (iii) assess the diagnostic yield of this strategy for congenital anaemias; and (iv) assess the clinical impact of results generated using this approach.

To select the genes for inclusion in the ORCP, we chose to take a relatively unbiased approach by including causative genes for conditions where anaemia may be part of a wider bone marrow failure syndrome, as well as those for specific red cell disorders, such as Diamond–Blackfan Anaemia (DBA) and Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anaemia (CDA).

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: An updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^113BuwBK]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Other initiatives to reduce alloimmunisation should continue to be considered. These include patient education and the provision of alert cards, which can be presented at each hospital visit to ensure the use of appropriate antigen‐negative RBCs, as well as data sharing of red cell immunohematology test results between hospitals. This is especially important in the absence of centralised transfusion records, which increases the risk of delayed HTRs from antibodies that show anamnesis and are not detectable on the antibody screen.

It should, however, be noted that alloantibody formation can occur despite extended RBC matching and other measures detailed above. For instance, alloantibodies may be formed in 1.2% of pregnancies, with clinically significant antibodies less commonly seen at 0.4% in the absence of any transfusions being given. Furthermore, even extended antigen matching will not be able to match all 362 currently recognised RBC antigens. While high frequency and clinically significant antigens are aimed to be included in all extended matching strategies, less frequently occurring RBC antigens still have the potential to cause alloimmunisation when discrepancies in recipient and donor RBC antigens occur.

It should also be recognized that disparity in donor/recipient RBC antigens may vary globally. This has implications for readers and clinicians interpreting data from studies with different countries of origin. For example, if donor and recipient populations are well-matched, recipients might be more likely to get antigen‐matched units by chance.

### Clinical utility of next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of hereditary haemolytic anaemias [^111H77xK]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). High credibility.

Hereditary haemolytic anaemias are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorders characterized by increased red cell destruction, with consequences ranging from innocuous to severe life-threatening anaemia. Diagnostic laboratories endeavor to assist clinicians in reaching the exact patient diagnosis by using tests primarily based on morphological and biochemical techniques. However, these routine studies may be inconclusive, particularly in newborn infants and when transfusions have recently been administered.

The large numbers and size of the potentially involved genes also impose a practical challenge for molecular diagnosis using routine sequencing approaches. To overcome these diagnostic shortcomings, we have utilized next-generation sequencing to provide a high-throughput, highly sensitive assay. We developed a panel interrogating 28 genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins and enzymes, with sequencing coverage of the coding regions, splice site junctions, deep intronic, and regulatory regions.

We then evaluated 19 samples, including infants with unexplained extreme hyperbilirubinaemia and patients with transfusion-dependent haemolytic anaemia. Where possible, inheritance patterns of pathogenic mutations were determined by sequencing of immediate relatives. We conclude that this next-generation sequencing panel could be a cost-effective approach to the molecular diagnosis of hereditary haemolytic anaemia, especially when the family history is uninformative or when routine laboratory testing fails to identify the causative haemolytic process.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: Who and how to test [^111fhkxR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). High credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals in pediatric and adult hematology practice. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most cases will be acquired, especially in adult patients, but many can be inherited, with some potentially affecting other organ systems. The first step is defining whether symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up, which can be as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low?

Once the decision has been made to pursue additional studies, the diagnostic process can become complex due to the increasing number of laboratory tests available. This article outlines a general approach for evaluating patients being considered for an inherited platelet disorder. It presents two clinical vignettes as an introduction to the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet disorders. The rationale for different types of tests that are clinically available is described, alongside their limitations and the challenges often encountered during result interpretation. Additionally, guidance is provided on the expected phenotype concerning the severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia according to the etiology of the inherited disorder. The goal is to equip practicing hematologists with a practical framework that is clinically applicable in their daily practice.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^115W24Xp]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Haemoglobinopathies constitute the most common recessive monogenic disorders worldwide, and the treatment of affected individuals presents a substantial global disease burden. Carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis represent valuable procedures that identify couples at risk for having affected children so that they can be offered options to have healthy offspring. Molecular diagnosis facilitates both prenatal diagnosis and the definitive diagnosis of carriers and patients, especially in atypical cases who often have complex genotype interactions.

However, the haemoglobin disorders are unique among all genetic diseases in that the identification of carriers is preferable by haematological (biochemical) tests rather than DNA analysis. These best practice guidelines offer an overview of recommended strategies and methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of haemoglobinopathies. They emphasize the importance of appropriately applying and interpreting haematological tests in supporting the optimum application and evaluation of globin gene DNA analysis.

### Risk assessment and genetic counseling for hematologic malignancies-practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^116yXekg]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). High credibility.

Hematologic malignancies (HMs) are a heterogeneous group of cancers impacting individuals of all ages that have been increasingly recognized in association with various germline predisposition syndromes. Given the myriad of malignancy subtypes, expanding differential diagnoses, and unique sample selection requirements, evaluation for hereditary predisposition to HM presents both challenges and exciting opportunities in the ever-evolving field of genetic counseling. This practice resource has been developed as a foundational guide for genetic counseling approaches to hereditary HMs and aims to empower genetic counselors who encounter individuals and families with HMs in their practice.

### A novel 33-gene targeted resequencing panel provides accurate, clinical-grade diagnosis and improves patient management for rare inherited anaemias [^115RTLeK]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Typically, diagnosis of unexplained congenital anaemia involves sequential investigations including routine haematological and biochemical tests followed by specialized tests (e.g. red cell enzyme assays, bone marrow morphology) and, finally, testing of individual genes directed by these investigations. Our targeted panel may allow the diagnostic pathway to be shortened by performing NGS before specialized investigations. For many patients, this would dramatically reduce the time to diagnosis and the number of expensive, complex tests, as specific confirmatory tests can be targeted to individual patients to confirm the molecular diagnosis.

Indeed, the average time to diagnosis for the five new or changed diagnoses in our study was 3.3 years, rather than 3 months had NGS been available earlier. However, we acknowledge that several strategies will be needed to increase the diagnostic yield of targeted NGS for congenital anaemia before this approach will replace conventional diagnostic approaches. In particular, we plan to include a larger number of red cell enzyme genes and add red cell membrane genes to the panel. Furthermore, the diagnostic utility of such panels depends on a regular process of review to accommodate relevant newly identified pathogenic and modifying mutations in genes and their promoters and regulatory elements. It is likely that whole exome sequencing or whole genome sequencing, which provide a much more comprehensive, unbiased approach, will replace targeted sequencing in the future. At present, however, the use of a restricted, targeted sequencing panel remains an essential tool.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^116ApezM]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Patient welfare**: CDA‐I remains a rare disorder and shares the hurdles and obstacles faced by patients with other rare conditions. Delays in diagnosis may be reduced by implementing gene panels as part of routine testing. Earlier diagnosis should allow treatment prior to the development of iron overload and associated organ damage. Due to the rarity of the condition, CDA‐I patients should be reviewed at least annually at centers specializing in rare anemias and having access to specialized monitoring and multidisciplinary meetings. Such clinicians belong to national and international networks of experts that collaborate to provide optimal care and access to research developments.

EuroBloodNet, a European rare disease network, promotes transnational collaboration and sharing of expertise. Patients with rare conditions benefit from the support offered by national patient networks. A recent James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership identified the most important research question for these patients and their families: "Would a national formal network of clinicians with expertise and/or a national MDT (multidisciplinary team meeting) improve care for patients with rare inherited anemias?" Collaboration between clinicians, patients, and research partners is critical to guiding and securing optimal clinical care for CDA‐I.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: An updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^112eTvRt]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) antigen matching beyond ABO and RhD is commonly recommended for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia. We present an updated systematic literature review to inform evidence-based guidelines on RBC matching. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool was used to develop recommendations.

Six new observational studies (four prospective, two retrospective) were identified. These studies reported on 583 patients in total, including cross-over designs, with sample sizes from 10 to 343. The studies were heterogeneous, utilizing varying degrees of RBC matching and different definitions for 'extended' matching. All studies reported on alloimmunization, and one study reported on molecular matching. The reported prevalence of alloimmunization using limited matching was 0%-50%, and with extended matching was 0%-24%. Eighty-two patients were alloimmunized before study entry. The risk of bias across studies was moderate to critical.

The guideline panel recommends that ABO, RhDCcEe, and K-compatible RBCs are selected for individuals with SCD and thalassemia, even in the absence of alloantibodies, and that RBCs which are antigen-negative to already existing clinically significant antibodies are chosen. There is a need for comparative research to define the benefit, impact, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility of extended RBC matching strategies to prevent alloimmunization.

### Whole-genome sequencing association analysis of quantitative red blood cell phenotypes: The NHLBI TOPMed program [^117KJQxg]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2021). High credibility.

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), a powerful tool for detecting novel coding and non-coding disease-causing variants, has largely been applied to the clinical diagnosis of inherited disorders. Here, we leveraged WGS data from up to 62,653 ethnically diverse participants from the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program and assessed the statistical association of variants with seven red blood cell (RBC) quantitative traits. We discovered 14 single variant-RBC trait associations at 12 genomic loci, which have not been reported previously. Several of the RBC trait-variant associations (RPN1, ELL2, MIDN, HBB, HBA1, PIEZO1, and G6PD) were replicated in independent GWAS datasets imputed to the TOPMed reference panel. Most of these discovered variants are rare or low frequency, and several are observed disproportionately among non-European ancestry (African, Hispanic/Latino, or East Asian) populations.

We identified a 3 bp indel p. Lys2169del (g.88717175_88717177TCT[4]), common only in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, of PIEZO1, a gene responsible for the Mendelian red cell disorder hereditary xerocytosis (MIM: 194380), associated with higher mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). In stepwise conditional analysis and in gene-based rare variant aggregated association analysis, we identified several of the variants in HBB, HBA1, TMPRSS6, and G6PD that represent the carrier state for known coding, promoter, or splice site loss-of-function variants that cause inherited RBC disorders. Finally, we applied base and nuclease editing to demonstrate that the sentinel variant rs112…

### Applications of high-throughput DNA sequencing to benign hematology [^117VA6gv]. Blood (2013). High credibility.

The development of novel technologies for high-throughput DNA sequencing is having a major impact on our ability to measure and define normal and pathologic variation in humans. This review discusses advances in DNA sequencing that have been applied to benign hematologic disorders, including those affecting the red blood cell, the neutrophil, and other white blood cell lineages.

Relevant examples of how these approaches have been used for disease diagnosis, gene discovery, and studying complex traits are provided. High-throughput DNA sequencing technology holds significant promise for impacting clinical care. This includes development of improved disease detection and diagnosis, better understanding of disease progression and stratification of risk of disease-specific complications, and development of improved therapeutic strategies, particularly patient-specific pharmacogenomics-based therapy, with monitoring of therapy by genomic biomarkers.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: An updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^112DLHSX]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

A total of 3432 references were identified and screened, as presented in Figure 1. Of these, 1832 were excluded as duplicates. In total, 1600 references underwent screening review, following which 1499 were excluded. The remaining 101 references underwent a full-text review, of which 93 were excluded, and eight references were considered for inclusion. Of the eight screened for full text, six references were identified for data extraction and were included in the qualitative review. All were observational studies. The evidence for the original 2018 guideline was based on 18 references (17 clinical studies and one cost-effectiveness study).

- **Search results and study selection**: Of the six new studies identified, three reported on patients with a range of different thalassaemia genotypes (most commonly HbE/ß-thalassaemia, then Hb H disease), one reported on patients with SCD, and two studies included both populations. Four studies were prospective observational, and two were retrospective observational. Two of the six studies were from Italy, two were from Thailand, and two were from the United States.

Figure 1 shows the PRISMA flow chart.

### How I manage children with Diamond-Blackfan anaemia [^115LiKCG]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

For many years, three therapeutic approaches have been the cornerstone of DBA treatment: erythrocyte transfusions, glucocorticoids (GC), and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the latter mostly as a salvage option. While HSCT is currently the only curative treatment for the haematological phenotype, it is not frequently performed due to the risk of severe short-term and long-term toxicity, and because spontaneous remission of anaemia has been known to occur in a significant number of DBA patients. In addition, spontaneous self-reverting mutations have been described, although these are most likely very rare.

- **Erythrocyte transfusions**: Given that bone marrow dysfunction in DBA generally only concerns erythrocyte production, red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are an effective option to treat anaemia in DBA. However, the toxicity associated with iron overload, concomitant with chronic transfusion regimens, is a limiting factor for lifelong transfusions. DBA patients generally require 10–15 ml/kg per RBC transfusion every 3–5 weeks to keep haemoglobin levels above 80 g/L.

	- Transfusion schemes are further individualized based on growth, neurocognitive development, and general performance. In very young children (generally up to the age of 1 year), RBC transfusions are the first choice of treatment to avoid the toxicities of glucocorticoids on neurodevelopment and growth. As infants and young children often require higher haemoglobin levels to maintain adequate growth and development, transfusion schemes in this group generally aim for haemoglobin levels above 90 g/L.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: An updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^113axe6v]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

A 2021 global survey estimated that the number of patients living with SCD was 7.74 million worldwide (95% CI 6.5–9.2), of whom 5.7 million (95% uncertainty interval 4.8–6.6) lived in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where, according to one recent systematic review, transfusion for SCD is the second most common reason for transfusion overall. Approximately 7% of transfused SCD patients in SSA may have clinically significant RBC alloantibodies. In high-resource countries, it is often standard practice to provide patients with haemoglobinopathies with extended matched RBC units. However, this can be challenging in low/low-middle income countries (LMIC) due to several factors: the genetic diversity of blood group antigens among patients and donors, limited blood supply, and scarce testing resources.

This situation is exacerbated by the insufficiency of antigen testing, even for common RBC antigens, such as RhD, RhCcEe, and K, and the lack of historical records, even within single institutions, making it difficult to achieve the same standard of care in these regions. Ethnic differences between blood donors and recipients in different regions of the world may further limit the value of common generalisable recommendations. The higher prevalence of Ro (short notation of the Rh system cDe haplotype) in people of African ancestry compared with other populations may have specific implications for RhD and RhCcEe matching, as potential donors from this background are more likely to be RhCcEe, as well as K, matched to patients with SCD.

### Second international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^1139QjeL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, specifically in relation to genetic testing, the HHT-WG 2020 guidelines recommend referring patients for genetic testing for HHT:

- **To identify** the causative mutation in a family with clinically confirmed HHT.
- **To establish** the diagnosis in relatives of a patient with a known causative mutation, including asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients, as well as patients desiring prenatal testing.
- **To assist** in establishing the diagnosis in patients not meeting clinical diagnostic criteria.

### High-throughput sequencing approaches for diagnosing hereditary bleeding and platelet disorders [^113twZmP]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Hereditary bleeding and platelet disorders (BPDs) are characterized by marked genetic heterogeneity, far greater than previously appreciated. The list of genes involved in the regulation of megakaryopoiesis, platelet formation, platelet function, and bleeding has been growing rapidly since the introduction of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) approaches in research. Thanks to the gradual adoption of HTS in diagnostic practice, these discoveries are improving the diagnostic yield for BPD patients, who may or may not present with bleeding problems and often have other clinical symptoms unrelated to the blood system.

However, it was previously found that screening for all known etiologies gives a diagnostic yield of over 90% when the phenotype closely matches a known BPD but drops to 10% when the phenotype is indicative of a novel disorder. Thus, further research is needed to identify currently unknown etiologies for BPDs. Novel genes are likely to be found to be implicated in BPDs. New modes of inheritance, including digenic inheritance, are likely to play a role in some cases. Additionally, identifying and interpreting pathogenic variants outside exons is a looming challenge that can only be tackled with an improved understanding of the regulatory landscape of relevant cell types and with the transition from targeted sequencing to whole-genome sequencing in the clinic.

### How I manage acquired pure red cell aplasia in adults [^116QKnvN]. Blood (2021). Low credibility.

Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare hematological disorder with multiple etiologies. The multifaceted nature of this disease is emphasized by the variety of concomitant clinical features. Beyond the classic idiopathic presentation, prompt recognition of pathogenetic clues is important due to their diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Consequently, the treatment of PRCA is diverse and strictly dependent on the presented clinical scenario.

Here, we propose a series of clinical vignettes that showcase instructive representative situations derived from our routine clinical practice. Using these illustrative clinical cases, we review the diagnostic workup needed for a precise diagnosis and the currently available therapeutic options, discussing their applications in regard to the various PRCA-associated conditions and individual patients' characteristics.

Finally, we propose a treatment algorithm that may offer guidance for personalized therapeutic recommendations.

### Diagnosis and management of pyruvate kinase deficiency: International expert guidelines [^111fw121]. The Lancet Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is the most common cause of chronic congenital non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of one in 100,000 to one in 300,000 people. PK deficiency results in chronic haemolytic anaemia, with wide-ranging and serious consequences affecting health, quality of life, and mortality. The goal of the International Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency was to develop evidence-based guidelines for the clinical care of patients with PK deficiency. These clinical guidelines were developed using the GRADE methodology and the AGREE II framework. Experts were invited after consideration of area of expertise, scholarly contributions in PK deficiency, and country of practice for global representation.

- **Composition of the expert panel**: The expert panel included 29 expert physicians (including adult and paediatric haematologists and other subspecialists), geneticists, laboratory specialists, nurses, a guidelines methodologist, patients with PK deficiency, and caregivers from ten countries.

- **Development process**: Five key topic areas were identified, the panel prioritised key questions, and a systematic literature search was done to generate evidence summaries that were used in the development of draft recommendations. The expert panel then met in person to finalise and vote on recommendations according to a structured consensus procedure.

- **Consensus and recommendations**: Agreement of greater than or equal to 67% among the expert panel was required for inclusion of a recommendation in the final guideline. The expert panel agreed on 31 total recommendations across five key topics.

### Modified Delphi panel consensus recommendations for management of severe aplastic anemia [^1174vjkM]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

Tests to diagnose acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and rule out inherited bone marrow failure (IBMF) syndromes should be performed promptly. Therapy for acquired SAA should not be delayed while awaiting test results to differentiate it from IBMF syndromes, unless clinical features suggest IBMF.

- **Required diagnostic tests**: A complete blood count with differential; review of peripheral blood smear; reticulocyte count; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) assessment by flow cytometry of peripheral blood; and bone marrow (BM) biopsy and aspirate with karyotype should be obtained in all patients. Given the poor growth of cytogenetics culture in cases of aplastic anemia (AA), and to exclude hypocellular myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for MDS-associated cytogenetic abnormalities is recommended. Somatic next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panels for genes frequently mutated in hematologic malignancies have become standard in the evaluation of suspected BM failure.

- **Somatic mutations and assessments**: Although somatic mutations are commonly seen in both AA and in hypocellular MDS, the inclusion of somatic NGS sequencing panels, supported by commonly used practice guidelines, can help with baseline assessment. This includes identification of MDS-defining variants and can be informative prognostically and in the longitudinal follow-up of clonal evolution. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tissue typing should be ordered upfront for patients of all ages who are candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Comprehensive ancillary studies to exclude transient etiologies of pancytopenia, such as nutritional deficiencies or viral and other infections, should also be performed in all patients.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of adult aplastic anaemia: A British Society for Haematology guideline [^11676jTt]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for aplastic anaemia, specifically concerning the evaluation for inherited AA, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining genetic testing. This testing aims to identify constitutional disorders for surveillance of associated abnormalities in patients. Accurate testing for the same pathogenic variants in close relatives is advised to predict their risks, and prenatal diagnosis for future pregnancies is also recommended.

### Current clinical practices and challenges in molecular testing: A GOAL Consortium Hematopathology Working Group report [^111Gm4XR]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

- **Hematologic malignancy NGS panel design**: Figure 1 illustrates the number of next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels offered for hematologic malignancies by responding laboratories. These include a single comprehensive cancer panel, a single comprehensive hematologic malignancy panel (HMP), and two or more panels. The bar chart in Figure 1A shows the panel variety.

- **Gene coverage and categories**: Figure 1B displays the range of genes offered, from small panels with 21 to 50 genes to large panels with more than 300 genes. Respondents were categorized as those with a single comprehensive cancer panel, a single comprehensive HMP, and a combined group with more than one panel.

- **Panel efficacy**: Figure 1C generally indicates excellent coverage of myeloid processes with no more than five additional genes needed for most NGS panels. Conversely, Figure 1D shows moderate coverage of lymphoid processes, requiring a wider range of genes.

The number of genes included in the panels varied widely, from more than 300 genes, as covered by 4 out of 18 laboratories (22.2%), to 21 to 50 genes, as covered by 2 out of 18 laboratories (11.1%). The four laboratories offering tests for over 300 genes were doing so through comprehensive cancer panels. Among the seven laboratories using a comprehensive HMP, panel sizes ranged from 21 to 50 genes to 201 to 250 genes.

Gene lists for panels used to test hematologic malignancies were received from 13 laboratories. Two gene lists were used for comprehensive cancer panels, each covering more than 300 genes. The other 11 were for comprehensive HMPs, with sizes ranging from 21 to 50 genes to 201 to 250 genes. For a detailed institution list, refer to the supplement.

### Diagnosis of inherited bleeding disorders in the genomic era [^114tLbSF]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Inherited bleeding disorders affect between 1 in 1000 individuals for the most common disorder, von Willebrand Disease, to only 8 reported cases worldwide of alpha-2-antiplasmin deficiency. Those with an identifiable abnormality can be divided into disorders of coagulation factors (87%), platelet count and function (8%), and the fibrinolytic system (3%). Of the patients registered in the UK with a bleeding disorder, the remaining 2% are unclassifiable. In addition to bleeding symptoms, patients with an inherited bleeding disorder can manifest other abnormalities, making an accurate and complete diagnosis that reflects the underlying molecular pathology important.

Although some inherited bleeding disorders can still be easily diagnosed through a combination of careful clinical assessment and laboratory assays of varying degrees of complexity, there are many where conventional approaches are inadequate. Improvements in phenotyping assays have enhanced our diagnostic armoury, but genotyping now offers the most accurate and complete diagnosis for some of these conditions.

The advent of next-generation sequencing technology has meant that many genes can now be analysed routinely in clinical practice. Here, we discuss the different diagnostic tools currently available for inherited bleeding disorders and suggest that genotyping should be incorporated at an early stage in the diagnostic pathway.
