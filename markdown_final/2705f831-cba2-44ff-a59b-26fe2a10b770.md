## Question

Does progesterone cream give uterine protection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether progesterone cream provides uterine protection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "uterine protection" means mechanistically and in guidelines. Then, I should evaluate pharmacokinetic data for topical progesterone creams and whether they achieve therapeutic exposure. Next, I will examine tissue-level and biopsy evidence for endometrial effects. After that, I need to assess product quality and regulatory oversight for compounded creams. Then, I will compare these creams to established, effective progestogen regimens that do protect the endometrium. I should review professional guidelines and labeling. Finally, I will anticipate counterarguments and synthesize a clear clinical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical target: uterine protection means preventing estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia and cancer by giving sufficient progestogen to transform an estrogen-primed proliferative endometrium into a secretory or atrophic one, which is the explicit role of the progestogen component in menopausal hormone therapy per labeling and position statements [^1157dZfP] [^113RnL78] [^116nHVgh].

> I need to check systemic exposure from progesterone creams, because without adequate circulating levels or tissue delivery, protection is unlikely; randomized pharmacokinetic data show that after topical progesterone cream or gel, venous serum levels rise only modestly with very low AUC compared with saliva or capillary samples, indicating minimal systemic delivery despite local cutaneous concentrations [^111AaL9j]. Hold on, let me verify salivary findings; salivary progesterone does increase after topical dosing while serum often does not, reinforcing that high salivary or fingertip capillary levels do not equate to systemic exposure required for endometrial protection [^117N77iA]. Let me consider clinical effects as a reality check; a 12-week randomized trial of 32 mg/day transdermal progesterone found no biologic impact on vasomotor symptoms or metabolic markers, suggesting inadequate bioavailability for systemic effects [^112zV79m].

> Next, I should review endometrial biopsy evidence, because histology is the gold standard for protection; reports summarized in a pharmacokinetic/clinical review note that with transdermal progesterone cream doses of 40 to 64 mg/day combined with estradiol, postmenopausal women frequently showed proliferative endometrium or even complex hyperplasia on biopsy after prolonged use, and serum progesterone levels remained far below a commonly cited luteal-phase benchmark of approximately 5 ng/mL that is often used as a heuristic for adequate exposure, indicating clinical failure to oppose estrogen [^112herxj]. Wait, let me double-check the consistency of these findings across cohorts; both the Wren and Vashisht cohorts within that review showed substantial rates of proliferation or hyperplasia despite daily topical progesterone in the 40 to 64 mg range, which is not consistent with reliable uterine protection [^112herxj].

> I will now examine tissue-level delivery principles; FDA-reviewed vaginal progesterone products are known to transform proliferative to secretory endometrium, consistent with high local tissue exposure when administered intravaginally, whereas this effect is not demonstrated with creams applied to the skin [^117VwNRA]. Hmm, wait a minute, the capillary-versus-serum discrepancy after topical application might tempt one to assume adequate systemic absorption, but the markedly higher capillary AUC reflects local dermal microvascular concentrations rather than uniform systemic distribution to uterine tissues, which is why venous serum remains low and uterine protection is unreliable with creams [^111AaL9j]. But wait, I just said "portal circulation delivery", which is imprecise here; hold on, I should verify the anatomy — endometrial tissue is perfused by uterine arteries within the systemic circulation, not the hepatic portal system, and the key point is that low venous serum levels after topical application reflect insufficient systemic delivery to the uterus despite high local dermal concentrations [^111AaL9j].

> Next, I should review product quality and regulatory issues, because even if a theoretical dose existed, inconsistent potency would undermine protection; multiple analyses of compounded estradiol/progesterone capsules and creams show substantial between-pharmacy and within-batch variability in progesterone content, lack of standardization, and absence of FDA oversight, all of which can lead to underdosing and endometrial risk during estrogen therapy [^113NiyJm] [^1118NzTV] [^116umsp4] [^113MtCNW]. Hold on, let me verify the real-world implications; regulatory reviews emphasize that compounded hormone products are not required to demonstrate safety, efficacy, or endometrial protection in trials, reinforcing caution with compounded progesterone creams [^112Bwetc].

> I should now compare topical creams to regimens proven to protect the endometrium; oral micronized progesterone 200 mg daily for 12 days per cycle is a labeled regimen for prevention of endometrial hyperplasia, and continuous-combined oral estradiol/progesterone capsules with 100 mg daily have been shown in a large randomized trial to provide endometrial protection during continuous estrogen exposure, whereas comparable protection has not been demonstrated for topical creams [^111MQy1D] [^113jmok2]. Let me double-check corroborating progestin data; cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate with estrogen reduces hyperplasia rates in randomized studies, and continuous combined estrogen-progestin therapy lowers endometrial cancer risk compared with sequential regimens in observational data, further underscoring that adequate systemic progestogen exposure is protective when properly dosed and delivered [^112qkhjT] [^1131Tek3].

> Next, I should review guideline and labeling recommendations, because these shape standard of care; professional societies and FDA labeling consistently advise adding an adequate progestogen when prescribing systemic estrogen to women with a uterus, and they do not endorse transdermal progesterone creams for endometrial protection, instead recommending oral, intrauterine, or in some contexts vaginal routes that have evidence for uterine opposition [^116nHVgh] [^114UUsY1] [^116Rk1LU]. I need to ensure I include management guidance; RCOG advises against systemic estrogen-only therapy in women with a uterus and supports continuous progestogen strategies including a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system as a progestogen source when appropriate, with counseling to report unscheduled bleeding and consideration of evaluation per endocrine guidelines [^113JwhQc] [^112fss9c] [^1145or1i] [^116o1psd]. I should also confirm SOGC recommendations relevant to endometrial protection; for hyperplasia without atypia, levonorgestrel IUS is first-line, which reflects its strong local endometrial progestogenic effect, a principle leveraged by many clinicians needing reliable uterine protection during estrogen therapy [^113RpfGV].

> But wait, what if someone argues that high salivary or capillary levels prove adequate absorption; I should double-check the PK nuance — post-cream application salivary and fingertip capillary progesterone are high while venous serum is low, indicating compartmental differences that do not translate into reliable uterine exposure, which is why biopsy data show failure despite apparently "high" salivary numbers [^111AaL9j] [^117N77iA]. Hold on, let me address the "bioidentical compounded creams are safer" claim; absence of evidence of endometrial protection, coupled with documented potency variability and lack of regulatory trials, does not support safety or efficacy for this indication, making such claims unsubstantiated [^112Bwetc] [^113NiyJm]. I should also emphasize that lack of bleeding is not proof of protection; endometrial hyperplasia can be silent, and in the studies summarizing cream use, hyperplasia and proliferation were found even in asymptomatic women [^112herxj] [^113q2S8s].

> Putting this together, I need to be clear and clinically direct: No, progesterone creams do not provide reliable uterine protection during systemic estrogen therapy, based on inadequate systemic exposure, biopsy-demonstrated failure to oppose estrogen, and lack of regulatory-grade evidence, whereas oral micronized progesterone regimens and intrauterine progestogen reliably protect when used at established doses [^111AaL9j] [^112herxj] [^111MQy1D] [^113jmok2] [^113RpfGV]. My clinical recommendation, after verifying dosing and contraindications, is to avoid relying on transdermal progesterone creams for endometrial protection and instead use an FDA-approved oral micronized progesterone regimen such as 200 mg daily for 12 days each month with sequential estrogen or continuous 100 mg daily in a continuous-combined estradiol/progesterone capsule, or consider a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system as the progestogen source, with counseling to promptly report unscheduled bleeding and evaluation per guidelines if bleeding persists [^111MQy1D] [^113jmok2] [^112fss9c] [^116o1psd].

No, progesterone cream does not reliably protect the uterus because it delivers **insufficient systemic levels** [^111AaL9j] to oppose estrogen and prevent endometrial hyperplasia or cancer [^112herxj]. Clinical trials show **inadequate endometrial protection** with topical progesterone, and major guidelines (NAMS, ACOG, FDA) do not recommend it for this purpose [^112Bwetc]. For women on estrogen therapy with a uterus, use only FDA-approved oral or vaginal progesterone or progestins at established doses [^111MQy1D].

## Pharmacokinetics and absorption of progesterone cream

- **Low systemic absorption**: Topical progesterone creams produce low serum levels [^111AaL9j], typically below the luteal threshold (~5 ng/mL) needed for endometrial protection [^112herxj].

- **Salivary vs serum levels**: Salivary progesterone rises after topical use [^111AaL9j], but serum levels remain low, indicating limited systemic availability [^117N77iA].

- **Formulation variability**: Compounded creams show significant dose variability [^113NiyJm], leading to inconsistent absorption and unreliable endometrial protection [^1118NzTV].

---

## Clinical evidence on endometrial protection

- **Insufficient endometrial protection**: Trials of topical progesterone (40–64 mg/day) with estrogen report inadequate protection: 27% endometrial proliferation and 5% complex hyperplasia in one study [^112herxj].

- **Histological evidence**: Biopsies after topical progesterone often show proliferative or hyperplastic endometrium, indicating insufficient opposition to estrogen [^112herxj].

- **Comparison with approved formulations**: Oral micronized progesterone (200 mg/day for 12 days/month) [^111MQy1D] and vaginal progesterone (100–200 mg/day) reliably prevent hyperplasia; topical creams do not.

---

## Guidelines and professional recommendations

- **North American Menopause Society (NAMS)**: Topical progesterone creams are not recommended for endometrial protection due to inadequate systemic absorption and lack of evidence [^116nHVgh] [^112herxj].

- **American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)**: ACOG does not recommend topical progesterone creams for endometrial protection; use only FDA-approved oral or vaginal progesterone or progestins.

- **FDA stance**: The FDA does not recognize topical progesterone creams as effective for endometrial protection; they are not approved for this indication [^113PdyLb] [^111MQy1D].

## Risks associated with inadequate endometrial protection

Inadequate progesterone exposure increases the risk of **endometrial hyperplasia**, a precursor to endometrial cancer [^113q2S8s] [^1157dZfP]. Chronic unopposed estrogen significantly increases **endometrial cancer risk**, and insufficient progesterone opposition does not offset this risk [^114UUsY1]. Inadequate endometrial protection can also cause **abnormal uterine bleeding**, necessitating evaluation and intervention [^116o1psd] [^1145or1i].

---

## Alternative progesterone formulations for uterine protection

| **Formulation** | **Dose** | **Route** | **Endometrial protection** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Oral micronized progesterone | 200 mg/day for 12 days/month | Oral | Effective [^111MQy1D] |
| Medroxyprogesterone acetate | 5–10 mg/day for 12 days/month | Oral | Effective [^112qkhjT] |
| Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system | 20 µg/day | Intrauterine | Highly effective [^113RpfGV] |
| Vaginal progesterone gel | 90 mg/day | Vaginal | Effective [^117VwNRA] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Progesterone cream **does not provide reliable uterine protection** because of low systemic absorption and inconsistent dosing [^113PdyLb]. Clinicians should **use only FDA-approved oral or vaginal progesterone or progestins** at established doses to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in women with a uterus receiving estrogen therapy [^114UUsY1].

In contrast, compounded hormone therapy (HT) is not reviewed and approved by the FDA, and makers of compounded HT are not required to conduct the costly trials needed to prove the safety and efficacy of the medications they create. Compounded hormones that have inadequate bioavailability or do not contain the correct amounts of estrogens and progestogen may fail to protect the uterus. Several studies that evaluated compounded transdermal progesterone creams and gels in postmenopausal women observed post-treatment serum levels of progesterone far below the luteal level of 5 ng/mL.

- **Wren et al**: Reported serum levels of progesterone similar to baseline levels among 21 women treated with a 100-μg estradiol patch plus up to 64 mg of progesterone cream daily for three 28-day cycles. In addition, a biopsy after cycle 3 showed that 13 women developed endometrial proliferation during the study.
- **Vashisht et al**: Treated postmenopausal women (N = 54) with a compounded cream delivering progesterone 40 mg/day and with a compounded gel delivering estradiol 1 mg/day for 48 weeks. Biopsy results at the study's conclusion showed that the progesterone had provided insufficient endometrial protection for 32% of participants: 27% had endometrial proliferation and 5% had complex hyperplasia.

Many US women turned to compounded HT after findings from the Women's Health Initiative indicated that the risks of HT (used to prevent chronic diseases) outweighed its benefits. Surveys suggested that some women have been persuaded by marketing claims from compounding pharmacies that compounded hormones — also sometimes referred to in a more favorable light — could be a safer alternative.

### Percutaneous progesterone delivery via cream or gel application in postmenopausal women: a randomized cross-over study of progesterone levels in serum, whole blood, saliva, and capillary blood [^111AaL9j]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

This study aims to investigate the distribution of progesterone in venous whole blood, venous serum, fingertip capillary blood, and saliva after its topical application in both cream and gel formulations.

- **Methods**: Ten postmenopausal women were randomized to receive 80 mg of progesterone cream or gel applied daily for 14 days, crossing over following a 14-day washout. On the last day of each treatment period, venous blood, fingertip capillary blood, and saliva were sampled frequently for 24 hours after the final application.

- **Results**: After progesterone cream or gel application, serum progesterone levels rose gradually, reaching a peak at 9 and 8 hours, respectively; AUC(0–24) h was significantly higher with cream (12.39 vs. 8.32 ng h mL(-1), P = 0.0391). Whole venous blood levels followed a pattern similar to that of serum but were considerably lower. Saliva progesterone showed a peak at 1 and 6 hours after cream and gel application, respectively, and C(max) was comparable with cream and gel. Saliva AUC(0–24) h was substantially higher than the corresponding area under the curve for serum or whole blood, but did not differ significantly by delivery method (39.02 and 58.37 ng h mL(-1), P = 0.69). In capillary blood, C(max) was reached at the same time (8 h) and was similar with both formulations; AUC(0–24) h was also similar with both formulations (1,056 ng h mL(-1) for cream and 999 ng h mL(-1) for gel) but was dramatically higher than the corresponding areas under the curve for venous serum and whole blood.

- **Conclusions**: After application of topical progesterone, saliva and capillary blood showed higher AUC values compared to venous serum and whole blood.

### Determination of estradiol and progesterone content in capsules and creams from compounding pharmacies [^113NiyJm]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

In general, the safety of compounded products has been a government concern for the last two decades, including issues over potency (too weak or too strong), purity (substances that could be harmful), and contamination (bacteria, fungus, or virus). Compounded drugs are not subject to the same US FDA regulations or oversight as other non-compounding products and are not routinely tested by any regulatory agency for quality, purity, or potency. Thus, some compounded products, including hormone therapy (HT), may be associated with increased risks.

Because the dose, duration, and ratio of estrogens to progesterone are well known to affect endometrial protection, ensuring the accuracy of the dose of the estrogen and progestogen components used for HT is critical. Improperly formulated HT combinations could have serious health consequences, such as endometrial cancer, in users. However, because compounded drugs are not systematically studied, limited safety reports are available. A few publications reported cases of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer with the use of custom-compounded estradiol and progesterone products prescribed to relieve menopausal symptoms. For example, one of the women diagnosed with atypical endometrial hyperplasia used a 2% compounded topical estradiol gel and a 6% compounded topical progesterone gel daily. A North American Menopause Society (NAMS) survey of postmenopausal women with menopausal symptoms also reported an increased risk of endometrial cancer and suggested an increase in vaginal bleeding with compounded HT compared with US FDA-approved HT.

Regarding specific circumstances for endometrial hyperplasia, particularly in patients receiving hormonal replacement therapy, the BSGE/RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend not offering systemic estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy to females with a uterus.

### A comparative review of the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy regimens [^112rh8Ne]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative, a large randomized, placebo-controlled trial, investigated the effect of conjugated equine estrogens combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate on specific potential long-term benefits and risks. A review of the clinical studies examined different types and regimens of estrogens combined with progestins to assess the applicability of the Women's Health Initiative results to hormone replacement therapy regimens in general. The studies reviewed were limited to randomized clinical trials and observational studies published over the last 15 years (1987–2002), as well as meta-analyses and reviews that included literature prior to 1987.

The Women's Health Initiative identified increased risks for venous thromboembolism, stroke, coronary heart disease, and breast cancer. These risks have also been reported with postmenopausal hormone therapies containing various estrogen and progestin products. While the beneficial effects noted in the Women's Health Initiative regarding reductions in fractures and colorectal cancer have not been evaluated in large, randomized controlled trials using different estrogen/progestin combinations, observational trials employing a variety of estrogen or hormone replacement therapy products and randomized clinical studies evaluating bone mineral density (an excellent predictor of fracture risk) suggest that results would likely be similar.

### Guideline no. 390-classification and management of endometrial hyperplasia [^113RpfGV]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for endometrial hyperplasia, specifically with respect to progestin therapy, the SOGC 2019 guidelines recommend offering the levonorgestrel intrauterine system as first-line therapy in patients with endometrial hyperplasia without atypia. This recommendation is due to its effectiveness, favorable side effect profile, and the possibility of maintaining it for 5 years in patients responding to treatment.

### A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% in postmenopausal women with vaginal dryness as the most bothersome symptom [^1127qkU4]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). High credibility.

This study was conducted in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for GCP guidelines and in accordance with the ethical principles originating from the Declaration of Helsinki and the US FDA Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, parts 50, 56, and 312. The protocol was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards and all participants provided written informed consent.

- **Study design**: This was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in postmenopausal women reporting vaginal dryness due to VVA as the most bothersome symptom. Following screening and baseline assessments, participants were randomized (1:1) to estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% (15 μg estradiol; 0.5 g of cream) or placebo cream (0.5 g of cream). During the 2-week initial treatment period, estradiol and placebo creams were applied vaginally every day for 2 weeks to rapidly maximize the vaginal response. Dosages for both treatments were then reduced to two maintenance applications per week for 10 weeks. After completing the 12-week trial, participants who had an intact uterus at baseline were provided a progestin for 14 days; the type and dose of progestin were determined at the discretion of the investigator.

### Endometrial effects, bleeding control, and compliance with a new postmenopausal hormone therapy regimen based on transdermal estradiol gel and every-other-day vaginal progesterone in capsules: A 3-year pilot study [^112HYZPu]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

In a 3-year prospective study, 30 postmenopausal women received transdermal E2 gel and every-other-day vaginal P in capsules. At study completion, endometrial thickness was significantly reduced compared with baseline (2.7 ± 0.5 mm vs. 3.4 ± 0.9 mm); endometrial biopsy showed endometrial atrophy in all cases, and amenorrhea was achieved in 92.6% of cycles. Excellent patient satisfaction was also reported.

### Crinone [^117VwNRA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical pharmacology:

Progesterone is a naturally occurring steroid that is secreted by the ovary, placenta, and adrenal gland. In the presence of adequate estrogen, progesterone transforms a proliferative endometrium into a secretory endometrium. It is essential for the development of decidual tissue, and the effect of progesterone on the differentiation of glandular epithelia and stroma has been extensively studied.

Progesterone is necessary to increase endometrial receptivity for the implantation of an embryo. Once an embryo is implanted, it acts to maintain the pregnancy. Normal or near-normal endometrial responses to oral estradiol and intramuscular progesterone have been noted in functionally agonadal women through the sixth decade of life. Furthermore, progesterone administration decreases the circulatory levels of gonadotropins.

### Endometrial safety of low-dose vaginal estrogens in menopausal women: A systematic evidence review [^116XyXTU]. Menopause (2019). High credibility.

Endometrial histology was reported in 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of menopausal women who used various doses and durations of vaginal estrogen creams, tablets, inserts, or rings. Multiple products were used in some studies. From a total of 2,983 unique women exposed to vaginal estrogen products for up to 1 year (with 66 women exposed to multiple doses), 1 case of endometrial cancer (0.03%) and 12 cases of hyperplasia (0.4%; including a case of hyperplasia in an endometrial polyp) were detected.

### Endometrial safety of low-dose vaginal estrogens in menopausal women: A systematic evidence review [^1159SWff]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Vaginal estradiol tablets, with doses ranging from 10 to 50 μg, were evaluated in 10 studies involving 721 unique women, with durations ranging from 3 weeks to 2 years. Of these, 66 women were exposed to multiple doses as part of crossover study designs in two RCTs.

Eight RCTs evaluated vaginal estradiol tablets at 25 μg; one trial also included an estradiol vaginal tablet of 50 μg evaluated in 20 women. Out of a total of 490 women exposed to 25 μg for 3 to 52 weeks, there were three reports of endometrial hyperplasia: two cases after 3 weeks of treatment, and one after 12 weeks. No reports of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer were observed in women exposed to 50 μg.

One report of simple hyperplasia without atypia (1/32; 3.1%) was observed in a woman treated with a 25-μg vaginal estradiol tablet after 12 weeks of therapy; no other endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy was found at week 52. In a study of women who used a 25-μg vaginal estradiol tablet for 3 weeks before genital prolapse surgery without baseline biopsies, 2 of 22 (9.1%) women had "simple hyperplastic endometrium without epithelial atypia", with normal atrophic endometrium observed 1 month later in both women.

Studies with lower doses of vaginal estradiol were also reported. Two RCTs evaluated a vaginal 10-μg estradiol tablet in a total of 297 women for 12 to 52 weeks. The first study was 12 weeks in duration, and no endometrial hyperplasia or cancer was observed for the vaginal estradiol tablet (10 μg; n = 92). The second study was a 52-week RCT (n = 205), which identified one case of…

### Management of endometrial hyperplasia (Green-top guideline no. 67) [^1153Bzkr]. RCOG (2016). High credibility.

The BSGE/RCOG 2016 guidelines address specific circumstances of endometrial hyperplasia, particularly for patients receiving tamoxifen. The guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems for patients with breast cancer receiving tamoxifen. This caution is due to the unknown effects on breast cancer recurrence risk. However, there is evidence that levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems prevent polyp formation and reduce the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia in patients receiving tamoxifen.

### Endometrial hyperplasia: A review [^113q2S8s]. Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey (2004). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on endometrial hyperplasia:

- **Definition**: Endometrial hyperplasia is an abnormal growth of endometrial glands and stroma due to excessive estrogen exposure and can be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of endometrial hyperplasia is primarily driven by chronic exposure to unopposed estrogen, which stimulates the proliferation of endometrial cells, and a deficiency in progesterone, which normally counteracts the effects of estrogen by inducing cell differentiation and apoptosis.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of endometrial hyperplasia is estimated at 133 per 100,000 woman-years, peaking at ages 50–60. The peak incidences of simple, complex, and atypical endometrial hyperplasia are estimated at 142, 213, and 56 per 100,000 woman-years, respectively.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia include obesity, diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and postmenopausal status, all of which can lead to an excess of estrogen. Certain medications, such as tamoxifen and selective estrogen-receptor modulators, can also increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, endometrial hyperplasia most commonly presents with abnormal uterine bleeding, which can manifest as heavy menstrual bleeding or postmenopausal bleeding.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of endometrial hyperplasia varies based on the type of hyperplasia and the presence of atypical cells. While most cases of endometrial hyperplasia are benign, there is a potential for progression to endometrial cancer.

### Transdermal progesterone and its effect on vasomotor symptoms, blood lipid levels, bone metabolic markers, moods, and quality of life for postmenopausal women [^112zV79m]. Menopause (2003). Low credibility.

To determine whether transdermal progesterone cream has any effect on vasomotor symptoms, mood, sexual response, cardiovascular lipid levels, or bone mineral metabolic markers, a parallel, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. Eighty postmenopausal women at the Menopause Centre at the Royal Hospital for Women, Sydney, were randomly allocated to receive either a transdermal cream containing progesterone (32 mg daily) or a placebo cream. Evaluation was done using the Greene Climacteric Scale and the Menopause Quality of Life Questionnaire, along with blood analysis for lipids and bone markers over a 12-week period. Despite a slight elevation of blood progesterone levels, results showed no detectable change in vasomotor symptoms, mood characteristics, sexual feelings, blood lipid levels, or bone metabolic markers. The use of the transdermal route to administer progesterone at 32 mg daily does not seem to allow sufficient hormone to enter the body to achieve a biological effect on lipid levels, bone mineral metabolic markers, vasomotor symptoms, or moods.

### A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% in postmenopausal women with vaginal dryness as the most bothersome symptom [^113BpQZB]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). Low credibility.

In contrast to the FDA-approved vaginal estrogen creams currently on the market, such as Premarin® (0.625 mg/g) and Estrace® 0.01% (0.1 mg/g), estradiol 0.003% provides a lower vaginal dose of 30 μg/g (15 μg/0.5g in this study) per application. This is similar to the lower dose vaginal estradiol tablets currently available in the US (10–25 μg/tablet). This approach aligns with the FDA and NAMS recommendations to use the lowest effective vaginal estrogen dose for VVA treatment to reduce systemic exposure.

Additional justification to prescribe appropriately low estrogen doses is that many postmenopausal women with VVA using a prescription estrogen treatment have concerns over long-term safety, hormone exposure, and general side effects, which may negatively impact medication adherence. Furthermore, local application of low-dose local estrogen may be an appropriate treatment for some women who have moderate to severe VVA and for whom systemic absorption of estrogen might present greater risk than benefit.

Treatment with the estradiol cream was well tolerated, as indicated by the similar rates of TEAEs and related discontinuations between the two treatment groups. One exception is that vulvovaginal mycotic infections were more frequent in the estradiol group. This finding was not unexpected and may reflect the impact of estrogen on decreasing vaginal pH, a shift in the vaginal biome, or a direct effect of estrogen on candida species. No serious TEAEs were considered treatment-related or led to discontinuations, and no deaths occurred.

### Salivary, but not serum or urinary, levels of progesterone are elevated after topical application of progesterone cream to pre-and postmenopausal women [^117N77iA]. Clinical Endocrinology (2000). Low credibility.

Use of topically applied micronised ('natural') progesterone as a substitute for synthetic oestrogens and progestogen preparations is controversial. This study aimed to examine the changes in blood and salivary concentrations of progesterone following a single topical application of a progesterone cream.

- **Patients and measurements**: We investigated six premenopausal women in the luteal phase and six postmenopausal women to determine the short-term changes in serum, urinary and salivary progesterone concentrations following a single 64 mg topical application of micronised progesterone.

- **Results**: Serum progesterone concentrations did not increase during the first 3 hours after application of progesterone cream; however, salivary values rose significantly in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. This is consistent with the view that progesterone is absorbed and transported through the body. Salivary progesterone concentrations were significantly elevated above basal levels by 30–60 minutes and reached peak levels at 1–4 hours, with mean levels approximately fivefold higher in premenopausal than in postmenopausal women.

- **Conclusions**: Salivary progesterone measurements confirm that topically applied progesterone is absorbed, despite the lack of change in serum progesterone concentrations. However, at the dose administered, serum progesterone levels do not reach those observed after oral or vaginally delivered progesterone preparations. Higher doses may be required to induce biological responses within the endometrium.

### Efficacy of progestin-only treatment for the management of menopausal symptoms: a systematic review [^116Uevcw]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

Menopause is associated with bothersome symptoms for many women, including mood changes, hot flushes, sleep problems, and fatigue. Progesterone is commonly prescribed in combination with estrogen therapy. Although monotherapy with progestins has been used as a treatment of menopausal symptoms in women with contraindications to estrogens, the optimal route and dosage of progestin monotherapy has not been established.

- **Objective**: To assess whether progestin as a standalone treatment is effective for treating vasomotor and mood symptoms associated with menopause.

- **Evidence review**: We conducted a systematic review using PubMed and Embase databases from January 1980 to January 2020. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated different forms of progestin for the treatment of vasomotor or mood symptoms associated with menopause.

- **Findings**: A systematic search of 892 studies identified seven RCTs involving a total of 601 patients. The available literature was heterogeneous in terms of formulation and dose of progesterone; administration ranged from 5 to 60 mg of transdermal progesterone, 10 to 20 mg oral medroxyprogesterone acetate, and 300 mg of oral micronized progesterone. The duration of treatment also differed between studies, ranging from 21 days to 12 months (median: 12 weeks). Three of seven RCTs reported that progestin therapy led to an improvement of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in postmenopausal women. The largest study administering oral progestin using 300 mg micronized progesterone reported a 58.9% improvement in VMS compared to 23.5% in the placebo group.

### What providers need to know about progestogens in hormone therapy [^116P3aWU]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

Progestogens, such as micronized progesterone and synthetic progestins, are characterized by their ability to transform the estrogen-primed proliferative endometrium into secretory endometrium. Although more than 200 progestogens have been synthesized, only a few are employed clinically in hormone therapy. Clinicians caring for menopausal women should be familiar with the clinical properties and characteristics of the three most-used progestogens for hormone therapy: micronized progesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and norethindrone acetate.

### Progestogens in hormonal replacement therapy: New molecules, risks, and benefits [^113ZxjFf]. Menopause (2002). Low credibility.

While the benefits of progestogen use in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are well recognized, particularly concerning endometrial protection, their risks and drawbacks have sparked controversy. Several risks are attributed to progestogens as a class effect; however, the progestogens used in HRT have varying pharmacological properties and do not induce the same side effects.

Natural progesterone (P) and some derivatives, such as the 19-norprogesterones (Nestorone, nomegestrol acetate, trimegestone), do not bind to the androgen receptor and, hence, do not exert androgenic side effects. Newly synthesized molecules such as drospirenone or dienogest have no androgenic effect but do possess a partial antiandrogenic effect. Drospirenone, derived from spironolactone, binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor.

When considering cardiovascular risk factors, some molecules with higher androgenic potency may attenuate the beneficial effects of estrogens on the lipid profile and vasomotion. Conversely, other progestogens devoid of androgenic properties do not exert these deleterious effects. Epidemiological data do not suggest any negative effect of progestogens, when administered with estrogens, on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. However, recent results indicate that in women with established coronary heart disease, HRT may not protect against further heart attacks if the selected progestogen possesses androgenic properties.

The data related to the progestogen effect on breast tissue has been interpreted differently.

### Breast cancer after use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone: Analyses of data from 2 Women's Health Initiative randomized clinical trials [^1148X84h]. JAMA Oncology (2015). High credibility.

Use of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) continues in clinical practice, but reports are conflicting concerning the longer-term breast cancer effects of relatively short-term use. This study aims to report the longer-term influence of menopausal HT on breast cancer incidence in the two Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trials.

A total of 27,347 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years were enrolled at 40 US centers from 1993 to 1998 and followed up for a median of 13 years through September 2010.

- **Interventions**: A total of 16,608 women with a uterus were randomized to conjugated equine estrogens (0.625 mg/d [estrogen]) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg/d [progestin]) (E+P) or placebo with a median intervention duration of 5.6 years. Additionally, 10,739 women with prior hysterectomy were randomized to conjugated equine estrogens alone (0.625 mg/d) or placebo with a median intervention duration of 7.2 years.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Time-specific invasive breast cancer incidence rates and exploratory analyses of breast cancer characteristics by intervention and post-intervention phases in the two HT trials were assessed.

In the E+P trial, hazard ratios (HRs) for the influence of combined HT on breast cancer were lower than 1 for two years (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47–1.08) and steadily increased throughout the intervention. They became significantly increased for the entire intervention phase (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.01–1.53). In the early post-intervention phase (within 2.75 years from intervention), there was a sharp decrease in breast cancer incidence rates.

### Pharmacokinetics of the first combination 17β-estradiol/progesterone capsule in clinical development for menopausal hormone therapy [^113PdyLb]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

The ability to combine the natural hormones 17β-estradiol (estradiol) and progesterone in a single-dose form to treat menopause symptoms while providing endometrial protection would be clinically useful. A comprehensive search suggests that no single drug combining these two hormones has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A product that combines 17β-estradiol with progesterone and offers good bioavailability of both hormones is difficult to achieve biochemically. Progesterone has poor bioavailability — it is highly lipophilic and undergoes a complex metabolic process, making it difficult to administer orally or transdermally. Administering clinically effective oral doses of estradiol and progesterone together in a formulation that does not compromise the bioavailability of either hormone is challenging because of differences in their structure and solubility.

Many compounding pharmacies manufacture products that combine estrogen and progesterone. Considering the poor bioavailability of oral and transdermal progesterone and the difficulty in determining the appropriate ratio of progesterone to estradiol, compounded hormone products should be viewed with caution. Pharmacokinetic studies of products manufactured by compounding pharmacies, aimed at ensuring adequate bioavailability, are rarely performed, and few clinical trials have appropriately evaluated the safety and efficacy of compounded hormones. For example, despite the widespread use of custom-compounded progesterone gels and creams, no evidence exists to show that any of them effectively opposes estradiol.

### Management of premenstrual syndrome: Green-top guideline No. 48 [^1148VWsS]. BJOG (2017). High credibility.

The 2017 RCOG guidelines recommend considering a cyclical 10–12 day course of oral or vaginal progesterone, or long-term progestogen with a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (52 mg), to prevent endometrial hyperplasia in patients with premenstrual syndrome receiving percutaneous estradiol.

### Estradiol and progesterone bioavailability for moderate to severe vasomotor symptom treatment and endometrial protection with the continuous-combined regimen of TX-001HR (oral estradiol and progesterone capsules) [^113jmok2]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Historically, very high oral doses of crystalline P4 were needed to have biological effects due to low absorption. Better absorption was achieved with micronized P4 particles suspended in an oil-based formulation. Creating a product that combines E2 and P4 in a single oral pill has also been challenging due to the differing structures and solubilities of E2 and P4, which could have resulted in poor P4 bioavailability. The unique formulation of TX-001HR allows E2 and P4 to be combined in a single softgel capsule, while retaining pharmacologically effective absorption of both E2 and P4 as shown in this report.

The REPLENISH trial is the first randomized controlled trial, powered to detect endometrial hyperplasia, to show that continuous daily use of oral 100 mg P4 with 0.5 or 1 mg E2 can protect postmenopausal women from endometrial hyperplasia. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that sequential use of oral 200 mg P4 for 12 to 14 days each cycle may offer protection against estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia.

- **Postmenopausal estrogen/progestin interventions (PEPI) trial**: The PEPI trial was the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the potential protective effect of P4 on the endometrium from estrogen-induced stimulation. While the PEPI study was not fully powered to demonstrate endometrial protection, women taking 200 mg P4 cyclically for 12 days plus 0.625 mg CEE for up to 36 months had rates of endometrial hyperplasia similar to that of placebo. On the contrary, two European observational studies — the Étude Épidémiologique Auprès de Femmes de l'Éducation Nationale (E3N) — showed different findings.

### Bleeding patterns of the hormone replacement therapies in the postmenopausal estrogen and progestin interventions trial [^1145Kf7M]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

To explore whether significant differences exist between bleeding patterns with common regimens of hormone replacement therapy using two different progestogens, a study was conducted. A total of 875 women in the Postmenopausal Estrogen and Progestin Interventions Trial participated. They were assigned to either a placebo group or one of the hormone replacement regimens:

- 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) alone
- CEE 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg in a continuous fashion
- CEE 0.625 mg daily plus cyclical medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg
- CEE 0.625 mg daily plus cyclical micronized progesterone 200 mg/day for 12 days per month

Bleeding days, amounts, and episodes were meticulously recorded in diaries, aggregated at 6-month intervals over a period of 3 years, for the 596 participants with an intact uterus. Any bleeding for women on continuous regimens, or more than 6 episodes of bleeding per 6-month period for cyclical regimens, was regarded as excess.

Conjugated equine estrogen plus cyclical micronized progesterone was associated with fewer excess episodes of bleeding than the continuous regimen of conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate during the first 6 months. The amount of bleeding with the CEE plus cyclical micronized progesterone was consistently less than with CEE plus cyclical medroxyprogesterone acetate over 30 months, and the number of bleeding days was reduced throughout the study's duration. Overall, the 3-year cumulative quantities, days, and episodes of bleeding were significantly lower in participants using CEE with cyclical micronized progesterone compared to those using CEE with medroxyprogesterone acetate.

### A randomized, multicenter, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% in postmenopausal women with dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom [^113gfPT9]. Menopause (2018). High credibility.

Postmenopausal women were recruited if they met at least one of the following criteria: (1) ≥ 40 years of age with hysterectomy and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels > 40 mIU/mL; (2) ≥ 35 years of age with bilateral oophorectomy and FSH levels > 40 mIU/mL; (3) ≥ 40 years of age with 12 months of amenorrhea; or (4) ≥ 40 years of age with 6 months of amenorrhea and FSH levels > 40 mIU/mL. Participants were also required to self-identify as sexually active and experiencing dyspareunia of moderate–severe intensity that was considered by the participants to be the most bothersome vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) symptom. Additional inclusion criteria included ≤ 5% superficial cells on a vaginal cytology smear, vaginal pH > 5.0, documentation of a negative mammogram if > 40 years of age, and a normal clinical breast examination before enrollment.

Exclusion criteria for the study were as follows: untreated hypertension, porphyria, abnormal history of or suspected genetic component for thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders, or abnormal Pap smear at screening suggestive of at least a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Participants could not be using vaginal (e.g. creams, gels, rings) or transdermal estrogen products within 4 weeks, hormonal intrauterine devices or oral estrogen products within 8 weeks, progestin implants or estrogen injections within 3 months, or estrogen pellet or progestin injections within 6 months of screening.

### Hormonal contraception and HIV-1 acquisition: Biological mechanisms [^115xqy42]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

The effects on the structure of the endometrium, cervix, and vagina are influenced by the dose, duration, and type of progestin, as well as whether it is administered in combination with estrogen. Estradiol alone (1 mg of micronized E2 or 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens) was a commonly used hormone replacement therapy in the 1970s until clinical studies identified a link between unopposed estradiol and endometrial cancer. Studies reported incidence rates of 15% to 22% for endometrial hyperplasia, with abnormal cytology and glandular structure being particularly associated with progression to carcinoma. However, the administration of low-dose progestins combined with estradiol appeared to mitigate this risk.

The formulations of COC exhibit both estrogenic and progestogenic effects on the endometrium, with the progestin effect becoming predominant due to the downregulation of estrogen receptors (ERs) after several cycles. Consequently, the initial few cycles display both proliferative and secretory characteristics, followed by atrophic changes in both glands and stroma with continued use. Blood vessels also become thinner and sinusoidal with extended use. The most common oral progestin formulation is norethisterone (NET), whereas implants typically contain etonogestrel (ETG) or levonorgestrel (LNG). In Southern Africa, most COCs contain LNG. The histological changes are similar across these progestins, with long-term use resulting in endometrial atrophy characterized by small and sparse glands that have lost their tortuosity and are lined by low columnar cells.

### Role of progestogen in hormone therapy for postmenopausal women: Position statement of The North American Menopause Society [^116nHVgh]. Menopause (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this position statement is to create an evidence-based guideline regarding the role of progestogen in postmenopausal hormone therapy (estrogen plus progestogen, or EPT) for managing menopause-related symptoms.

NAMS employed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this document. Clinicians and researchers acknowledged as experts in the field of postmenopausal hormone therapy were enlisted to review evidence from medical literature and develop a position statement for approval by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

The primary role of progestogen in postmenopausal hormone therapy is endometrial protection. Unopposed estrogen therapy (ET) is associated with a significantly increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma. Adding the appropriate dose and duration of progestogen to ET has been shown to lower that risk to the level found in never-users of ET. The clinical goal of progestogen in EPT is to provide endometrial protection while maintaining estrogen benefits and minimizing progestogen-induced side effects, particularly uterine bleeding. EPT discontinuance correlates with uterine bleeding; women with more days of amenorrhea have higher rates of continuance. All US Food and Drug Administration-approved progestogen formulations will provide endometrial protection if the dose and duration are adequate. Progestogens may diminish the beneficial effects of ET on cardiovascular risk factors. However, no EPT (or ET) regimen should be initiated for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular conditions.

### Provera [^114V63VE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon the duration of use and could last for more than ten years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated an increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater and became apparent earlier with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations or routes of administration.

Use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.

All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

- **Endometrial cancer**: An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about two to twelve times greater.

### Progesterone action in endometrial cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and breast cancer [^111RwuLv]. Endocrine Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Progesterone receptor (PR) mediates the actions of the ovarian steroid progesterone, which, together with estradiol, regulates gonadotropin secretion, prepares the endometrium for implantation, maintains pregnancy, and differentiates breast tissue. The separation of estrogen and progesterone actions in hormone-responsive tissues remains a challenge. Pathologies of the uterus and breast, including endometrial cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and breast cancer, are highly associated with estrogen, which is considered to be the mitogenic factor. Emerging evidence supports distinct roles of progesterone and its influence on the pathogenesis of these diseases.

Progesterone antagonizes estrogen-driven growth in the endometrium, and insufficient progesterone action strikingly increases the risk of endometrial cancer. In endometriosis, eutopic and ectopic tissues do not respond sufficiently to progesterone and are considered progesterone-resistant, contributing to proliferation and survival. In uterine fibroids, progesterone promotes growth by increasing proliferation, cellular hypertrophy, and deposition of the extracellular matrix. In normal mammary tissue and breast cancer, progesterone is pro-proliferative and carcinogenic.

A key difference between these tissues that could explain the diverse effects of progesterone is the paracrine interactions of PR-expressing stroma and epithelium. Normal endometrium is a mucosa containing large quantities of distinct stromal cells with abundant PR, which influences epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation and protects against carcinogenesis.

### Estrace [^1157dZfP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogen/progestin combinations is important (see PRECAUTIONS). Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

- **Breast cancer**: The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09.

### Medroxyprogesterone acetate [^112qkhjT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a 3-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 356 nonhysterectomized, postmenopausal women aged between 45 and 64 years, participants were randomized to receive either a placebo (n = 119), 0.625 mg conjugated estrogen only (n = 119), or 0.625 mg conjugated estrogen plus cyclic MPA (n = 118). Results demonstrated a reduced risk of endometrial hyperplasia in the treatment group receiving 10 mg MPA plus 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens compared to the group receiving 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens only.

In a second 1-year study, 832 postmenopausal women between 45 and 65 years of age were treated with 0.625 mg conjugated estrogen daily (days 1–28), plus either 5 mg cyclic MPA or 10 mg cyclic MPA (days 15–28), or daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogen only. The treatment groups receiving either 5 or 10 mg cyclic MPA (days 15–28) plus daily conjugated estrogens exhibited a significantly lower rate of hyperplasia compared to the conjugated estrogens only group.

### Estrogel [^116Rk1LU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, it is generally advisable to consider the addition of a progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus typically does not need to use a progestogen in addition to her estrogen therapy. In certain cases, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may require a progestogen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.14)].

Estrogen-alone or in combination with a progestogen should be used at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Periodic reevaluation of postmenopausal women is necessary to determine the ongoing necessity of treatment.

- **Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause**: Estrogel 0.06% 1.25 g per day is the approved dose for treating moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. The lowest effective dose for this indication has not yet been determined. Prior to using the canister for the first time, it must be primed by removing the large canister cover and fully depressing the pump five times. Any unused gel should be discarded by rinsing it down the sink or placing it in household trash. After priming, the pump is ready for use. The recommended application area is the arm, with a thin layer applied over the entire inside and outside of the arm from wrist to shoulder.

- **Treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause**: Estrogel 0.06% 1.25 g per day is the approved dosage.

### Endometrial safety of low-dose vaginal estrogens in menopausal women: A systematic evidence review [^112XndL3]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Inclusion criteria: Abstracts were independently reviewed by four reviewers who initially determined from the title and abstract if the article met eligibility criteria for full-text review. These criteria included studies using vaginal estrogens in menopausal women for reasons such as vulvar and vaginal atrophy, urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary tract infections. Endometrial histology was necessary to identify cases of endometrial cancer or hyperplasia, except in larger cohort studies where incidence rates were reported. Citations were included for full-text review if it was not stated or clear from the abstract whether any endometrial histologic data were reported, including endometrial cancer, hyperplasia, or proliferation.

From the full-text review, primary studies were eligible for review if they reported endometrial histology data obtained from a biopsy in menopausal women using vaginal estrogens or the incidence of endometrial cancer and/or hyperplasia in menopausal women who used vaginal estrogens in larger cohort studies. Articles were excluded if they reported no use of vaginal estrogen, the use of vaginal rings with a progestogen, the exclusive use of estriol or other non-US-approved estrogens, no endometrial histology, or unrelated content. General reviews or editorials, abstracts of studies now fully published, or duplicate publications were also excluded. No studies reporting endometrial histology in women using vaginal estrogens were excluded.

### Determination of estradiol and progesterone content in capsules and creams from compounding pharmacies [^116umsp4]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Estradiol and progesterone are highly potent molecules with low aqueous solubility. These characteristics make them a challenge to formulate consistently. Specifically, progesterone is classified as a Biopharmaceutical Classification System Class II drug (poorly soluble-highly permeable); thus, its bioavailability is associated with its solvation rate and is greatly impacted by how it is formulated.

Testing steroid hormone products from compounding pharmacies shows that the dose of the product received may differ from the prescribed dose. When we evaluated estradiol and progesterone doses in compounded, combined estradiol and progesterone formulations and determined the consistency of these formulations across pharmacies and within a batch, variability was observed. Our results showed that for estradiol in capsules, greater variation was evident between pharmacy-compounded capsules (range of mean 0.370–0.525 mg) than in creams (range of mean 0.445–0.507 mg/g). However, within pharmacies, there was more consistency in the capsules (range of % CV 2.66–4.56) than in the creams (range of % CV 2.98–9.17). Similarly, the range of means for progesterone in capsules was 91.4 to 131 mg, and 94.7 to 112 mg/g in creams between pharmacies. Nevertheless, the within-pharmacy consistency was similar between capsules (range of % CV 6.05–7.27) and creams (range of % CV 2.11–7.20).

### Continuous combined hormone replacement therapy and risk of endometrial cancer [^1131Tek3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2000). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal women who receive sequential hormone replacement therapy with estrogen combined with progestogen for 10 to 24 days per month for a prolonged period may have an elevated endometrial cancer risk relative to those who have never received hormone replacement therapy. We investigated whether daily use of estrogen and progestogen (continuous combined hormone replacement therapy) could diminish any excess endometrial cancer risk.

- **Study design**: A population-based study in Washington State obtained interview data from 969 women aged 45 to 74 years with endometrial cancer diagnosed during 1985 through 1991 or 1994 through 1995 and from 1325 age-matched control subjects selected primarily by random digit dialing. Women who had received only continuous combined hormone replacement therapy were compared with women who had only received another hormone replacement therapy regimen or who had never received hormone replacement therapy.

- **Results**: The risk of endometrial cancer among users of continuous combined hormone replacement therapy (n = 9 case patients, n = 33 control subjects) relative to women who had never received hormone replacement therapy was 0.6 (95% confidence interval, 0.3–1.3); the risk relative to women who received hormone replacement that included progestogen for 10 to 24 days per month was 0.4 (95% confidence interval, 0.2–1.1). Most continuous combined hormone replacement therapy use was short-term (< 72 months) or recent (in the previous 24 months).

- **Conclusion**: Women who had received continuous combined hormone replacement therapy for several years did not appear to have an increased risk of endometrial cancer compared to other groups.

### Estradiol and progesterone bioavailability for moderate to severe vasomotor symptom treatment and endometrial protection with the continuous-combined regimen of TX-001HR (oral estradiol and progesterone capsules) [^114x7uJp]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

During the menopause transition, decreases in estrogen may cause women to experience vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and genitourinary symptoms of menopause. Estrogen therapy has been successfully used for several decades for the management of these menopausal symptoms. However, the prolonged use of unopposed estrogens increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. In women with a uterus, the addition of a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to protect the uterus from estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer.

Various combinations of estrogen (conjugated equine estrogens [CEEs], ethinyl estradiol, 17β-estradiol [E2]) and synthetic progestogens (norethindrone acetate, drospirenone, norgestimate, medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA]) products are currently available, including oral and transdermal products. However, oral formulations of E2 and progesterone (P4) in a single capsule have been challenging because of their differences in structure and solubility. As of 2017, no combined oral E2/P4 capsule had been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To address this unmet treatment option, clinicians have been prescribing E2 and P4 products separately to their patients. Many women prefer using E2 and P4, as they are bioidentical to the natural hormones produced by the body.

While up to 21 million US FDA-approved and compounded hormone therapy prescriptions containing P4 were estimated to be filled in the United States per year, serum P4 levels required for endometrial protection in a continuous-combined regimen have yet to be standardized or clearly defined.

Regarding specific circumstances for endometrial hyperplasia, especially in patients receiving hormonal replacement therapy, the BSGE/RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend switching to continuous progestogen with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. Alternatively, consider a continuous combined hormone replacement therapy preparation for patients with endometrial hyperplasia who are taking a sequential hormone replacement therapy and wish to continue this therapy.

### Using progestins in clinical practice [^115GU4nS]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Progestational agents have many important functions, including the regulation of the menstrual cycle, treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, prevention of endometrial cancer and hyperplastic precursor lesions, and contraception. Because of the reported side effects of synthetic analogs called "progestins", there has been interest in replicating the natural hormone for clinical use. Natural progesterone is obtained primarily from plant sources and is currently available in injectable, intravaginal, and oral formulations. An oral micronized progesterone preparation has improved bioavailability and fewer reported side effects compared with synthetic progestins.

Adolescents and perimenopausal women may require progestational agents for the treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding resulting from anovulatory cycles. These agents may also be used in women at risk for endometrial hyperplasia due to chronic unopposed estrogen stimulation. Progestin-only contraceptives can be used in women with contraindications to estrogen; however, efficacy requires rigorous compliance. New progestins for use in combination oral contraceptive pills were specifically developed to reduce androgenic symptoms. It is unclear whether these progestins increase the risk of venous thromboembolic disease. Progestin-only emergency contraception offers a regimen that is more effective than combination oral contraceptive pills, with fewer reported side effects.

### The effect of micronized progesterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate in combination with transdermal estradiol on hemostatic biomarkers in postmenopausal women diagnosed with POI and early menopause: a randomized trial [^112ja8Di]. Menopause (2022). Low credibility.

To compare the impact of micronized progesterone (MP) or medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in combination with transdermal estradiol (t-E2) on traditional coagulation factors and thrombin generation parameters in postmenopausal women diagnosed with premature ovarian insufficiency or early menopause, a randomized prospective trial was conducted. Women diagnosed with premature ovarian insufficiency or early menopause and an intact uterus were recruited over 28 months. All participants were prescribed t-E2 and randomized to either cyclical MP or MPA using a web-based computer randomization software, Graph Pad. Thrombin generation parameters were measured at baseline and repeated after 3 months. Traditional hemostatic biomarkers were measured at baseline and repeated after 3, 6, and 12 months.

A total of seventy-one participants were screened for the study, of whom 66 met the inclusion criteria. In total, 57 participants were randomized: 44 completed the thrombin generation assessment arm of the study, while 32 completed 12 months of the traditional coagulation factor screening component of the trial.

Thrombin generation parameters did not significantly change from baseline following a 3-month duration for either progestogen component when combined with t-E2, unlike the traditional coagulation factors. Protein C activity, free Protein S, and Antithrombin III levels decreased with time in both treatment arms. Fluctuations in traditional hemostatic biomarkers were not reproduced by parallel changes in thrombin generation parameters, which remained neutral in both groups.

### Determination of estradiol and progesterone content in capsules and creams from compounding pharmacies [^113MtCNW]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

While estradiol and progesterone are administered in supraphysiological doses, we believe that a relatively small reduction in dose (e.g. 20%) would impact the endometrial protection in some women. For example, some women may be high metabolizers of steroid hormones, leading to decreased circulating progesterone levels, which may be insufficient for endometrial protection. Small changes in the ratio of estradiol to progesterone could also potentially have a negative impact on the endometrium with long-term exposure. In addition, because we studied only 13 pharmacies, it is possible that greater reductions in dose may have been found in compounded drugs from other pharmacies. A reduced dose in creams would be especially important in women who do not apply the cream as instructed, as the entire dose would not be applied.

This study has a few limitations, including the small number of pharmacies queried, how the pharmacies were chosen (internet only), and the small number of samples tested; therefore, our results may not accurately represent products coming from all US compounding pharmacies. Another limitation of the study is the inherent variability of the RIA method.

### Determination of estradiol and progesterone content in capsules and creams from compounding pharmacies [^1118NzTV]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

To analytically characterize the doses of estradiol and progesterone found in compounded combined forms of oral capsule and transdermal cream formulations, and to determine the consistency of the hormone formulations within a batch, prescriptions for combined estradiol/progesterone capsules (0.5 and 100 mg, respectively) and creams (0.5 and 100 mg/g, respectively) were sent to 15 custom-compounding pharmacies. Estradiol and progesterone levels were measured by radioimmunoassays. Hormone levels were measured in two capsules and two creams from each pharmacy; 10 capsules from three pharmacies; and top/middle/bottom layers of cream containers to assess consistency. The magnitude and sources of variation for the measurements were examined by analysis of variance models.

Thirteen pharmacies filled the prescriptions. Measured estradiol levels were 0.365 to 0.551 mg for capsules and 0.433 to 0.55 mg/g for creams, and progesterone levels were 90.8 to 135 mg for capsules and 93 to 118 mg/g for creams. Greater variations in estradiol levels were observed between pharmacies for estradiol in capsules than in creams; however, measured estradiol levels within pharmacies were more consistent in the capsules than the creams. Similar results were obtained for progesterone levels.

The variations in estradiol and progesterone levels observed in compounded hormone therapy formulations justify concerns regarding risks as a result of variability, which have been outlined by The North American Menopause Society and the American College of Obstetricians.

### Management of endometrial hyperplasia (Green-top guideline No. 67) [^1171hJj9]. RCOG (2016). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for endometrial hyperplasia, especially in patients receiving hormone replacement therapy, the BSGE/RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend reviewing the necessity for continued hormone replacement therapy in patients with endometrial hyperplasia who are on a continuous combined preparation and wish to continue hormone replacement therapy. It is important to discuss the limitations of the available evidence regarding the optimal progestogen regimen in this context. Consider offering the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system as a source of progestogen replacement.

### Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women: Principal results from the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial [^112bLkXm]. JAMA (2002). High credibility.

The study, WHI, was published by Rossouw JE and colleagues in 2002 in the journal JAMA. It is related to the following diseases: coronary artery disease and menopause.

The trial addressed the question: what is the role of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women? The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 16,608 female patients. Participants were healthy postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years with an intact uterus at baseline. Exclusion criteria included any medical condition likely associated with a predicted survival of less than 3 years, prior breast cancer, other cancer within the last 10 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer, low hematocrit or platelet counts, alcoholism, or dementia.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 8506 received estrogen plus progestin (conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in one tablet).
	- n = 8102 received a matching placebo tablet.

- **Primary outcomes**:
	- There was a borderline significant increase in nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death (0.37% vs. 0.3%; HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.63).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in stroke (0.29% vs. 0.21%; HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07).
	- A borderline significant increase in venous thromboembolic disease (0.34% vs. 0.16%; HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.82).
	- A borderline significant decrease in osteoporotic fractures (1.47% vs. 1.91%; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.85).

### Vaginal rings delivering progesterone and estradiol may be a new method of hormone replacement therapy [^113xAEWx]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

To determine whether a low dose of progesterone (P) delivered together with estradiol (E2) from a vaginal ring on a continuous schedule can prevent endometrial proliferation and yield a bleeding pattern dominated by amenorrhea, a longitudinal clinical study was conducted.

- **Setting**: Three university hospitals.

- **Patients**: Fifty-five women aged 45 to 75 years, not hysterectomized, with estradiol levels of < 20 pg/mL and experiencing hot flashes two or more times per day in the past week.

- **Interventions**: A vaginal ring delivering approximately 150 microg/d of 17beta-E2 and either approximately 5 mg/d or approximately 9 mg/d of P was used continuously for either 4 or 6 months.

- **Main outcome measures**: Endometrial thickness, bleeding pattern, and hot flash incidence.

- **Results**: Endometrial proliferation was prevented by both P doses, and bleeding incidence decreased. In months 4, 5, and 6, 8 out of 12 women experienced no bleeding. The incidence of hot flashes and night sweats decreased quickly and significantly.

- **Conclusions**: A vaginal ring delivering E2 and a low dose of P merits further study as a method for long-term hormone replacement therapy.

### Prempro [^116Tuo3p]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies revealed increased risks dependent upon the duration of use, lasting up to over 10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. The extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater and became apparent earlier with estrogen plus progestin therapy compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.

Use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has resulted in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.

All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. Mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.

Endometrial hyperplasia, a possible precursor of endometrial cancer, has been reported to occur at a rate of approximately 1% or less with PREMPRO or PREMPHASE. An increased risk of endometrial cancer has…

### Update on medical and regulatory issues pertaining to compounded and FDA-approved drugs, including hormone therapy [^112Bwetc]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Authors of a systematic literature search for RCTs evaluating compounded progesterone cream for vasomotor symptoms found three RCTs, none of which applied the FDA methodology for assessing endometrial safety. A few observational studies and surveys offered low-level evidence that CBHT improved menopausal symptoms, but most consolidated results for all CBHT used, ignoring differences in hormones, doses, and delivery methods.

### Evaluation of endometrial progesterone receptor expression after 12 weeks of exposure to a low-dose vaginal estradiol insert [^113VPDH7]. Menopause (2021). Low credibility.

Vaginal versus oral administration of estrogens has been shown to provide lowered systemic exposure when used for the treatment of local VVA symptoms. While studies have shown no significant increase in endometrial or breast cancer and cardiovascular risk with vaginal estrogens, the direct effects of vaginal estrogens on the endometrium have not been well studied. Because of this lack of direct, definitive evidence to support endometrial safety with low-dose vaginal estrogen, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required the addition of the boxed warning of systemically administered estrogens, which includes risks of endometrial cancer, for all vaginal estrogen products.

To assess whether vaginal E2 may have a direct effect on the endometrium, the progesterone receptor (PGR) was used as a biomarker of E2 exposure. Endometrial PGR expression is one of the, if not the, most sensitive gene response to estradiol. We hypothesized that there may be insufficient E2 exposure from the 4-μg and 10-μg E2 vaginal inserts placed in the lower part of the vagina to increase endometrial PGR expression. If bioavailable estradiol is insufficient to stimulate PGR expression, we would not expect inserts to cause endometrial proliferation or hyperplasia/cancer. The objective of this analysis was to quantify the expression of PGR in endometrial tissues of women who used the softgel vaginal E2 or placebo insert in the REJOICE study.

### Management of endometrial hyperplasia (Green-top guideline no. 67) [^116HvuWF]. RCOG (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the management of endometrial hyperplasia, particularly in patients with atypical endometrial hyperplasia, the BSGE/RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend offering the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system as the first-line therapy. Oral progestogens are recommended as a second alternative for patients who wish to preserve their fertility or are ineligible for surgery.

### Estradiol [^114UUsY1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When prescribing estrogen for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, consider adding a progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus typically does not need to use a progestogen in addition to her estrogen therapy. However, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may require a progestogen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.14)].

Use estrogen alone or in combination with a progestogen at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Periodically reevaluate postmenopausal women to determine if treatment is still necessary, as clinically appropriate.

- **Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause**: Start therapy with the estradiol transdermal system 0.0375 mg per day, applied to the skin twice weekly. Make dosage adjustments based on clinical response. Attempt to taper or discontinue the estradiol transdermal system at intervals of 3 to 6 months.

- **Application instructions**: Place the adhesive side of the estradiol transdermal system on a clean, dry area of the lower abdomen (below the umbilicus) or buttocks. Do not apply the estradiol transdermal system to the breasts. Replace the estradiol transdermal system twice weekly (every 3 to 4 days). Rotate the sites of application with an interval of at least 1 week allowed between applications to a particular site. Select an area for application that is not oily, damaged, or irritated. Avoid the waistline, since tight clothing may interfere with adhesion.

### Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate use and the development and progression of uterine leiomyoma [^111it42x]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

At first glance, a protective effect for a progestin is unexpected given the critical roles that progesterone plays in positive leiomyoma growth, including cell proliferation, extracellular matrix formation, and suppression of apoptosis (reviewed in Reis and Bulun); however, estradiol is instrumental in the effect of progesterone through the upregulation of progesterone receptor expression, and use of DMPA results in hypoestrogenism. Any resulting reduction in progesterone receptor expression could diminish responsiveness of the tissues to endogenous progesterone as well as the exogenous progestin.

The biological activity of endogenous progesterone and synthetic progestins (reviewed in Hapgood et al.) differs in ways that are both progestin and tissue-specific. For instance, in lung carcinoma and embryonic kidney cells, medroxyprogesterone acetate has heightened affinity and potency for the glucocorticoid receptor compared with progesterone. Additionally, in endometrial stromal fibroblasts, treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate resulted in differential expression of almost 150 genes compared with progesterone. Given these important biological differences, mechanistic studies of myometrial and leiomyoma tissue obtained from women with different exposures to DMPA are needed to investigate the biological pathways at play.

Our study has limitations. First, we lack accurate data on the duration of the last episode of DMPA use. However, we have reasonably good data on time since last DMPA use. The recall accuracy of hormonal contraceptive use has been reported to be high, and we collected these.

### Breast effects of oral, combined 17β-estradiol, and progesterone capsules in menopausal women: a randomized controlled trial [^112oDMni]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

One limitation of the study is that the analysis of breast density changes with E2/P4 was not a prespecified endpoint in the REPLENISH study. Increased breast density is often found in women using hormone therapy (HT) containing a progestin. Greater breast density may be associated with increased breast cancer risk, although it is unknown whether the elevated breast cancer risk by combined HT is mediated through hormone-induced breast density change. Another limitation of the study is the relatively short duration of observations of breast changes. As a longer duration of combined hormone use is associated with higher breast cancer risk, our study is likely not sufficiently powered to observe the long-term breast safety of TX-001HR (in addition to the low incidence of breast cancer in women of similar age). Nevertheless, this duration is typical in evaluating menopausal hormone medications, and the study suggests short-term breast safety of TX-001HR.

The REPLENISH trial demonstrated significant reductions in the severity and frequency of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) with the two highest doses of TX-001HR studied, with favorable safety profiles including endometrial protection, pharmacologically effective absorption, improved quality of life, and sleep outcomes, and no adverse effects on cardiometabolic markers. The results reported here suggest that TX-001HR, an FDA-approved bioidentical combined HT, is potentially safe with no significant adverse impact on the breast after one year of use.

### Determination of estradiol and progesterone content in capsules and creams from compounding pharmacies [^1171Xg7M]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Many postmenopausal women are treated with hormone therapy (HT) to alleviate symptoms of menopause, primarily hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal atrophy, and to prevent osteoporosis. The postmenopausal period is considered an endocrine-deficient state, and HT can help restore the premenopausal endocrine milieu. Estrogen is the principal hormone used to treat postmenopausal symptoms. Various estrogenic preparations are available, including the natural endogenous estrogen, 17β-estradiol. To prevent endometrial hyperplasia from the effects of exogenous estrogens in women with a uterus, a progestogen is used either continuously combined or sequentially with the estrogens. The progestogens available for therapeutic use are synthetic progestogens (progestins) and natural progestogen (progesterone).

There is a high demand for HT containing natural hormones, as evidenced by the estimated annual prescriptions of up to 21 million products containing natural progesterone, representing the most prescribed form of HT in the United States. Since there was no single US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved formulation containing both estradiol and progesterone before 2018, most of these (up to 18 million prescriptions) were for non-US FDA-approved compounded HT. In October 2018, the US FDA approved the first oral softgel capsule containing 1 mg of estradiol and 100 mg of progesterone, branded as Bijuva (TherapeuticsMD, Boca Raton, FL).

### Estrogen and progesterone receptors and cyclooxygenase-2 expression in endometrial cancer, endometrial hyperplasia, and normal endometrium [^1153MxCf]. Gynecologic Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

To determine whether cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is observed in endometrial cancer, endometrial hyperplasia, and normal endometria, and whether it correlates with the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors, a retrospective, IRB-approved analysis was conducted. Biopsy samples were obtained from 14 patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma, 19 with endometrial hyperplasia, and 10 with normal endometrium. Samples were excluded if women had a history of pelvic radiation, NSAID use, or hormone treatment in the previous year. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, scoring the expression of COX-2, estrogen, and progesterone receptors according to the proportion of positive-staining cells: 1(+) for 50%. A score of ≥ 2(+) was considered positive. Fisher's exact test and analysis of variance were employed to compare proportions and continuous variables, respectively.

Overexpression of COX-2 was observed in 4 (29%) of the endometrial cancers, 6 (32%) of the endometrial hyperplasia, and 4 (20%) of the normal endometria, although these differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.90). No COX-2 expression was detected in stromal tissue. Of the 14 endometrial cancers, 7 (50%) expressed any level of COX-2, with 4 (29%) having an expression score of ≥ 2(+). Among the 19 endometrial hyperplasias, 11 (58%) expressed any COX-2, with 6 (32%) having a score of ≥ 2(+). All 10 normal endometria showed only 1(+) expression. No significant differences were found in COX-2 expression by grade or stage.

### Micronized vaginal progesterone to prevent miscarriage: a critical evaluation of randomized evidence [^115LcN9D]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

We used vaginal, micronized progesterone in the PROMISE and PRISM trials. The results from these trials are not necessarily generalizable to progestogens such as dydrogesterone or 17-hydroxyprogesterone. The natural progesterone used in the PROMISE and PRISM trials is derived from soybeans and Mexican yam roots and has an identical chemical structure to physiological progesterone synthesized in the human body. Synthetic progestogens, which include dydrogesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, have a different molecular structure, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics, as well as a different safety profile. We have restricted our analysis to progesterone, and our data do not support or refute the role of other progesterone-like compounds.

- **Implications for clinical practice**: In summary, the PRISM and PROMISE trials found a small but positive treatment effect that seems to be dependent on the number of miscarriages. Our analysis did not suggest any benefit from progesterone therapy for women with early pregnancy bleeding but no history of miscarriages. We believe that the dual risk factors of early pregnancy bleeding and a history of one or more previous miscarriages identify high-risk women in whom progesterone is of benefit. The question is how this should affect clinical practice. We recommend that the information should be communicated to women at high risk of miscarriages to enable shared decision-making. Our suggestion is to consider offering progesterone therapy to women with vaginal bleeding and a history of one or more previous miscarriages.

### Depo-estradiol [^113RnL78]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Addition of progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy**: Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer, adverse effects on lipoprotein metabolism (e.g. lowering HDL, raising LDL), and impairment of glucose tolerance.

- **Elevated blood pressure**: In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen. Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use.

- **Hypertriglyceridemia**: In patients with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications.

- **Impaired liver function and past history of cholestatic jaundice**: Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.

### A randomized, multicenter, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% in postmenopausal women with dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom [^111Z7DXd]. Menopause (2018). High credibility.

This study was performed in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for good clinical practice guidelines and in accordance with the ethical principles originating from the Declaration of Helsinki and the US FDA Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, parts 50, 56, and 312. The protocol was reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Boards and all participants provided written informed consent.

- **Study design**: This was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in postmenopausal women reporting dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom of VVA. Once screening and baseline assessments were completed, participants were randomized (1:1) to estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% (15 μg estradiol; 0.5 g cream) or placebo cream (0.5 g of cream). During the 2-week initial treatment period, estradiol and placebo creams were applied vaginally every day for 2 weeks to rapidly maximize vaginal response. Dosages for both treatments were then reduced to three maintenance applications per week for 10 weeks. After completion of the 12-week trial, those participants who had an intact uterus at baseline were provided a progestin for 14 days; the type and dose of progestin were determined by the investigator.

### Micronized vaginal progesterone to prevent miscarriage: a critical evaluation of randomized evidence [^114EhXYn]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the interpretation of subgroup effects note that "debates about subgroup effects may be framed in terms of absolute acceptance or rejection", but such a "yes versus no polarized approach is undesirable and destructive, mainly because it ignores the uncertainty that is inevitably part of such judgments". Furthermore, "an approach that is more productive and more realistic is to place the likelihood that a subgroup effect is real on a continuum from 'highly plausible' to 'extremely unlikely'". The question is then a decision of where on this continuum a putative subgroup effect lies. We propose the subgroup effect first suggested in the PROMISE trial, and then confirmed in the PRISM trial, is highly plausible.
