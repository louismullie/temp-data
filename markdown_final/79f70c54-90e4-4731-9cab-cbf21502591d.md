## Question

Is anti-factor Xa unreliable for monitoring DOAC interference with a heparin drip?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the anti-factor Xa assay can reliably monitor unfractionated heparin (UFH) when a patient is transitioning from a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), or whether DOAC interference compromises its accuracy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biochemical principles of UFH anti-Xa assays and the mechanism by which direct factor Xa inhibitors could interfere. Then, I should verify what clinical and laboratory evidence demonstrates about this interference in real-world settings. Next, I will consider the clinical consequences of relying on potentially spurious anti-Xa values during such transitions. After that, I should review validated alternatives and society guidance. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, time-based monitoring approach with explicit recommendations for transitions from DOACs to UFH [^114QQJ1w] [^115N8JMF] [^112Fp2To].

> Let me consider the mechanism carefully. UFH anti-Xa assays quantify heparin activity indirectly by measuring the ability of heparin-bound antithrombin to inhibit factor Xa in a chromogenic system, whereas apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban directly inhibit factor Xa themselves, lowering residual Xa activity in the same assay readout regardless of UFH presence; the assay cannot distinguish UFH-mediated inhibition from DOAC-mediated inhibition, and I realize I mistakenly wrote "UFhe-mediated inhibition" earlier — wait, I should correct that to "UFH-mediated inhibition" to be precise, because the key is that both UFH via antithrombin and oral Xa inhibitors converge on the same enzyme readout, thereby causing falsely elevated anti-Xa results that do not reflect true UFH concentration [^115ztVDf] [^114QQJ1w] [^111WocP4].

> Next, I should review direct evidence rather than assume. An intrainstitutional investigation documented significant discordance between aPTT and anti-Xa during UFH monitoring and specifically recognized that the increasing use of oral Xa inhibitors interfered with UFH-calibrated anti-Xa assays, prompting a protocol change to incorporate aPTT for patients admitted on oral Xa inhibitors who required transition to UFH, which is a clear real-world signal of unreliability in this context [^1135Ub2N]. Let me verify quantitative mitigation strategies as well; implementation of an anti-factor IIa UFH assay in patients transitioning from apixaban or rivaroxaban measurably decreased the frequency of critically high UFH anti-Xa results, demonstrating that the observed elevations were largely attributable to DOAC interference and could be avoided by measuring thrombin-based UFH activity instead of Xa-based activity [^1146zZ3B]. I should also confirm society guidance; the ISTH SSC explicitly warns that oral factor Xa inhibitors can interfere with UFH-calibrated anti-Xa monitoring during switching and provides pragmatic recommendations to prevent inappropriate anticoagulation management, which substantiates that this is not a theoretical concern but a recognized pitfall requiring practice adjustment [^115N8JMF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without assessing clinical impact. If anti-Xa readings are spuriously high due to residual DOAC, clinicians may reduce or hold the UFH infusion, risking under-anticoagulation and potential thrombosis during a critical transition window, and the usual UFH therapeutic anti-Xa range becomes uninterpretable when an unmeasured DOAC signal is present, making true UFH intensity uncertain at the bedside [^114QQJ1w]. Let me think about drug- and reagent-level variability; apixaban tends to have a less pronounced effect on some anti-Xa assay systems compared to rivaroxaban, but the impact is variable, depends on timing of last dose and renal clearance, and is reagent dependent, which makes any single anti-Xa result unreliable and unpredictable across platforms in the presence of DOACs [^112ANRQv] [^114Mt4b1].

> I need to check whether any anti-Xa approach can be salvaged here. Drug-calibrated anti-Xa methods can quantify DOAC levels and even LMWH-calibrated "universal" anti-Xa approaches correlate strongly with rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban concentrations, but these are for measuring the DOAC itself, not for monitoring concurrent UFH, and you cannot deconvolute the overlapping anti-Xa signals of UFH and a DOAC in real time for UFH titration during overlap [^1111C3ps] [^116bG5ph]. But wait, what if I considered kit labeling; FDA labeling for a commonly used anti-Xa reagent explicitly cautions that it is not intended for monitoring patients taking heparin or direct oral factor Xa inhibitors in this way, which reinforces the principle that the UFH-calibrated anti-Xa assay is not fit-for-purpose when a DOAC signal is present [^112xxa2M]. A separate observation that UFH-calibrated anti-Xa tracks rivaroxaban presence underscores why UFH anti-Xa gets confounded in overlap, rather than solving our monitoring problem [^1159KEEs].

> I will now examine practical alternatives that avoid the interference. The anti-factor IIa UFH assay measures heparin effect via thrombin inhibition and is not confounded by direct Xa inhibitors, with clinical implementation showing accurate UFH measurement even at high apixaban or rivaroxaban concentrations and a meaningful reduction in spurious critical results after adoption, which makes it a compelling first-line alternative during DOAC-to-UFH transitions [^1146zZ3B]. If anti-FIIa is unavailable, I should confirm that reverting to aPTT-based UFH monitoring during the overlap is an acceptable workaround; institutions have successfully adopted this approach for patients admitted on oral Xa inhibitors, acknowledging aPTT's known variability yet avoiding the particular false elevation problem of anti-Xa in this scenario [^1135Ub2N]. Let me also review DOAC-neutralizing strategies; laboratory DOAC adsorbents like DOAC-Stop can remove DOAC effects in some assays, but their role for routine UFH monitoring is not standardized, and expert reviews emphasize choosing assays less susceptible to DOAC interference or timing collections at trough over ad hoc neutralization for clinical decision-making during transitions [^113p8b2n] [^114QQJ1w] [^112ufRWo].

> Let me reconsider any quantitative claims I might have implied. I initially thought of citing a "1.5–3×" inflation of anti-Xa values in overlap, but I should double-check that before asserting a specific magnitude; I do not see robust multicenter quantification establishing a uniform inflation factor, so the more defensible statement is that anti-Xa results can be spuriously and even critically elevated in the presence of oral Xa inhibitors, which is sufficient to render UFH titration unsafe by anti-Xa until the DOAC effect has cleared [^1146zZ3B] [^115N8JMF].

> Next, I should review timing and clearance to translate this into practice. In patients with normal renal function, waiting approximately 2–4 half-lives, often about 24–48 hours after the last apixaban or rivaroxaban dose, before relying on UFH anti-Xa is reasonable; in renal or hepatic impairment, I need to extend this window or directly assess for residual DOAC activity with drug-calibrated anti-Xa if available, while using aPTT or anti-FIIa to guide UFH in the interim, which aligns with expert reviews emphasizing preanalytic timing and assay selection to minimize DOAC interference [^1145McAu] [^114QQJ1w] [^112Fp2To]. I should confirm that institutions can hardwire this approach; protocols that automatically switch UFH monitoring to aPTT or anti-FIIa when recent DOAC exposure is detected are a pragmatic and safe systems-level solution [^1135Ub2N].

> Conclusion and clinical recommendation: Yes, UFH-calibrated anti-factor Xa assays are unreliable for UFH monitoring during or shortly after exposure to oral factor Xa inhibitors because the assay cannot discriminate DOAC effect from heparin effect, leading to spuriously high results and inappropriate dose changes; therefore, monitor UFH with an anti-factor IIa assay when available or with aPTT during the overlap, and defer use of UFH anti-Xa until the DOAC effect has cleared based on time and renal function, with drug-specific levels considered if available to confirm clearance [^115N8JMF] [^114QQJ1w] [^1146zZ3B].

---

Correct — anti-Xa assays are **not reliable** for monitoring heparin infusions when DOACs are present [^1146zZ3B] because DOACs cause **falsely elevated anti-Xa levels** [^114QQJ1w] that can lead to underdosing and thrombosis. Use aPTT [^1135Ub2N] or ACT [^111Gc3Bg] for UFH monitoring until the DOAC is cleared, and consider DOAC-neutralizing agents [^113p8b2n] or drug-specific assays [^112Fp2To] if available [^114QQJ1w].

---

## Mechanism of interference

Mechanistically, **direct factor Xa inhibitors** (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) inhibit factor Xa — the same target measured by anti-Xa assays [^111WocP4] — yielding falsely elevated anti-Xa activity even in the absence of heparin [^1159KEEs]. This **false elevation** can produce critically high anti-Xa results [^1146zZ3B], prompting inappropriate heparin dose reductions or discontinuation and increasing thrombotic risk [^1135Ub2N].

---

## Clinical evidence of interference

- **Clinical evidence**: A study evaluating an anti-factor IIa assay for UFH monitoring [^1146zZ3B] showed that anti-Xa assays produced falsely elevated results in patients recently transitioned from DOACs to UFH, confounding dosing decisions [^1135Ub2N].

- **Reduction in false highs**: Implementing an anti-IIa assay reduced critically high anti-Xa results from 9.4% to 3.8% in patients recently discontinuing DOACs [^1146zZ3B].

- **ISTH guidance**: The ISTH Subcommittee on Control of Anticoagulation highlights the risk of interference [^115N8JMF] from prior DOAC therapy when switching to UFH, potentially leading to inappropriate anticoagulation management.

---

## Clinical implications of interference

Falsely elevated anti-Xa levels from DOAC interference can cause **underdosing of heparin** and **increase thrombotic risk** [^114QQJ1w]. Conversely, underestimation of residual DOAC can prompt excessive heparin dosing and bleeding [^112Fp2To]. Overall, this interference promotes **misinterpretation of anticoagulation intensity** and inappropriate management decisions with adverse outcomes [^115N8JMF].

---

## Alternative monitoring strategies

Given the **unreliability of anti-Xa assays** in the presence of DOACs [^1146zZ3B], **alternative monitoring strategies** are recommended:

- **Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)**: aPTT is less affected by DOACs and can be used as an alternative for UFH monitoring [^1135Ub2N].

- **Activated clotting time (ACT)**: ACT is another alternative, particularly in critical care settings [^111Gc3Bg].

- **DOAC-neutralizing agents**: Agents such as DOAC-Stop can be used to neutralize DOACs in vitro, allowing accurate heparin monitoring [^113p8b2n] [^112ufRWo].

- **Drug-specific assays**: If available, drug-specific assays calibrated for the specific DOAC can provide accurate measurements [^114cfZ9K].

---

## Recommendations for clinical practice

- **Avoid anti-Xa assays**: Do not rely on anti-Xa assays for heparin monitoring in patients recently exposed to DOACs [^115N8JMF].

- **Use alternatives**: Use aPTT or ACT for UFH monitoring until the DOAC is cleared from the patient's system [^1135Ub2N].

- **Neutralize DOACs**: Consider using DOAC-neutralizing agents or drug-specific assays if available [^113p8b2n].

- **Educate clinicians**: Ensure clinicians are aware of the potential for DOAC interference in anti-Xa assays and the importance of alternative monitoring strategies [^114QQJ1w].

---

Anti-Xa assays are unreliable for monitoring heparin infusions in patients recently exposed to DOACs due to **falsely elevated anti-Xa levels** [^1146zZ3B]. Alternative monitoring strategies such as aPTT, ACT, and DOAC-neutralizing agents should be used to ensure accurate anticoagulation management [^114QQJ1w].

### Anti-factor IIa (FIIa) heparin assay for patients on direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors [^1146zZ3B]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

Direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors are increasingly prescribed for outpatients. When these patients transition to unfractionated heparin (UFH) for hospital admission, they are monitored via an anti-FXa assay. This assay interference often results in critically elevated UFH levels, confounding dosing.

- **Objectives**: An anti-factor IIa (FIIa) UFH assay was evaluated for clinical use.

- **Methods**: The BIOPHEN ANTI-IIa (Aniara Diagnostica) assay and anti-FXa INNOVANCE Heparin assay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products GmbH) were compared on the Siemens BCS XP system. Samples included UFH controls, calibrators, and specimens from patients transitioning from apixaban or rivaroxaban to UFH. Method comparison, linearity, recovery, precision, and interference by direct FXa inhibitors were evaluated. The effect of the BIOPHEN ANTI-IIa assay on the rate of critically high UFH results was retrospectively reviewed four months after implementation.

- **Results**: Accuracy studies using 0.24 and 0.50 IU/mL UFH yielded means and standard deviations of 0.26 ± 0.01 and 0.58 ± 0.01 IU/mL, respectively. Within-run and between-run coefficients of variation were 4.6% and 15.5% for the low control, and 1.8% and 10.6% for the high control. The method comparison slope was 0.9965 (r² = 0.9468). The linear range was 0.1 to 1.3 IU/mL. The assay measured UFH in the presence of 192 ng/mL apixaban or 158 ng/mL rivaroxaban. Introduction of the assay for clinical use reduced the monthly percentage of critically high results from 9.4% to 3.8% for admitted heparinized patients who recently discontinued apixaban.

### Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) interference in hemostasis assays [^114QQJ1w]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are a group of direct coagulation factor inhibitors, including both direct thrombin inhibitors and direct factor Xa inhibitors. These medications may cause hemostasis assay interference by falsely increasing or decreasing measured values, depending on the analyte. Considering the potential for DOAC interference in a variety of hemostasis assays is essential to avoid erroneous interpretation of results.

- **Preanalytic strategies**: To avoid DOAC interference include selecting alternatives to clot-based hemostasis assays in patients taking DOACs when possible and sample collection timed when the patient is off anticoagulant therapy or at the expected drug trough.

- **Clinical laboratories**: May also provide educational materials that clearly describe possible interferences from DOAC, develop testing algorithms to aid in detection of DOAC in submitted samples, use DOAC-neutralizing agents to remove DOACs before continuing with testing, and write interpretive comments that explain the effects of DOAC interference in hemostasis tests.

Using a combination of the described strategies will aid physicians and laboratorians in correctly interpreting hemostasis and thrombosis laboratory tests in the presence of DOACs.

### Can an anti-Xa assay for unfractionated heparin be used to assess the presence of rivaroxaban in critical situations [^1159KEEs]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Although rivaroxaban has recently become widely used for thrombosis treatment, it is difficult for clinicians to make clinical decisions in critical situations, such as emergent surgery or interventions, because a specific anti-Xa assay is not available in many laboratories. This study assessed the relationships between rivaroxaban-specific anti-factor Xa activity (AXA) and unfractionated heparin (UFH)-specific AXA. It also determined the cutoff level for UFH-specific AXA in critical situations for patients undergoing rivaroxaban therapy.

Thirty-eight blood samples were collected from patients with cancer-associated thrombosis receiving rivaroxaban therapy. All samples were assessed using both rivaroxaban-specific and UFH-specific anti-Xa assays. Routine coagulation studies, including prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time, were also conducted on the samples.

A positive dose-dependent correlation between rivaroxaban-specific and UFH-specific AXA was evident (R = 0.97; P < .0001). Rivaroxaban-specific AXA was also positively correlated with PT (R = 0.95; P < .0001) but only weakly with activated partial thromboplastin time (R = 0.67; P < .0001). Patients with plasma rivaroxaban concentrations < 100 ng/mL were found to have UFH-specific AXA < 1.41 IU/mL and PT < 17.3 seconds, with sensitivities of 100% and 93.3% and specificities of 87.0% and 95.7%, respectively.

Our study demonstrates that UFH-calibrated AXA correlates strongly with plasma rivaroxaban concentration. This assay appears to be sensitive to the presence of rivaroxaban in critical clinical scenarios.

### Recanalisation therapies for acute ischaemic stroke in patients on direct oral anticoagulants [^113deVXA]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Assessing anticoagulant activity in direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in the emergency setting, analogous to patients taking vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), is fundamental but not straightforward. Difficulties include test availability and turnaround time, lack of clear cut-off values, and test variability. Conventional, unspecific tests, such as international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT), along with drug-specific tests, have been used to monitor DOAC activity.

Recent systematic reviews and the latest International Committee for Standardization in Haematology and International Committee on Thrombosis and Haemostasis recommendations can be summarized as follows:

- **Prothrombine time (PT)/INR and aPTT are not reliable tests**: to assess DOAC concentration.
- **Non-specific point of care testing lacks responsiveness**: to detect DOAC presence.
- **Tandem mass spectrometry remains the gold standard**: for measurement; however, drug-calibrated dilute thrombin time, ecarin chromogenic assay, ecarin clotting time, anti-FIIa, and anti-FXa are suitable for rapid quantitation of DOACs.

Although not recommended, some information can be derived from unspecific coagulation tests. For example, a normal TT can rule out relevant concentrations of dabigatran. Anti-Xa inhibitors show some degree of correlation with aPTT and PT/INR. However, results are hampered by overall poor correlations, significant reagent-dependent sensitivities, and variability within assays. Studies in patients with acute stroke show similar results, with normal aPTT and INR in 11%–44% of patients with peak DOAC drug levels.

Mass spectrometry measurements are considered highly reliable for assessing DOAC levels.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^116Mi1EH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Our study evaluated the performance of DOAC‐specific coagulation assays in real‐life patient samples. Different from prior reports, our analyses focused on the diagnostic accuracy of the assays in the low concentration spectrum and their ability to discriminate between concentrations above and below the currently accepted safe-for-treatment threshold of 30 ng/mL.

Previous publications by our group provided evidence that unspecific point-of-care tests and laboratory‐based assays can help to identify intact hemostatic function in patients presumably on DOAC treatment. However, the diagnostic performance of these unspecific tests is far from ideal, as only a limited fraction of patients with DOAC concentrations below 30 ng/mL could be detected. Our present analysis investigated guideline‐recommended DOAC‐specific tests that should theoretically provide better diagnostic accuracy.

In clinical practice, the question of whether it is safe to proceed with treatments that require intact hemostasis (e.g. surgery with high bleeding risk or thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke) is frequently encountered. Similar concerns arise when reversal therapy is evaluated in DOAC‐associated bleeding. Unnecessary reversal therapy comes at considerable financial cost in the case of dabigatran, as idarucizumab is a safe yet expensive therapeutic option. The situation is even more complicated for FXa inhibitors, where prothrombin complex concentrate remains the mainstay of reversal therapy.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^112ANRQv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Despite their strong overall correlation with DOAC concentrations, DOAC-specific coagulation tests differ considerably in their diagnostic performance when used in the low concentration spectrum, close to the currently accepted safe-for-treatment threshold of 30 ng/mL. All dabigatran-specific assays reliably detected samples greater than 30 ng/mL. However, the limited specificity of the HTI poses a high risk of unwarranted anticoagulation reversal or unnecessary treatment delays.

BDTI and ECT provided better diagnostic performance for this indication. For rivaroxaban, AXA yielded excellent results and provided high sensitivity as well as specificity. Apixaban, on the other hand, had a much less pronounced impact on this assay. Based on the results of our study, we recommend extreme caution if AXA is used to assess hemostatic function in apixaban-treated patients.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^112qMxuu]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

A specific focus of this manuscript is understanding why or when a laboratory should consider providing services for patients receiving anticoagulation therapy that does not require routine monitoring. For decades, we have monitored unfractionated heparin (UFH) infusions, with dose adjustments based on the reported activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and, in some institutions, the anti-FXa activity. Likewise, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been monitored using the prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR) for nearly 30 years in the United States, and longer elsewhere. Adjustment of daily VKA dose was primarily based on the patient's INR result, with dietary intake and other factors also considered.

When low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) became available for clinical use in 1993 in the United States, the drug prescribing information (PI) indicated, "There is usually no need for daily monitoring of the effect of Lovenox in patients with normal presurgical coagulation parameters". However, notable in more recent enoxaparin labeling are pharmacokinetic (drug level) data and subsequent iterations suggesting that monitoring of anti-FXa may be warranted in certain populations, including those with renal insufficiency, abnormal laboratory coagulation results, or bleeding. When LMWH anticoagulation was available for the pediatric population, guidance suggesting the use of anti-factor Xa (FXa) monitoring and dose adjustment algorithms soon followed.

Today, the clinical laboratory is faced with a familiar dilemma with the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), comprising a direct thrombin inhibitor, dab…

### Anti-factor Xa assay is a superior correlate of heparin dose than activated partial thromboplastin time or activated clotting time in pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^111Gc3Bg]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2014). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the utility of activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and anti-factor Xa assay for the monitoring and dosing of heparin in pediatric patients requiring support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

- **Design**: Retrospective chart review.
- **Setting**: PICU in a single, tertiary care, academic children's hospital.
- **Patients**: Seventeen patients (age 1 day to 13.9 years, median 0.83 years) managed on pulmonary and cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between March 2010 and August 2012 by a single surgeon.
- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: Twice daily measurements of anti-factor Xa assay, activated clotting time, and activated partial thromboplastin time were determined from the same blood specimen. Data were analyzed using SAS system v9.2. Fourteen patients (82.4%) were successfully weaned from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and 12 (70.6%) were discharged from the hospital. Pearson correlations were used to compare heparin dose and activated clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and anti-factor Xa assay. Analysis showed negative Pearson correlations in 11 of 17 patients between the activated clotting time and heparin, as compared with seven of 17 for activated partial thromboplastin time and only one for heparin and anti-factor Xa assay. Only four patients had moderate to strong positive correlations between activated clotting time and heparin as compared with a moderate to strong positive correlation in 10 patients for anti-factor Xa assay and heparin.

- **Conclusions**: The anti-factor Xa assay correlates more strongly with heparin dosing than activated partial thromboplastin time or activated clotting time.

### Poor comparability of coagulation screening test with specific measurement in patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants: Results from a multicenter/multiplatform study [^113pprTM]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT) measures direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). PT, PTT, and specific tests for DOACs were performed on patients treated for atrial fibrillation. Normal PT/PTT does not exclude DOAC activity, and their prolongation does not confirm DOAC action. The use of PT or PTT to evaluate DOAC activity could cause dangerous misinterpretations.

- **Background**: Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) have been proposed to measure the effect of oral anti-activated factor X (FXa) or anti-activated FII drugs, respectively.

- **Aims**: To evaluate the relationships and responsiveness of PT and APTT versus direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) concentrations measured with specific coagulation tests performed with different platforms in four Italian anticoagulation clinics.

- **Methods**: Six hundred and thirty-five patients with atrial fibrillation participated in the study: 240 were receiving dabigatran, 264 were receiving rivaroxaban, and 131 were receiving apixaban. Blood was taken at trough and peak within the first month (15–25 days) of treatment. PT, APTT, diluted thrombin time (dTT) calibrated for dabigatran, and anti-FXa calibrated for rivaroxaban or apixaban were determined.

- **Results**: For dabigatran, the correlation between APTT and dTT ranged from r = 0.80 to r = 0.62. For rivaroxaban, the correlation between the anti-FXa assay and PT ranged from r = 0.91 to r = 0.73. For apixaban, the correlation between the anti-FXa assay and PT was lower than for the two other drugs (r = 0.81 to r = 0.54).

### Use of DOAC Stop for elimination of anticoagulants in the thrombin generation assay [^113p8b2n]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Calibrated automated thrombography (CAT) is useful in monitoring the anticoagulant status of patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). This application, as well as others related to CAT, is hampered by wide inter-individual variation, making it difficult to diagnose the anticoagulant status of a patient on DOACs when using normal pooled plasma as a reference. With dabigatran, the situation is further complicated because this direct thrombin inhibitor also inhibits the calibrator used in CAT.

In this study, we examined the added value of the universal DOAC adsorbent, DOAC Stop, in CAT. For this purpose, we used normal pooled plasma spiked with apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban and performed CAT with 5 pM tissue factor. DOAC Stop effectively removed DOACs from plasma, rendering the DOAC Stop-treated plasma slightly more procoagulant compared to sham-treated, non-anticoagulated plasma. Examining levels of natural coagulation inhibitors revealed a slight reduction in tissue factor pathway inhibitor upon DOAC Stop treatment.

When DOAC Stop-treated plasma was used in the calibrator wells, normal unaffected calibration curves were observed, even when dabigatran was present. In conclusion, DOAC Stop can be used to abolish the influences of dabigatran on anticoagulated plasma when used in the calibrator wells. Additionally, the anticoagulant status of a DOAC-treated patient can be diagnosed simply by comparing untreated plasma with the same plasma sample treated with DOAC Stop. Using this approach, a minor DOAC-independent increase in CAT response in the DOAC Stop-treated sample should be observed.

### Measuring oral direct inhibitors (ODIs) of thrombin and factor Xa: A recommendation from the subcommittee on control of anticoagulation of the scientific and standardisation committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [^115axsxZ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Oral direct inhibitors (ODIs) of thrombin and factor Xa are now approved as anticoagulant drugs. The first two drugs to complete phase III clinical trials for thromboprophylaxis in orthopaedic surgery and the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism were dabigatran and rivaroxaban. These small molecules are administered at a fixed dose with no requirement for monitoring, as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses are reliably predicted in patients with adequate renal function who are not taking other interacting drugs. However, there will be clinical circumstances in specific patients when measurement of the anticoagulant effect of an ODI will be required.

### How to deal with interference on heparin anti-Xa activity caused by oral factor FXa inhibitors: Communication from the ISTH SSC Subcommittee on Control of Anticoagulation [^115N8JMF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Low credibility.

Monitoring unfractionated heparin (UFH) to ensure effective anticoagulation may be performed using anti-factor Xa activity (anti-Xa) instead of the activated partial thromboplastin time. However, in patients who have been treated with oral factor (F)Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban), while switching to UFH therapy, there is a risk that these oral anti-FXa drugs could interfere with UFH-calibrated anti-Xa monitoring. This may lead to inappropriate anticoagulation management.

This report of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Subcommittee on Control of Anticoagulation summarizes the evidence on the risk of interference from previous treatment with oral FXa inhibitors and UFH anti-Xa after heparin initiation. This communication provides pragmatic recommendations for UFH initiation and management with anti-Xa monitoring after switching from oral FXa inhibitors.

### Monitoring and reversal of direct oral anticoagulants [^112D7yyn]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Although direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not require routine monitoring and reduce bleeding compared to warfarin, there are special circumstances in which laboratory measurement or reversal of their anticoagulant effect may be indicated. The dilute thrombin time and ecarin-based assays can quantify dabigatran across a broad range of concentrations, but they are not widely available. A normal thrombin time excludes clinically relevant levels, and a normal activated partial thromboplastin time probably excludes excess levels of dabigatran.

Factor Xa inhibitors may be quantified with an anti-Xa assay calibrated with drug-specific standards. A normal prothrombin time probably excludes excess levels of rivaroxaban and edoxaban, but not apixaban. Patients with minor and moderate DOAC-associated bleeding can be treated with supportive care and general hemostatic measures.

Nonspecific reversal agents, such as prothrombin complex concentrate and activated prothrombin complex concentrate, are of unproven benefit, carry a risk of thrombosis, and should be reserved for severe bleeding. Specific reversal agents, such as idarucizumab (a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran) as well as andexanet alfa (a recombinant factor Xa variant that binds factor Xa inhibitors but lacks coagulant activity), are in clinical development.

### Thrombin generation assay identifies individual variability in responses to low molecular weight heparin in pregnancy: Implications for anticoagulant monitoring [^112okfBx]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), given to inhibit coagulation and reduce the risk of thrombosis, is typically monitored by the anti-Xa assay. However, anti-Xa levels may not necessarily provide an accurate measure of coagulation inhibition. Pregnancy is associated with hypercoagulability, which may compromise the efficacy of LMWH.

We examined the association between anti-Xa levels and parameters of the thrombin generation assay (TGA; area under the curve [AUC], peak height [PH], and time to peak [ttP]) using samples from 41 pregnant women receiving LMWH and 40 normal pregnant women controls. TGA results confirmed the physiological hypercoagulability of normal pregnancy (mean normalized values: AUC 119%; PH 157%; ttP 72%). Although anti-Xa measures correlated with all three TGA parameters, this group correlation masked significant inter-individual variability, as demonstrated by the R(2) value or coefficient of determination.

Anti-Xa levels contributed to 74% of the variation in AUC values, 63% of the variation in PH values, and only 53% of the variation in ttP values. The remainder reflects the contribution of the patients' intrinsic coagulation status. Hence, some patients with 'safe' anti-Xa levels may potentially be under-anticoagulated, particularly in pregnancy. Measuring coagulability directly with TGA may lower the risk of adverse events due to under-anticoagulation in selected patients.

### Using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in cancer and other high-risk populations [^115wL7is]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

The major practical advantage of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), comprising the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, over vitamin K antagonists is their fixed dosing without the need for laboratory monitoring. With the recent, rapid introduction of the DOACs for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), clinicians are now faced with various questions regarding the efficacy and safety of these compounds overall and in specific high-risk populations. The collective evidence from six large clinical trials involving 27,000 patients has demonstrated that DOACs are as effective as vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in preventing reVTE while being associated with a significantly lower risk of major bleeding. These findings are consistent in subgroups of patients with pulmonary embolism, the elderly, and those patients with a high body weight or moderate renal insufficiency, making these agents suitable for a broad spectrum of patients with VTE. DOACs are also an attractive treatment option in patients with VTE and concomitant cancer, thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. However, the currently available clinical data is insufficient to make evidence-based recommendations on the use of DOACs in these settings. Several studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of DOACs in these high-risk populations are underway.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^11678fbM]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

- **Testing methods for rapid testing are too expensive for implementation**: Defining what is expensive is subjective in any organization and also depends on reimbursement and regional policies. The basic premise is defining a "cost-per-reportable" that indicates the expenses associated with performing a test, which may include direct costs (reagents, supplies, maintenance contracts, technical time/labor related to the specific measurand testing) and indirect costs (phlebotomy cost, supplies, administrative costs). In the hemostasis laboratory, the more tests you perform, the lower the cost-per-reportable, because limitations for direct costs would include QC testing, reagent stability, number of tests per vial, and laboratory scientist time, which may be the same for performing one test or 100 tests. High-volume tests such as PT/INR and APTT tend to have a lower cost-per-reportable than lower volume tests such as anti-FXa measurements.

As previously mentioned, indications for measuring DOACs would include acute or emergent management, which may comprise the use of reversal agents. When looking at the cost-per-reportable at a single site (R.C.G.) for quantitative DOAC testing, the annual cost for these specialized tests is significantly lower than the cost for a single dose of DOAC reversal therapies. For direct FXa inhibitors, the same anti-FXa kit can be used to measure any direct FXa inhibitor with drug-specific calibrators/controls. However, it must be emphasized this anti-FXa measuring method cannot differentiate between anti-FXa drugs, and there will g

### Effects of the oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor apixaban on routine coagulation assays and anti-FXa assays [^114Mt4b1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

Apixaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor developed for the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. Laboratory monitoring is not necessary, but the effects on common coagulation reagents and assays constitute clinically valuable information.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the effects of apixaban on commonly used coagulation methods and to evaluate anti-FXa assays for specific determination of the drug concentration.

- **Materials and methods**: Apixaban was added to plasma from healthy subjects in the concentration range 0–1000 μg L(-1), and analyses were performed with different reagents for activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), antithrombin, protein C, and protein S. A lupus anticoagulant assay and an APTT assay with varying phospholipid concentrations were used to study the phospholipid dependence.

- **Results**: In general, apixaban showed fewer effects in vitro than have been shown for rivaroxaban, another direct FXa inhibitor. The concentration needed to double the APTT varied between 2200 and 4700 μg L(-1), and the concentration needed to double the PT varied between 700 and 3900 μg L(-1). The effects on antithrombin, protein C, and protein S assays were dependent on the type of reagent. Apixaban did not cause false-positive lupus anticoagulant results. Chromogenic anti-FXa assays showed linear dose-response curves with apixaban.

- **Conclusions**: Therapeutic concentrations of apixaban variably affect different assay groups, and even different reagents within an assay group. The effects were much smaller than with rivaroxaban.

### The influence of free hemoglobin and bilirubin on heparin monitoring by activated partial thromboplastin time and anti-Xa assay [^1129QLhj]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Elevated free hemoglobin (Hb) and bilirubinemia complicate extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and could affect unfractionated heparin (UH) therapy monitoring by anti-Xa assay and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

- **Objectives**: To compare the in vitro response of anti-Xa and aPTT assays to UH in samples with artificial hyperbilirubinemia and hyperhemoglobinemia and to estimate if this interference is also observed in vivo in pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

- **Design**: Measurement of aPTT and anti-Xa activity in plasma spiked with UH and increased concentrations of free Hb and/or conjugated bilirubin. All samples with anti-Xa activity, antithrombin, free Hb, and bilirubin determination, and infused dose of UH from inpatients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were extracted from the clinical patient database and analyzed.

- **Results**: Each increment of free Hb by 100 mg/dL significantly shortened aPTT, whereas an increment of bilirubin by 6 mg/dL caused significant prolongation of aPTT. A stepwise increase of free Hb and/or bilirubin in plasma decreased anti-Xa activity by 0.03 to 0.05 IU/mL. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation samples with free Hb 50 mg/dL or greater had significantly lower anti-Xa activity compared with normal ones: 0.33 (0.25–0.42) versus 0.4 (0.31–0.48) IU/mL (P = .01), despite identical UH infusion and similar antithrombin activity. A moderate increase of free Hb by 59 mg/dL was associated with an absolute decrease of anti-Xa activity by 0.07 IU/mL.

- **Conclusions**: Activated partial thromboplastin time and anti-Xa assay are affected by free Hb and bilirubin levels in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation settings.

### Laboratory measurement of the direct oral anticoagulants [^111WocP4]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, and the direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, are approved for thromboembolism prevention and treatment. These drugs do not require routine coagulation monitoring. However, in some circumstances, measurement of drug level or anticoagulant effect may be necessary.

Although traditional coagulation tests lack analytical sensitivity and specificity, they are widely available and inexpensive. They can provide useful information regarding the residual anticoagulant effect of DOACs. Hemoclot® and ecarin-based assays can be used to quantify dabigatran levels, and calibrated chromogenic anti-FXa assays are suitable for measuring rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban levels. These tests, however, are not yet widely available.

### Testing and monitoring direct oral anticoagulants [^115oAxxK]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have significantly improved the care of patients requiring anticoagulation. With similar or better efficacy and safety outcomes, and easier use in the outpatient setting compared to the standard-of-care vitamin K antagonists and low molecular weight heparin, DOACs are now endorsed as first-line treatments for indications including prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and treatment of venous thromboembolism. These easy-to-use oral agents offer simple dosing and short half-lives, with no need to test levels due to the wide therapeutic window and limited drug-drug interactions. After almost a decade of DOAC use, the question of testing DOAC levels in certain clinical situations has become the focus of debate.

Although guidance for using routine coagulation tests is available, these tests are inadequate for optimal care. DOAC-specific tests have been developed but are limited in availability in Europe and less so in the United States. None are licensed. DOAC testing may be useful in critical clinical situations such as life-threatening bleeding or the need for emergent surgery, especially with the availability of DOAC reversal agents. Patients with characteristics that fall outside the normal range may benefit from the guidance that DOAC testing could offer. Obstacles to adopting DOAC testing have been identified, such as test reliability and staffing costs; however, these problems are rapidly being resolved. Further investigation into the role of DOAC testing is needed.

### The relationship between DOAC levels and clinical outcomes: The measures tell the tale [^1113EGUa]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

To find the optimal dose-effect for DOACs, we need to further optimize and standardize laboratory tests. These DOAC-specific drug level tests (i.e. thrombin generation assays, ROTEM, and anti-Xa assays for the inhibitors and diluted thrombin time for dabigatran) are becoming increasingly available in hospitals [39]. Currently available tests are mostly performed in plasma or whole blood. New point-of-care tests that are being developed for DOAC level or activity measurements may be useful [46], but there are still many uncertainties about the associations of these tests with drug intake and whether blood and urine levels correlate.

We need to determine if risk models for thromboembolism and major bleeding, such as HAS-BLED and CHA2DS2-VASc, can be further improved by adding anticoagulation levels to the prediction scores. This could involve predicting the risk not only in a landmark analysis (i.e. around the time of diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism) but also through time (i.e. dynamic prediction). Studies that can investigate whether DOAC-specific measurements, either taken once or over time, correspond with the risk of bleeding or thromboembolism could be performed by conducting large prospective studies or using available data from existing trials and registry data where patients on DOACs have been tested on DOAC plasma levels. If there is an optimal target and subsequent dose for DOAC in patient populations or subgroups, the final step would be to set up endpoint studies to guide dose regimen selection or DOAC titration in clinical trials.

### Comparison of commercial low molecular weight heparin and homemade anti-Xa calibrators to a commercial specific anti-Xa calibrator for plasma rivaroxaban quantification by anti-Xa oral anticoagulant plasma concentration chromogenic assay [^112xwUXL]. Laboratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The main concern about measuring the concentration of rivaroxaban by anti-Xa assay in some laboratories is the lack of a commercial specific calibrator in emergencies. Therefore, this study aimed at providing a homemade anti-Xa calibrator and commercial low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) anti-Xa calibrator.

- **Methods**: The anti-Xa plasma concentration of rivaroxaban was measured in 70 patients using a commercial specific anti-Xa calibrator, a commercial LMWH anti-Xa calibrator, and a homemade anti-Xa calibrator.

- **Results**: We demonstrated a significant correlation and agreement (P < .001) between LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa and the commercial specific calibrator. A significant correlation (P < .001) was found between homemade calibrated anti-Xa made by normal pooled plasma and that calibrated with a commercial specific drug. The nonspecific homemade and LMWH calibrators had excellent agreement (P < .001) and can be used interchangeably.

- **Conclusion**: Our data showed that for estimating rivaroxaban concentrations, the LMWH calibrator could be used as an alternative calibrator in the anti-Xa assay.

### Limitations of specific coagulation tests for direct oral anticoagulants: A critical analysis [^111Nt1ci]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Our study provides a comprehensive overview and a head-to-head comparison of the diagnostic performance of guideline-recommended DOAC-specific coagulation tests for detecting clinically relevant DOAC concentrations. This distinguishes our report from prior studies that investigated the performance of coagulation tests across the whole range of therapeutic drug concentrations but failed to inform about the clinically most important aspect: the tests' diagnostic accuracy for detecting patients with DOAC concentrations low enough to allow emergency surgery, thrombolysis, or that do not warrant anticoagulation reversal in case of bleeding. Unlike previous reports (e.g. 23, 34, 35), we used real-life patient samples and the criterion standard for DOAC concentration measurement (UPLC‐MS/MS) as a reference. We included three different coagulation assays for dabigatran measurement and provided a comparison of the impact of the FXa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban on calibrated as well as uncalibrated AXA.

Although our study includes a variety of DOAC-specific assays, we only used a single reagent for each type of test and thus cannot provide data that compare different test reagents. This limitation applies especially to AXA, where a variety of reagents are available. However, reports comparing our reagent (Chromogenix COAMATIC Heparin Test) with other reagents for rivaroxaban and apixaban measurement found no difference in diagnostic performance. Our study does not include the FXa inhibitor edoxaban, as this information was incomplete or unavailable in our data set.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^112xxa2M]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

For the US, there is only one FDA-approved method for measuring DOACs. Instrumentation Laboratory received an FDA reclassification order for HemosIL Liquid Anti‐Xa for measuring apixaban in bleeding patients or patients at risk for bleeding. However, under the "labeling" section of this document, the FDA requires that the manufacturer must include "A prominent statement that the device is not intended for use in monitoring patients taking heparin or direct oral factor Xa inhibitors".

There are two existing IFUs for this reagent, one without apixaban information (HemosIL Liquid Anti‐Xa, product 0020302602, Insert revision 06/2017) and the other including apixaban information (HemosIL Liquid Anti‐Xa, product 0020302602, Insert revision 12/2020). For the Instrumentation Laboratory reagent including apixaban information, the intended use statement indicates the following situations where measurement of apixaban levels could be useful to have as additional information:

- **Patients at risk for major bleeding**: The assay is not a standalone test, and the results should be used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings.
- **Patients experiencing a bleeding episode**: The use of this kit is specific to a certain class of instruments; therefore, using this kit on other instruments would be considered a modification to the IFU and thus an LDT.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^116bG5ph]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

We conducted a prospective, multicentre cross-sectional study to test the hypothesis that an LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assay would accurately measure rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban drug levels in clinical practice and correctly predict clinically relevant concentrations. Consecutive inpatients and outpatients treated with rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban were included in 2018 and 2019 from nine major haemostasis laboratories affiliated with Swiss tertiary hospitals.

- **Inclusion criteria**: (a) Age > 18 years, (b) use of rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban, (c) drug-level requested, and (d) signed general informed consent, if required by local authorities.
- **Exclusion criteria**: (a) Refusal of general informed consent, (b) additional use of heparin, (c) more than one DOAC used, (d) pre-analytical issues, and (e) insufficient sample material.

The appropriate Ethics Committee approved the protocol, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

- **Methods**: Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) targeting rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and edoxaban M4 metabolite was conducted as the reference standard in parallel.

### The PiCTtest is a reliable alternative to the activated partial thromboplastin time in unfractionated heparin therapy management: results from a multicenter study [^114hP4sF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

The essentials of this study reveal that activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) or anti-Xa tests are typically used to monitor heparin. The prothrombinase-induced clotting time (PiCT) was compared to APTT in a clinical study. PiCT shows a higher correlation to anti-Xa than APTT does and demonstrates greater comparability between centers. Notably, PiCT demonstrates significantly higher accuracy and reliability than APTT in heparin monitoring.

Background: Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is still a commonly used anticoagulant for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolism in a variety of situations. Increasingly, chromogenic anti-Xa assays are used for UFH monitoring given the high variability of APTT in this setting. Despite known variability, the APTT test remains the most frequently used monitoring tool in UFH therapy because of its broad availability, lower costs, and wide acceptance. Various guidelines continue to recommend the use of APTT as an anti-Xa surrogate, although this approach remains controversial.

Objective: To assess the prothrombinase-induced clotting time (PiCT®) test, reported in seconds, as an alternative to APTT in the management of UFH-mediated anticoagulation.

Methods: Plasma samples from patients receiving UFH were obtained in three different centers in the United States and Europe. Samples were analyzed for PiCT, APTT, and anti-Xa activities with conditions set to allow comparability. Target ranges in seconds for PiCT and APTT were established for a UFH concentration of 0.3–0.7 IU mL^-1, derived from anti-Xa results as suggested by the ACCP guidelines.

### Monitoring unfractionated heparin (UFH) therapy: Which anti-factor Xa assay is appropriate [^115ztVDf]. Thrombosis Research (2007). Low credibility.

Anti-Factor Xa (Anti-Xa) assays specifically determine the anticoagulant activity of UFH by measuring the ability of heparin-bound antithrombin (AT) to inhibit a single enzyme, Factor Xa (FXa). Recent improvements in the automation, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility of the assay to clinicians have resulted in the Anti-Xa assay becoming a part of daily clinical practice in many institutions.

- **Objectives**: We hypothesized that different Anti-Xa assays have different applicability for use in clinical settings, depending on the amount of UFH administered. This was investigated in a tertiary paediatric institution.

- **Materials and methods**: Samples were collected from children receiving low-dose UFH of at least 10 IU/kg/h, with or without a previous bolus of up to 25 IU/kg/h, within the previous 6 hours in the PICU and HDU. The high-dose UFH population consisted of children undergoing cardiac catheterization (CC), who received a bolus of UFH of 100 IU/kg body weight, 30 minutes prior to sampling.

- **Results and conclusions**: The Anti-Xa activity for a given dose of UFH was found to vary significantly based on the Anti-Xa assay and the population being monitored. Our study suggests that the modified COMATIC Anti-Xa assay provides the best physiological measure of the UFH effect in children, as it does not introduce sources of error, such as exogenous AT, which may increase the measured anti-Factor Xa activity, nor dextran sulphate, which can displace plasma protein-bound heparin, leading to falsely elevated assay results. Further studies that include assessment of…

### Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in the laboratory: 2015 review [^116wj5h3]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulant therapies, including direct anti-Xa and thrombin inhibitors, have recently been introduced and may have advantages over vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin. This review briefly describes the clinical utility and mechanism of action of these agents.

Detailed information is provided on the effect of these agents on routine assays, including the APTT and PT, as well as their impact on specialty laboratory assays. Additionally, the use of drug-specific assays and a discussion of alternative methods to determine relative drug concentration are included. Such methods involve evaluating drug calibrators in APTT and PT assays and using heparin-calibrated anti-Xa assays to measure direct Xa inhibitors.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^113EQKfx]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). High credibility.

The proportion of the population taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban is rapidly increasing, and critical clinical situations occur frequently. A simple and readily available laboratory test that accurately determines these anticoagulants' concentration in various healthcare settings would improve care in this vulnerable population.

Routine coagulation tests, which are widely available, are not suitable for determining DOAC drug levels. Anti-Xa assays, which are successfully used for the monitoring of heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), demonstrated a nice linear relationship in samples spiked with rivaroxaban. DOAC-calibrated anti-Xa activity correlated well with drug concentrations when measured in healthy volunteers and even in patients. However, widespread implementation in clinical practice is hampered by two major problems.

- **Current challenges**:
	- A large study investigating the accuracy of all Xa inhibitors over the full spectrum of concentrations in clinical practice is still missing.
	- Providing different assays for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban drug levels in a '24/7' service is elaborate and expensive.

It would be very convenient if laboratories could use a test that is already available on a 24/7 basis to determine all three Xa inhibitors. Such a universal anti-Xa assay would simplify laboratory procedures and foster widespread implementation.

### Measurement of the new anticoagulants [^116dg1h1]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

New oral anticoagulants are administered at fixed daily doses without laboratory dose adjustments for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following elective total knee and hip replacements, for the treatment and prevention of acute venous thromboembolism, and for the prevention of embolic events in atrial fibrillation. However, it may be necessary to determine the anticoagulant effect of these new oral anticoagulants in special patient populations such as the elderly, those with renal impairment, and before operations, as well as during bleeding or thrombotic episodes, to monitor self-compliance. Oral factor Xa and oral thrombin inhibitors dose-dependently influence global and specific coagulation assays. Standardization of assays is currently underway. Determination of the new oral anticoagulants in serum samples would facilitate blood sampling and analysis from samples taken and stored for creatinine or other biochemical parameters. Point-of-care methods from plasma or urine for the new oral anticoagulants would improve patient care. Initial data demonstrate the feasibility of such assays in urine.

### The effect of direct oral anticoagulants on antithrombin activity testing is abolished by DOAC-Stop in venous thromboembolism patients [^112ufRWo]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may cause false negative results of antithrombin (AT) deficiency screening.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the impact of DOAC-Stop, an agent reversing in vitro effects of DOACs, on AT testing in anticoagulated patients.

- **Design**: We assessed 130 venous thromboembolism patients aged 46.7 ± 13.5 years. Blood samples were collected 2 to 27 hours after DOAC intake from 49 patients on rivaroxaban, 54 on apixaban, and 27 on dabigatran. Antithrombin activity was assessed using the activated factor X (FXa)-based and the activated factor II (FIIa)-based methods twice, before and after DOAC-Stop treatment, together with plasma DOAC levels using coagulometric assays.

- **Results**: The use of DOAC-Stop did not influence AT activity measured using the FIIa-based assay, whereas there was a marked decrease in AT activity determined using the FXa-based assay (ΔAT = 16.9%; 95% CI, 12.9%-19.1%). The AT-FIIa assay revealed decreased AT level (< 79%) in all 10 (7.7%) genetically confirmed AT-deficient patients treated with rivaroxaban or apixaban (n = 5 each), whereas the AT-FXa assay showed decreased AT activity (< 83%) in 2 subjects on rivaroxaban and 1 on apixaban with low plasma DOAC concentrations (< 90 ng/mL). After DOAC-Stop, median AT-FXa activity lowered from 83.5% (interquartile range, 66%-143%) to 65.5% (interquartile range, 57%-75%; p = 0.005; ΔAT = 18%) in AT-deficient patients, without any false negative results. The ΔAT in the FXa-based assay correlated with rivaroxaban and apixaban concentrations in the AT-deficient patients (r = 0.99, P < .001).

### Direct oral anticoagulant monitoring: What laboratory tests are available to guide us [^1163Rd8w]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used in the treatment and prophylaxis of thromboembolism due to several advantages over vitamin K antagonists, including no need for laboratory monitoring. However, it has become increasingly important in certain clinical scenarios to know either the actual DOAC concentration (quantitative) or the presence of DOAC (qualitative). These clinical conditions include patients presenting with major bleeding or requiring urgent surgery who may need a reversal or hemostatic agent, extremes of body weight, and failed therapy. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are variably affected by factor Xa inhibitors (FXaIs) and direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI), respectively, depending on the sensitivity of reagents, and hence, they cannot be relied on confidently. Thrombin time is highly sensitive to very low amounts of DTI; thus, a normal value rules out a clinically significant amount. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry accurately measures DOAC levels but is clinically impractical. Dilute thrombin time and ecarin-based assays using appropriate calibrators/controls provide an accurate DTI level. Anti-Xa assays using corresponding FXaI calibrators/controls provide accurate drug levels. However, these assays are not readily available in the United States compared to some other parts of the world. Heparin assays using anti-Xa activity often have a linear relationship with calibrated FXaI assays, especially at the lower end of on-therapy levels, and they may provide rapid assessment of drug activity for clinical decision making.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^1145McAu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), edoxaban (Savaysa), and betrixaban (Bevyxxa) — are anticoagulation therapies used for the prevention of thrombosis in several cardiovascular contexts. DOACs are categorized into two main classes: oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (i.e. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (i.e. dabigatran). In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its first DOAC, dabigatran, followed by rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban in subsequent years. DOACs are relatively new agents demonstrating superiority or noninferiority to prior standards of care, such as anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA; i.e. warfarin) or low‐molecular‐weight heparins (LMWHs), in reducing the risk of thromboembolic complications with similar or reduced bleeding risks.

Advantages of DOACs compared with VKAs include fewer monitoring requirements, less frequent follow‐up, more immediate drug onset and offset effects (important for periprocedural and acute bleeding management), and fewer drug and food interactions. As a result, DOAC prescriptions exceeded those for warfarin by 2013, with apixaban being the most frequently prescribed DOAC for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).

Over the past decade, DOACs have been the subject of extensive investigation in many clinical scenarios. Though guidelines and review articles have provided detailed and in‐depth analyses of the immense literature base, these can sometimes be cumbersome to navigate.

### Reversal of direct oral anticoagulants: a practical approach [^112RpQYV]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have at least noninferior efficacy compared with other oral anticoagulants and offer ancillary benefits, including an overall better safety profile, a lack of need for routine monitoring, a rapid onset of action, and ease of administration. Reversal of these agents may be indicated in certain situations such as severe bleeding and for perioperative management. DOAC-associated bleeding should be risk stratified: patients with moderate or severe bleeding should discontinue DOAC and consider reversal strategies.

Laboratory testing has limited utility in the acute management of bleeding. Thrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time may be useful for excluding clinically relevant levels of dabigatran. Prothrombin time is potentially useful for rivaroxaban and edoxaban, but calibrated anti-Xa assays are optimal for determining clinically relevant levels of factor Xa inhibitors. Because specific reversal agents are not widely available, supportive care and interventions for local hemostasis remain the cornerstones of therapy in patients with DOAC-associated bleeding. Nonspecific reversal agents should be considered only in the event of severe bleeding because their efficacy is unknown, and they are associated with the risk of thrombosis.

Recent results from phase 3/4 studies demonstrate efficacy for an antidote to dabigatran (idarucizumab, a monoclonal antibody fragment with specificity for dabigatran) and an antidote to factor Xa inhibitors (andexanet alfa, a recombinant and inactive form of factor Xa that binds inhibitors).

### Progress in the monitoring of direct oral anticoagulant therapy [^1155agDb]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

The availability of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has led to a paradigm shift in the field of anticoagulation, with DOACs increasingly being prescribed for patients in preference to vitamin K antagonists and low molecular weight heparin. Despite good experience with the use of these agents at fixed doses, there are clinical scenarios where monitoring is recommended. Data from phase III studies of the DOACs and small real-world studies suggest a relationship between DOAC concentration and clinical events.

The DOACs have differing impacts on the common tests of haemostasis, and it is important that clinicians are familiar with the sensitivity of the reagents used in their laboratory to individual DOACs. The specific DOAC drug concentrations can be assayed in the laboratory, when required, to guide appropriate clinical decision-making.

Studies from the real world with sufficient numbers evaluating the association of DOAC concentrations with outcomes should be a research priority in order to understand if we could do better through dose individualisation.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^113njy2S]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

There are no FDA‐approved methods to monitor the anticoagulant effect of DOACs. Qualitative coagulation assays, such as activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and prothrombin time, can be used as first‐line tests if evaluating medication compliance is clinically important. However, these tests are insufficient to assess the degree of anticoagulant effect as seen with INR for the management of VKA therapy.

Quantitative measures, such as anti–factor Xa levels, plasma drug concentrations, dilute thrombin time, and ecarin thrombin time, exist to directly assess anticoagulation effects. However, quantitative tests do not have an established clinical role since standardized therapeutic ranges have not been established and quantitative test results have not been correlated with clinical outcomes.

Other general monitoring parameters include signs and symptoms of bleeding, complete blood count, and a comprehensive metabolic panel specifically evaluating liver function tests, albumin, total bilirubin, and serum creatinine. These monitoring parameters should be performed in all patients before the initiation of a DOAC and routinely monitored 1 to 3 months after initiation, and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter, with more frequent follow‐ups based on patient‐specific characteristics recommended in provider plans.

- **Comprehensive DOAC monitoring approach**: In addition to laboratory monitoring parameters, this should include the following items assessed at each follow‐up: health status and adherence.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^1111C3ps]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). High credibility.

A universal anti-Xa assay for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban drug concentrations would simplify laboratory procedures and facilitate widespread implementation. Following two pilot studies analyzing spiked samples and material from 698 patients, we conducted a prospective multicenter cross-sectional study. This study included 867 patients treated with rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban in clinical practice to comprehensively evaluate a simple, readily available anti-Xa assay that would accurately measure drug concentrations and correctly predict relevant levels in clinical practice.

Anti-Xa activity was measured by an assay calibrated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in addition to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). As an external validation, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity was also determined in nine external laboratories. The LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity correlated strongly with rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban drug levels [r_s = 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98–0.98]. The sensitivity for the clinically relevant cut-off levels of 30, 50, and 100 µg/l was 96.2% (95% CI 94.4–97.4), 96.4% (95% CI 94.4–97.7), and 96.7% (95% CI 94.3–98.1), respectively. Concordant results were obtained in the external validation study.

In conclusion, a universal, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assay accurately measured rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban concentrations and correctly predicted relevant drug concentrations in clinical practice.

### The myths behind DOAC measurement: Analyses of prescribing information from different regulatory bodies and a call for harmonization [^117Mc6JC]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Laboratories in Canada, the UK, Australasia, and Europe have demonstrated that these tests are easily implementable and show adequate analytical and clinical performance according to their regional regulations. These tests are helpful for clinicians, as evidenced by numerous studies from these regions. In the United States, there is no need to wait for FDA approval of DOAC-dedicated methods to develop these tests, as almost all laboratories possess the minimum material requirements for performing these analyses. In centers dealing with DOAC reversal agents, offering product‐dedicated methods may even be extremely cost-effective. This approach may help rationalize the administration of andexanet alfa or idarucizumab for direct factor Xa inhibitors and dabigatran, respectively.

Use of DOACs is ever-expanding, with DOAC prescriptions now exceeding those of other anticoagulants, including VKA, in some geographies. As this use increases, the likely need to measure DOAC exposure will also increase. Measurement of DOACs does not present any technical difficulty. The fact that these laboratory tests are not available in some locations suggests disparities in patient care, and it is time to address such disparities.

### A universal anti-xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^112ajopi]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

In a comprehensive set of evaluation studies, a universal LMWH‐calibrated anti‐Xa assay accurately estimated concentrations of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, and correctly predicted relevant drug levels. We demonstrated a sensitive and linear relationship between drug concentrations and the assay measurements in spiking experiments. In an extensive retrospective analysis, we confirmed the method's feasibility by comparing drug‐specific measurements with LMWH‐calibrated results. A large prospective multicentre cross‐sectional study utilizing LC‐MS/MS as a reference standard established a high accuracy and sound sensitivity and specificity for clinically relevant thresholds. External validation conducted in nine laboratories confirmed that the assay can be applied to other institutions.

A few preliminary studies proposing a single calibration to determine all anti‐Xa inhibitors have been conducted. Our present results are essentially consistent with those results. A high level of correlation was observed in a retrospective study measuring an LMWH‐calibrated assay and LC‐MS/MS in 210 patients taking rivaroxaban or apixaban. Similar results were also reported by Douxfils et al. in a retrospective analysis of 52 patients and another cross‐sectional analysis in 30 patients. More recently, rivaroxaban and apixaban‐calibrated anti‐Xa measurements were compared with possible LMWH‐calibrated measurements as inferred from the same measurement. Additionally, in vitro or ex vivo spiking experiments have been conducted by several other authors.

Patient characteristics

A total of 932 patients were included across nine study centres (Fig 1). Among these, 35 patients were excluded due to heparin use, two were excluded for using more than one DOAC, five were excluded because of pre-analytical issues, and 23 were excluded due to insufficient sample material. Thus, 867 patients were eventually available for analysis. Of these, 375 patients were taking rivaroxaban, 426 were taking apixaban, and 66 were taking edoxaban. The median age was 76 years with an interquartile range (IQR) of 66–82 years, and 42.8% of the patients were female. Drug levels for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban were evenly distributed across the full range of measurements (Fig 3).

- **Measurements**: The universal, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)-calibrated anti-Xa assay was used to measure drug concentrations in a multicentre cross-sectional study conducted in clinical practice (n = 867). Drug concentrations were determined using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Out of all the patients, 375 were on rivaroxaban, 426 on apixaban, and 66 on edoxaban. The Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.99 for rivaroxaban (95% CI 0.98–0.99), 0.97 for apixaban (95% CI 0.96–0.97), and 0.98 for edoxaban (95% CI 0.95–0.99).

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: The association between LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assay measurements and drug concentrations is depicted in Fig 3. The Spearman correlation coefficient (rs) was 0.99 for rivaroxaban (95% CI 0.98–0.99), 0.97 for apixaban (95% CI 0.96–0.97), and 0.98 for edoxaban (95% CI 0.95–0.99). Below 50 µg/L, the rs was 0.90 (95% CI 0.88–0.93).

### Anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112psHL9]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

An important advantage of DOACs over warfarin is that there is no need for regular pharmacodynamic monitoring. However, in certain clinical situations, the use of an anti-IIa assay for dabigatran or an anti-Xa assay calibrated for factor Xa inhibitors may be required. These clinical situations include the occurrence of major bleeding, the need for emergent surgery, concerns about drug absorption or adherence, concomitant use of P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, morbid obesity, and patients with advanced CKD. A detailed description of anticoagulant reversal is beyond the scope of this manuscript.

### Laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant activity of direct oral anticoagulants: A systematic review [^112Fp2To]. Chest (2017). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the treatment of choice for most patients with atrial fibrillation and/or noncancer-associated venous thromboembolic disease. Although routine monitoring of these agents is not required, assessment of anticoagulant effect may be desirable in special situations. The objective of this review was to systematically summarize evidence regarding laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

- **Methods**: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting relationships between drug levels and coagulation assay results.

- **Results**: We identified 109 eligible studies: 35 for dabigatran, 50 for rivaroxaban, 11 for apixaban, and 13 for edoxaban. The performance of standard anticoagulation tests varied across DOACs and reagents; most assays showed insufficient correlation to provide a reliable assessment of DOAC effects. Dilute thrombin time (TT) assays demonstrated linear correlation (r² = 0.67–0.99) across a range of expected concentrations of dabigatran, as did ecarin-based assays. Calibrated anti-Xa assays demonstrated linear correlation (r² = 0.78–1.00) across a wide range of concentrations for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

- **Conclusions**: An ideal test, offering both accuracy and precision for the measurement of any DOAC, is not widely available. We recommend a dilute TT or ecarin-based assay for assessment of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, and anti-Xa assays with drug-specific calibrators for direct Xa inhibitors. In the absence of these tests, TT analysis may be considered.

### Comparative performance of three anti-factor Xa heparin assays in patients in a medical intensive care unit receiving intravenous, unfractionated heparin [^1158FhpM]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

The availability of automated anti-Xa heparin assays provides an opportunity to manage patient unfractionated heparin levels directly, rather than by the activated partial thromboplastin time. Because critically ill patients can acquire an antithrombin deficiency, we compared the performance of three anti-Xa heparin assays: one with and two without antithrombin supplementation. This comparison involved analyzing in vitro aliquots of plasma with defined antithrombin levels and specimens from intensive care patients receiving intravenous heparin therapy.

Heparin concentration recovery in vitro was dependent on the plasma antithrombin concentration for all three assays. The antithrombin-supplemented assay demonstrated improved heparin recovery directly correlated to the heparin concentration in the plasma. The greatest effect of antithrombin supplementation occurred when the antithrombin level dropped below 40%, a level present in only 5% of the patient specimens.

Analysis of patient specimens demonstrated significant correlation among the three assays. Classification of the clinical adequacy of patient heparin levels showed agreement of 80% or more between the antithrombin-supplemented and nonsupplemented assays. The antithrombin-supplemented assay did not significantly improve clinical usefulness.

### Activated partial thromboplastin time and anti-Xa measurements in heparin monitoring: Biochemical basis for discordance [^111fkeuW]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

We examined the concordance of heparin levels measured by a chromogenic anti-Xa assay and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) during unfractionated heparin therapy (UFH) and the biochemical basis for differences between these measures. We also investigated the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) as a possible measure of anticoagulation. Paired measures of anti-Xa and APTT were performed on 569 samples from 149 patients on UFH. The anti-Xa values and the APTT were concordant in only 54% of measurements. One hundred twelve samples from 59 patients on UFH were assayed for APTT, anti-Xa, factor II, factor VIII, and ETP. Supratherapeutic APTT values but therapeutic anti-Xa results had decreased factor II activity. Subtherapeutic APTT but therapeutic anti-Xa values had high factor VIII activity. ETP correlated with anticoagulation status and UFH dose. In conclusion, factor II and VIII activity contributes to discordance between APTT and anti-Xa results. ETP measurements may provide an additional assessment of anticoagulation status.

### A universal anti-xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy, and external validation [^115qH1qn]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). High credibility.

Our present study's strength is the comprehensive set of evaluation studies we conducted, which were carefully designed to clarify all essential questions associated with the implementation. The cross-sectional study was prospectively designed and conducted in a multicentre design, including many patients. LC-MS/MS was utilized as the most valid reference standard. Moreover, a clinical practice, rather than an artificial study setting, was chosen. External validation confirmed the potential application of the specific cut-offs to other laboratories.

The present study has several potential limitations. First, edoxaban was not studied in the spiking experiments and the retrospective analysis because it was not available in Switzerland at the time of these experiments. As long as the accuracy of the measurements was equivalent to rivaroxaban and apixaban in the cross-sectional study and external validation, we believe that findings from spiking experiments and retrospective analysis can be extrapolated to edoxaban. Second, the number of patients taking edoxaban was limited due to its restricted use in Switzerland. However, we estimate the risk of bias as low because the accuracy measures are consistent between drugs and in the external validation study. Third, only one particular LMWH-calibrated assay was studied, and other anti-Xa assays might behave differently. Therefore, these results cannot be straightforwardly applied to other LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assays.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: Method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^1149MeqN]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

In conclusion, a universal LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assay accurately measured concentrations of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban and correctly predicted relevant drug levels in clinical practice. A sensitive and linear relationship was established, the feasibility confirmed, and high accuracy with sound sensitivity and specificity was demonstrated. The test was verified through external validation. Implementation of the universal assay might not only simplify laboratory processes and save healthcare costs, but also foster the implementation of anti-Xa assays for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban in various healthcare settings. Future research shall confirm our observations in other settings using different reagents and analysers.

Calculated and realised concentrations of the spiked samples are shown in Table SI of the supplemental material. Figure 2 illustrates the association between LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa measurements and drug concentrations in all seven laboratories. The Spearman correlation coefficient between anti-Xa activity and drug concentrations was 1.0 in all laboratories.

- **Spiking experiments**: Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)-calibrated anti-Xa activity in standardised plasma samples spiked with rivaroxaban and apixaban, as measured in seven haemostasis laboratories, are reported. Results of pilot study 1 show a Spearman correlation coefficient of 1.0 in all laboratories.

- **Retrospective analysis**: A total of 698 samples from 474 patients were available for analysis. Among them, 432 patients were taking rivaroxaban and 73 apixaban. The median age was 68.2 years (range 18–99 years), and 70.1% were female. The correlations between LMWH- and drug-calibrated anti-Xa activities are shown in Figure S1 of the supplemental material. The Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.96 for rivaroxaban [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95–0.97] and 0.98 for apixaban [95% CI 0.97–0.99]. A deviation from linearity was observed in patient samples > 483 µg/l.

### DOACs: Role of anti-Xa and drug level monitoring [^114cfZ9K]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2024). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not require routine monitoring of anticoagulant effect, but measuring DOAC activity may be desirable in specific circumstances to detect whether clinically significant DOAC levels are present, such as prior to urgent surgery. Additionally, it is important to assess whether drug levels are excessively high or excessively low in at-risk patients, for instance, after malabsorptive gastrointestinal surgery. Routine coagulation tests, including the international normalized ratio (INR) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), cannot accurately quantify drug levels but may provide a qualitative assessment of DOAC activity. This assessment considers the estimated time to drug clearance based on the timing of the last drug ingestion and renal and hepatic function.

Drug-specific chromogenic and clot-based assays can quantify drug levels; however, they are not universally available and do not have established therapeutic ranges. In this review, we discuss our approach to measuring DOAC drug levels, including patient selection, interpretation of coagulation testing, and how measurement may inform clinical decision-making in specific scenarios.

### Interlaboratory performance in measurement of dabigatran and rivaroxaban [^112TPP3p]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Assessing direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) drug levels through reliable laboratory assays is crucial in various clinical scenarios.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of DOAC-specific assays for different concentrations of dabigatran and rivaroxaban. Additionally, the study assessed the interlaboratory variability in measuring these DOACs and investigated the responsiveness of routine clotting assays to various concentrations of these oral anticoagulants.

College of American Pathologists proficiency testing survey data from 2013 to 2016 were summarized and analyzed.

For dabigatran, the interlaboratory coefficient of variation (CV) for the ecarin chromogenic assay was broad, ranging as follows:

- For 100-ng/mL: 7.5% to 29.1%
- For 200-ng/mL: 6.3% to 15.5%
- For 400-ng/mL: 6.8% to 9.0%

The CV for diluted thrombin time for dabigatran was more consistent, ranging as follows:

- For 100 ng/mL: 11.6% to 17.2%
- For 200 ng/mL: 9.3% to 12.3%
- For 400 ng/mL: 7.1% to 11.2%

For rivaroxaban, the rivaroxaban-calibrated anti-Xa assay CVs showed variability:

- For 50-ng/mL: 11.5% to 22.2%
- For 200-ng/mL: 7.2% to 10.9%
- For 400-ng/mL: 6.4% to 8.1%

The responsiveness of prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to DOACs was dose- and reagent-dependent. PT was more responsive to rivaroxaban, while aPTT was more responsive to dabigatran. The undiluted thrombin time exhibited maximum prolongation across all three dabigatran concentrations, making it impractically sensitive for drug-level monitoring.

### A universal anti-Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban measurements: method validation, diagnostic accuracy and external validation [^11565XGm]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). High credibility.

A universal anti-Xa assay for the determination of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban drug concentrations would simplify laboratory procedures and facilitate widespread implementation. Following two pilot studies analyzing spiked samples and material from 698 patients, we conducted a prospective multicenter cross-sectional study. This study included 867 patients treated with rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban in clinical practice to comprehensively evaluate a simple, readily available anti-Xa assay that would accurately measure drug concentrations and correctly predict relevant levels in clinical practice.

- **Methodology**: Anti-Xa activity was measured by an assay calibrated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in addition to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
- **External validation**: As an external validation, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity was also determined in nine external laboratories.

The LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa activity correlated strongly with rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban drug levels (r = 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98–0.98). The sensitivity for the clinically relevant cut-off levels of 30, 50, and 100 µg/l was 96.2% (95% CI 94.4–97.4), 96.4% (95% CI 94.4–97.7), and 96.7% (95% CI 94.3–98.1) respectively. Concordant results were obtained in the external validation study.

In conclusion, a universal, LMWH-calibrated anti-Xa assay accurately measured rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban concentrations and correctly predicted relevant drug concentrations in clinical practice.

### Anticoagulation monitoring during ECMO support: Monitor or flip a coin [^114QJFPp]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Anti-factor Xa assays, which measure the ability of heparin-bound antithrombin to inhibit factor Xa, are gaining popularity as an important component of UFH monitoring in patients receiving ECMO support. A meta-analysis of anti-Xa-guided anticoagulation monitoring, encompassing 26 articles with a total of 2293 patients, did not find a significant difference in anti-Xa levels between patients with and without hemorrhagic events. However, the authors found a moderate correlation between UFH dose and anti-Xa levels, supporting its utility in anticoagulation monitoring. Additionally, in cases of thromboembolic events (16 studies, 1968 patients), anti-Xa levels were significantly lower in patients experiencing thrombosis. Both meta-analyses were limited by the predominantly retrospective nature of the included studies and the relatively small number of studies examining thromboembolic events. Despite its longer turnaround time compared to time-guided methods, anti-Xa demonstrates potential, and further research is warranted.

Although significant advancements have been made in critical care, time-guided anticoagulation monitoring tools remain widely used in patients receiving ECMO support. Considering the contemplative limitations of these methods, combining multiple tools may be the most effective approach to minimizing the risk of adverse events.

Given the above, should we rely on monitoring or simply flip a coin? The increasing use of anti-factor Xa activity to monitor the effect of UFH appears appropriate, given its moderate correlation with the UFH infusion.
