first line of treatmentb for psychosis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about first-line treatment for psychosis, including acute and maintenance phases, first-episode considerations, nonpharmacologic adjuncts, and how to individualize and escalate care if needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the clinical context and whether this is first-episode psychosis or recurrent psychosis. Then, I should verify pharmacologic first-line recommendations across high-credibility guidelines. Next, I will consider dose selection and monitoring in first-episode psychosis, followed by maintenance-phase guidance. After that, I need to integrate psychosocial interventions and when they are first-line. Then, I will address special populations and resource settings. Finally, I should review escalation strategies for inadequate response, including when to introduce clozapine, and synthesize a practical first-line approach with safety checks and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because the "first-line" approach differs meaningfully between a first episode of psychosis and subsequent episodes or chronic illness, and it hinges on shared decision-making given patient preferences and values vary widely in acute and maintenance care, so I need to ensure I'm anchoring recommendations to that framework before proceeding [^112arzzX] [^114GMNkp].

> I will now examine pharmacologic first-line treatment for the acute episode; hold on, I should verify concordance across guidelines: both the VA/DoD and BAP recommend initiating an antipsychotic medication for acute psychosis, and VA/DoD explicitly recommends using an antipsychotic other than clozapine as initial therapy, reserving clozapine for treatment resistance or suicidality, with selection individualized to patient characteristics and side-effect profiles, and WHO's updated mhGAP similarly endorses antipsychotic initiation as first-line therapy for psychotic disorders, aligning with this approach [^115Fanqv] [^116MN4hH] [^114iEM53].

> Wait, let me verify agent selection nuances; although some expert commentaries and contemporary algorithms caution against agents with high metabolic risk in treatment-naïve patients, VA/DoD treats the class as having broadly similar efficacy and does not name a single preferred agent, while BAP emphasizes starting at the low end of licensed dose ranges, and primary care guidance commonly favors second-generation antipsychotics due to a lower propensity for extrapyramidal symptoms, so I should not over-specify a single "best" drug outside of patient-specific risk profiles and access constraints [^115Fanqv] [^116MN4hH] [^112cN6xy].

> For first-episode psychosis, I need to ensure dosing is conservative and monitoring is intensive; start low, go slow, reassess within a week for safety and tolerability, then closely monitor over 4–6 weeks, using lower-end dosing and slower titration given increased sensitivity to side effects and to reduce discontinuation risk, which VA/DoD explicitly supports and aligns with BAP's low-end dose guidance and WHO's emphasis on careful risk–benefit balance in early illness [^1121nTtM] [^116MN4hH].

> Next, I should review maintenance-phase guidance; let me confirm duration recommendations and whether a specific time window is advised: WHO mhGAP recommends maintenance antipsychotic treatment for a minimum of 7–12 months after remission in first-episode psychosis, while VA/DoD concludes evidence is insufficient to specify a universal duration, and a classic randomized trial suggests very high one-year recurrence risk after discontinuation compared with continued treatment, so the balance favors continuation with individualized, shared decision-making about long-term therapy and cautious, slow tapering if attempted [^116XS7ms] [^1176oeHu] [^112B3jpP].

> Hold on, I should verify psychosocial interventions' role; they are not a substitute for antipsychotic treatment in acute psychosis but are co-first-line adjuncts, particularly for first-episode psychosis within coordinated specialty care models, with VA/DoD recommending family interventions and structured psychosocial programs and UK NICE-aligned practice emphasizing CBT and family interventions for children and young people, so medication plus psychosocial treatment is the evidence-based bundle rather than either alone [^117KbeE8] [^115WdmgT] [^1175iRrK].

> Let me consider special populations and settings so I don't overgeneralize; in adolescents and young adults, AACAP recommends second-generation antipsychotics as first-line in conjunction with psychotherapeutic interventions, while in older adults, I should prioritize lower starting doses, slower titration, and heightened attention to medical comorbidity; in humanitarian and low-resource settings, WHO's mhGAP-HIG supports haloperidol or chlorpromazine as first-line given availability, with risperidone or olanzapine as reasonable second-line options when available, reinforcing the need to align first-line choices with local formulary and monitoring capacity [^1177Fred] [^1121nTtM] [^115SpmcJ].

> I should double-check the escalation pathway when response is inadequate; VA/DoD suggests switching to another antipsychotic rather than immediate augmentation, after verifying adherence and an adequate dose and duration, and multiple guidelines converge on clozapine for treatment resistance, typically defined by TRRIP as inadequate response to two different antipsychotics of adequate dose and duration, though emerging data suggest earlier consideration may be warranted in some cases; importantly, a meta-analysis of algorithmic treatment shows superior response with clozapine at the third stage compared with switching among other non-clozapine agents, supporting timely clozapine initiation when resistance is evident [^113t3jL5] [^115rD2yX] [^11257E6t].

> But wait, what if adherence is the issue rather than pharmacologic failure; I need to ensure I evaluate and address adherence proactively, and if adherence remains problematic or is anticipated, consider long-acting injectables, which VA/DoD suggests to improve adherence and which several guidelines acknowledge as appropriate earlier when nonadherence risk is high or patient preference supports this route, with LAI benefits including reduced relapse and hospitalization and better continuity monitoring, though clinician and system barriers persist [^113Gx7sU] [^111jLzyg].

> I should confirm the role of measurement-based care and monitoring; given class risks like metabolic effects and extrapyramidal symptoms, guidelines emphasize baseline and serial assessments of weight, BMI, waist circumference, glucose and lipids, blood pressure, movement disorders, and prolactin as indicated, alongside symptom and functioning scales, and shared decision-making about switching or dose changes if adverse effects emerge or efficacy is suboptimal [^112cN6xy] [^1121nTtM].

> Let me reconsider whether any non-antipsychotic augmentation should be first-line; the evidence is limited and mixed, with VA/DoD citing insufficient evidence to recommend for or against augmentation for cognitive or negative symptoms, so first-line maintenance should remain antipsychotic monotherapy with psychosocial supports, reserving augmentation for selected cases after an adequate monotherapy trial and careful risk–benefit discussion [^114eAveJ] [^111FL5Zw].

> Pulling this together, my final, clinically actionable first-line approach is as follows: for an acute episode of psychosis, initiate a second-generation antipsychotic at the low end of the licensed dose range with shared decision-making about side-effect profiles, monitor closely within 1 week and again at 4–6 weeks, and if this is first-episode psychosis, deliver care within a coordinated specialty care model that includes CBT and family interventions; continue antipsychotic treatment for at least 7–12 months after remission, individualize long-term duration, maintain robust metabolic and neurologic monitoring, and if inadequate response after dose optimization and adherence confirmation, switch to another antipsychotic and, after two adequate trials, move promptly to clozapine to reduce relapse risk and improve outcomes, with LAIs considered when adherence is a concern or patient preference supports them [^115Fanqv] [^116MN4hH] [^1121nTtM] [^112cN6xy] [^116XS7ms] [^117KbeE8] [^115rD2yX] [^113Gx7sU].

---

The first-line treatment for psychosis is a **second-generation antipsychotic (SGA)** [^112cN6xy] (e.g. risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, paliperidone) started at a low dose and titrated to effect [^1121nTtM], with **shared decision-making** to match the agent to patient preferences and side-effect profiles [^114GMNkp]. SGAs are preferred over first-generation agents due to a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia [^115haei3]. For first-episode psychosis, use lower starting doses and titrate more slowly [^1121nTtM]; for treatment-resistant cases, **clozapine is indicated** [^115rD2yX] after two adequate trials of different antipsychotics [^115rD2yX]. Psychosocial interventions (CBT, family therapy, coordinated specialty care) [^112arzzX] should be offered alongside medication [^1121nTtM] to improve adherence and outcomes [^117K5VQV].

## Pharmacological first-line treatment

### Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs)

- **Definition**: SGAs (atypicals) are the preferred first-line pharmacological treatment for psychosis [^112cN6xy] due to their favorable side-effect profile compared to first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) [^112cN6xy].

- **Common SGAs**: Risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, paliperidone, ziprasidone, and lurasidone [^notfound].

- **Mechanism of action**: SGAs primarily antagonize dopamine D2 receptors and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, reducing psychotic symptoms with a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia (TD) compared to FGAs [^117N3G6i].

- **Clinical evidence**: SGAs have demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) and improving overall functioning in patients with psychosis [^notfound].

---

### First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs)

Although SGAs are preferred, **FGAs** (e.g. haloperidol, chlorpromazine) remain options, particularly in resource-limited settings [^1166HGjf], because of their lower cost and wide availability [^1166HGjf]. However, they carry a higher risk of EPS and TD, necessitating careful monitoring and dose adjustments [^115haei3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several authoritative guidelines provide clear recommendations on the **first-line pharmacological treatment** of psychosis:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) | Initiate SGAs as first-line treatment, starting at the lower end of the licensed therapeutic range [^116MN4hH] |
| World Health Organization (WHO) | - Recommend SGAs as first-line treatment <br/> - Emphasize individualized treatment based on patient characteristics and side-effect profiles [^notfound] |
| American Psychiatric Association (APA) | - SGAs are recommended as first-line treatment <br/> - Emphasize shared decision-making and individualized care [^notfound] |

---

## Factors influencing antipsychotic selection

The choice of antipsychotic medication should be **individualized** based on several factors:

- **Patient characteristics**: Age, gender, comorbidities, and previous treatment response [^1121nTtM].

- **Side-effect profiles**: Consider metabolic effects, weight gain, sedation, and prolactin elevation [^112V5jDm].

- **Patient preferences**: Engage in shared decision-making to enhance adherence and satisfaction [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Pharmacological treatment should be complemented by **psychosocial interventions** to optimize outcomes:

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Effective in reducing symptoms, improving functioning, and preventing relapse [^115gGwYV].

- **Family interventions**: Improve family functioning, reduce relapse, and enhance adherence [^notfound].

- **Coordinated specialty care (CSC)**: Multidisciplinary approach for first-episode psychosis, integrating pharmacological and psychosocial treatments [^112arzzX].

---

## Special considerations

### First-episode psychosis (FEP)

In first-episode psychosis, **lower starting doses and slower titration** are recommended to minimize side effects and enhance adherence [^1121nTtM]. Maintenance treatment is typically recommended for at least 7–12 months after remission, with individualized decisions regarding long-term treatment [^116XS7ms].

---

### Treatment-resistant schizophrenia

For treatment-resistant schizophrenia (defined as inadequate response to at least two different antipsychotics), **clozapine is the gold standard** and should be initiated promptly [^115rD2yX].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of **symptom improvement, side effects, and adherence** is essential [^117K5VQV]. Clinicians should assess metabolic parameters, weight, and cardiovascular risk factors periodically [^112cN6xy].

---

The first-line treatment for psychosis is the initiation of a **second-generation antipsychotic** [^1131NKx4], tailored to patient characteristics and preferences, with psychosocial interventions provided in conjunction with pharmacological treatment.

### Reducing variation in the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia: defining acceptable standards of treatment [^1172PWBQ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Clinicians are exhorted to improve the quality of care for patients with schizophrenia by applying evidence-based medication treatment guidelines. Unfortunately, although there are many guidelines, they are all more or less out of date, and their recommendations often are inconsistent, leaving clinicians uncertain about the definition of acceptable standards of care. This paper reviews existing guideline recommendations and recently published research related to two parameters of care: 1) first-line treatment of multiepisode psychosis and 2) the care of treatment-resistant patients. Its purpose is to help clinicians understand the implications of the latest research for the content of schizophrenia guidelines and for the clinical practice they are supposed to inform.

Objectives

A growing number of atypical antipsychotics are available for clinicians to choose from in the treatment of psychotic disorders. However, a number of important questions concerning medication selection, dosing and dose equivalence, and the management of inadequate response, compliance problems, and relapse have not been adequately addressed by clinical trials. To aid clinical decision-making, a consensus survey of expert opinion on the pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders was undertaken to address questions not definitively answered in the research literature.

Method

Based on a literature review, a written survey was developed with 60 questions and 994 options. Approximately half of the options were scored using a modified version of the RAND 9-point scale for rating the appropriateness of medical decisions. For the other options, the experts were asked to write in answers (e.g., average doses) or check a box to indicate their preferred answer. The survey was sent to 50 national experts on the pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders, 47 (94%) of whom completed it. In analyzing the responses to items rated on the 9-point scale, consensus on each option was defined as a non random distribution of scores by chi-square "goodness-of-fit"test. We assigned a categorical rank (first line/preferred choice, second line/alternate choice, third line/usually inappropriate) to each option based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean rating. Guideline tables indicating preferred treatment strategies were then developed for key clinical situations.

Results

The expert panel reached consensus on 88% of the options rated on the 9-point scale. The experts overwhelmingly endorsed the atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of psychotic disorders. Risperidone was the top choice for first-episode and multi-episode patients, with the other newer atypicals rated first line or high second line depending on the clinical situation. Clozapine and a long-acting injectable atypical (when available)were other high second line options for multi-episode patients. The expert's dosing recommendations agreed closely with the package inserts for the drugs, and their estimates of dose equivalence among the antipsychotics followed a linear pattern. The experts considered 3–6 weeks an adequate antipsychotic trial, but would wait a little longer (4–10 weeks) before making a major change in treatment regimen if there is a partial response. The experts recommended trying to improve response by increasing the dose of atypical and depot antipsychotics before switching to a different agent; there was less agreement about increasing the dose of conventional antipsychotics before switching, probably because of concern about side effects at higher doses. If it is decided to switch because of inadequate response, risperidone was the expert's first choice to switch to, no matter what drug was initially tried. Although there was some disparity in the expert's recommendations concerning how many agents to try before switching to clozapine, the expert's responses suggest that switching to clozapine should be Clozapine was also the antipsychotic of choice for patients with suicidal behavior. When switching oral antipsychotics, the experts considered cross-titration the preferred strategy. When switching to an injectable antipsychotic, the experts stressed the importance of continuing the oral antipsychotic until therapeutic levels of the injectable agent are achieved. The experts considered psychosocial interventions the first choice strategy for partially compliant patients, with pharmacologic interventions the first choice for patients with clear evidence of noncompliance. However, because it can be difficult to distinguish partially compliant from noncompliant patients, the editors recommended combining psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions to improve compliance whenever possible. When patients relapse because of compliance problems or if there is any doubt about compliance, the experts recommended the use of a long-acting injectable antipsychotic and would select an injectable atypical when this option becomes available. The experts would also consider using an injectable atypical antipsychotic (when available) in many clinical situations that do not involve compliance problems. The experts stressed the importance of monitoring for health problems-especially obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, HIV risk behaviors, medical complications of substance abuse, heavy smoking and its effects, hypertension, and amenorrhea-in patients being treated with antipsychotics. Although many patients are prescribed adjunctive treatments, multiple antipsychotics, and combinations of different classes of drugs (e.g., antipsychotics plus mood stabilizers or antidepressants) in an effort to enhance response, the experts gave little support to any of these strategies, with the exception of antidepressants for patients with dysphoria/depression, antidepressants or ECT for patients with suicidal behavior, and mood stabilizers for patients with aggression/violence. When asked about indicators of remission and recovery, the experts considered acute improvement in psychotic symptoms the most important indicator of remission, whereas they considered more sustained improvement in multiple outcome domains (e.g., occupational/educational functioning, peer relationships, independent living) important in assessing recovery.

Conclusions

The experts reached a high level of consensus on many of the key treatment questions in the survey. Within the limits of expert opinion and with the expectation that future research data will take precedence, these guidelines provide direction for addressing common clinical dilemmas that arise in the pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders. They can be used to inform clinicians and educate patients regarding the relative merits of a variety of interventions. Clinicians should keep in mind that no guidelines can address the complexities involved in the care of each individual patient and that sound clinical judgment based on clinical experience should be used in applying these recommendations.

### Updated rationale for the initial antipsychotic selection for patients with schizophrenia [^116PFDKR]. Schizophrenia (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Expert groups differ in their recommendations for early-stage schizophrenia treatment. Some expert groups, including American Psychiatric Association (APA), are non-directive and do not specify preferred agents for patients with first-episode psychosis –. This approach, while patient-centric, may challenge early practitioners and learners. Others offer algorithmic guidelines, but existing algorithms only partially agree on "first-line" treatments (see the section "Summary of first-line treatment options for patients without concurrent violence" for definition), reflecting the complexity of risk-benefit analysis –. In addition, updates to guidelines are essential to incorporate the latest research.

Based on up-to-date evidence (as of January 2024), we present a rationale for the selection of "first-line treatments" for patients with early-stage schizophrenia and challenges surrounding the selection of these agents. We present a general rationale, such that when idiographic factors of individuals dictate a different approach, the considerations discussed here should defer to individualized plans, and patients and practitioners should engage in shared decision-making at every step.

Initial patient stratification

After diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder is made and need for treatment established, patients in this algorithm are stratified into two groups (see the section "Treatment of patients with violence" for rationale) based on comorbid violence (in research studies typically defined as high score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) hostility item or Modified Overt Aggression Scale; henceforward "violence" will be used for simplicity). Figure 1 summarizes selection of antipsychotics proposed in this manuscript.

### Intervention in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis: a review and future directions [^112N4djs]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Over the last 15 years, a focus on early intervention in psychotic disorders has emerged. Initially, the early psychosis movement focused on timely recognition and phase-specific treatment of first-episode psychosis. However, early psychosis researchers suspected that pushing the point of intervention even further back to the prodromal phase of psychotic disorders may result in even better outcomes. This article reviews intervention research in the ultra-high-risk phase of psychotic disorders.

Data Sources

A literature search of intervention trials with ultra-high-risk cohorts published after 1980 was conducted on PubMed with the search terms prodrome and intervention.

Study Selection

All published intervention trials with ultra-high-risk cohorts.

Data Synthesis

The first generation of intervention trials indicated that both pharmacologic and psychological intervention strategies may be of value in terms of symptom reduction and delay or prevention of onset of threshold psychotic disorder.

Conclusions

Further controlled intervention trials with larger sample sizes are required in order to confirm and extend these findings. We argue that the clinical staging model provides a framework for the rationale and design of such studies, with simpler, safer, and more benign interventions being better candidates for first-line treatment, while more complex and potentially harmful treatments should be reserved for those cases in which response has failed to occur. Recent evidence indicates that neuroprotective agents, such as essential fatty acids, may be a suitable form of intervention for the ultra-high-risk phase of psychotic disorders, with a positive risk-benefit balance. Ethical aspects have become more salient given the recently observed declining transition rate in ultra-high-risk samples. We outline the key questions for the next generation of ultra-high-risk intervention trials.

### Late-life psychosis: diagnosis and treatment [^112yVCMB]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Psychosis is one of the most common conditions in later life with a lifetime risk of 23%. Despite its high prevalence, late-onset psychosis remains a diagnostic and treatment dilemma. There are no reliable pathognomonic signs to distinguish primary or secondary psychosis. Primary psychosis is a diagnosis of exclusion and the clinician must rule out secondary causes. Approximately 60% of older patients with newly incident psychosis have a secondary psychosis. In this article, we review current, evidence-based diagnostic and treatment approaches for this heterogeneous condition, emphasizing a thorough evaluation for the "six d's" of late-life psychosis (delirium, disease, drugs dementia, depression, delusions). Treatment is geared towards the specific cause of psychosis and tailored based on comorbid conditions. Frequently, environmental and psychosocial interventions are first-line treatments with the judicious use of pharmacotherapy as needed. There is an enormous gap between the prevalence of psychotic disorders in older adults and the availability of evidence-based treatment. The dramatic growth in the elderly population over the first half of this century creates a compelling need to address this gap.

### Is earlier better? At the beginning of schizophrenia: timing and opportunities for early intervention [^111hZhpW]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The fundamental tenet is treating psychotic patients as quickly and as effectively as possible. Few would oppose this idea. Increasing community awareness of the services, enhancing accessibility, optimizing the treatment approaches, improving compliance, and addressing substance misuse should hopefully translate into improved outcomes for the patients and their families and are extremely encouraging and welcome developments. However, the field urgently needs properly designed randomized controlled trials to definitively determine their efficacy. If they are shown to be efficacious the emphasis should then shift to randomized controlled trials of prodromal intervention. If prodromal intervention is proven to be successful then earlier might indeed be better and primary prevention within reach.

Treatment of patients without violence

Initial treatment of patients without concurrent violence

Clinicians face challenges in balancing efficacy and side effects when prescribing antipsychotics to treatment-naive patients. Existing algorithms approach this issue by assigning high significance to a few side effects, such as weight gain and/or tardive dyskinesia, commonly leading to exclusion of agents such as olanzapine and first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), respectively, as first-line treatments. The approach here deviates from such a rationale. In our opinion, selection of first-line treatments should be guided by three key overlapping factors:
Overall efficacy: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antipsychotics with long-term follow-up should be preferentially considered. Most RCTs are only several weeks long. Since schizophrenia is a disorder requiring treatment far longer in duration, shorter duration RCTs are less relevant (though still important) and have less external validity compared to studies with longer outcomes.
All-cause discontinuation: Discontinuation is typically influenced by perceived (in)efficacy and tolerability. Instead of weighing risks of particular side effects against effectiveness, we use all-cause discontinuation rates as a surrogate measure of side effect burden versus effectiveness. All-cause discontinuation is ideally based on RCTs with long-term follow-up.
Mortality: Schizophrenia has one of the highest mortality risks of all psychiatric disorders. While complex and difficult to study, mortality is a crucial outcome deserving attention for antipsychotic selection. There is an emerging consensus that untreated psychosis has more adverse health effects compared to risks posed by antipsychotics, but there is little guidance on how to weigh risk of discontinuation (and associated risks of untreated psychosis) versus long-term side effects. One could imagine a scenario of a weight-gaining antipsychotic with higher efficacy and lower overall discontinuation rate initially, but higher long-term mortality because of cardiovascular problems associated with weight gain over a longer period. Increased mortality may exclude this medication from first-line therapies. Conversely, if a weight-gaining antipsychotic has higher efficacy, lower discontinuation rates, and similar or lower long-term mortality relative to alternative treatments, there is no convincing reason to exclude it from first-line treatments. Thus, mortality data combines the above factors to allow determination of the "safest" first-line treatment choices.

### Early intervention in the treatment of psychosis [^1175iRrK]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

This article aims to: (1) describe the evolution of first episode of psychosis (FEP) approaches; (2) define a model of multidisciplinary care; (3) identify challenges and limitations; (4) discuss the unique challenges for those first experiencing psychosis; (5) identify strategies to expand early psychosis interventions. The authors take the medical standpoint and use the differential diagnosis and initial medical work-up as a context for assessment. The remainder of the article will be focused on treatment of FEP in those with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^116h9YWW]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

These updated guidelines from the British Association for Psychopharmacology replace the original version published in 2011. They address the scope and targets of pharmacological treatment for schizophrenia. A consensus meeting was held in 2017, involving experts in schizophrenia and its treatment. They were asked to review key areas and consider the strength of the evidence on the risk-benefit balance of pharmacological interventions and the clinical implications, with an emphasis on meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials where available, plus updates on current clinical practice. The guidelines cover the pharmacological management and treatment of schizophrenia across the various stages of the illness, including first-episode, relapse prevention, and illness that has proved refractory to standard treatment. It is hoped that the practice recommendations presented will support clinical decision making for practitioners, serve as a source of information for patients and carers, and inform quality improvement.

### Psychosocial interventions for people with schizophrenia or psychosis on minimal or no antipsychotic medication: a systematic review [^115BvU4f]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Antipsychotics are the first-line treatment for people with schizophrenia or psychosis. There is evidence that they can reduce the symptoms of psychosis and risk of relapse. However many people do not respond to these drugs, or experience adverse effects and stop taking them. In the UK, clinical guidelines have stressed the need for research into psychosocial interventions without antipsychotics. This systematic review examines the effects of psychosocial interventions for people with schizophrenia or psychosis who are on no/minimal antipsychotics. Databases were searched for empirical studies investigating a psychosocial intervention in people with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder who were not taking antipsychotics or had received an antipsychotic minimisation strategy. We identified nine interventions tested in 17 studies (N = 2250), including eight randomised controlled trials. Outcomes were generally equal to or in a small number of cases better than the control group (antipsychotics/treatment as usual) for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Need Adapted Treatment and Soteria. The remaining interventions provided some encouraging, but overall inconsistent findings and were Psychosocial Outpatient Treatment, Open Dialogue, Psychosocial Inpatient Treatment, Psychoanalysis/Psychodynamic Psychotherapy, Major Role Therapy, and Milieu Treatment. Study quality was generally low with little recent research. In conclusion, nine psychosocial interventions have been studied for patients on no/minimal antipsychotics. The majority of studies reported outcomes for the intervention which were the same as the control group, however, study quality was problematic. Given the adverse effects of antipsychotics and that many people do not want to take them, high quality trials of psychosocial treatments for people on minimal/no antipsychotics are needed.

### Evidence base for using atypical antipsychotics for psychosis in adolescents [^112KhoSc]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic medications have been the first line of treatment for adolescents with psychosis in the past couple of decades. Till the late 90s, there were very few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the treatment of adolescents with psychosis, although a fifth of schizophrenia starts during adolescence. Most of the treatment guidelines for adolescents with psychosis were derived from data on adults. In the past 10 years, there has been increasing number of studies on adolescents with psychosis. The current paper summarizes the findings of trials on adolescents with psychosis in 4 groups: (a) atypical antipsychotic medications vs placebo, (b) atypical antipsychotic medication vs typical antipsychotic medications, (c) one atypical antipsychotic medication vs another atypical antipsychotic medication, and (d) Low dose vs standard dose of atypical antipsychotic medication. We included 13 RCTs, with a total of 1112 participants. Although our review suggest that atypical antipsychotic medications are as effective as typical antipsychotic medications as regards clinical efficacy, atypical antipsychotic medications have a preferred side effect profile and lesser drop-out rate from trials. Obviously, this is extremely important as treatment adherence is key to successful remission of psychotic symptoms and also in some case prevent relapse of illness. Treatment with olanzapine, risperidone, and clozapine is often associated with weight gain. Aripiprazole is not associated with increased prolactin or with dyslipidemia. Adolescents may respond better to standard-dose as opposed to lower dose risperidone, but for aripiprazole and ziprasidone, lower doses may be equally effective. Future trial should be longer term and have uniform ways of reporting side effects.

### Update of the World Health Organization's mental health gap action programme guideline for psychoses (including schizophrenia) [^111REQrJ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

PSY2: Duration of Pharmacotherapy in First Episode Psychosis

The current guideline recommends maintenance therapy for a minimum of 7–12 months in adults with a first episode of psychosis (including schizophrenia) in remission, whereas the previous guideline in 2012 recommended maintenance therapy for the first episode psychosis for at least 12 months. The updated evidence showed high certainty evidence for maintenance therapy between 7 and 24 months, however, follow-up data were scarce between 1- and 2-year follow-up. In addition to the evidence, the decision for the recommended timeframe was taken against the background of various side effects of the antipsychotics. Moreover, in the first episode psychosis, it is frequently uncertain whether the diagnosis of schizophrenia is fulfilled or if it is a time-limited psychosis that will not develop into schizophrenia. After considering these aspects, maintenance therapy for a minimum of 7–12 was recommended, and not up to 2 years.

As a remark to this recommendation, it is stated that antipsychotics should be discontinued by gradually and slowly reducing the dosage. Moreover, when medicines are discontinued, people living with schizophrenia and family members need to be educated to detect the reemergence of symptoms early to allow for close clinical monitoring of relapse.

### Do cognitive behavioural therapy interventions lead to schema change in people with psychosis? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161f8PS]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Negative schemas have been highlighted as important factors in the development and maintenance of psychosis. However, evidence for schema therapy in people with experiences of psychosis and for schema-specific interventions is lacking for these disabling core beliefs. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) interventions remain a first-line recommended psychological treatment for psychosis, alongside psychotropic medication. The current review aimed for the first time to investigate if CBT interventions led to schema change in this population.

Method

A systematic search of five databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science) identified 19 eligible studies, of which 10 were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analyses.

Results

A narrative synthesis highlighted the variety in CBT intervention length and focus. A small proportion of studies highlighted schema theory within their therapy rationale and within their subsequent CBT intervention. Meta-analytic findings demonstrated that participants receiving a CBT intervention experienced a significant reduction in their negative-self schemas at the end of therapy, compared with control participants.

Conclusion

The findings provide evidence that CBT for psychosis can reduce negative schemas in people with psychosis. The review also offers a rationale for considering schema more explicitly within CBT for psychosis intervention studies and clinical practice.

### Clinicians' views of treatment types for first episode psychosis delivered in a randomised controlled trial (MAPS) [^115WdmgT]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Psychosis most often emerges during adolescence or young adulthood. The UK's NICE guidance for treatment of psychosis and schizophrenia in children and young people (CYP) recommends that both pharmaceutical (antipsychotic medication [AP]) and psychological (cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT] and family intervention [FI]) treatments are offered to CYP experiencing a first episode of psychosis. However, the evidence to support this guidance is largely extrapolated from studies conducted with adults, which limits its value as treatment effects observed in adults, positive or negative, may occur differently in younger people. The MAPS feasibility trial (Managing Adolescent first Episode Psychosis: a feasibility Study) was developed to address the need to improve this evidence base. MAPS randomised adolescents aged 14–18 years to one of three treatment allocations: AP only, CBT and FI only, or a combination of AP and CBT/FI.

Along with establishing empirical trial evidence, researchers should also evaluate relevant personal and professional perspectives to inform interpretations of trial feasibility or outcome data. With regard to the MAPS trial, it is therefore important to understand the views of clinicians working with adolescents with psychosis as their views may influence young people's (YP) access to treatments. However, most studies exploring clinicians' views of treatment for psychosis have consulted practitioners working with adult populations, focusing predominantly on AP prescribing. For example, a recent UK qualitative study identified factors underpinning prescribing behaviour that include prescribers' level of experience, varying levels of perceived personal responsibility for prescribing and associated risks, collaboration and compromise, patient involvement, and research evidence. Notably, a Norwegian interview study examining psychiatrists' views of medication-free treatment for psychosis reported substantial concern among prescribers that justifying treatment without antipsychotics lacked evidence.

Only a small number of survey studies have explored clinicians' views of treatment options for adolescents with a first episode of psychosis. These have also focused on antipsychotic treatment, particularly side effects and factors affecting adherence.

Very few studies have explored clinicians' views of psychological treatment for psychosis. One recent example explored staff views of psychology provision in a multidisciplinary adult psychiatric inpatient setting and found that although psychological treatment was valued, it was considered an 'add on' to medication and not a first-line treatment. There are no studies evaluating views of psychological interventions for psychosis among child and adolescent psychiatrists. Addressing the need to develop this literature, a nested qualitative interview study was conducted as part of the MAPS trial to investigate prescribing clinicians' views of antipsychotic medication and psychological intervention for adolescents with first-episode psychosis.

### Pharmacological treatments for first-episode schizophrenia [^113H8JrJ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2005). Low credibility.

Studies with first-episode populations offer the unique opportunity to examine the effectiveness and side effects of medications without the confounding effects of prior medication use. This review focuses upon studies of (1) treatment of the initial episode, (2) maintenance treatment issues, (3) recovery, and (4) side effects. Response rates for the initial episode are high with both conventional and new-generation antipsychotics. However, we lack data directly comparing the new-generation agents with one another for treatment of the initial episode, and data about options for patients with treatment resistance at illness onset are very limited. With the most commonly used pharmacological therapies, the course of early-phase schizophrenia is characterized by repeated relapses and a low rate of recovery. Medication treatment is also associated with a variety of side effects. Of particular concern for treatment of first-episode patients are the metabolic side effects with the new-generation antipsychotics because they occur rapidly, are very distressful to adolescents and young adults, and have long-term medical consequences. Available data support maintenance treatment to prevent relapse, but questions remain about the optimal duration of maintenance treatment, whether there are differences among the new-generation agents for maintenance treatment, and balancing the benefits of maintenance antipsychotics with their long-term side effects.

### Heterogeneity in treatment outcomes and incomplete recovery in first episode psychosis: does one size fit all? [^114xqH8x]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

The heterogeneity in recovery outcomes for individuals with First Episode Psychosis (FEP) calls for a strong evidence base to inform practice at an individual level. Between 19–89% of young people with FEP have an incomplete recovery despite gold-standard evidence-based treatments, suggesting current service models, which adopt a 'one-size fits all' approach, may not be addressing the needs of many young people with psychosis. The lack of consistent terminology to define key concepts such as recovery and treatment resistance, the multidimensional nature of these concepts, and common comorbid symptoms are some of the challenges faced by the field in delineating heterogeneity in recovery outcomes. The lack of robust markers for incomplete recovery also results in potential delay in delivering prompt, and effective treatments to individuals at greatest risk. There is a clear need to adopt a stratified approach to care where interventions are targeted at subgroups of patients, and ultimately at the individual level. Novel machine learning, using large, representative data from a range of modalities, may aid in the parsing of heterogeneity, and provide greater precision and sophistication in identifying those on a pathway to incomplete recovery.

### Update of the World Health Organization's mental health gap action programme guideline for psychoses (including schizophrenia) [^1166HGjf]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, more evidence on older first-generation antipsychotics would be desirable in the context of LMICs. The fact that more second-generation antipsychotics are recommended in the WHO guideline is also due to the low quality of evidence for older medications except haloperidol. Considering the lower cost of these medications and likely availability problems of newer second-generation medications, more evidence on relevant older antipsychotics could enhance the healthcare for people living with psychoses in lower- and middle-income countries.

Regarding the recommendation of duration of pharmacotherapy in first episode psychosis, the WHO guideline recommends maintenance therapy for a minimum of 7–12 months. Other national schizophrenia guidelines, such as the German S3 guideline or the NICE guideline, do no longer specify a duration for maintenance therapy, but emphasize the importance of shared decision-making and the inclusion of different external and individual factors. It is important to note, that in LMICs, follow-up models and specialist healthcare are often not available, and continuous psychosocial support is frequently not guaranteed. Therefore, a treatment recommendation over a defined minimum period of 7–12 months is important even in first episode psychosis, although some patients (about 12%–22%) with a time-limited single episode of psychosis could possibly be overtreated.

In summary, a strength of the WHO mhGAP guidelines is the systematic and transparent guideline development process by using the GRADE methodology, while other national guidelines for schizophrenia, except for the NICE guideline, do not apply the GRADE methods. The evidence appraisal for all selected outcomes and reasons for downgrading is available in the evidence profiles, along with the aspects considered by the GDG when going from the evidence to recommendations (eg, values and preferences, benefits and harms, equity). In addition, a key strength of the WHO mhGAP guidelines is that an evidence-based guideline based on a few key recommendations can be developed and implemented in more than 100 countries, and be general enough to fit into their health systems and policies, while still working toward minimizing the treatment gap. Moreover, the WHO mhGAP guidelines (and the EML) point out the best available evidence which might improve mental health globally. Subsequently, this could stimulate scientists, manufacturers, global health and social care organizations, and policymakers, potentially favoring an increased availability and accessibility of interventions.

Treatment of first-episode schizophrenia

For obvious reasons, treatment of schizophrenia has focused almost exclusively on the stage when patients present with clear-cut clinical symptoms, that is, psychosis. Although an increasing number of studies are now developing treatment at the earlier stages of the illness, such as the ARMS, or focus on the alleviation of cognitive dysfunction in chronic patients, the bulk of studies still focus on the treatment of psychosis.

### Pharmacological and somatic treatments for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia: synopsis of the US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^117K5VQV]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Module C — pharmacotherapy for treatment of first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia begins when an individual presents with a diagnosis of first-episode psychosis or schizophrenia and clinicians initiate/continue psychotherapy/psychosocial interventions. For initial treatment of a first episode of psychosis, using shared decision making, choose antipsychotic medication based on discussion of benefits versus adverse effects; consider starting doses and rates of titration at the lower end of the dose range established for each agent. For non‑initial treatment, using shared decision making, choose antipsychotic medication, route of administration, and starting dose/ rate of titration based on history of responses, adverse effects, adherence to previous treatment(s), comorbidities, and discussion of benefits versus side effects. Follow-up/reevaluate closely for 4–6 weeks after an initial short-term reevaluation within 1 week (including side effects); allow longer times for comorbid substance use, limited adherence, and slow titration. If there is not an adequate treatment response, assess adherence by asking, Is the individual taking the medication as prescribed?, and if not, evaluate causes of non-adherence; address them through education, management of side effects, change to LAI, and psychosocial interventions. If adherent, ask, Are there side effects?, and if yes, manage side effects; consider Modifying dose, Changing medication(s), or Adding other medication directed toward side effects. If there remains no response after these steps, titrate dose; begin considering a change in medication if there is no response (go to Box 25). For ongoing care, evaluate at 3 months; allow longer times for comorbid substance use, limited adherence, and slow titration.

### Clinicians' views of treatment types for first episode psychosis delivered in a randomised controlled trial (MAPS) [^114zm7dE]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinicians' treatment beliefs were an important influence in their decision-making, and this accords well with comparable existing research. Notably, while clinicians generally favoured the efficacy of AP for timely reduction of acute symptoms and risk, they also voiced the most concern about AP treatment decision-making, and this reflects the prominence of AP-related studies in this area of research. Very few studies have consulted clinicians responsible for prescribing AP to children and adolescents (side effects, adherence), and these have used survey methodology. Findings from qualitative adult studies are therefore needed for interpretation. In line with the present study, qualitative research has previously reported that prescribers commonly view AP as the primary or key treatment for psychosis; as Shephard et al. argue, such views are likely to influence how information and treatment offers are presented to patients.

Psychological interventions were generally viewed positively, in terms of helping YP understand and cope with distressing experiences. It was also suggested that CBT could be a more appropriate treatment than AP for some YP if, for example, there is greater uncertainty around their FEP status. However clinicians felt that CBT/FI were not an appropriate first-line treatment for YP with the most severe presentations, and that more generally some YP would find it difficult to engage with CBT. Clinicians' beliefs about causes of psychosis may also have influenced these views. A recent survey study found that among professional disciplines, only psychiatrists endorsed biogenetic above psychosocial causal beliefs, with a corresponding association between biogenetic beliefs and perceived helpfulness of AP. In contrast, the perceived helpfulness of CBT was associated with stronger endorsement of psychosocial causal beliefs (eg. effects of trauma). It was also recognised that CBT had the potential to cause negative impacts, though less concern was expressed about this than in relation to AP. Most clinicians viewed a combination of AP and psychological treatment as optimal, with AP seen to help YP benefit from CBT/FI. There is no directly comparable research with which to contextualise these findings.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^117CB4hM]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2011). Low credibility.

These guidelines from the British Association for Psychopharmacology address the scope and targets of pharmacological treatment for schizophrenia. A consensus meeting, involving experts in schizophrenia and its treatment, reviewed key areas and considered the strength of evidence and clinical implications. The guidelines were drawn up after extensive feedback from the participants and interested parties, and cover the pharmacological management and treatment of schizophrenia across the various stages of the illness, including first-episode, relapse prevention, and illness that has proved refractory to standard treatment. The practice recommendations presented are based on the available evidence to date, and seek to clarify which interventions are of proven benefit. It is hoped that the recommendations will help to inform clinical decision making for practitioners, and perhaps also serve as a source of information for patients and carers. They are accompanied by a more detailed qualitative review of the available evidence. The strength of supporting evidence for each recommendation is rated.

Results

The 2023 WHO recommendations on psychoses are summarized in table 1. The nonupdated WHO recommendations are included in supplementary table S1. These were reviewed for topicality and remain valid in their current form.

Table 1.
The 2023 Updated WHO Recommendations on Psychoses (Including Schizophrenia)

Each updated recommendation is based on 1 key question in the PICO format (for more detailed information regarding each key question, please see appendix table 1):

PSY1: In adults with psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia) are antipsychotic medicine safe and effective?
PSY2: In adults with a first psychotic episode (schizophrenia) with full remission, how long should antipsychotic medicine be continued after remission in order to allow for the best outcomes?
PSY4: In adults with psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia) requiring long-term treatment, what is the safety and role of depot antipsychotic medicine?
PSY5: Is antipsychotic medicine effective and safe for adolescents with psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia)?
PSY10: In adults with psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia) are psychological interventions (such as psychoeducation, family interventions, and cognitive behavioral therapy) effective in the acute phase?
PSY11: In adults with psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia) are psychological interventions (such as psychoeducation, family interventions, and CBT) effective in the maintenance phase?

In addition, the conclusions to each updated recommendation including (1) justification (the evidence behind the recommendations), (2) remarks (providing some additional explanations for utilization of the recommendations), (3) implementation considerations (various aspects that are influencing the implementation of the guideline), and (4) research gaps are presented (a summary is presented in table 1; detailed information is available from WHO).

WHO uses the expression psychoses (including schizophrenia), to not only include people living with schizophrenia, but all those affected by psychoses in general.

### Mapping the evidence on pharmacological interventions for non-affective psychosis in humanitarian non-specialised settings: a UNHCR clinical guidance [^115SpmcJ]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Populations exposed to humanitarian emergencies are particularly vulnerable to mental health problems, including new onset, relapse and deterioration of psychotic disorders. Inadequate care for this group may lead to human rights abuses and even premature death. The WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG), and its adaptation for humanitarian settings (mhGAP-HIG), provides guidance for management of mental health conditions by non-specialised healthcare professionals. However, the pharmacological treatment of people with non-affective psychosis who do not improve with mhGAP first-line antipsychotic treatments is not addressed. In order to fill this gap, UNHCR has formulated specific guidance on the second-line pharmacological treatment of non-affective psychosis in humanitarian, non-specialised settings.

Methods

Following the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, a group of international experts performed an extensive search and retrieval of evidence on the basis of four scoping questions. Available data were critically appraised and summarised. Clinical guidance was produced by integrating this evidence base with context-related feasibility issues, preferences, values and resource-use considerations.

Results

When first-line treatments recommended by mhGAP (namely haloperidol and chlorpromazine) are not effective, no other first-generation antipsychotics are likely to provide clinically meaningful improvements. Risperidone or olanzapine may represent beneficial second-line options. However, if these second-line medications do not produce clinically significant beneficial effects, there are two possibilities. First, to switch to the alternative (olanzapine to risperidone or vice versa) or, second, to consider clozapine, provided that specialist supervision and regular laboratory monitoring are available in the long term. If clinically relevant depressive, cognitive or negative symptoms occur, the use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor may be considered in addition or as an alternative to standard psychological interventions.

Conclusions

Adapting scientific evidence into practical guidance for non-specialised health workers in humanitarian settings was challenging due to the paucity of relevant evidence as well as the imprecision and inconsistency of results between studies. Pragmatic outcome evaluation studies from low-resource contexts are urgently needed. Nonetheless, the UNHCR clinical guidance is based on best available evidence and can help to address the compelling issue of undertreated, non-affective psychosis in humanitarian settings.

US Department of Veterans Affairs and US Department of Defense (VA/DoD) clinical practice guideline research and implementation priorities for schizophrenia emphasize that many critically important questions, such as those about durations of treatment, when treatments should be continued, when they should be augmented, when they should be switched, and about how the treatment should be sequenced when switches are appropriate, are less likely to be addressed through competitive processes and might require novel strategies based on quality improvement, program evaluation, and research within the VA/DoD. An early step might be to support the development of measures and methods to be used in measurement-based care for schizophrenia, and a better understanding of how to implement measurement-based care in schizophrenia to improve clinical care appears to be a sound first step. When there is sufficient uptake by providers within the health care system, outcome measures could then be examined for quality improvement purposes, as well as research, and establishing systemwide use of measurement-based care could then facilitate studies on interventions. Another next step might be to develop an infrastructure that would support an array of simple, pragmatic, point-of-care randomized clinical trials for alternative interventions where equipoise exists between benefits and risks as a component of quality improvement.

### Prevention of first-episode psychosis in people at clinical high risk: a randomized controlled, multicentre trial comparing cognitive-behavioral therapy and clinical management plus low-dose aripiprazole or placebo (PREVENT) [^115WVEVZ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There is limited knowledge of whether cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) should be recommended as the first-line treatment in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHRp).

Hypothesis

To examine whether individual treatment arms are superior to placebo and whether CBT is non-inferior to SGAs in preventing psychosis over 12 months of treatment.

Study Design

PREVENT was a blinded, 3-armed, randomized controlled trial comparing CBT to clinical management plus aripiprazole (CM+ARI) or plus placebo (CM+PLC) at 11 CHRp services. The primary outcome was transition to psychosis at 12 months. Analyses were by intention-to-treat.

Study Results

Two hundred eighty CHRp individuals were randomized: 129 in CBT, 96 in CM+ARI, and 55 in CM+PLC. In week 52, 21 patients in CBT, 19 in CM+ARI, and 7 in CM+PLC had transitioned to psychosis, with no significant differences between treatment arms (P = 0.342). Psychopathology and psychosocial functioning levels improved in all treatment arms, with no significant differences.

Conclusions

The analysis of the primary outcome transition to psychosis at 12 months and secondary outcomes symptoms and functioning did not demonstrate significant advantages of the active treatments over placebo. The conclusion is that within this trial, neither low-dose aripiprazole nor CBT offered additional benefits over clinical management and placebo.

At "Is this a first episode of psychosis?" a Yes branch leads to "Refer to a coordinated specialty care program for first episode psychosis (see Sidebar 4)". The algorithm directs to "Conduct clinical evaluation", including "Confirm diagnoses and rule out other conditions (see Sidebar 5)" and "Provide psychoeducation about schizophrenia/psychotic disorder and its treatment". It then states to "Use shared decision making to determine an individualized outpatient treatment plan; consider some or all of the following components:" including "Offering psychotherapy/psychosocial treatment (see Sidebar 6)" and "Offering pharmacotherapy (see Module C)".

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, more specifically with respect to maintenance therapy, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to offer maintenance therapy with an antipsychotic for at least 7–12 months in adult patients with a first episode of psychosis (including schizophrenia) in remission, carefully balancing effectiveness, side effects, and individual preference.

### Perspective on medication decisions following remission from first-episode psychosis [^113GzxF9]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Medium credibility.

While antipsychotics (APs) could provide rapid relief of positive symptoms in psychotic disorders, their usage is often associated with side effects, stigma and inconveniences. For these and other reasons, many psychosis patients, particularly those of first-episode psychosis (FEP) in remission, wish to discontinue maintenance treatment. The current review aims to discuss the strategies of AP treatment following remission from FEP, with particular emphasis on the evaluation of outcomes following AP discontinuation. Upon review of relevant literature, three potential strategies are put forth for treatment-responsive, remitted FEP patients: a) life-long maintenance treatment, b) AP discontinuation during second year of treatment, or c) AP discontinuation after three years of treatment. In theory, the first strategy presents the safest option for maximal symptom control. However, a rigorous RCT indicates that if AP discontinuation is to be attempted, the third strategy best prevents poor long-term clinical outcomes. Further data is needed to address the costs and benefits of each treatment strategy, compare AP-free patients with those on different types of APs, as well as explore even longer-term outcomes.

### The RAISE early treatment program for first-episode psychosis: background, rationale, and study design [^1141o9Kb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The premise of the National Institute of Mental Health Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode Early Treatment Program (RAISE-ETP) is to combine state-of-the-art pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments delivered by a well-trained, multidisciplinary team in order to significantly improve the functional outcome and quality of life for first-episode psychosis patients. The study is being conducted in non-academic (ie, real-world) treatment settings, using primarily extant reimbursement mechanisms.

Method

We developed a treatment model and training program based on extensive literature review and expert consultation. Our primary aim is to compare the experimental intervention to "usual care" on quality of life. Secondary aims include comparisons on remission, recovery, and cost-effectiveness. Patients 15–40 years old with a first episode of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, or brief psychotic disorder according to DSM-IV and no more than 6 months of treatment with antipsychotic medications were eligible. Patients are followed for a minimum of 2 years, with major assessments conducted by blinded, centralized raters using live, 2-way video. We selected 34 clinical sites in 21 states and utilized cluster randomization to assign 17 sites to the experimental treatment and 17 to usual care. Enrollment began in July 2010 and ended in July 2012 with 404 subjects. The results of the trial will be published separately. The goal of the article is to present both the overall development of the intervention and the design of the clinical trial to evaluate its effectiveness.

Conclusions

We believe that we have succeeded in both designing a multimodal treatment intervention that can be delivered in real-world clinical settings and implementing a controlled clinical trial that can provide the necessary outcome data to determine its impact on the trajectory of early phase schizophrenia.

### Pharmacological and somatic treatments for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia: synopsis of the US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^115haei3]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD clinical practice guideline — antipsychotic medication for acute episodes in schizophrenia and first-episode psychosis: The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence, and it is categorized as Reviewed, New-added with confidence in the quality of the evidence described as moderate. The guideline states that the benefits of antipsychotic medications for an acute episode and the potential harms of not providing these medications outweighed the potential harm of adverse events. Patient values and preferences varied with concerns about side effects, may fluctuate with changes in insight, and some perceive long-term treatment as a burden. Equity issues include decreased use of SGAs in African American populations that exposes patients to increased risk of EPS, including TD, and may adversely impact adherence and treatment response; subgroup considerations include using lower antipsychotic doses in people experiencing FEP and in older adults due to reduced drug metabolism. The recommendation is, "We recommend the use of an antipsychotic medication other than clozapine" for an acute episode in individuals with schizophrenia or first-episode psychosis who have previously responded to antipsychotics, and "The choice of antipsychotic medication should be based on an individualized evaluation" considering patient characteristics and side effect profiles.

### Antipsychotic treatment resistance in first-episode psychosis: prevalence, subtypes and predictors [^112xWQXd]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

We examined longitudinally the course and predictors of treatment resistance in a large cohort of first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients from initiation of antipsychotic treatment. We hypothesized that antipsychotic treatment resistance is: (a) present at illness onset; and (b) differentially associated with clinical and demographic factors.

Method

The study sample comprised 323 FEP patients who were studied at first contact and at 10-year follow-up. We collated clinical information on severity of symptoms, antipsychotic medication and treatment adherence during the follow-up period to determine the presence, course and predictors of treatment resistance.

Results

From the 23% of the patients, who were treatment resistant, 84% were treatment resistant from illness onset. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that diagnosis of schizophrenia, negative symptoms, younger age at onset, and longer duration of untreated psychosis predicted treatment resistance from illness onset.

Conclusions

The striking majority of treatment-resistant patients do not respond to first-line antipsychotic treatment even at time of FEP. Clinicians must be alert to this subgroup of patients and consider clozapine treatment as early as possible during the first presentation of psychosis.

### Neurocognition and NMDAR co-agonists pathways in individuals with treatment resistant first-episode psychosis: a 3-year follow-up longitudinal study [^111mg2ZP]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), accounting for 15 to 30% of schizophrenia cases, suffer from continuous symptoms, with higher disability rates than those who respond to first-line antipsychotic treatment. To offset inconsistency in the definition of treatment-resistance, which prevents between-study comparison, Treatment Response and Resistance in Psychosis (TRRIP) consensus guidelines defined resistance as inadequate response to at least two trials of different first-line antipsychotics for a duration of at least 6 weeks each. Although clinical evidence showed that TRS patients display poor cognition in the advanced phases of the disease, the neurocognitive profile of TRS individuals in the early phases of psychosis is lacking. Moreover, underlying mechanisms of resistance are unclear. While most TRS subjects may benefit from early treatment with clozapine, in clinical practice the diagnosis of treatment resistance can be delayed for many years, thus hindering the introduction of clozapine at an early stage, when the course of illness is still modifiable. It has been thus proposed that clozapine be prescribed in patients with limited-response schizophrenia (LRS), i.e. after only one failed treatment episode. However, little is known about LRS.

### Generating evidence to inform policy and practice: the example of the second generation "atypical" antipsychotics [^112tzC4W]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

The introduction of the second generation "atypical" antipsychotics has been heralded as a major advance in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Systematic reviews have revealed only modest advantages over conventional antipsychotics and uncertainty about long-term efficacy and safety, yet the second generation antipsychotic drugs have been widely accepted into clinical practice. Although the existing evidence of the benefits and harms of atypical antipsychotics can facilitate decision making about individual patients, the randomized evidence remains inadequate to make valid and fully evidence-based policy statements such as clinical practice guidelines that are designed to apply to groups of patients. Further large randomized trials are needed, but these require patients and clinicians to be in equipoise, or substantially uncertain, about alternative therapies. Premature clinical practice guidelines or expert opinion can lead to changes in clinical practice that make it difficult or impossible to conduct the required trials and are therefore a disservice to patients.

### Mapping the evidence on pharmacological interventions for non-affective psychosis in humanitarian non-specialised settings: a UNHCR clinical guidance [^116juCEU]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Results

In people with non-affective psychosis who do not improve after treatment with a FGA, is switching to another FGA effective and safe?

Haloperidol and chlorpromazine were used as the reference standard, as these medications are the first-line recommended treatments for patients with non-affective psychosis in the mhGAP guidelines.

We did not find studies of SGA intervention in individuals who had failed to improve after treatment with one FGA. Therefore, we included studies conducted in the general population of people suffering from non-affective psychosis. This evidence was rated as indirect (Additional file 1).

According to available evidence, no difference in treatment response was identified between haloperidol and FGAs as a class, and between haloperidol and the following medications considered individually: chlorpromazine, perphenazine, pimozide, fluphenazine and trifluoperazine. Haloperidol showed a slightly better overall acceptability with respect to chlorpromazine, but caused more movement disorders. Perphenazine and FGAs as a class did not show benefits compared with haloperidol in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. Pimozide, fluphenazine and trifluoperazine did not show benefits over haloperidol in terms of efficacy, while data on acceptability and tolerability were not available.

With few exceptions, the GRADE tables showed 'low' or 'very low' quality for the vast majority of outcomes, mostly due to the indirectness of the evidence, as no data were collected in low-resource settings, and individuals were not included on the basis of being not responsive to haloperidol as first-line treatment. Moreover, many of the included studies had small sample sizes and high attrition rates.

In conclusion, the clinical implication was that it is not possible to identify individual FGAs to recommend when a first-line treatment with haloperidol proves to be ineffective. Common clinical practice would suggest switching to the other most commonly available treatment or chlorpromazine. However, there is still uncertainty and further studies in low-resources/humanitarian settings may provide relevant insights on this issue.

The therapeutic dose of haloperidol may vary between 2 and 12 mg/day, and a maintenance dose of 4 to 6 mg/day is usually required. For chlorpromazine, the dose range is from 25 to 1000 mg/day, with a maintenance dose of 75 to 300 mg/day.

### Schizophrenia [^112cN6xy]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Schizophrenia is the most common psychotic mental disorder, and those affected have two to four times higher mortality than the general population. Genetic and environmental factors increase the risk of developing schizophrenia, and substance use disorder (particularly cannabis) may have the strongest link. Schizophrenia typically develops in young adulthood and is characterized by the presence of positive and negative symptoms. Positive symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech. Negative symptoms include blunted affect, alogia, avolition, asociality, and anhedonia. Symptoms must be present for at least six months and be severe for at least one month to make a diagnosis. Because schizophrenia is debilitating, it should be treated with antipsychotics, and early treatment decreases long-term disability. Treatment should be individualized, and monitoring for effectiveness and adverse effects is important. Patients with a first episode of psychosis who receive a formal diagnosis of schizophrenia should be treated in a coordinated specialty care program. Second-generation antipsychotics are the preferred first-line treatment because they cause fewer extrapyramidal symptoms. Patients with schizophrenia who are treated with second-generation antipsychotics are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and should receive at least annual metabolic screening and counseling with interventions to prevent weight gain and encourage smoking cessation. Treatment-resistant schizophrenia should be treated with clozapine. Adjunctive treatments include electroconvulsive therapy, antidepressants, and cognitive behavior therapy for psychosis. Family and social support are keys to improved outcomes.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of First-Episode Psychosis and Schizophrenia — research priorities emphasize questions on crisis response partnerships, Whole Health, care delivery, social determinants, technology access, and aging. Topics include working with crisis responders "to prevent unnecessary trauma to individuals in crisis", how "the principles of Whole Health" should inform care, which movement and exercise therapies — "yoga, tai chi, and qigong" — and whether "acupuncture" are most effective, and "what strategies for care delivery are most effective for managing the adverse effects of antipsychotic medications". The agenda asks whether primary and preventive strategies can "decrease the excess mortality", assesses "racial and ethnic disparities" in diagnosis, treatment availability, and outcomes, seeks interventions to mitigate negative "social determinants of health", and examines whether individuals with schizophrenia have reduced access to "technological resources and digital access", including subgroup disparities. For older adults, it calls for identifying "models of care" that integrate physical and mental health, whether long-term "anticholinergic" exposure is a risk for late-life dementia, how "cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of aging", including "biomarkers", can inform interventions to improve health, cognition, and functioning, and which "treatments are safe and effective for schizophrenia in late life".

### Response rates to sequential trials of antipsychotic medications according to algorithms or treatment guidelines in psychotic disorders. A systematic review and meta-analysis [^11257E6t]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a relative lack of research evaluating the outcomes when treatment guidelines or algorithms for psychotic disorders are followed. This systematic review and meta-analysis determined the response rates to antipsychotic medications at different stages of these algorithms and whether these response rates differ in first episode cohorts.

Methods

Data sources: A systematic search strategy was conducted across four databases PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO (Ovid) and CINAHL. Studies that had sequential trials of different antipsychotic medications were included. A meta-analysis of proportions was performed using random effects models and sub-group analysis in first episode psychosis studies.

Results

Of the 4078 unique articles screened, fourteen articles, from nine unique studies, were eligible and included 2522 participants. The proportion who experienced a response to any antipsychotic in the first stage of an algorithm was 0.53 (95% C. I.:0.38,0.68) and this decreased to 0.26 (95% C. I.:0.15,0.39) in the second stage. When clozapine was used in the third stage, the proportion that achieved a response was 0.43 (95% C. I. 0.19, 0.69) compared to 0.26 (95% C. I.:0.05,0.54) if a different antipsychotic was used. Four studies included 907 participants with a first episode of psychosis and the proportions that achieved a response were: 1st stage: 0.63 (95% C. I.: 0.45, 0.79); 2nd stage: 0.34 (95% C. I.:0.16,0.55); clozapine 3rd stage: 0.45 (95% C. I.:0.0,0.97), different antipsychotic 3rd stage: 0.15 (95% C. I.,0.01,0.37).

Discussion

These findings support the recommendation to have a trial of clozapine after two other antipsychotic medications have been found to be ineffective.

VA/DoD schizophrenia guideline — management after inadequate response to antipsychotic therapy states that the Work Group suggests using another agent when patients do not respond to an initial course of treatment, rather than augmentation with a second agent and combination pharmacotherapy. We suggest a trial of another antipsychotic medication for individuals with schizophrenia who do not respond to (or tolerate) an adequate trial of an antipsychotic medication. Before determining treatment failure and using another agent, ensuring an adequate treatment trial of a sufficient dose over a long enough duration is important, and ensuring acceptable antipsychotic adherence before switching agents is important, unless the patient is experiencing intolerable side effects, with changing agents requiring close monitoring because relapse or withdrawal symptoms can occur. Variations exist in methods of switching a patient from one antipsychotic to another, with little evidence to suggest one method is superior to another, and studies not included in the evidence base indicate antipsychotic polypharmacy has been associated with increased risk and severity of side effects and treatment non-adherence.

### Pharmacological and somatic treatments for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia: synopsis of the US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^112iFJZE]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Defense (DOD) provide care each year for approximately 75,000 people with first-episode psychoses or schizophrenia, but neither has formal, evidence-based guidance for treating these conditions. Recognition of this gap, together with guidance from Congress, led the Departments to develop clinical practice guidelines for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia. This synopsis summarizes the psychopharmacological and other somatic treatment recommendations.

Study Design

An interdisciplinary panel of VA and DOD mental health and primary care providers was created following methods specified by the VA/DOD Evidence-Based Practice Guideline Work Group. The panel formulated key questions that guided a comprehensive search of the intervention literature from November 2011 to December 2021, with evidence limited to findings from randomized clinical trials. Recommendations were based on evaluation of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods.

Study Results

The VA/DOD guideline panel developed 15 pharmacological and somatic treatment recommendations, including those on antipsychotic medication use for the treatment of first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia, use of clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, treatment of clozapine non-responders, and side effect management. There was insufficient evidence to provide recommendations for or against the use of non-antipsychotic medications or somatic treatments to treat negative or cognitive symptoms.

Conclusions

The VA/DOD guideline panel developed 15 pharmacological and somatic treatment recommendations to promote optimal, evidence-based care for active service members and Veterans. However, there remain multiple treatment planning decision points for which there is a lack of data and/or effective treatments.

### Metacognitive training for psychosis (MCT): a systematic meta-review of its effectiveness [^11775r2n]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders have been ranked among the most debilitating mental disorders worldwide, requiring long-term disability adjustments for 1.5% of men and women aged between 25 and 49 years. Moreover, schizophrenia has been linked to lifetime suicide rates as high as 10%, with rates of suicide attempts for people with schizophrenia ranging from 18–55%. Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association (APA), as well as the British NICE guidelines, recommend the use of antipsychotic drugs as first-line treatment for schizophrenia and psychosis. In the past, psychotherapy for psychosis was often not offered due to the belief that the condition is neither psychologically explicable nor treatable. Recent reviews with predominantly positive results have contradicted this viewpoint and discussed the inclusion of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in the treatment guidelines for psychosis. Yet, some dissenting findings have been reported, and effects of psychotherapy for psychosis are lower than for other disorders.

CBT targets symptoms by highlighting maladaptive beliefs or maladaptive appraisal and dysfunctional coping with events or situations. A new trend in CBT is especially concerned with cognitive biases, such as jumping to conclusions (JTC), overconfidence in errors, and a bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE), which have been linked to the formation and maintenance of positive and negative symptoms and are largely unresponsive to antipsychotic medication. Metacognitive training for psychosis (MCT), a CBT variant, aims to raise (meta)cognitive awareness of these cognitive biases. The core principles and objectives of MCT relate to the concept of metacognition or the act of "thinking about thinking". MCT encompasses several aspects of self-awareness and problem-solving targeted at correcting cognitive distortions and overconfidence, as patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders may not be aware of their cognitive biases or may tend to be overconfident in their assumptions (see eTable 1 of the supplementary material for a complete overview of the MCT modules and objectives).

Categorization of clinical practice guideline recommendations — evidence-based clinical practice guidelines should be current, and staying current typically requires revision of a CPG's previous versions based on new evidence or as scheduled subject to time-based expirations; for example, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) aims to review each topic at least every five years for either an update or reaffirmation. Recommendation categories were used to track how the previous CPG's recommendations could be reconciled, and Table 3 lists these categories and definitions: for evidence reviewed, New-added (New recommendation), New-replaced (Recommendation from previous CPG was carried forward and revised), Not changed (Recommendation from previous CPG was carried forward but unchanged), Amended (Recommendation from previous CPG was carried forward with a nominal change), and Deleted (Recommendation from previous CPG was deleted); for evidence not reviewed, Not changed (Recommendation from previous CPG was carried forward but unchanged), Amended (Recommendation from previous CPG was carried forward with a nominal change), and Deleted (Recommendation from previous CPG was deleted).

### Mapping the evidence on pharmacological interventions for non-affective psychosis in humanitarian non-specialised settings: a UNHCR clinical guidance [^112V5jDm]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Are SGAs effective and safe in people with non-affective psychosis who do not improve with FGAs used as first-line treatment?

Each SGA was compared initially to haloperidol, as the reference standard of first-line FGAs. SGAs that proved to be more effective than haloperidol were then compared to each other (head-to-head) in order to identify possible advantages of one medication over another. We found no data specifically referring to individuals who had already failed to improve after treatment with one FGA. Therefore, studies conducted in the general population of people suffering from non-affective psychosis were used (indirect). Compared to haloperidol, all SGAs considered individually (with the exception of paliperidone, for which no data were available) appeared to cause less sedation and motor symptoms, and had a better overall acceptability profile. Among these medications, only risperidone and olanzapine showed a more favourable efficacy profile in comparison with haloperidol. After having compared these two medications head-to-head, risperidone showed better acceptability and was associated with less weight gain than olanzapine, while olanzapine caused less motor symptoms and prolactin increase.

Indirectness, high attrition rates and imprecise results (due to small sample sizes) contributed to set the quality of the evidence to 'low' or 'very low' for all of the outcomes of interest. In conclusion, the clinical implication was that risperidone and olanzapine may be chosen as second-line treatments as they are both associated with benefits in comparison with haloperidol in terms of efficacy and overall acceptability in the medium- and long-term. The level of confidence in this clinical implication was judged uncertain. The panel pointed out that the choice between risperidone and olanzapine should be based on specific patient characteristics and the antipsychotic profile, considering that, in general, risperidone may have a slightly better overall tolerability and cause less weight gain compared to olanzapine, while olanzapine is associated with less motor symptoms and prolactin increase compared to risperidone. Further, the choice should take into account availability, affordability and sustainability of provision in the long term, in relation to the setting of care. The therapeutic dose of risperidone may vary between 2 and 10 mg/day, and a maintenance dose of 4 to 6 mg/day is usually required, while the dose of olanzapine may vary between 5 and 20 mg/day, and the maintenance dose required is usually 10 mg/day.

### Antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia in the maintenance phase: a systematic review of the guidelines and algorithms [^117H1iPn]. Schizophrenia Research (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Antipsychotic treatment strategy for the maintenance phase of schizophrenia has been inconsistent in the literature. The purpose of this systematic review is to overview recommendations in various guidelines and algorithms.

Methods

The guidelines and algorithms for schizophrenia that were published or updated in English after 2000 were searched, using Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO with the following key words: guideline, algorithm, schizophrenia, and psychosis (last search: July 2011). The reference lists of the relevant reports were also examined.

Results

Fourteen guidelines and algorithms were identified; only five of them clearly defined terms about the maintenance phase and treatment. Ten of 11 guidelines and algorithms did not recommend discontinuation of antipsychotics within five years; six of them partially recommended antipsychotic discontinuation for patients with first-episode schizophrenia exclusive. All nine guidelines and algorithms that referred to intermittent or targeted antipsychotic strategy endorsed against this strategy. Although being a hot topic of controversy, dose reduction of antipsychotics or lower dose therapy in the maintenance phase compared to the acute dosage is not recommended on the whole concerning atypical antipsychotics, whereas dose reduction appears sometimes considered acceptable for typical antipsychotics.

Conclusion

What constitutes maintenance phase and its treatment in schizophrenia has not yet been established in the literature. While discontinuation and intermittent or targeted strategies are not generally recommended, there is controversy regarding dose reduction or lower dose therapy, especially with regards to atypical antipsychotics. Further evidence is needed in order to derive treatment recommendations on antipsychotics in this critical treatment phase of schizophrenia.

### Improving outcomes of first-episode psychosis: an overview [^116i58d8]. World Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Outcomes of psychotic disorders are associated with high personal, familiar, societal and clinical burden. There is thus an urgent clinical and societal need for improving those outcomes. Recent advances in research knowledge have opened new opportunities for ameliorating outcomes of psychosis during its early clinical stages. This paper critically reviews these opportunities, summarizing the state-of-the-art knowledge and focusing on recent discoveries and future avenues for first episode research and clinical interventions. Candidate targets for primary universal prevention of psychosis at the population level are discussed. Potentials offered by primary selective prevention in asymptomatic subgroups (stage 0) are presented. Achievements of primary selected prevention in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (stage 1) are summarized, along with challenges and limitations of its implementation in clinical practice. Early intervention and secondary prevention strategies at the time of a first episode of psychosis (stage 2) are critically discussed, with a particular focus on minimizing the duration of untreated psychosis, improving treatment response, increasing patients' satisfaction with treatment, reducing illicit substance abuse and preventing relapses. Early intervention and tertiary prevention strategies at the time of an incomplete recovery (stage 3) are further discussed, in particular with respect to addressing treatment resistance, improving well-being and social skills with reduction of burden on the family, treatment of comorbid substance use, and prevention of multiple relapses and disease progression. In conclusion, to improve outcomes of a complex, heterogeneous syndrome such as psychosis, it is necessary to globally adopt complex models integrating a clinical staging framework and coordinated specialty care programmes that offer pre-emptive interventions to high-risk groups identified across the early stages of the disorder. Only a systematic implementation of these models of care in the national health care systems will render these strategies accessible to the 23 million people worldwide suffering from the most severe psychiatric disorders.

### Systematic literature review of schizophrenia clinical practice guidelines on acute and maintenance management with antipsychotics [^115Fjcby]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

Numerous guidelines have recently updated their recommendations on the pharmacological treatment of patients with schizophrenia, which we have summarized in this review. Consistent recommendations were observed across CPGs in the areas of balancing risk and benefits of antipsychotics when selecting treatment, a preference for antipsychotic monotherapy, especially for patients with a first episode of schizophrenia, and the use of clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. By contrast, there were inconsistencies with regards to recommendations on maintenance antipsychotic treatment, with differences existing on type and dose of antipsychotic, as well as the duration of therapy. However, LAIs were consistently recommended, but mainly suggested in cases of nonadherence or patient preference, despite their established efficacy in broader patient populations and clinical scenarios in clinical trials. Guidelines were sometimes contradictory, with some recommending LAI use earlier in the disease course (e.g. first episode) and others suggesting they only be reserved for later in the disease. This inconsistency was not due to lack of evidence on the efficacy of LAIs in first-episode schizophrenia or the timing of the CPG, so that other reasons might be responsible, including possibly bias and stigma associated with this route of treatment administration. Lastly, gaps existed in the guidelines for recommendations on the duration of maintenance treatment, treatment of negative symptoms, and the development/use of treatment algorithms whenever evidence is sufficient to provide a simplified summary of the data and indicate their relevance for clinical decision making, all of which should be considered in future guideline development/revisions.

### You say "schizophrenia" and I say "psychosis": just tell me when I can come off this medication [^115WWkwh]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Individuals experiencing a first episode of psychosis are likely to respond well to treatment with antipsychotic medications. Of those treated for a first episode of schizophrenia, three out of four can expect to achieve remission. The question of how long antipsychotic medication should be continued has been a topic of heated debate in the field. Longitudinal studies of individuals diagnosed with a first episode of psychosis have reported that as many as 30% may be able to come off of medications without relapsing while treatment discontinuation studies have found that very few patients remain in remission off of medication. This paper reviews the literature on relapse rates following a first episode of schizophrenia and identifies factors that contribute to the discrepancies in the rates reported. These factors include sampling considerations, the distribution of psychiatric diagnoses, the duration of follow-up, the rate of medication discontinuation and the criteria used to define illness recurrence. We propose that individuals for whom the diagnosis of their first psychotic episode is determined with ongoing follow-up to be due to schizophrenia are at extremely high risk of relapse and should be advised to continue antipsychotic medication for the long-term. Those whose first episode of psychosis is determined to be due to other causes are also at high risk of illness recurrence off medications. Recommendations for maintenance treatment should be tailored to reflect the risk of relapse and sequelae of relapse associated with specific causes of first episode psychosis.

### Stratification and prediction of remission in first-episode psychosis patients: the OPTiMiSE cohort study [^116hpdy3]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Early response to first-line antipsychotic treatments is strongly associated with positive long-term symptomatic and functional outcome in psychosis. Unfortunately, attempts to identify reliable predictors of treatment response in first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients have not yet been successful. One reason for this could be that FEP patients are highly heterogeneous in terms of symptom expression and underlying disease biological mechanisms, thereby impeding the identification of one-size-fits-all predictors of treatment response. We have used a clustering approach to stratify 325 FEP patients into four clinical subtypes, termed C1A, C1B, C2A and C2B, based on their symptoms assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scale. Compared to C1B, C2A and C2B patients, those from the C1A subtype exhibited the most severe symptoms and were the most at risk of being non-remitters when treated with the second-generation antipsychotic drug amisulpride. Before treatment, C1A patients exhibited higher serum levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammation-associated biomarkers therefore validating our stratification approach on external biological measures. Most importantly, in the C1A subtype, but not others, lower serum levels of interleukin (IL)-15, higher serum levels of C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12), previous exposure to cytomegalovirus (CMV), use of recreational drugs and being younger were all associated with higher odds of being non-remitters 4 weeks after treatment. The predictive value of this model was good (mean area under the curve (AUC) = 0.73 ± 0.10), and its specificity and sensitivity were 45 ± 0.09% and 83 ± 0.03%, respectively. Further validation and replication of these results in clinical trials would pave the way for the development of a blood-based assisted clinical decision support system in psychosis.

### Update of the World Health Organization's mental health gap action programme guideline for psychoses (including schizophrenia) [^114FZQEV]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

During the WHO guideline for psychoses update in 2023, 6 out of 12 recommendations from 2015 were updated and 1 recommendation was newly developed, resulting in an updated guideline that includes 13 recommendations. There are a number of distinct elements in the development of mhGAP that differentiate it from national guidelines. Additionally, an outlook on potential improvements of the guideline is provided.

Evidence-based guidelines are an essential part of the WHO mhGAP.WHOs update on recommendations for psychoses will help to ensure access to evidence-based treatment for patients across the globe. The WHO guideline development process and the formulated recommendations themselves differ significantly from comparable national guidelines, such as the American Psychiatric Association Professional Practice Guidelines, the German S3 Guideline for Schizophrenia, or the British NICE guideline for schizophrenia. The WHO offers only 13 key questions and recommendations for psychoses, whereas eg, the German schizophrenia guideline includes 162 recommendations. The reason is that the recommendations are limited to particularly essential and transnational topics (eg, safety and efficacy of antipsychotics, duration of antipsychotic treatment), so that they are applicable across various countries, which can then adjust them according to their respective regularities of the health system. Despite the rather general treatment recommendations, specific medications are mentioned in the WHO guideline, which is not common in the mentioned national guidelines for schizophrenia, whose target group is primarily healthcare specialists in high-income countries with sufficient medication supply. Since the WHO guideline is intended for use globally, including LMICs and nonspecialized healthcare settings, the recommended medications are aligned with the EML.

### Comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment strategies for relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia in Finland: a population-based cohort study [^114DUmqS]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our findings challenge the current treatment guidelines recommending clozapine as a third-line treatment, resulting in treatment practices characterised by long delays to clozapine initiation. When a person with first-episode schizophrenia has a first psychosis relapse despite the use of non-clozapine oral antipsychotics, continuation with the same antipsychotic or a switch to another non-clozapine oral antipsychotic is not beneficial in relapse prevention. Instead, clozapine initiation should be considered as part of shared decision-making with the person with schizophrenia and carers.

There is no established treatment algorithm (ie, a step-by-step guide for which antipsychotic should be chosen) for patients who have relapsed despite ongoing antipsychotic treatment. Possible options are to continue with the same antipsychotic that was used before the relapse, to switch to another oral antipsychotic or to a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, or to antipsychotic polypharmacy. Clozapine is the most efficacious antipsychotic, but due to safety problems, treatment guidelines state that at least two other antipsychotics should be tried before switching to clozapine. In addition, there are prescriber-related and organisational barriers for clozapine use, which requires regular blood monitoring. Thus far, only one study has been published on the comparative effectiveness of different antipsychotic switching strategies in first-episode schizophrenia. The results of this 32-week trial showed that switching from a first non-clozapine antipsychotic (amisulpride) to a second non-clozapine antipsychotic (olanzapine) was not a helpful strategy to reach symptomatic remission in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. This non-differential outcome is probably due to a combination of factors including amisulpride and olanzapine being similarly efficacious, as well as the presence of a subgroup of patients with symptoms that are treatment-resistant, which occur in approximately one in five patients with first-episode schizophrenia.

On the basis of this finding and our previous study indicating decreased effectiveness of antipsychotics after the second relapse, we hypothesised that prevention of the second relapse is of utmost importance and that effective treatment strategies for that should be identified. In this study, we aimed to investigate the comparative effectiveness of different pharmacological treatment strategies in the prevention of the second relapse in patients with first-episode schizophrenia who had a first relapse.

### Comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment strategies for relapse prevention in first-episode schizophrenia in Finland: a population-based cohort study [^111tH4sY]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study on the comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment strategies for the prevention of the second relapse in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. Our results from 3000 patients suggest that, after the first relapse, three of the most common treatment strategies (switching from a previous non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapy to another non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapy, continuation of the previous non-clozapine oral antipsychotic monotherapy, or switch to non-use of antipsychotics) are equally ineffective. Only switching to clozapine from any treatment strategy was associated with a substantially decreased risk of the second relapse. Another key finding is that almost half of patients were not using antipsychotics before their first relapse, which indicates that antipsychotic non-use is widespread.

Our finding that only a switch to clozapine was associated with a decreased risk of the second relapse runs counter to current treatment guidelines, which uniformly state that if the first antipsychotic fails, another non-clozapine antipsychotic must be tried before switching to clozapine. Clozapine is associated with risks of rare but potentially severe adverse effects, such as agranulocytosis. However, there is accumulating evidence, which has not been incorporated in the guidelines, suggesting that clozapine is the safest antipsychotic concerning overall survival, in addition to being associated with greater symptomatic improvement, including in patients without treatment-resistant schizophrenia. In this study, we did not know whether clozapine was initiated as first-line, second-line, third-line, or later-line treatment, since our database does not include data on medications used during hospital care periods. However, we can conclude that if a patient with first-episode schizophrenia has a relapse despite ongoing antipsychotic treatment, the best option to reduce the risk of relapse is switching to clozapine (or continuing to use clozapine).

### Do cognitive behavioural therapy interventions lead to schema change in people with psychosis? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115gGwYV]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) interventions are recommended by UK and international guidance as a preventative therapy for people at risk of developing psychosis and as a first‐line approach for treating first episode and longstanding psychosis alongside antipsychotic medication (Addington et al; Early Psychosis Guidelines Writing Group; Keepers et al; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence). In support of this, systematic reviews have demonstrated evidence for symptom change in psychosis following a course of CBT (Bighelli et al; Burns, Erickson, and Brenner; Lutgens, Gariepy, and Malla; Sitko et al; Wood et al.). Additionally, CBT appears to improve social and occupational functioning and reduce relapse in people with psychosis as well as reduce transition to psychosis in at‐risk individuals (Bighelli et al; Frawley et al; Stafford et al; Zheng et al.).

Research has suggested that change in maladaptive schemas precedes symptom reduction following CBT for people with OCD and PTSD (Bourdon et al; Wilhelm et al.). However, it is unclear whether CBT interventions lead to schema change in people with psychosis, despite evidence for the relationship between negative schemas and psychosis (Fowler et al.). Increasing understanding of the processes by which CBT interventions lead to symptom change in psychosis may lead to further development and refinement of interventions. Consequently, in line with theoretical evidence, it would be beneficial to understand whether CBT interventions exert their influence on symptoms through change in schemas. However, there are currently no reviews considering schema change in CBT interventions for psychosis. Evidence is needed to understand whether CBT and third‐wave interventions, offered by mental health services, lead to schema change in people with psychosis. The aim of this review was to consider whether CBT interventions are seen to lead to schema change in people with psychosis.

### Maintenance treatment with quetiapine versus discontinuation after one year of treatment in patients with remitted first episode psychosis: randomised controlled trial [^112B3jpP]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Clinical guidelines recommend maintenance drug treatment for the first year after the onset of illness, but no consensus exists regarding longer periods of maintenance treatment. Some authors estimated that up to a quarter of patients with first episode psychosis may not need long term maintenance treatment, whereas others question whether it should ever be discontinued. Two recent studies investigated first episode patients with somewhat longer periods of remission. Gitlin et al randomised 108 patients previously treated with depot fluphenazine for one year to placebo and maintenance groups (54 each) for three months, followed by a crossover of treatment in the next three months, then open label discontinuation. Exacerbation was defined as a recurrence of mild psychotic symptoms (a 2 point change, to a score > 3, on any of three brief psychiatric rating scale psychosis items). Relapse was defined as a recurrence of severe psychotic symptoms (a rating of 6 or 7 on any of three brief psychiatric rating scale psychosis items). Unfortunately, interpretation of the effect of drug treatment was complicated by persistence of the depot fluphenazine in the placebo group. After open label discontinuation, 78% had an exacerbation or relapse in the next 12 months. However, without randomisation and blinding, the effects of participants' and raters' expectations on the assessments remain uncertain. In another study of drug discontinuation, Wunderink et al randomised 128 patients who were in remission for six months (65 open withdrawal, 63 open continuation of drug). The study did not involve a placebo control. Relapse (clinical deterioration with one or more score in the severe range of 5 or more in the positive and negative syndrome scale positive subscale) was more frequent in the discontinuation group (43%) than in the maintenance treatment group (21%).

In the context of the limited available evidence, discontinuation of drug treatment is perceived as a viable option for patients with first episode psychosis after at least one year of antipsychotic drug treatment without relapse. Longer term maintenance treatment, with its associated long term side effects, is often unacceptable to first episode patients. Currently, decisions and guidelines on discontinuation must be made without directly relevant, randomised, placebo controlled data. In addition, no robust predictors exist to identify patients at low risk of relapse.

### Prevention of the first episode of psychosis [^113MteNP]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Long a desired goal but increasingly a focus of research on clinical practice, prevention of psychosis has emerged as one of the most promising and effective areas of investigational interest and effort in psychiatry. Spurred by long-term studies that have associated outcome with duration of untreated psychosis, current research is focused on improving the accuracy of prediction based on clinical and neurocognitive measures and on refining treatments of the earliest symptoms of the psychoses. Both efforts are bearing success, although there remains ambiguity as to the most effective preventive interventions. This article reviews the leading studies of, and remaining issues for, this important enterprise.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes in patients with schizophrenia following different long-acting injectable event-driven initiation strategies [^111jLzyg]. Schizophrenia (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antipsychotics are the main pharmacologic therapy for patients with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia treatment guidelines recommend tailoring pharmacologic intervention based on patient's disease stage, history of schizophrenia-related relapses, psychiatric and physical comorbidities, response to current or previous antipsychotic(s), potential side effects associated with antipsychotic medication and its tolerability profile, history of antipsychotic medication adherence, transition of care, and patient preference –.

An important challenge in schizophrenia care is adherence to therapy, which is crucial for reducing the risk of schizophrenia relapse and its negative consequences such as hospitalization and self-harm –. Studies have demonstrated that long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs), which require less frequent administration than oral antipsychotics (OAPs), are associated with better adherence than OAPs –. Some studies have also found that treatment with LAIs was associated with significant reductions in healthcare resource utilization, with the magnitude of results varying depending on the study design and patient population. Other recognized advantages of LAIs include ensured knowledge about adherence status; lower risk of relapse, hospitalization and mortality; and increased opportunity to receive psychosocial treatments during a state of greater stability.

Barriers to using LAIs may exist. Surveys conducted among clinicians have identified some reasons underlying the infrequent LAI use, particularly as treatment following first-episode psychosis, including concerns over costs, adverse effects, stigmatization, presumed OAP adherence and nonacceptance of LAI treatment, and clinicians' perception that LAIs were reserved for later use in the disease course –.

Despite these barriers, most guidelines recognize the various advantages of LAIs compared to OAPs; however, recommendations for the appropriate timing of LAI initiation with respect to events such as nonadherence and relapse vary considerably across guidelines and will differ based on patient experiences, preferences, and situations. A recent systematic review found that among US guidelines for schizophrenia, recommendations include initiating LAIs as first-line therapy after tolerability and sufficient effectiveness have been assessed with the oral formulation of the same antipsychotic (Florida Medicaid Program), in patients with history of poor or uncertain adherence (American Psychiatric Association, Harvard South Shore Program), in patients presenting frequent relapses (American Association of Community Psychiatrists [AACP]), after failure of ≥ 2 OAPs or in nonadherent patients (Florida Medicaid Program, AACP, Oregon Health Authority), or when patients prefer the LAI formulation to OAPs (Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team).

### Risk of symptom recurrence with medication discontinuation in first-episode psychosis: a systematic review [^115sYLXW]. Schizophrenia Research (2014). Low credibility.

The large majority of individuals with a first episode of schizophrenia will experience a remission of symptoms within their first year of treatment. It is not clear how long treatment with antipsychotic medications should be continued in this situation. The possibility that a percentage of patients may not require ongoing treatment and may be unnecessarily exposed to the long-term risks of antipsychotic medications has led to the development of a number of studies to address this question. We carried out a systematic review to determine the risk of experiencing a recurrence of psychotic symptoms in individuals who have discontinued antipsychotic medications after achieving symptomatic remission from a first episode of non-affective psychosis (FEP). Six studies were identified that met our criteria and these reported a weighted mean one-year recurrence rate of 77% following discontinuation of antipsychotic medication. By two years, the risk of recurrence had increased to over 90%. By comparison, we estimated the one-year recurrence rate for patients who continued antipsychotic medication to be 3%. These findings suggest that in the absence of uncertainty about the diagnosis or concerns about the contribution of medication side effects to problems with health or functioning, a trial off of antipsychotic medications is associated with a very high risk of symptom recurrence and should thus not be recommended.

Literature Search

The search was conducted externally by a professional information specialist, the Nottinghamshire Healthcare Foundation Trust (see Acknowledgments). A comprehensive search of major bibliographic databases was performed in the following databases: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Global Index Medicus. The search strategy was aligned with the PICO terms, and systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials published from 2014 onwards were targetted: Pharmacological and psychological/psychosocial interventions were compared with any other interventions, placebo, or waiting list in people with psychotic disorders (including first episode psychosis, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder). The flow chart for each updated PICO question can be found in appendix figures 1–6.

Grading of the Evidence

The quality of the evidence of the studies was evaluated following the GRADE methodology. The quality assessment includes study design, and grading of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. The quality of evidence is graded for each patient-important outcome, and afterward, the overall quality of evidence is assessed across outcomes (ie, the body of evidence). The GDG and the Steering Group select critical and important patient outcomes that will guide the evidence. According to GRADE for guideline panels, the quality of evidence indicates the level of confidence we have in an estimate of the effect and its ability to support a specific recommendation. The quality of a body of evidence is classified into 1 of 4 grades:

High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

Treatment after first unsuccessful trial

This algorithm does not meaningfully deviate from other algorithms and recommendations; hence we only provide a brief summary. If initial trial does not lead to clinically satisfactory response despite sufficient duration, and dose, we recommend switchingto monotherapy with an alternative antipsychotic with a different mechanism of action or metabolism. If initial failed trial was due to side effects, alternative antipsychotic with low propensity for that specific side effect should be selected. Clozapine should be offered after two failed trials with appropriate monitoring.

Antipsychotic class considerations and risk–benefit rationale: Antipsychotic medications are dopamine D2 receptor antagonists and share similar efficacy, with clozapine reserved primarily for people who either failed to adequately respond to other antipsychotic medications or for the treatment of suicidality; therefore, the Work Group considered antipsychotic medications as a class. Despite pairwise comparison evidence ranging from very low to moderate, the grouping of all antipsychotic medications led to an overall judgment of moderate confidence, and the benefits of antipsychotic medication treatment strongly outweigh the potential harms and burdens associated with withholding treatment, which include increased risk of self-harm or harm to others; impaired work or social functioning or both; decreased QoL; distress from untreated symptoms; engagement with the justice system; and family burden.

### Predicting treatment resistance from first-episode psychosis using routinely collected clinical information [^1143G6Sk]. Nature: Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia spectrum disorders can have remarkably different life courses: approximately half of people presenting with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) show good outcomes, such as remissionor no need for long-term secondary care. However, ~23–24% of FEP patients go on to develop treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). TRS is typically defined as resistance to two antipsychotic treatments, each given at an adequate dose for at least 6 weeks, with evidence of medication adherence. TRS is associated with reduced quality of life, substantial societal burden, and up to tenfold higher healthcare costs.

It is not currently possible to predict accurately whether someone with FEP will develop TRS. This is important because there is evidence that clozapine, the only treatment licensed for TRS, is more effective the sooner it is prescribed. Yet, in clinical practice there are often long delays before clozapine is considered. This highlights the need to identify treatment resistance as soon as possible.

Risk prediction in psychosis is a flourishing field, with the number of papers on the topic doubling between 2012 and 2019 (Supplementary Figure 1). However, in many existing studies the focus has been on trying to elucidate the pathophysiological underpinnings of treatment resistance, rather than the production of a clinically useful tool. While the former is an important research goal, it is distinct from the latter, which is of greater immediate clinical relevance. For example, existing studies have commonly included predictors that are, currently, either: not easy to deploy in routine clinical practice (e.g. neuroimagingor genetic measures); not routinely or reliably collected (e.g. duration of untreated psychosis, substancemisuse, premorbid functioning); not available at FEP onset (e.g. antipsychotic medication polypharmacy during follow-up, symptom patterns over time). Furthermore, some of the research has focussed on short term outcomes, such as clozapine use at the end of a current admission. All these characteristics limit the potential clinical usefulness of existing efforts in TRS prediction.

Specialized early intervention services (EIS) for first-episode psychosis — duration guidance and evidence: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific duration for participation in specialized early intervention services for individuals with first-episode psychosis (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). EIS are multidisciplinary, community-based mental health teams delivered through an assertive outreach model of care, with care coordinators who have restricted caseload sizes. Treatment services are usually limited to two years, with extended specialized EIS prolonging the duration up to a maximum of five years. Limited evidence indicates that extended specialized EIS might improve global psychotic symptoms and engagement in services; some evidence exists of benefit for symptom outcomes and disengagement but no demonstrated effect on overall functioning, employment status, remission, or psychiatric hospital admissions. Though the body of supporting evidence was small, the benefits of specialized EIS slightly outweighed the harms and burdens.
