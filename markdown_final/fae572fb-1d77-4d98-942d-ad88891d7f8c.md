## Question

Medical management of sudden hematuria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step approach to the medical management of sudden hematuria. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and differentiating gross from microscopic hematuria. Then, I should verify key history elements that change pretest probabilities and imaging choices. Next, I will examine the physical exam, initial labs, and how to interpret the urinalysis, including dysmorphic RBCs and casts. After that, I will consider initial risk stratification, followed by targeted imaging for gross hematuria, trauma, stones, and medical renal disease. Finally, I will address initial management by likely etiology, indications for urgent urology and nephrology consults, special populations, and a pragmatic follow-up plan, while continuously checking each step against guideline-based evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm priorities: I need to stabilize ABCs, quantify bleeding, and differentiate true gross hematuria from pigmenturia or contamination; if there is shock or massive clot retention, I should treat immediately while simultaneously beginning diagnostics, because life-threatening bleeding and obstructing clots cannot wait for a leisurely workup [^notfound]. Wait, let me verify trauma imaging thresholds: in stable blunt trauma, gross hematuria mandates contrast-enhanced CT; microscopic hematuria with hypotension also mandates CT; microscopic hematuria alone without hypotension generally does not require imaging, though mechanism matters and clinical judgment applies, so I should double-check for significant deceleration or penetrating injury before deciding to defer imaging [^111fbt2P] [^116R9bCd].

> I need to check the history next: onset and pattern of bleeding, pain characteristics, fever, trauma or vigorous exercise, medication exposures including anticoagulants, cyclophosphamide, or antiplatelets, smoking and occupational exposures, and gynecologic or menstrual history in women; painless gross hematuria in older adults raises malignancy concern and warrants expedited urologic evaluation, while women are often misattributed to UTI, which contributes to delayed cancer diagnoses, so I should be cautious and explicit about these risk amplifiers [^111V1Czx] [^112AjDdC] [^114iCsHn]. Hold on, I should verify risk-factor definitions: AUA/SUFU risk tiers use age, smoking pack-years, RBC burden, and prior gross hematuria, so I should document these precisely to guide the intensity of imaging and cystoscopy later in the pathway [^114cVMKz].

> On exam, I will look for signs of volume depletion, flank or suprapubic tenderness, masses, abdominal wall ecchymoses suggesting retroperitoneal bleeding, and any pelvic instability or perineal injuries that would raise concern for associated bladder injury; I should confirm blood pressure and orthostatics because hypotension plus hematuria in trauma shifts me toward immediate CT and a lower threshold for intervention [^111fbt2P] [^116R9bCd]. Let me reconsider the bladder: if there is gross hematuria with a pelvic fracture, retrograde cystography is indicated because the combination carries a substantial risk of bladder rupture and alters management, so I should not miss that [^1118zvtF].

> Next, I should review the initial laboratories: urinalysis with microscopy, urine culture if infection is suspected, CBC, renal function panel with eGFR, coagulation profile if anticoagulated or bleeding risk is high, and electrolytes; I need to ensure I inspect for dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts, proteinuria, and pyuria, since dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts push me toward glomerular disease and a nephrology-first pathway rather than a purely urologic one [^115spsC7] [^117RrQsk]. Hold on, I should verify the downstream implications: hematuria with significant proteinuria or AKI merits urgent nephrology input for potential biopsy and immunotherapy, whereas isolated hematuria without proteinuria is more often urologic in origin [^117RrQsk].

> Now, risk stratification for microscopic hematuria should be explicit: AUA/SUFU 2025 defines low/negligible, intermediate, and high risk using age, smoking, RBC count, and prior gross hematuria; importantly, I should confirm that anticoagulation status does not obviate standard risk-based evaluation, so I must not dismiss hematuria as "just anticoagulation" without a proper workup [^114cVMKz] [^114MSbvc]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said low-risk patients never need cystoscopy; let me correct that — some low-risk patients may warrant cystoscopy based on symptoms or preference, but guideline-preferred initial management in low/negligible-risk microscopic hematuria is repeat urinalysis in 6 months rather than immediate imaging or cystoscopy, which balances harms and the very low malignancy yield in this group [^112njtLh] [^115LpRp2].

> For imaging, I should confirm modality choices by scenario: for gross hematuria in nonpregnant adults, CT urography without and with IV contrast is first-line when feasible; if contrast is contraindicated, MRI urography or noncontrast alternatives are reasonable; ultrasound can be a bridge but misses small urothelial lesions; in trauma, contrast-enhanced CT with delayed imaging is the gold standard when hematuria is accompanied by significant mechanism or hypotension [^116R9bCd] [^112wLc1c]. But wait, what if I suspect a stone? Noncontrast CT is preferred for suspected urolithiasis, whereas CT urography is preferred when malignancy is the leading concern; I should tailor the protocol to the most likely diagnosis to limit unnecessary radiation and contrast exposure [^notfound].

> Let me consider management by likely etiology while I keep verifying each branch: if infection is present, I should treat and then repeat urinalysis in 2–6 weeks to ensure resolution; persistent hematuria after adequate treatment mandates risk-based urologic evaluation rather than attributing to lingering infection [^117Eoaeg]. If urolithiasis is suspected, I should provide analgesia, antiemetics, and alpha-blockade when appropriate, and arrange imaging and urology follow-up; obstruction with infection is an emergency requiring decompression and antibiotics, so I need to ensure I do not miss that combination [^notfound]. For BPH-related bleeding, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors can reduce recurrent hematuria after excluding other causes; if bleeding is refractory or complicated by retention or stones, surgical options are indicated, so I should document severity and prior episodes to guide escalation [^1159pEoU] [^112uhNLk]. For malignancy-suspected cases, I should expedite cystoscopy and upper tract imaging, and if a lesion is found, proceed to TURBT for diagnosis and staging; I should also counsel on smoking cessation given its strong association with urothelial cancer [^111V1Czx] [^112AjDdC]. For glomerular disease, I should involve nephrology early for biopsy and immunosuppression when indicated, and I must not delay this in the presence of proteinuria, RBC casts, or AKI [^117RrQsk].

> I should double-check indications for urgent urology consultation: gross hematuria, clot retention, trauma with gross hematuria or microscopic hematuria plus hypotension, suspected bladder injury with pelvic fracture, suspected iatrogenic injury, and any scenario with ongoing bleeding or expanding hematoma warrant prompt urologic involvement; in trauma with active extravasation or pseudoaneurysm, angiography and embolization are indicated in stable patients to preserve renal function [^115ngH9R] [^111fbt2P] [^11363VZk]. Hold on, I should verify follow-up imaging timing: for high-grade renal injuries, repeat CT within 48–72 hours is advised if there is ongoing bleeding or urine extravasation, and delayed-phase imaging is essential when collecting system injury is suspected [^111nTMW6].

> For nephrology, I need to ensure I refer when hematuria coexists with significant proteinuria, dysmorphic RBCs or RBC casts, AKI, suspected systemic vasculitis or glomerulonephritis, or persistent unexplained hematuria after a negative urologic workup; these features shift the pretest probability toward medical renal disease and potential biopsy [^117RrQsk] [^115spsC7]. Let me reconsider the threshold: even modest albuminuria with hematuria can be a trigger in some contexts, so I should integrate the whole clinical picture rather than a single cutoff in isolation [^117RrQsk].

> Special populations require tailored pathways: in pregnancy, ultrasound is preferred initially and CT is generally avoided; in pediatrics, ultrasound is first-line and CT is reserved for trauma with gross hematuria or hypotension, with most hematuria being medical rather than urologic; in patients with LVADs, I should broaden the differential to include hemolysis and device-related issues while still pursuing standard GU etiologies; in patients with ADPKD, hematuria is common and often self-limited, but large cysts can bleed and require conservative management with specialist input [^1116eVP2] [^114bDi9D] [^11764vK5]. I should confirm that in children with hematuria and proteinuria or hypertension, nephrology referral is appropriate, whereas isolated microscopic hematuria may be observed with follow-up depending on context [^116pf93V].

> Follow-up and surveillance need to be explicit and risk-based: for low/negligible-risk microscopic hematuria, repeat urinalysis in 6 months is preferred; if hematuria persists or risk escalates, move to intermediate/high-risk pathways; for intermediate-risk patients, cystoscopy and renal ultrasound are recommended; for high-risk patients, cystoscopy and CT urography are indicated; after a negative evaluation, shared decision-making about repeat urinalysis is reasonable, and new gross hematuria or rising RBC burden should trigger re-evaluation rather than reassurance [^112njtLh] [^112MZhiB] [^111bup6H]. Wait, let me verify timing after treating a benign cause: waiting at least 3 weeks and no more than 3 months before repeating urinalysis allows transient hematuria to resolve while avoiding undue delay in detecting persistent disease, which I should document clearly in the care plan [^113DvpYu].

> Key principles I should not overlook: painless gross hematuria in older adults is cancer until proven otherwise and deserves expedited cystoscopy and imaging; anticoagulation does not explain away hematuria and should not defer standard evaluation; women are frequently misdiagnosed with UTI, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion and avoid anchoring bias; and delays in evaluation correlate with worse oncologic outcomes, so I should build systems that reduce time-to-cystoscopy and imaging for high-risk patients [^111V1Czx] [^114MSbvc] [^114iCsHn]. Hold on, I should verify that my documentation captures risk factors, rationale for imaging choices, and follow-up intervals, because this both supports quality metrics and protects patients from missed diagnoses [^114cVMKz].

Sudden hematuria requires **immediate stabilization** and a **structured workup** to identify and treat the cause. Begin with **ABCs**, vital signs, and a focused history/physical to assess for trauma, infection, stones, malignancy, or coagulopathy [^116UCChT]. Order urinalysis with microscopy, CBC, renal function, coagulation profile, and urine culture; if infection is present, treat and repeat urinalysis to confirm resolution [^117Eoaeg]. Imaging is guided by risk: **renal ultrasound for low-risk patients** and **CT urography for intermediate/high-risk or gross hematuria** [^117DFb2D] [^115235m8]. Cystoscopy is indicated for **gross hematuria**, **persistent microscopic hematuria**, or **high-risk patients** [^113cNqcM] [^112tL1bY] [^114qfGMw]. Management is cause-specific: antibiotics for infection, stone management, malignancy referral, and coagulopathy correction; admit for **active bleeding**, **clot retention**, **unstable patients**, or **high-risk findings** [^notfound].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

- **Airway, breathing, circulation (ABCs)**: Stabilize the patient first [^notfound].

- **Vital signs**: Assess for hypotension, tachycardia, or shock.

- **History**: Onset, duration, pain, trauma, infection symptoms, anticoagulant use, smoking, occupational exposures, family history of malignancy [^114MSbvc].

- **Physical examination**: Flank tenderness, abdominal masses, prostate enlargement, signs of bleeding diathesis [^notfound].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

- **Urinalysis with microscopy**: Confirm hematuria, assess for proteinuria, RBC casts, dysmorphic RBCs (suggest glomerular source) [^115spsC7].

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate anemia, thrombocytopenia, infection [^notfound].

- **Renal function tests**: Serum creatinine, eGFR to assess renal impairment [^1143meSj].

- **Coagulation profile**: PT, aPTT, INR if anticoagulation is suspected [^notfound].

- **Urine culture**: Rule out or confirm infection [^117Eoaeg].

## Imaging studies

Imaging is selected based on **clinical suspicion and risk stratification**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended imaging** |
|-|-|
| Low-risk microscopic hematuria | Renal ultrasound [^112PYwCc] |
| Intermediate/high-risk microscopic hematuria or gross hematuria | CT urography (CT-IVP) [^117DFb2D] |
| Suspected ureteral stones | Non-contrast CT abdomen/pelvis [^111CiPc6] |
| Suspected bladder/urethral injury | Retrograde cystography [^1118zvtF] |
| Pregnancy | Renal ultrasound (avoid radiation) [^notfound] |

---

## Indications for cystoscopy

Cystoscopy is indicated for **gross hematuria**, **persistent microscopic hematuria**, or patients categorized as **intermediate/high risk** for malignancy [^112MZhiB] [^111V1Czx].

---

## Management based on underlying cause

### Infection

For infection, **treatment** is empiric antibiotics tailored to culture results, and **follow-up** should include repeat urinalysis to confirm resolution [^117Eoaeg].

---

### Stones

For stones, **management** includes analgesia, hydration, and medical expulsive therapy (e.g. tamsulosin); **procedures** such as ureteroscopy or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) are indicated for large or obstructing stones [^notfound].

---

### Malignancy

For malignancy, **referral** to urology/oncology is essential, and **management** may involve surgical resection, chemotherapy, or radiation depending on stage and histology [^111V1Czx].

---

### Coagulopathy

For coagulopathy, **correction** involves reversing anticoagulation or administering clotting factors as indicated, with **monitoring** of coagulation parameters [^notfound].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

Hospitalization is warranted for **hemodynamic instability**, **active bleeding requiring intervention**, **clot retention** needing catheterization, or **high-risk findings** such as suspected malignancy or significant renal injury.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include repeat urinalysis to confirm resolution, **risk-based urologic evaluation** using AUA guidelines [^114cVMKz], and **patient education** on warning signs and when to seek care [^111bup6H].

---

Sudden hematuria requires a structured approach: stabilize, evaluate with targeted labs and imaging, and treat the cause. Most patients can be managed **outpatient**, but **admit for active bleeding**, **clot retention**, **instability**, or **high-risk findings**.

### The approach to the patient with hematuria [^114r1D75]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is common; whether gross or microscopic, it is incumbent on emergency providers to consider life-threatening and benign processes when evaluating these patients. Most workup is driven by a focused history and physical, including laboratory studies and diagnostic imaging. The cause originates in the genitourinary tract and, as long as the patient remains stable, they can be discharged with close outpatient follow-up. The importance of this cannot be stressed enough because hematuria, especially in the elderly, frequently signals the presence of urologic malignancy. In addition, the workup occasionally yields a nongenitourinary tract cause, and these patients often require emergent management.

### Hematuria [^116UCChT]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The emergency physician can expect to commonly evaluate patients with hematuria, and the differential diagnosis will include both benign and life-threatening causes. This differential is divided into the following categories: glomerular or nonglomerular, coagulopathy-related, traumatic, and factitious causes. Nonglomerular causes account for the majority of hematuria evaluated in the ED, with infection and stones being the most prevalent diagnoses. Glomerular causes will have associated red cell casts and proteinuria present on urinalysis. Painless atraumatic gross hematuria in the elderly is caused by a malignancy until proven otherwise. A focused history, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic testing in the ED usually yields a diagnosis. If the patient is discharged home, proper follow-up with the primary care physician, urologist, or nephrologist is indicated, depending upon the diagnosis.

### Acquired hemophilia presenting as profound hematuria: evaluation, diagnosis, and management of elusive cause of bleeding in the emergency department setting [^114ezjPA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There are numerous causes of bleeding that may present to the Emergency Department (ED). Although rare, acquired hemophilia is a potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder, with reported mortality rates ranging from 6% to 8% among patients who received proper diagnosis and treatment. Approximately two thirds of patients with this condition will present with major bleeding, the magnitude of which may necessitate urgent evaluation and care.

Objectives

The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the evaluation, differential diagnosis, and management of acquired hemophilia for the emergency physician.

Case Report

A case report of a patient who presented to the ED with gross hematuria secondary to undiagnosed acquired hemophilia is described to facilitate a review of the laboratory evaluation, differential diagnosis, and treatment of acquired hemophilia.

Conclusion

Patients with acquired hemophilia-related bleeding may present to the ED for care, given the often serious nature of their bleeding. Delayed diagnosis may postpone the initiation of targeted, effective treatments for achieving hemostasis, with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly in patients who require emergent invasive procedures. Recognition of the potential for an underlying bleeding disorder and subsequent consultation with a hematologist are critical first steps in effectively identifying and managing a patient with acquired hemophilia who presents with bleeding.

Haematuria can be a troublesome symptom with various different methods of presentation and aetiologies. Microscopic haematuria is a common coincidental finding often found when the patient has presented for another reason. We will discuss the subject of haematuria but will focus the majority of this article on the discussion of microscopic haematuria, including a definition, the important features to cover in the history and examination, aetiologies to suspect in children and infants, and a suggested approach to assessing these patients in secondary care.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hematuria [^1116eVP2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is a common reason for patients to be referred for imaging of the urinary tract. All patients diagnosed with hematuria should undergo a thorough history and physical examination, urinalysis, and serologic testing prior to any initial imaging. Ultrasound, CT, and MRI are the most common imaging modalities used to evaluate hematuria. This document discusses the following clinical scenarios for hematuria: initial imaging of microhematuria without risk factors or history of recent vigorous exercise, or presence of infection, or viral illness, or present or recent menstruation; initial imaging of microhematuria in patients with known risk factors and no history of recent vigorous exercise, or presence of infection, or viral illness, or present or recent menstruation or renal parenchymal disease; initial imaging of microhematuria in the pregnant patient and initial imaging of gross hematuria. Follow-up of normal or abnormal findings is beyond the scope of this review. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the current consensus guidelines for nonimaging triage and ultimate preferred imaging approach for the patient with unexplained hematuria.

Conclusion

Numerous consensus guidelines from varying societies have outlined preferred imaging pathways for the patient with unexplained urologic causes of hematuria. Future guidelines will need to take into account disease prevalence, radiation considerations, and cost.

### Sudden late onset of gross hematuria in a previous renal transplant recipient 3 months after transplant nephrectomy [^116petVG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Causes of gross hematuria in a patient with end-stage renal disease are limited compared with those in patients with normal renal function. Given the increased likelihood of patients with end-stage renal disease developing renal cell carcinoma, the workup focuses on a careful evaluation of the collecting system. The workup for gross hematuria in a renal transplant recipient is similar; however, the focus shifts toward a more thorough evaluation of the transplanted kidney and bladder because immunosuppression increases the overall risk for malignancy. An immunosuppressed patient also is at risk for infectious processes in the transplanted kidney manifesting as gross hematuria. Concerns for chronic rejection also should be investigated, although microscopic hematuria is more common in this scenario. If this is unrevealing, then close scrutiny of the native kidneys for possible sources of bleeding is warranted. We present an interesting and unusual cause of painless gross hematuria in a patient with end-stage renal disease and transplant nephrectomy 3 months before the onset of bleeding.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114oNGrM]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — initially low/negligible-risk with hematuria on repeat urinalysis: Low/negligible-risk patients with microhematuria on repeat urinalysis should be reclassified as intermediate- or high-risk based on repeat urinalysis. In such patients, clinicians should perform risk-based evaluation in accordance with recommendations for these respective risk strata. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C)

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116cFAjd]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — evaluation and diagnostic accuracy in suspected recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI): A meta-analysis of 9 studies found that the combination of sudden-onset dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge confers a 90% probability of UTI, defined in this report as > 10^4 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen. In the same study, approximately 50% of women with one or more UTI symptoms (e.g., dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria, or back pain), who lacked that very specific combination of symptoms did not have cystitis, suggesting misdiagnosis of acute UTI is common. In-person assessment significantly improves UTI diagnostic accuracy; culture positivity rates for those tested following virtual assessment (29%) are less than half that for patients seen in person (64%). Given the number of conditions that share significant symptomatology with UTI and the common misdiagnosis of acute cystitis, patients with rUTI warrant evaluation with an examination at least at their initial presentation to rule out alternative explanations for the patient's relapsing symptoms and to identify any structural or functional abnormalities that may be contributing to infection recurrence, and additional examinations with subsequent infections are not required, particularly when presenting symptoms are consistent with prior episodes, but may be useful in situations where the patient's symptoms are atypical or fail to resolve with appropriate treatment.

### Sudden onset flank pain: spontaneous renal rupture [^115H9J8J]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Undifferentiated abdominal pain is a common condition encountered in the emergency department. While a patient's age, risk factors, and comorbidities often aid in risk stratification and guide emergency department evaluation, atypical presentations of serious disease may still occur suddenly in young otherwise healthy patients.

Case Report

In this vignette we discuss a case of spontaneous, atraumatic renal rupture with large retroperitoneal hemorrhage (Wunderlich's Syndrome) in a 22year old male.

Discussion

Emergency physicians regularly encounter uncommon causes of abdominal pain. Wunderlich's syndrome is rare but proper understanding of the disease process will aid in decision making and improve disposition and outcomes for patients. Likely presentations and risk factors for atraumatic renal rupture will be discussed as well as ED management and definitive treatment options.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^112wLc1c]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Renal trauma follow-up and delayed-phase imaging — perform follow-up imaging (within 48 to 72 hours) only for patients with ongoing blood loss, urine extravasation on initial imaging, penetrating high-grade ballistic injury, or who are symptomatic with suspicion for a complication related to the renal injury. Delayed follow-up imaging (weeks or months post trauma) is recommended only to monitor known complications or when the patient presents with either gross hematuria or symptoms related to complications from renal trauma. When concerned about a collecting system injury, delayed-phase imaging is necessary for evaluation and staging, and for patients with significant renal injuries on contrast imaging, delayed-phase imaging is necessary for appropriate evaluation and injury grading when a mechanism of injury is concerning for significant renal or ureteral injury, or when the patient has unexpected fluid around the kidneys or ureters.

### Diagnosis and management of hematuria [^1167fRFm]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Microscopic and gross hematuria present unique and difficult diagnostic and management challenges in the already complex general surgery patient. This article provides the general surgeon with relevant knowledge in the pathophysiology, anatomy, etiologies, workup, and treatments of hematuria. In addition common causes of hematuria that may be encountered by the general surgeon (including trauma, urinary tract infection, urolithiasis, and malignancy), the difficult to manage clinical situation of clot urinary retention is presented. This article provides a urologic framework of thinking for the clinician to best manage a general surgery patient who has hematuria.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112njtLh]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — low/negligible-risk initial evaluation: In low/ negligible-risk patients with microhematuria, clinicians should obtain repeat urinalysis within six months rather than perform immediate cystoscopy or imaging (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Thus, given the low risk of malignancy and the potential harms of over-evaluation, the Panel recommends against routine cystoscopy and imaging for the initial evaluation of patients in the low-risk category and has renamed the category as low/negligible-risk to emphasize this point. The Panel acknowledges, however, that there may be scenarios in which cystoscopy in low/negligible-risk patients may be warranted based on symptoms, clinical suspicion or patient preference, and given the intermittent nature of hematuria, the Panel recommends a repeat UA with subsequent risk-based evaluation predicated on those results. Supporting validation studies found extremely low rates of malignancy among patients in the low-risk category (0%, 0.4% and 0%, respectively), and one study followed low-risk patients for a median of 26 months with no additional cancers identified.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^115spsC7]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Assessment for acute kidney disorder (AKD) includes evaluation for volume depletion (e.g., lightheadedness or dizziness, hypotension, orthostasis); for urinary obstruction with symptoms of voiding dysfunction, flank pain, or hematuria, elevated post-void bladder volume, or evidence of obstruction on kidney imaging (e.g., hydronephrosis); and for suspicion of acute glomerular or interstitial disease (e.g., hematuria, dysmorphic RBCs or RBC casts, new onset or acute increase in albuminuria) with recent illness (e.g., infection), constitutional or rheumatologic symptoms, rash, edema, and hemoptysis.

### Evaluation of hematuria in children [^113qC96H]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The detection of blood in a child's urine is alarming and often prompts many laboratory studies. Hematuria is one of the most important signs of renal or bladder disease, but proteinuria often is a more important diagnostic and prognostic finding. The physician should ensure that serious conditions are not overlooked, avoid unnecessary laboratory studies, reassure the family, and provide guidelines for additional studies if there is a change in the child's course. This article provides an approach to the evaluation and management of hematuria in a child. Many tests have been recommended for the child with hematuria, but no consensus exists on a systematic evaluation.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^116R9bCd]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Renal trauma imaging — contrast-enhanced abdominal/pelvic CT is the gold standard for the patient who is hemodynamically stable or was stabilized after blunt or penetrating trauma, and if imaging has not been obtained, perform CT imaging for suspected renal injury in patients with any of the following: gross hematuria; microhematuria and hypotension without indications for emergent operative interventions; a significant injury mechanism (fall from height, blow to flank, rapid deceleration, etc.); penetrating injuries to the abdomen or flank; or clinical findings suggestive of renal trauma, including flank ecchymosis on physical exam and rib fractures seen on initial trauma radiograph studies. Degree of hematuria can be used to reduce imaging burden, and for individuals with only microhematuria or no hematuria and no hypotension, imaging of the GU system can be omitted. Plain film radiograph or ultrasound is not recommended as a diagnostic tool for initial evaluation and diagnosis of trauma patients with a suspected kidney injury.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^111bup6H]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria follow-up after a negative evaluation: in patients with a negative risk-based hematuria evaluation, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding whether to repeat urinalysis in the future (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation and subsequent negative urinalysis, clinicians may discontinue further evaluation for microhematuria (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Most patients who have an appropriate risk-stratified negative hematuria evaluation do not require ongoing urologic monitoring and may be safely discharged from the urology clinic after shared decision-making and discussion of the best available evidence, and for these patients a future UA may be considered.

### Clinical utility of a non-invasive urine test for risk assessing patients with no obvious benign cause of hematuria: a physician-patient real world data analysis [^114K5iTu]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hematuria, or blood in the urine, is a common occurrence in clinical practice. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH; defined as > 3 red blood cells/high-powered field in a properly collected urine sample) is present in up to 24% of the general population and is the primary reason for more than 485,000 referrals to urologists in the US every year.

The current American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend a full urological work-up to diagnose or rule out UC in patients with AMH within 180 days, however several barriers to referral for a full urological work-up exist. For example, clinical diagnostic algorithms for patients with hematuria are complicated, difficult to follow and enable a degree of latitude in their interpretation. Many physicians are also conscious of the burden of invasive procedures and the potential for harm and there is a lack of compliance by patients when confronted with the prospect of many and varied invasive procedures. Invasive procedures, such as cystoscopy and contrast computed tomography (CT) scans, have the potential to impact their patients in terms of adverse events, financial cost and emotional impact. As such, guideline recommendations to administer full urological work-ups to all patients presenting with hematuria may only be selectively adhered to.

In particular, as few as 10% of women with hematuria are referred to urologists. Likewise, < 14% of patients with hematuria undergo cystoscopy or radiological investigation within 180 days and a recent Australian study reported delays of up to 1165 days between initial presentation of hematuria and subsequent treatment for UC. This is particularly concerning given that delayed diagnoses are known to negatively influence outcomes for patients with UC with every day increasing the risk of death for a patient with UC by 1%.

The high probability of delayed treatment is particularly evident for younger and female patients. Treatment for UC is more likely to be delayed for women than men, and although the incidence of UC is higher for men, women are less likely to undergo procedures after being referred and have a higher risk of presenting with UC at an advanced stage and have poorer survival outcomes. Therefore, a simple, rigorous and accurate segregation of patients using a non-invasive risk-assessment tool may reduce barriers to referral and focus the intensity and prioritisation of patients for workup.

### Clinical utility of a non-invasive urine test for risk assessing patients with no obvious benign cause of hematuria: a physician-patient real world data analysis [^111M2WzS]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The assessment process undertaken in this study with participating physicians retrospectively evaluating real world patients extends the previous study by demonstrating that the intensity and focus of the physician recommended workup is influenced by the Cxbladder result without compromising detection of UC. The heatmap data graphic was developed to enhance the visualization of the changes in decisions for the evaluation of these patients, as either an escalation or de-escalation from baseline decisions, after the addition of the Cxbladder test results. This approach provided the opportunity to view changes in decision making and their impact on clinical utility at the level of the individual physician-patient interaction as opposed to the consolidated cohort-wide view of our previous study.

The addition of non-invasive Cxbladder urine biomarker test results to the physicians decision making process was shown in this study to provide an overall increase in clinical utility of Cxbladder as an objective risk assessment tool for UC in the work-up of patients presenting with AMH where there are no obvious benign causes. More specifically, presentation of Cxbladder results leads to physicians modifying their diagnostic behavior and resource allocation in a consistent and repeatable manner reflecting the risk of disease for the patient. In addition, 33% (8/24) of the clinical decisions where the patient had UC, would not have been referred for an appropriate work-up that included invasive diagnostics tests in the absence of results from Cxbladder.

The addition of Cxbladder test results for decision making was shown to enable patients with a high probability of UC to be identified and prioritized for a full urological work-up in advance of an initial consultation, offering a clear increase in clinical utility. This outcome is expected to be of significant importance in a healthcare system when there are challenges from < 14% of patients with hematuria being referred to a urologist within 180 days, and where approximately 20,000 instances of UC are missed annually in the US amongst patients with hematuria who are considered to be moderate-to-high risk. Furthermore, approximately, one-third of patients with hematuria undergo a cystoscopy, providing the potential for approximately 200,000 potentially unnecessary cystoscopies performed on patients who have a low risk of UC every year. Accordingly, Cxbladder has the potential to provide an enhancement to the standard of care for the management and diagnostic workup of patients with hematuria that will provide benefits to the patient and the healthcare system alike from the appropriate targeting and reduction in the total number and invasiveness of tests and procedures used.

### Acute urinary tract disorders [^1124EhWh]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Acute urinary tract disorders often manifest as flank pain and are a common complaint of patients who present to the emergency department. The pain is often a vague, poorly localized sensation that may have a variety of causes. Laboratory and clinical findings, such as hematuria, are neither sensitive nor specific for determining the cause of the flank pain. Accordingly, imaging is an important tool in determining a diagnosis and management plan. Patients with acute urinary tract disorders who present with pain include those with calculi as well as renal infection, vascular disorders, and hemorrhage.

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults [^115UnMZX]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria, a common finding on routine urinalysis of adults, is clinically significant when three to five red blood cells per high-power field are visible. Etiologies of microscopic hematuria range from incidental causes to life-threatening urinary tract neoplasm. The lack of evidence-based imaging guidelines can complicate the family physician's decision about the best way to proceed. Patients with proteinuria, red cell casts, and elevated serum creatinine levels should be referred promptly to a nephrology subspecialist. Microscopic hematuria with signs of urinary tract infection should resolve with appropriate treatment of the underlying infection. Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or with hematuria persisting after treatment of urinary tract infection also need to be evaluated. Because upper and lower urinary tract pathologies often coexist, patients should be evaluated using cytology plus intravenous urography, computed tomography, or ultrasonography. When urine cytology results are abnormal, cystoscopy should be performed to complete the investigation.

Microhematuria initial evaluation — in patients with microhematuria, clinicians should perform a history, physical examination including blood pressure measurement, and serum creatinine to assess risk factors for genitourinary malignancy, medical renal disease, gynecologic, and non-malignant genitourinary causes of microhematuria; clinicians should perform the same evaluation of patients with microhematuria who are taking antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants (regardless of the type or level of therapy) as patients not on these agents; in patients with findings suggestive of a gynecologic or non-malignant urologic etiology, clinicians should evaluate the patients with appropriate physical examination techniques and tests to identify such an etiology; in patients diagnosed with gynecologic or non-malignant genitourinary sources of microhematuria, clinicians should repeat urinalysis following resolution of the gynecologic or non-malignant genitourinary cause, and if microhematuria persists or the etiology cannot be identified, clinicians should perform risk-based urologic evaluation; in patients with hematuria attributed to a urinary tract infection, clinicians should obtain a urinalysis with microscopic evaluation following treatment to ensure resolution of the hematuria; and clinicians should refer patients with microhematuria for nephrological evaluation if medical renal disease is suspected. However, risk-based urologic evaluation should still be performed.

### Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults: summary of the AUA best practice policy recommendations [^115sJyBv]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The American Urological Association (AUA) convened the Best Practice Policy Panel on Asymptomatic Microscopic Hematuria to formulate policy statements and recommendations for the evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria in adults. The recommended definition of microscopic hematuria is three or more red blood cells per high-power microscopic field in urinary sediment from two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens. This definition accounts for some degree of hematuria in normal patients, as well as the intermittent nature of hematuria in patients with urologic malignancies. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has causes ranging from minor findings that do not require treatment to highly significant, life-threatening lesions. Therefore, the AUA recommends that an appropriate renal or urologic evaluation be performed in all patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria who are at risk for urologic disease or primary renal disease. At this time, there is no consensus on when to test for microscopic hematuria in the primary care setting, and screening is not addressed in this report. However, the AUA report suggests that the patient's history and physical examination should help the physician decide whether testing is appropriate.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaHematuria-child [^114bDi9D]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Hematuria is the presence of red blood cells in the urine, either visible to the eye (macroscopic hematuria) or as viewed under the microscope (microscopic hematuria). The clinical evaluation of children and adolescents with any form of hematuria begins with a meticulous history and thorough evaluation of the urine. The need for imaging evaluation depends on the clinical scenario in which hematuria presents, including the suspected etiology. Ultrasound and CT are the most common imaging methods used to assess hematuria in children, although other imaging modalities may be appropriate in certain instances. This review focuses on the following clinical variations of childhood hematuria: isolated hematuria (nonpainful, nontraumatic, and microscopic versus macroscopic), painful hematuria (ie, suspected nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis), and renal trauma with hematuria (microscopic versus macroscopic). The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Challenging clinical scenarios for therapeutic anticoagulation: a practical approach [^112XLyK6]. Thrombosis Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic anticoagulation remains a fundamental backbone in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism. However, while modern therapies are increasingly safe, anticoagulation is not without risks, particularly in those at high risk for or with recent bleeding. When weighing concurrent risks and benefits in each challenging clinical scenario, an individualized assessment of the risk and acuity of bleeding should be balanced by the indication for anticoagulation. Addressing modifiable risk factors and routine re-evaluation of any changes in this balance is critical. This review outlines available data and current guidelines for the management of anticoagulation in high-risk populations, including those with thrombocytopenia, elderly and high-fall risk, inherited bleeding disorders, and in acute coronary syndrome. We also examine management after clinically significant bleeding episodes, including intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, hemoptysis, retroperitoneal bleeding, hematuria, and abnormal uterine bleeding. The aim is to provide a comprehensive review of available literature to guide clinicians in providing optimal, safe, and individualized care for patients in these challenging scenarios.

Asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria is a worrisome clinical sign for a patient that usually prompts a visit to a urologist. Hematuria is classified as microscopic versus gross; the evaluation for gross hematuria differs from that for microscopic hematuria, and the most important differentiating factor is the patient's age. The major causes of hematuria differ between children and adults, and the evaluation should reflect this. Renal disease is more common in children and malignancy more common in adults. The application and utility of laboratory tests, radiological studies, and cystoscopy are well established in adults but are more variable in children. Follow-up of hematuria after a negative evaluation is becoming more limited in adults but should be routine for children.

### Hematuria in children [^112iqPgs]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Children with hematuria require a thorough history and physical examination. Not all children with hematuria require the same investigations. The only laboratory test uniformly required for children with the various presentations of hematuria is a complete urinalysis with a microscopic examination. The rest of the evaluation is tailored according to the pertinent history, physical examination, and other abnormalities on the urinalysis. This article has provided a brief summary of the more common causes of pediatric hematuria and suggestions for tailoring the patient's evaluation according to the presentation. Most causes of hematuria in pediatrics represent medical conditions that often require referral to a pediatric nephrologist. Indications for referral to a urologist are more limited and include stones that do not pass spontaneously or are more than 5 mm in diameter, renal injury from trauma, anatomic abnormalities, or gross hematuria that seems to originate from the urinary tract and is without an identified cause.

The causes of macroscopic and microscopic hematuria overlap; both are often caused by urinary tract infections or urethral/bladder irritation. Coexistent hypertension and proteinuria should prompt investigation for glomerular disease. The most common glomerulonephritis in children is postinfectious glomerulonephritis. In most patients, and especially with isolated microscopic hematuria, the diagnostic workup reveals no clear underlying cause. In those cases whereby a diagnosis is made, the most common causes of persistent microscopic hematuria are thin basement membrane nephropathy, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or idiopathic hypercalciuria. Treatment and long-term prognosis varies with the underlying disease.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^1127MwzE]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study indicates that the prevalence of bladder cancer in patients presenting with microscopic hematuria is low (7%). A key question is what is the proportion of subjects in whom a positive cytology prompted a biopsy that was positive for cancer, in whom a biopsy would not otherwise have been performed? None of our patients had a positive cytology and a negative cytsoscopic/radiologic evaluation. This is consistent with our previous study that demonstrated an extremely low yield of urinary cytology in the evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria. To our knowledge, these are the first contemporary report bringing the utility of urinary cytology in patients with microscopic hematuria into question.

As for the application of serial urinary cytologies, previous studies demonstrated a marginally improved by serial examinations, which was confirmed in our study. Because of this low prevalence and the low sensitivity, the utility of urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of patients with microscopic hematuria is minimal, especially since all high risk patients proceeded to cystourethroscopy and upper urinary tract radiologic evaluation.

Current AUA guidelines recommend that patients presenting with microscopic hematuria should undergo upper tract evaluation along with cystoscopy. When the CT scan is not feasible, MRI or renal ultrasound with bilateral retrograde pyelograms can be substituted (2). This evaluation is adequate in assessing the kidneys, collecting system, ureters, bladder, and urethra as the cause of the hematuria. Unfortunately, except in select patients our current diagnostic modalities will not allow us to diagnose urothelial carcinomas without visualization of a lesion followed by biopsy, which is the gold standard. With this said, the acquisition of urinary cytology even as an adjunct to the above studies rarely changes the evaluation or management and may lead to an exhaustive, unfruitful, and costly evaluation. In the face of abnormal cytology and normal cystoscopy confirmed by biopsy and normal imaging of the upper tract, the question arises whether to pursue the abnormal cytology as a possible upper tract tumor. Evaluation may include retrograde pyelogram, ureteroscopy, and selective cytology. The yield of these maneuvers is reported to be extremely low and of little benefit, except in highly select patients, especially in the face of normal radiologic studies and normal cystoscopic evaluation. However, if an abnormality is noted on radiologic or cystoscopic examination, urinary cytology may prove to be useful as a confirmation of a malignancy prior to formal biopsy.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^112qtvJM]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Gross or microscopic hematuria [≥ 3 red blood cells (RBC) per high power field (hpf)] may be caused by numerous factors - urinary calculi, hematologic abnormalities, infection, trauma, tuberculosis, and tumor. Some of these factors (e.g. tumor) may be life threatening. Thus prompt, thorough evaluation and treatment are needed. Currently, evaluation for the hematuric patient consists of inspecting the lower urinary tract by cystourethroscopy, inspecting the upper urinary tract with computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast, ultrasonography or intravenous pyelogram (IVP), and obtaining a urine sample for cytologic evaluation.

Urine for cytology can detect cancerous cells shed from any part of the entire urothelium (i.e. collecting system to urethra) in a voided urine specimen. Higher grade tumors or larger tumors (> 3 cm) are more likely to shed cells into the urine and thus the sample is more likely to be positive for cancer. Urinary cytology has a notoriously low sensitivity, but an extremely high specificity, thus making it a useful tool in following patients with high grade cancers. Furthermore, interpretation of urinary cytology may be difficult, especially in the face of such conditions as urinary tract infection. With these notable limitations, the question arises as to how effective is urinary cytology in diagnosing bladder cancer in a patient presenting with microscopic hematuria? Herein, we report the utility of urinary cytology of patients presenting to a urology clinic for evaluation of microscopic hematuria.

Hematuria

Hematuria in a patient with an LVAD could be either VAD-related or non-VAD-related. Intravascular hemolysis (hemoglobinuria), rhabdomyolysis, anticoagulation, medication-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and bacterial endocarditis are VAD-related causes of hematuria. Drugs, urinary tract infection, nephrolithiasis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate, bladder, and renal malignancies, and autoimmune diseases are non-VAD-related causes of hematuria.

The following laboratory and imaging tests should be ordered to determine the cause of the hematuria: urinalysis; urine culture; plasma free hemoglobin, LDH, and haptoglobin levels; coagulation panel, ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor profile (if thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a consideration); renal function panel; urine eosinophil level; ultrasonography of the kidneys or CT imaging; and cystoscopy. A urology consultation may also be considered.

Infection

Continuous-flow LVADs have lower overall infection rates compared with pulsatile devices but the rates still range from 30 to 50% in patients with implanted devices. Patients who undergo LVAD implantation for destination therapy are more likely to develop infections than patients who had LVADs implanted as a bridge to transplantation because destination therapy patients tend to be sicker and have longer durations of LVAD support.

The diagnosis of sepsis in patients with LVADs is the same as that for other patient populations. Important steps in the management of sepsis include blood cultures, antibiotics, measuring lactate levels to assess for a state of vasodilatory shock and reduced tissue perfusion, and intravenous fluids, as deemed necessary based on the hemodynamic assessment. Patients may be hypotensive and have vasodilatation, with high VAD flow rates. Therefore, vasopressor agents may be needed early in the management course. Central access and measurement of central venous pressure for assessment of fluid responsiveness may help in guiding therapy. Inotropic agents may be needed if septic cardiomyopathy leads to RV dysfunction. VADs are related directly or indirectly to a variety of infections, including the VAD-specific infections (pump pocket, cannula, driveline) and VAD-related infections (endocarditis and pericarditis). VAD patients are also susceptible to mediastinitis and pneumonia, central line infections, e.g. a PICC line (peripherally inserted central catheter), or other non-VAD-related infections, such as urinary tract infections. Meticulous head-to-toe assessment is necessary to consider all possible sources of infection in patients who meet sepsis criteria.

### An evidence-based microscopic hematuria care pathway optimizes decision-making among providers [^112PYwCc]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Microscopic hematuria (MH) has many etiologies in women and requires specific gynecologic evaluation. We created a standardized MH pathway to serve as an evidence-based decision aid for providers in our practice.

Methods

Using a modified Delphi process, a multidisciplinary team reviewed existing guidelines for MH diagnosis and treatment to reach consensus on care pathway components.

Results

Entry into the care pathway by an advanced practice provider is determined by the finding of ≥ 3 red blood cells per high-power field (RBC/HPF) on microscopic urinalysis. Initial evaluation includes history and physical exam. If there are signs of a gynecologic cause of MH, the conditions are treated and repeat urinalysis is performed in 6 months. If repeat urinalysis shows persistent MH or there are no other apparent causes for MH, we proceed with risk stratification. Through shared decision-making, low-risk patients may undergo repeat urinalysis in 6 months or cystoscopy with urinary tract ultrasound. For intermediate-risk patients, cystoscopy and urinary tract ultrasound are recommended. For high-risk patients, cystoscopy and axial upper urinary tract imaging are recommended. If evaluation is positive, urology referral is provided. If evaluation is negative, low-risk patients are released from care, but intermediate-risk or high-risk patients undergo repeat urinalysis in 12 months. If repeat urinalysis is positive, shared decision-making is used to determine a plan.

Conclusions

We developed an MH care pathway to standardize care of women with MH across a multidisciplinary group. This pathway serves as a component of value-based care and supports evidence-based care by providers.

### Evaluation of proteinuria and hematuria in ambulatory setting [^111ZAZ8y]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria and/or hematuria are common findings in ambulatory settings. Proteinuria can be glomerular and/or tubular in origin and it may be transient, orthostatic, or persistent. Persistent proteinuria may be indicative of a serious kidney pathology. Hematuria, which denotes the presence of an increased number of red blood cells in the urine, can be gross or microscopic. Hematuria can originate from the glomeruli or other sites of the urinary tract. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or mild proteinuria in an otherwise healthy child is less likely to be of clinical significance. However, the presence of both requires further workup and careful monitoring.

### Evaluation of hospital-based hematuria diagnosis and subsequent cancer risk among adults in Denmark [^115RxCWB]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

The American Urological Association guideline for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria recommends yearly evaluation for urinary tract cancer in case of persistent hematuria after a negative urologic workup. We identified few additional cases of invasive bladder cancer more than 1 year after hematuria diagnosis among patients who underwent a cystoscopy within 3 months before or after their hematuria diagnosis. Because the American Urological Association recommends cystoscopy for all patients older than 35 years with hematuria, follow-up for more than 1 year may not be needed. This recommendation accords with suggestions by Mishriki et althat patients with monosymptomatic hematuria who have undergone a thorough initial investigation with normal results do not need further follow-up.

Inclusion of nonurologic cancers in this study adds to the existing literature. The 12-fold increased risk of any cancer during the first 3 months after the initial hematuria diagnosis likely indicates that hematuria can be the presenting symptom of an occult cancer or that an occult cancer can be an incidental finding during diagnostic workup for hematuria. For rectal and gynecologic cancers, the initial increased risk of cancer was succeeded by a compensatory decreased risk, which was sustained during more than 5 years of follow-up.

### Traumatic hematuria in children can be evaluated as in adults [^114Brr6V]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Controversy exists regarding whether children who present with blunt abdominal trauma and microhematuria should undergo renal imaging. Adult blunt trauma victims who present without gross hematuria, shock, or significant deceleration or other major associated injuries do not require renal imaging. This study was designed to evaluate whether the criteria for imaging the renal parenchyma in adult blunt trauma victims apply to the pediatric population.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 720 consecutive pediatric patients with suspected renal trauma to determine mechanism of injury, evaluation and treatment of subsequent injuries.

Results

Of the 720 trauma patients with hematuria (mean age 8 years) 334 underwent imaging, and 59 renal injuries were identified (grade I 32, grade II 6, grade III 8, grade IV 12, grade V 1). A total of 11 patients underwent exploration, resulting in 3 nephrectomies (grade IV 2, grade V 1). Renorrhaphy was not necessary and all other cases were managed conservatively. All patients with significant renal injuries experienced either gross hematuria, shock (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) or a significant deceleration injury.

Conclusions

The decision to image pediatric trauma cases based on the adult criteria of gross hematuria, shock and significant deceleration injury is appropriate. Among 720 pediatric cases of potential renal injury all would have been identified.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^116YcPGC]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Current practice patterns for the evaluation of microscopic hematuria include assessing the lower and upper urinary tracts. Due to the low prevalence of bladder cancer and the low sensitivity of cytology detecting bladder cancer, the exact role of urinary cytology in the evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria may be minimal.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^115DBHdq]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Penile penetrating injury — After patient stabilization, penetrating penile injury may be diagnosed by history and physical examination, including assessment of entry and exit wounds; additional imaging with ultrasound or MRI may be considered for surgical planning, however, this is not required prior to operative exploration. The urethra may be involved in up to 50% of penile ballistic injuries, and if urethral injury is suspected with signs of a weak urinary stream, gross hematuria, or acute urinary retention, a best practice is to perform a RUG or cystoscopy. Management is immediate surgical exploration with irrigation, conservative debridement of nonviable tissue, removal of any foreign bodies, and repair of involved structures is recommended; if urethral involvement is identified, perform urethral debridement and repair over a urethral catheter using a tension-free, watertight closure at the time of surgical exploration. For patients presenting to a lower-level trauma center, consider early patient transfer to a center with urology expertise for penile injury management once the patient is stabilized.

Quick contact with the urological unit

Phone calls from the urology unit, intended to align with SCP guidelines for time limits in scheduling appointments, were made without prior notification to patients that they would expect a call during that period defined by the SCP. As a result, unexpected calls made it challenging for informants to fully take in the information provided, particularly if the calls occurred in stressful situations. For example, some were called while in public places like stores, making it difficult to take notes or focus on the information being provided.

"I was scared when I got an urgent call in a situation like this. I had no idea whether the call would come the next day, in four days, or even ten days". Informant-3.

The rapid pace of events also intensified their anxiety, as the expedited healthcare pathway was often perceived as signalling something urgent or serious. Nonetheless, the absence of follow-up through written communication via some form of digital tool forced them to rely on handwritten notes to capture the details of their appointments.

"There was so much information. I think an email or SMS would be better. You could include a form with details like times, floors, and corridors to make things clearer". Informant- 3.

Many informants expressed a preference for receiving detailed information via SMS or email, allowing them to review and absorb it at their own pace. The unexpected nature of these calls increased fear and uncertainty, as informants were unaware of when the calls would occur or what they would entail. Due to the volume of information shared, informants found it necessary to take notes during the calls and frequently relied on online resources to understand what to expect. Keeping track of all the details related to hospital visits proved challenging and, at times, overwhelming.

"You feel shaken and scared in such a situation, and then you are suddenly called out of nowhere. I had no idea if it would happen the next day, in four days, five days, or ten days. And there I was, in the middle of life, surrounded by grandchildren when the phone rings". Informant- 3.

### Assessment of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults [^111xfM7J]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although routine screening for bladder cancer is not recommended, microscopic hematuria is often incidentally discovered by primary care physicians. The American Urological Association has published an updated guideline for the management of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, which is defined as the presence of three or more red blood cells per high-power field visible in a properly collected urine specimen without evidence of infection. The most common causes of microscopic hematuria are urinary tract infection, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and urinary calculi. However, up to 5% of patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria are found to have a urinary tract malignancy. The risk of urologic malignancy is increased in men, persons older than 35 years, and persons with a history of smoking. Microscopic hematuria in the setting of urinary tract infection should resolve after appropriate antibiotic treatment; persistence of hematuria warrants a diagnostic workup. Dysmorphic red blood cells, cellular casts, proteinuria, elevated creatinine levels, or hypertension in the presence of microscopic hematuria should prompt concurrent nephrologic and urologic referral. The upper urinary tract is best evaluated with multiphasic computed tomography urography, which identifies hydronephrosis, urinary calculi, and renal and ureteral lesions. The lower urinary tract is best evaluated with cystoscopy for urethral stricture disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and bladder masses. Voided urine cytology is no longer recommended as part of the routine evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, unless there are risk factors for malignancy.

### Diagnosis and management of non-dialysis chronic kidney disease in ambulatory care: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^1146XeYi]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Definition and screening

There was no disagreement on the definition of CKD by laboratory tests, but all guidelines fail to precise which structural abnormalities qualify for CKD. NICE and ACP guidelines as well as the USPSTF recommended explicitly against screening of asymptomatic individuals without known risk factors. Screening was recommended for high risk groups in most guidelines, but KHA-CARI used broad definitions for at risk populations like smoking, obesity, socioeconomic disadvantage or age. This can lead to screening situations where health benefits and therapeutic consequences of CKD diagnosis are lacking.

Diagnostic tests in newly diagnosed CKD

Main purpose of the initial diagnostic work-up is to establish CKD and rule out emergencies or specifically treatable kidney disorders, e.g. glomerulonephritis. Most guidelines agree on assessing kidney function by eGFR creatinine and proteinuria. Primarily KHA-CARI and HAS, recommend extensive additional diagnostic work-up, mainly to identify possible complications or comorbidities reflecting the epidemiology in specialized nephrology services but not in primary care. As the risk of developing complications like electrolyte disturbances, anemia or CKD-MBD is largely dependent on kidney function, a more differentiated approach according to CKD stage, could lower health service utilization and cost while maintaining quality of care. HAS explicitly stated that testing was aimed to obtain baseline values in some instances. It is debatable whether this set point information has therapeutic consequence.

Assessment of hematuria was inconsistently addressed. While NICE recommended against using urine microscopy, KHA-CARI recommended it. Most primary care providers do not have the skills and equipment to perform urine microscopy. However NICE and KDIGO did not specify when dipstick testing for hematuria is warranted, while most guideline did not address checking for hematuria at all.

### Evaluation of the patient with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^112zzZRS]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) is relatively common in clinical practice but the etiology remains unclear in the majority of patients; it is rarely related to genitourinary malignancies. The 2012 guidelines of the American Urological Association recommend an evaluation after a single positive urinalysis with mandatory upper tract evaluation in all patients, preferably with CT urography (CTU). The likelihood of detecting significant upper track abnormalities, particularly malignancies is low with CTU, while incidental extraurinary abnormalities are often found, the majority of which are not clinically significant. The workup for these incidental findings has significant financial and clinical implications. Primary care physicians, who are most apt to encounter patients with AMH, have a low rate of adherence to the AUA guidelines, possibly as a result of the broadening of criteria for AMH evaluation by the AUA, with resultant uncertainty amongst primary care physicians about the appropriate candidates for such evaluation. Selection of subgroups of patients with risk factors for GU malignancies who may benefit from a complete evaluation is essential, as opposed to evaluation of all patients classified as having AMH.

### Loin pain hematuria syndrome [^115AKTgK]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Loin pain hematuria syndrome is a rare disease with a prevalence of ∼0.012%. The most prominent clinical features include periods of severe intermittent or persistent unilateral or bilateral loin pain accompanied by either microscopic or gross hematuria. Patients with loin pain hematuria syndrome initially present with hematuria, flank pain, or most often both hematuria and flank pain. Kidney biopsies from patients with loin pain hematuria typically reveal only minor pathologic abnormalities. Further, loin pain hematuria syndrome is not associated with loss of kidney function or urinary tract infections. Loin pain hematuria syndrome-associated hematuria and pain are postulated to be linked to vascular disease of the kidney, coagulopathy, renal vasospasm with microinfarction, hypersensitivity, complement activation on arterioles, venocalyceal fistula, abnormal ureteral peristalsis, and intratubular deposition of calcium or uric acid microcrystals. Many patients with loin pain hematuria syndrome also meet criteria for a somatoform disorder, and analgesic medications, including narcotics, commonly are used to treat loin pain hematuria syndrome-associated pain. Interventional treatments include renal denervation, kidney autotransplantation, and nephrectomy; however, these methods should be used only as a last resort when less invasive measures have been tried unsuccessfully. In this review article, we discuss and critique current clinical practices related to loin pain hematuria syndrome pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.

### International consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in children and young people [^1176VG11]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic disease in adults, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 500–2,500 (refs –). Cyst development starts early in life, and macroscopic cysts can become detectable in childhood. Substantial disease burden with massively enlarged kidneys or decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) usually does not occur until adulthood; however, approximately 3% of children who carry ADPKD-causing mutations have either very-early-onset or unusually rapid progressive disease –. Thus, the absolute incidence of symptomatic ADPKD in childhood is thought to be higher than that of other severe paediatric kidney diseases such as autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (~1 in 20,000), nephrotic syndrome (~1 in 50,000)or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (~1 in 100,000 children).

The past 25 years have seen remarkable progress in knowledge of ADPKD. Advances have been made in unravelling the genetic origins of the disease, in non-invasive monitoring and in predicting disease progression; multiple large-scale clinical trials have been conducted; and the first pharmacological treatment for slowing disease progression — the vasopressin antagonist tolvaptan — has been licensed in the United States, Europe and Japan. However, most ADPKD studies have been performed in adults, and their results are not always easily transferable to children.

Children with ADPKD constitute a mixed cohort of healthy individuals who may not require treatment for decades (referred to here as asymptomatic patients) and individuals who have disease manifestations, such as hypertension, and will benefit from treatment started as early as possible. Few children suffer from symptomatic disease manifestations such as pain, enuresis, haematuria or urinary tract or cyst infections. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic children are likely to be confronted with the effects of ADPKD in older relatives and to have questions or anxieties about their own future health. In addition, many children with an affected parent are unaware of their own disease status (referred to here as at-risk children), either because diagnostic testing has not been performed or because a negative ultrasonography scan does not exclude ADPKD in childhood. An important dilemma in the medical care of children with ADPKD is the balance between not medicalizing currently healthy individuals and not missing treatable disease manifestations in those affected at an early age. Medical professionals from different backgrounds, nurses, affected parents and at-risk children naturally have different views on where this balance lies.

### When is red urine not hematuria? a case report [^113AvusH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The definition of gross hematuria is "the presence of blood in the urine in sufficient quantity to be visible to the naked eye". Certainly red urine, especially after trauma, immediately sparks the concern for genitourinary trauma. However, we report the unique case of a 19-year-old male who presented with "gross hematuria" after a motorcycle accident that turned out not to be hematuria but rather urine discoloration caused by the liberal use of a topical sulfa ointment containing an azo dye obtained in Mexico. We discuss the differential diagnosis of pigmenturia due to drugs or food ingestion, which is sparsely reported in the literature, as well as the frequency of alternative treatments used by patients presenting to the Emergency Department and the impact that can have on their evaluation.

### Augmenting primary prevention of sudden cardiac arrest in a young population [^115NryAG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, population‐wide screening may accelerate SCA detection. Since 1998, the Republic of Korea has mandated annual urinalysis screening in schools to identify and track progression of proteinuria and other renal diseases (Table). As demonstrated by Jeong et al, the screening system remains uninterrupted through adulthood via the biennial National Health Insurance Service‐Health Screeningoffering a wider range of biochemistry, imaging, and questionnaire‐based assessment of chronic diseases risk. Its neighboring country, Japan, also has mandated school urinary screening for asymptomatic hematuria and proteinuria. Since its implementation in 1974, the program has been successfully detecting kidney diseases at their preclinical stage and substantially reduced the incidence of end‐stage renal disease through early treatment of glomerulonephritis. Furthermore, the 2011 revision of primary care physician referral in underserved areas alleviated the burden of pediatric nephrology consultation for isolated cases of hematuria or mild urinary abnormalities unless present with advanced indications based on dipstick proteinuria testing. Through strategic leveraging of the existing surveillance and systematic referral system, longitudinal tracking of renal function may further enhance detection and effectively reduce cardiorenal complications.

Table 1
National Differences in Proteinuria Screening in Younger Adults

The United States, on the other hand, has taken a different route. Beginning in 2007, the American Academy of Pediatrics has removed routine urinalysis from the health supervision guidelines for asymptomatic children and adolescents, given the test's low sensitivity and high cost (Table). Even among adults, the cost‐effective analysis of population‐based dipstick proteinuria screening has not been demonstrated to be cost effective ($282 818 USD per quality‐adjusted life‐year with 0.0022 gain per person, incremental cost of $616) in delaying CKD progression unless selectively directed toward high‐risk (ie, elderly, adverse cardiometabolic health) groups. Although proteinuria alone cannot be attributable to CKD, the 2021 Global Burden of Diseasereports a 3.2‐fold higher CKD mortality rate in US adults aged 15 to 49 years (2.80 per 100 000) compared with that of Korean (0.87 per 100 000) or Japanese (0.68 per 100 000) adults (Figure). Such striking discrepancy merits re‐evaluating the feasibility and benefit of targeted screening and health outcomes research across diverse settings among young adults with underlying yet often underrecognized indications.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients on haemodialysis at jimma medical center, Ethiopia: a 7-year review [^115TMCWa]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study indicated that oliguria, gross hematuria, and dipstick hematuria were significantly more prevalent in patients with AKI compared to those with CKD. This finding aligns with existing literature that emphasizes the acute nature of AKI, where oliguria is a common symptom due to the kidneys' sudden inability to filter waste effectively. Hematuria is also frequently observed in AKI, especially in cases of acute glomerulonephritis, which can lead to rapid kidney dysfunction. In contrast, the significantly higher mean systolic [160mmHg (95% CI: 154–166), (± 21)] and diastolic blood pressures [93mmHg (95% CI: 89–97), (± 13)] observed in CKD patients at presentation reflect a different pathophysiological profile. This is consistent with other studies, suggesting CKD patients often present with hypertension, a significant risk factor for cardiovascular events and further renal deterioration. In this study, the average hemoglobin level was 7.82 ± 1.99 g/dL, which is far below the recommended target of 11.5–12.5 g/dL. Our findings are consistent with those of a multicenter international cohort study from Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, and the United States, which reported that anemia as a major complication of kidney failure. This is why the majority of the patients in our study, 57 (83.8%), received blood transfusions at some point.

In our study, hypertensive nephropathy was identified as the most frequently presumed cause of CKD among patients undergoing HD, accounting for 40.4% of cases. This finding is consistent with existing literature suggesting that hypertension is a leading cause of CKD, especially in resource-limited settings where early detection and management of hypertension may be inadequate. Despite a relatively young mean age of 42.7 years (± 12.78) among the patient cohort, with CKD patients averaging 45 years (± 12), hypertension remains a significant etiological factor, possibly due to the high prevalence of undiagnosed or poorly managed hypertension in the population.

The lower prevalence of diabetes-related CKD compared to hypertensive nephropathy and glomerulonephritis may reflect differences in local disease burden, healthcare access, and diagnostic practices. Additionally, the late presentation of patients for HD and limited diagnostic capabilities in our setting might contribute to a diagnostic bias toward more overtly symptomatic conditions, such as hypertension-related kidney disease. These factors likely influence the observed CKD distribution and emphasize the importance of improved hypertension screening and early intervention strategies in younger populations to prevent CKD progression.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114cVMKz]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for microhematuria, more specifically with respect to risk stratification, AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend to categorize patients presenting with microhematuria as low/negligible-, intermediate-, or high-risk for genitourinary malignancy following the initial evaluation:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Low/negligible (meeting all criteria)|- Age < 40 years for males, < 60 years for females <br/> - Never-smoker or < 10 pack-years <br/> - 3–10 RBC/hpf on a single urinalysis <br/> - No risk factors for urothelial cancer|
|Intermediate (meeting one or more criteria)|- Age 40–59 years for males, < 60 years for females <br/> - Smoking 10–30 pack-years <br/> - 11–25 RBC/hpf on a single urinalysis <br/> - Previously low/negligible-risk patient with no prior evaluation and 3–25 RBC/hpf on repeat urinalysis <br/> - Any additional risk factor for urothelial cancer (irritative LUTS, prior pelvic radiation therapy, prior cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide chemotherapy, family history of urothelial cancer or Lynch syndrome, occupational exposures to benzene chemicals or aromatic amines, such as rubber, petrochemicals, dyes, chronic indwelling foreign body in the urinary tract)|
|High (meeting one or more criteria)|- Age ≥ 60 years for males, females should not be categorized as high-risk solely based on age <br/> - > smoking > 30 pack-years <br/> - > 25 RBC/hpf on a single urinalysis <br/> - History of gross hematuria <br/> - One ore more risk factors for urothelial cancer plus any high-risk feature.|

### Triptorelin pamoate (Trelstar) [^1147m22w]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity, and angioedema related to TRELSTAR administration have been reported. In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue TRELSTAR immediately and administer the appropriate supportive and symptomatic care.

5.2 Tumor Flare

Initially, triptorelin (TRELSTAR), like other GnRH agonists, causes a transient increase in serum testosterone levels [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. As a result, worsening signs and symptoms of prostate cancer during the first weeks of treatment have been reported with GnRH agonists. Patients may experience worsening of symptoms or onset of new symptoms, including bone pain, neuropathy, hematuria, or urethral or bladder outlet obstruction.

Closely monitor patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction during the first few weeks of therapy.

5.3 Metabolic Syndrome

The use of GnRH agonists (including TRELSTAR) may lead to metabolic changes such as hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, including cirrhosis, occurred in the post-marketing setting. Hyperglycemia may represent new-onset of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with pre-existing diabetes. Monitor for changes in serum lipids, blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving TRELSTAR and manage according to institutional guidelines.

5.4 Cardiovascular Diseases

Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with the use of GnRH agonists (including TRELSTAR) in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Monitor patients receiving TRELSTAR for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and manage according to current institutional guidelines.

5.5 Convulsions

Convulsions have occurred in patients treated with GnRH analog (including TRELSTAR). These events included patients with risk factors for seizures such as a history of epilepsy, intracranial tumors or co-medication with other drugs known to present a risk of seizure reactions. Convulsions have also been reported in patients in the absence of known risk factors. Manage patients receiving TRELSTAR who experience convulsion according to institutional guidelines.

### Urotrauma guideline 2020: AUA guideline [^1118zvtF]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Bladder trauma — imaging for hematuria with pelvic fracture and cystography technique: Clinicians must perform retrograde cystography (plain film or CT) in stable patients with gross hematuria and pelvic fracture (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). Gross hematuria is the most common indicator of bladder injury, and pelvic fracture is the most common associated injury with bladder rupture; however, pelvic fracture alone does not warrant radiologic evaluation of the bladder. Bladder injury is present in 29% of the patients presenting with the combination of gross hematuria and pelvic fracture, making gross hematuria with pelvic fracture an absolute indication for retrograde cystography to evaluate for bladder injury. Retrograde cystography is the technique of choice to diagnose bladder injury, and plain film and CT cystography have similar specificity and sensitivity, with both techniques highly accurate for diagnosing bladder rupture. For plain film cystography, the technique consists of retrograde, gravity filling of the bladder with contrast, and the volume instilled should be a minimum of 300 mL or until the patient reaches tolerance in order to maximally distend the bladder.

### Evaluation of patients with microscopic hematuria… [^111CiPc6]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Family physicians often encounter patients with incidentally noted microscopic hematuria. Cohen and Brown reviewed the management of patients 18 years or older with microscopic hematuria. The definition of microscopic hematuria varies from one to more than 10 red blood cells per high-power field on urine microscopy, with trade-offs in sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing serious underlying disease. The review authors advocate a cutoff of two or more red cells per field for the diagnosis. They think that urine dipstick testing for heme may be too sensitive and nonspecific. Before work-up is pursued in an asymptomatic patient with a single instance of microscopic hematuria, the authors suggest repeat urine testing several days later, especially if vigorous exercise, menstruation, sexual activity, or urinary tract injury occurred close to the initial episode of hematuria. Urine microscopy is the first step in the evaluation of hematuria.

Acanthocytes, which are doughnut-shaped red cells with a central hole and membrane blebs attached peripherally, are more specific for an upper-tract bleeding source. The most common cause of glomerular bleeding is inherited immunoglobulin A nephropathy, followed by thin basement membrane disease and hereditary nephritis. If a glomerular source is considered unlikely, the next step in the evaluation is upper-tract imaging. The authors prefer computed tomography without contrast when urolithiasis is suspected, and computed tomographic urography when stone disease is clinically unlikely. Ultrasonography, excretory urography, or both are alternatives. These methods have lower sensitivity and specificity for detection of small renal neoplasms but are useful options if computed tomography is too expensive or unavailable. More than two thirds of patients with microscopic hematuria do not have a firm diagnosis after upper-tract imaging.

The authors suggest proceeding with cystoscopy if risk factors for bladder cancer are present. Older men and patients who smoke have increased rates of bladder cancer. Observational studies in women have had conflicting results. Urine cytology is highly specific for bladder cancer but has limited sensitivity. Sensitivity is improved by using first-morning voided specimens from three consecutive days. In many cases, complete upper- and lower-tract work-up of hematuria fails to identify a cause. No controlled studies of follow-up management have been done, but the case series available to date have not identified any occult cancers with later repetition of diagnostic studies.

### Microscopic hematuria in adults: updated recommendations from… [^114qfGMw]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Consider repeating urinalysis in women found to have microscopic hematuria associated with UTI following successful treatment.
- With microscopic hematuria in patients at low risk of cancer, performing repeat urinalysis at six months is a reasonable alternative to imaging and cystoscopy.
- Although gross hematuria is strongly associated with malignancy, microscopic hematuria is more common and has a lower malignancy risk. Initial Evaluation Initial evaluation for patients with microscopic hematuria involves searching for a likely cause to be addressed. Common causes include urinary tract infections, menstruation, external genital lesions, vaginal atrophy, pelvic organ prolapse, urolithiasis, benign prostatic enlargement, and urethral stricture. After addressing any of these issues, a repeat urinalysis should be performed.

With conditions such as prostatic hypertrophy, vaginal atrophy, and pelvic organ prolapse, microscopic hematuria may not completely resolve. In these cases, full evaluation may be warranted. Obtaining a catheter urine sample also may be helpful. Women with urologic malignancies are often treated repeatedly for UTI before cancer is diagnosed. Repeating urinalysis with microscopy after identifying hematuria associated with UTI should be considered, although this strategy has not been prospectively validated. Anticoagulation does not appear to explain microscopic hematuria, and the appropriate workup should be performed in these patients. Patients taking antithrombotic medications are more likely to be diagnosed with bladder cancer, suggesting these medications may increase bleeding from underlying malignancies.

HIGH RISK Patients at high risk have at least one high-risk factor, including age 60 years or older, more than a 30 pack-year smoking history, more than 25 RBC/HPF on microscopic urinalysis, and a history of gross hematuria. For these patients, the guideline recommends cystoscopy and computed tomography urography. Magnetic resonance urography and retrograde pyelography with renal imaging are reasonable if contrast media is contraindicated because of kidney disease or allergy. The guideline does contain an important warning: the need to consider a microscopic hematuria evaluation in patients with recurrent UTI, especially with negative culture results. About one in 10 women and one in 20 men with bladder cancer receive more than three antibiotic courses for UTI before cancer is diagnosed. Published source: J Urol. October 2020; 204: 778–786.

### Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults: summary of… [^117L3zDb]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria who are at risk for urologic disease or primary renal disease should undergo an appropriate evaluation. In patients at low risk for disease, some components of the evaluation may be deferred. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has many causes, ranging from minor incidental findings that do not require treatment to highly significant lesions that are immediately life-threatening. Therefore, hematuria has been classified into four categories: life-threatening; significant, requiring treatment; significant, requiring observation; and insignificant. In addition, interstitial renal disease, such as drug-induced interstitial disease or analgesic nephropathy, may be associated with hematuria. If systemic causes are not identified, renal biopsy is usually recommended. The laboratory analysis begins with comprehensive examination of the urine and urinary sediment. The number of red blood cells per high-power field should be determined.

In addition, the presence of dysmorphic red blood cells or red cell casts should be noted. The urine should also be tested for the presence and degree of proteinuria and for evidence of urinary tract infection. Patients with urinary tract infection should be treated appropriately, and urinalysis should be repeated six weeks after treatment. 27 If the hematuria resolves with treatment, no additional evaluation is necessary. Serum creatinine should be measured. The remaining laboratory investigation should be guided by specific findings of the history, physical examination and urinalysis. However, the advantage of CT over IVU is that CT has the highest efficacy for the range of possible underlying pathologies, and it shortens the duration of the diagnostic work-up. Additional evaluation, including repeat imaging and cystoscopy, may be warranted in patients with persistent hematuria in whom there is a high index of suspicion for significant underlying disease.

In this setting, the clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide further evaluation. Immediate urologic reevaluation, with consideration of cystoscopy, cytology or repeat imaging, should be performed if any of the following occur: gross hematuria, abnormal urinary cytology or irritative voiding symptoms in the absence of infection. If none of these occurs within three years, the patient does not require further urologic monitoring. Further evaluation for renal parenchymal disease or referral to a nephrologist should be considered if hematuria persists and hypertension, proteinuria or evidence of glomerular bleeding develops.
