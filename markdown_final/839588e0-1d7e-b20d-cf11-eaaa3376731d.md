## Question

How should molluscum contagiosum be treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how molluscum contagiosum should be treated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the natural history and whether treatment is necessary. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for each modality, distinguishing high-quality RCTs from lower-quality or conflicting data. Next, I will stratify recommendations by patient population and lesion characteristics. After that, I should integrate newly approved therapies and reconcile any conflicting guidance. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight safety, monitoring, and special scenarios like ocular involvement or immunocompromise [^816f67f5] [^1150e407].

> Let me first confirm the natural history and the default approach. Molluscum contagiosum is typically self-limited in immunocompetent hosts, with a mean time to resolution around 13 months and a substantial minority persisting beyond 18–24 months, so observation is reasonable when lesions are few, asymptomatic, and not cosmetically or socially distressing [^1150e407] [^816f67f5]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for "no treatment" as a strategy: the Cochrane review concludes that no single intervention is convincingly effective and that spontaneous resolution remains a strong option, which supports expectant management when appropriate [^816f67f5].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence for active therapies. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check which interventions have robust RCT data. VP-102 (cantharidin 0.7% in a standardized applicator) showed significantly higher complete clearance than vehicle in two phase 3 trials (about 46–54% vs 13–18%), with expected local blistering and pain but generally acceptable tolerability, and is now FDA-approved for patients aged 2 years and older [^422f85b4] [^53de76d5] [^0e8222d6]. Berdazimer gel 10.3%, a nitric oxide–releasing topical, also achieved higher complete clearance than vehicle in a large phase 3 trial (32.4% vs 19.7% at 12 weeks) with mostly mild local reactions, and is FDA-approved for patients aged 1 year and older, offering a home-applied option [^cac84ff9] [^e52d9908]. I should double-check that these are the only FDA-approved options to date — yes, VP-102 and berdazimer are the first FDA-approved treatments for molluscum [^0e8222d6] [^e52d9908].

> I will now examine mechanical therapies, but I need to be cautious about evidence quality. Curettage has high satisfaction and apparent efficacy in observational pediatric series, with 70% clearing after one treatment in a large retrospective cohort, yet prospective data show substantial failure rates and highlight risk factors like numerous lesions and atopic dermatitis, so I should not overstate certainty here [^ca325ca1] [^9755b7d8]. Cryotherapy is commonly used and may be reasonable for limited lesions, but guideline bodies cite insufficient evidence for routine recommendation in genital disease, so I should frame it as an option with limited high-quality data rather than a first-line standard [^0494db01] [^459693b4]. But wait, what if the patient has many lesions or atopy? In those settings, curettage may be less effective and more traumatic, so I should individualize and consider alternatives [^9755b7d8].

> Let me consider topical keratolytics and immunomodulators, and I should confirm the RCT signal. Potassium hydroxide 5–10% has supportive RCTs showing higher clearance than placebo in children, with 10% often better tolerated than 15%, though heterogeneity and small studies temper certainty; nonetheless, this remains a reasonable, low-cost home option when available [^161d70e9] [^620bc3b7]. Imiquimod 5% has repeatedly failed to show benefit over vehicle in high-quality RCTs and causes more local reactions, so I should avoid recommending it despite occasional guideline mentions, especially in children [^816f67f5] [^91bc9d57]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought imiquimod might help in select cases, but the Cochrane and subsequent trials consistently show no superiority, so I should correct that inclination and deprioritize imiquimod outside of research or exceptional circumstances [^816f67f5] [^91bc9d57].

> I should review other topical agents with limited or mixed evidence. Cantharidin (non–VP-102 formulations) has long-standing clinical use and observational support, but a small RCT did not show significant benefit versus placebo over 2 months, so compounded cantharidin remains off-label with variable quality and uncertain efficacy despite frequent real-world use [^ba5ad428] [^d331d62b]. Podophyllotoxin 0.5% is guideline-supported for genital lesions in immunocompetent adults, applied twice daily for 3 days with a 4-day break, repeated until clearance; it is not recommended in pregnancy and requires careful application to avoid normal skin [^669d45b9] [^3d1ab3ef]. Tea tree oil and iodine combinations have shown signal in very small RCTs, but replication is limited and they are not standard; I should mention them cautiously as investigational or adjuncts rather than first-line [^816f67f5].

> Now, I need to stratify by patient population. For immunocompetent children with nongenital disease, observation is appropriate when lesions are few and asymptomatic; if treatment is desired, VP-102 or berdazimer offer the strongest evidence-based options, with potassium hydroxide 10% as a reasonable alternative given cost and access considerations; curettage or cryotherapy can be considered for limited lesions or when rapid clearance is prioritized, acknowledging variable evidence quality [^422f85b4] [^cac84ff9] [^161d70e9] [^ca325ca1]. For immunocompetent adults with genital disease, expectant management is acceptable, but many patients prefer treatment; podophyllotoxin 0.5% is a guideline-endorsed patient-applied option, and VP-102 or berdazimer can be considered off-label for genital lesions though they were studied in nongenital disease; cryotherapy is commonly used and may be offered with counseling about limited high-quality evidence [^d44df1bf] [^669d45b9] [^459693b4] [^0494db01]. For immunocompromised patients, lesions are often numerous and persistent; restoring immune function with antiretroviral therapy is foundational, and for refractory cases, off-label options like intralesional immunotherapy or topical cidofovir may be considered in specialist hands, recognizing limited high-quality data [^205f2e20] [^b29d262d] [^d35e69a5].

> Hold on, I should verify special anatomic sites and complications. For periocular lesions causing conjunctivitis or keratitis, active removal is indicated to stop viral shedding; options include incision and curettage, excision with cautery, or cryotherapy, with careful follow-up until ocular surface disease resolves [^a1a72ec2]. For extensive or inflamed lesions, especially in atopic patients, I need to ensure eczema is treated with emollients and, if needed, mild topical corticosteroids to reduce scratching and autoinoculation, while selecting therapies that minimize trauma and scarring [^af06e886] [^c1ddfab8].

> I should double-check the role of systemic therapies. Oral cimetidine has been described as a painless, parent-administered option, particularly for young children, but high-quality evidence is limited and facial lesions respond poorly; thus, I should present it as an off-label, low-morbidity alternative when destructive procedures are undesirable, with counseling about uncertain efficacy [^44cd5f98] [^810d9fb8]. Systemic immunomodulators like interferon or oral agents lack sufficient evidence for routine use in immunocompetent patients and should be reserved for specialist-managed, refractory cases or specific immunologic contexts [^6b9b8a43].

> Next, I should review safety, tolerability, and monitoring. VP-102 commonly causes application-site vesicles, pain, and pruritus, which are expected and usually mild to moderate; repeated applications may be needed, and lesions often crust and heal without scarring when instructions are followed [^422f85b4] [^53de76d5]. Berdazimer causes application-site pain and erythema, mostly mild, and was well tolerated across ages in phase 3 trials; caregivers should be counseled on expected local reactions and adherence to daily application [^cac84ff9] [^7bfb47b7]. Curettage and cryotherapy can cause pain, dyspigmentation, and rarely scarring; technique and anesthesia choice matter, and patients with numerous lesions or atopy may fare worse, so shared decision-making is essential [^9755b7d8] [^2bd1681a].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, and I should confirm alignment with evidence. Start with education on natural history and transmission risk; if observation is chosen, set expectations for a 6–24 month course and provide return precautions for secondary infection or distressing symptoms [^1150e407]. If treatment is desired, prioritize FDA-approved options: VP-102 for patients aged 2 years and older, or berdazimer for patients aged 1 year and older, selecting based on access, lesion burden, and tolerance for local reactions; consider potassium hydroxide 10% as an alternative when approved therapies are unavailable or cost-prohibitive [^0e8222d6] [^e52d9908] [^161d70e9]. Reserve mechanical removal (curettage or cryotherapy) for limited lesions or when rapid clearance is needed, and use podophyllotoxin for genital lesions in nonpregnant adults; avoid imiquimod given lack of efficacy and higher adverse effects [^669d45b9] [^816f67f5]. Throughout, manage eczema, minimize trauma, and reassess at 4–6 week intervals to adjust the plan [^af06e886].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and balanced. No single treatment is universally superior, and spontaneous resolution remains common, so shared decision-making that incorporates lesion number, location, symptoms, psychosocial impact, and patient preferences is critical; VP-102 and berdazimer represent meaningful advances with regulatory approval and robust RCT data, while potassium hydroxide remains a reasonable, evidence-supported alternative in many settings [^816f67f5] [^422f85b4] [^cac84ff9] [^161d70e9]. I should emphasize that many historical and off-label options have limited or conflicting evidence, and that overtreatment can cause pain or scarring, reinforcing the need to match therapy to goals and context rather than a one-size-fits-all approach [^816f67f5] [^44cd5f98].

Treat molluscum contagiosum based on lesion count, location, age, and immune status, with **expectant management** as a valid option given the self-limited course [^816f67f5] [^1150e407]. For active treatment, **mechanical removal** (curettage, cryotherapy) is effective but may cause scarring; **topical agents** (cantharidin, potassium hydroxide, podophyllotoxin) are alternatives, with cantharidin 0.7% (YCANTH) now FDA-approved for patients ≥ 2 years [^422f85b4] [^0e8222d6]. Imiquimod is **not recommended** due to limited efficacy and irritation [^816f67f5] [^91bc9d57]. In immunocompromised patients, prioritize immune restoration and consider specialist options; in children, minimize pain and scarring with gentle modalities or observation [^205f2e20] [^44cd5f98].

---

## Natural history and spontaneous resolution

- **Self-limited course**: Lesions typically resolve spontaneously within 6–12 months, though persistence up to 2–4 years is not uncommon [^1150e407] [^2bd1681a].
- **Transmission risk**: Autoinoculation and person-to-person spread can prolong disease and justify treatment in some cases [^d813fed5] [^1150e407].
- **Expectant management**: Reasonable for asymptomatic, non-disfiguring lesions, especially in young children [^816f67f5] [^1150e407].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment is **considered** when:

- **Cosmetic or social concerns**: Visible lesions cause distress or stigma [^c32e9c35] [^1150e407].
- **Symptoms**: Pruritus, pain, or secondary infection are present [^c32e9c35] [^1150e407].
- **High risk of spread**: Numerous lesions, atopic dermatitis, or immunocompromise [^c32e9c35] [^1150e407].
- **Persistent lesions**: Duration > 6–12 months without resolution [^notfound].

## Treatment options

### Mechanical methods

Mechanical methods offer **rapid clearance** but may cause pain or scarring [^44cd5f98].

| **Treatment** | **Efficacy** | **Adverse effects** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Curettage | High (> 80% after 1–2 sessions) | Pain, scarring, infection | Limited lesions, older children, adults |
| Cryotherapy | Moderate–high | Pain, hypopigmentation, scarring | Limited lesions, adults |
| Laser therapy (PDL) | Moderate | Pain, scarring, cost | Refractory or extensive lesions |

---

### Topical agents

Topical agents provide **non-invasive options** with variable efficacy [^eb9d294e].

| **Treatment** | **Efficacy** | **Adverse effects** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Cantharidin 0.7% (YCANTH) | Moderate–high (46–54% clearance) | Blistering, pain, pruritus | Children ≥ 2 years, adults |
| Potassium hydroxide 5–10% | Moderate (58–64% clearance) | Irritation, burning | Children, home use |
| Podophyllotoxin 0.5% | Moderate | Irritation, ulceration | Genital lesions, adults |
| Imiquimod 5% | Limited efficacy | Irritation, erythema | Not recommended [^816f67f5] [^349ffaf5] |

---

### Systemic therapies

Systemic therapies are **reserved for extensive or refractory cases**, with limited evidence [^6b9b8a43].

- **Cimetidine**: Oral H2 antagonist with immunomodulatory effects; limited efficacy, mainly in children [^notfound].
- **Intralesional immunotherapy**: Candida antigen, interferon, or vitamin D3; emerging, moderate efficacy, specialist use [^d35e69a5].
- **Antiretroviral therapy**: Essential in HIV-associated molluscum to restore immunity [^205f2e20] [^b29d262d].

---

## Special populations

### Children

In children, **expectant management** is appropriate for mild, asymptomatic cases [^816f67f5] [^1150e407]. First-line treatments include cantharidin, potassium hydroxide, or gentle curettage; avoid imiquimod due to limited efficacy and irritation [^816f67f5] [^91bc9d57]. Minimize pain and scarring with careful technique and counseling [^44cd5f98].

---

### Immunocompromised patients

In immunocompromised patients, **immune restoration** with antiretroviral therapy or immunomodulators is foundational [^205f2e20] [^b29d262d]. Specialist-directed options include intralesional immunotherapy, topical cidofovir, or laser therapy [^d35e69a5] [^c514046d]. Expect prolonged disease and consider combination therapy [^88e0b720].

---

## Prevention of spread and recurrence

Prevention focuses on **hygiene measures** — avoiding sharing towels, clothing, or personal items; covering lesions during activities; and refraining from scratching or picking — and on **treating close contacts** when indicated to reduce household transmission [^d813fed5] [^1150e407].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Expectant management**: Valid for asymptomatic, non-disfiguring lesions [^816f67f5] [^1150e407].
- **First-line treatments**: Cantharidin 0.7% (YCANTH), potassium hydroxide 5–10%, or mechanical removal (curettage, cryotherapy) [^422f85b4] [^161d70e9].
- **Avoid**: Imiquimod due to limited efficacy and irritation [^816f67f5] [^91bc9d57].
- **Immunocompromised**: Prioritize immune restoration and specialist-directed therapies [^205f2e20] [^b29d262d].
- **Children**: Emphasize gentle, minimally scarring options or observation [^44cd5f98] [^1150e407].

---

Treatment should be **individualized** based on age, lesion burden, symptoms, and patient preference, balancing efficacy, safety, and cosmetic outcomes [^c32e9c35].

### Therapeutic approaches and special considerations for treating molluscum contagiosum [^a383fd9e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum (molluscum) is a common skin condition, especially in children, yet treatment approaches by US health care practitioners vary widely. A dearth of clinical data from large, well-controlled studies has resulted in significant gaps in knowledge, including treatment guidelines and algorithms. As of this writing, there are no FDA-approved treatments for molluscum. The objective of this review is to provide practitioners with expert, evidence-based information and guidance about treatment approaches for, and the special circumstances faced by, patients with molluscum. To this end, a group of five pediatric and adult dermatologists collectively identified treatments and special considerations they felt were most commonly used to treat molluscum. Hence, in the first part of the review, seven treatment approaches identified as the most important to review (e.g., curettage, cantharidin) are discussed in terms of their mechanisms of action, supporting clinical data, and rationale for use. Each treatment approach concludes with a &ldquo; clinical pearls&rdquo; section, which summarizes the group&rsquo; s experiences with the treatment. In the second part, five special considerations (e.g., atopic dermatitis, skin of color) are discussed with supporting clinical data and are also followed by a &ldquo; clinical pearls&rdquo; summary.

### Interventions for cutaneous molluscum contagiosum [^816f67f5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Molluscum contagiosum is a common skin infection that is caused by a pox virus and occurs mainly in children. The infection usually resolves within months in people without immune deficiency, but treatment may be preferred for social and cosmetic reasons or to avoid spreading the infection. A clear evidence base supporting the various treatments is lacking. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006, and updated previously in 2009.

Objectives

To assess the effects of specific treatments and management strategies, including waiting for natural resolution, for cutaneous, non-genital molluscum contagiosum in people without immune deficiency.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to July 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We searched six trial registers and checked the reference lists of included studies and review articles for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field to identify further relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of any treatment of molluscum contagiosum in people without immune deficiency. We excluded trials on sexually transmitted molluscum contagiosum and in people with immune deficiency (including those with HIV infection).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data from selected studies. We obtained missing data from study authors where possible.

Main Results

We found 11 new studies for this update, resulting in 22 included studies with a total of 1650 participants. The studies examined the effects of topical (20 studies) and systemic interventions (2 studies). Among the new included studies were the full trial reports of three large unpublished studies, brought to our attention by an expert in the field. They all provided moderate-quality evidence for a lack of effect of 5% imiquimod compared to vehicle (placebo) on short-term clinical cure (4 studies, 850 participants, 12 weeks after start of treatment, risk ratio (RR) 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.93), medium-term clinical cure (2 studies, 702 participants, 18 weeks after start of treatment, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.14), and long-term clinical cure (2 studies, 702 participants, 28 weeks after start of treatment, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.17). We found similar but more certain results for short-term improvement (4 studies, 850 participants, 12 weeks after start of treatment, RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.47; high-quality evidence). For the outcome 'any adverse effect', we found high-quality evidence for little or no difference between topical 5% imiquimod and vehicle (3 studies, 827 participants, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.07), but application site reactions were more frequent in the groups treated with imiquimod (moderate-quality evidence): any application site reaction (3 studies, 827 participants, RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.77, the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) was 11); severe application site reaction (3 studies, 827 participants, RR 4.33, 95% CI 1.16 to 16.19, NNTH over 40). For the following 11 comparisons, there was limited evidence to show which treatment was superior in achieving short-term clinical cure (low-quality evidence): 5% imiquimod less effective than cryospray (1 study, 74 participants, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78) and 10% potassium hydroxide (2 studies, 67 participants, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.93); 10% Australian lemon myrtle oil more effective than olive oil (1 study, 31 participants, RR 17.88, 95% CI 1.13 to 282.72); 10% benzoyl peroxide cream more effective than 0.05% tretinoin (1 study, 30 participants, RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.01 to 4.79); 5% sodium nitrite co-applied with 5% salicylic acid more effective than 5% salicylic acid alone (1 study, 30 participants, RR 3.50, 95% CI 1.23 to 9.92); and iodine plus tea tree oil more effective than tea tree oil (1 study, 37 participants, RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.57) or iodine alone (1 study, 37 participants, RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.50). Although there is some uncertainty, 10% potassium hydroxide appears to be more effective than saline (1 study, 20 participants, RR 3.50, 95% CI 0.95 to 12.90); homeopathic calcarea carbonica appears to be more effective than placebo (1 study, 20 participants, RR 5.57, 95% CI 0.93 to 33.54); 2.5% appears to be less effective than 5% solution of potassium hydroxide (1 study, 25 participants, RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.01); and 10% povidone iodine solution plus 50% salicylic acid plaster appears to be more effective than salicylic acid plaster alone (1 study, 30 participants, RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.16). We found no statistically significant differences for other comparisons (most of which addressed two different topical treatments). We found no randomised controlled trial evidence for expressing lesions or topical hydrogen peroxide. Study limitations included no blinding, many dropouts, and no intention-to-treat analysis. Except for the severe application site reactions of imiquimod, none of the evaluated treatments described above were associated with serious adverse effects (low-quality evidence). Among the most common adverse events were pain during application, erythema, and itching. Included studies of the following comparisons did not report adverse effects: calcarea carbonica versus placebo, 10% povidone iodine plus 50% salicylic acid plaster versus salicylic acid plaster, and 10% benzoyl peroxide versus 0.05% tretinoin. We were unable to judge the risk of bias in most studies due to insufficient information, especially regarding concealment of allocation and possible selective reporting. We considered five studies to be at low risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

No single intervention has been shown to be convincingly effective in the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. We found moderate-quality evidence that topical 5% imiquimod was no more effective than vehicle in terms of clinical cure, but led to more application site reactions, and high-quality evidence that there was no difference between the treatments in terms of short-term improvement. However, high-quality evidence showed a similar number of general side effects in both groups. As the evidence found did not favour any one treatment, the natural resolution of molluscum contagiosum remains a strong method for dealing with the condition.

### Molluscum contagiosum: the importance of early diagnosis and treatment [^e1fc87f3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection that is becoming an increasing problem in sexually active individuals and in patients with human immunodeficiency virus. Although molluscum contagiosum lesions are generally self-limiting, it may take 6 months to 5 years for lesions to disappear. Furthermore, patients with weakened immune systems have increased difficulty in clearing lesions; therefore lesions typically persist for prolonged periods. Although there has been continued debate about whether molluscum contagiosum lesions should be treated or allowed to resolve spontaneously, many clinicians recommend treatment of genital molluscum contagiosum lesions to reduce the risk of sexual transmission, prevent autoinoculation, and increase patient quality of life. Treatment options for molluscum contagiosum include physician-administered and patient-administered therapies. Novel patient-administered treatment options allow administration in the privacy of a patient's home, providing added convenience and reducing patient embarrassment or stress. With the novel treatment opportunities currently available or in development, physicians are able to improve patient quality of life while providing patients with a convenient, well-tolerated, easily administered treatment regimen. This review summarizes the clinical diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum and provides a critical assessment of several current and emerging treatment options.

### Interventions for cutaneous molluscum contagiosum [^d6bc62a7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Molluscum contagiosum is a common skin infection, caused by a pox virus. The infection will usually resolve within months in people with a normal immune system. Many treatments have been used for molluscum contagiosum but a clear evidence base supporting them is lacking. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 2, 2006.

Objectives

To assess the effects of management strategies (including waiting for natural resolution) for cutaneous, non-genital molluscum contagiosum in otherwise healthy people.

Search Strategy

In June 2009 we updated our searches of the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS. We also searched ongoing trials registers, reference lists, and contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We investigated randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. We excluded trials on sexually transmitted molluscum contagiosum and in people with lowered immunity (including those with HIV infection).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data from selected studies.

Main Results

Eleven studies, with a total number of 495 participants, examined the effects of topical (9 studies), systemic, and homoeopathic interventions (1 study each). Limited evidence was found for the efficacy of sodium nitrite co-applied with salicylic acid compared to salicylic acid alone (risk ratio (RR) 3.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 9.92); for Australian lemon myrtle oil compared to its vehicle, olive oil (RR 17.88, 95% CI 1.13 to 282.72); and for benzoyl peroxide cream compared to tretinoin (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.01 to 4.79). No statistically significant differences were found for 10 other comparisons, most of which addressed 2 topical treatments. Study limitations included no blinding (four studies), many dropouts (three studies), and no intention-to-treat analysis; small study sizes may have led to important differences being missed. None of the evaluated treatment options were associated with serious adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

No single intervention has been shown to be convincingly effective in the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. The update identified six new studies, most of them reporting on interventions not included in the original version. However, the conclusions of the review did not change.

### Interventions for cutaneous molluscum contagiosum [^26a776ec]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Molluscum contagiosum is a common skin infection, caused by a virus, which will usually resolve within months in people with a normal immune system. Many treatments have been promoted for molluscum contagiosum but a clear evidence base supporting them is lacking.

Objectives

To assess the effects of management strategies (including waiting for natural resolution) for cutaneous, non-genital molluscum contagiosum in healthy people.

Search Strategy

We searched the Skin Group Specialised Register (March 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2004, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1966 to March 2004), EMBASE (from 1980 to March 2004) and LILACS (from 1982 to March 2004) databases. We also searched reference lists and contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials for treatment of molluscum contagiosum were investigated. Trials on sexually transmitted molluscum contagiosum and in people with lowered immunity (including those with HIV infection) were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection and assessment of methodological quality were carried out by two independent authors. As similar comparisons between two interventions were not made in more than one study, statistical pooling was not performed.

Main Results

Five studies, with a total number of 137 participants, examined the effects of topical (three studies), systemic and homoeopathic interventions (one study each). Limited evidence was found for sodium nitrite co-applied with salicylic acid compared to salicylic acid alone (risk ratio (RR) 3.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 9.92). No statistically significant differences were found for topical povidone iodine plus salicylic acid compared to povidone iodine alone (RR of cure 1.67, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.41) or compared to salicylic acid alone. Also no statistically significant differences were found for potassium hydroxide compared to placebo; systemic treatment with cimetidine versus placebo or systemic treatment with calcarea carbonica, a homoeopathic drug, versus placebo (RR 5.57, 95% CI 0.93 to 33.54). Study limitations included no blinding (two studies), many dropouts (three studies) and no intention-to-treat analysis (two studies); small study sizes may have led to important differences being missed. None of the evaluated treatment options were associated with serious adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

No single intervention has been shown to be convincingly effective in treating molluscum contagiosum.

Clinical Question

How effective and safe are treatments for nongenital molluscum contagiosum in persons without immune deficiency?

Bottom Line

Compared with placebo, imiquimod, 5%, cream was not more effective in clearing molluscum contagiosum and caused more local adverse effects, including application site reactions, in children aged 2 to 12 years; because high-quality evidence for other interventions is lacking, allowing for natural resolution of the infection remains a reasonable approach.

### Pulsed dye laser therapy for molluscum contagiosum: a systematic review [^1c3804d2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a benign contagious viral skin infection that typically resolves without treatment within months. For cases where treatment is recommended or requested, a number of options are available. Over the last 2 decades, a number of case reports and case series have described cases of MC lesions that were successfully treated with pulsed dye laser (PDL); however, a review of these studies has not been reported in the dermatologic literature.

Objectives

To review the use of PDL for the treatment of MC.

Materials and Methods

A search of the National Library of Medicine's PubMed Database and the SCOPUS Database was performed to find articles that detailed the treatment of MC with PDL.

Results

Eight articles met criteria for inclusion in this review. These articles represented 161 patients with over 4200 MC lesions that were treated with PDL. Each article was reviewed and summarized in a table.

Limitations

The main limitation of this review is the small number of published studies, which reflects the importance of this review of the dermatology literature.

Conclusions

PDL offers a novel and effective treatment for MC. However, the articles reviewed herein suggest PDL is a safe, effective, quick and well-tolerated treatment for clearing MC lesions that does not cause scarring or permanent pigment change.

### Clinical overview of molluscum contagiosum… [^44cd5f98]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment and recovery The lesions caused by molluscum are usually benign and resolve without scarring if left alone. Trying to remove lesions by scraping and scooping increases the risk of scarring and is not recommended for otherwise healthy people. Physical removal Physical removal such as cryotherapy, curettage and laser therapy require a trained healthcare provider and often local anesthesia. These procedures can result in post-procedural pain, irritation, and scarring. Oral therapy Gradual removal of lesions may be achieved by oral therapy with cimetidine. This option is often preferred for pediatric patients because:

- It is less painful.
- Parents can administer it at home.
- It has less chance of leaving scars. While cimetidine is safe, painless, and well tolerated, facial mollusca do not respond as well as lesions elsewhere on the body. In patients with facial mollusca, consider other treatment options, such as topical therapy.

Topical therapy There are a number of topical treatments that are available for molluscum infections. These treatments must be prescribed by a healthcare professional. Podophyllotoxin cream is a reliable home therapy for women who are not pregnant. Each lesion must be treated individually as the therapeutic effect is localized. It is not recommended during pregnancy due to the potential risk to the fetus. Other options for topical therapy include iodine and salicylic acid, potassium hydroxide and tretinoin. Another therapy, the blistering agent cantharidin, is available but must be applied in a healthcare provider's office. Imiquimod is available for adults. It has not been proven effective in children and is not recommended for children due to possible adverse events. Therapy for immunocompromised people Patients with HIV/AIDS or other immunosuppressing conditions often do not respond to traditional treatments.

Thus far, the most effective therapy for immunocompromised people who have molluscum are those that boost their immune systems. In extreme cases, intralesional interferon has been used to treat facial lesions in these patients. However, interferon can cause severe and unpleasant side effects. These side effects make interferon a less desirable treatment. Radiation therapy is also of little benefit.

### Treatment options… [^33292cfe]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Be aware that some treatments available through the internet may not be effective and may even be harmful. Physical removal Physical removal of lesions may include cryotherapy, curettage, and laser therapy. These options are rapid and require a trained health care provider, may require local anesthesia, and can result in post-procedural pain, irritation, and scarring. Oral therapy Gradual removal of lesions may be achieved by oral therapy. This technique is often desirable for pediatric patients because it is generally less painful and may be performed by parents at home in a less threatening environment. Oral cimetidine has been used as an alternative treatment for small children who are either afraid of the pain associated with cryotherapy, curettage, and laser therapy or because the possibility of scarring is to be avoided.

While cimetidine is safe, painless, and well tolerated, facial mollusca do not respond as well as lesions elsewhere on the body. Topical therapy YCANTH topical solution, 0. 7%, is the only FDA approved treatment of molluscum. It is a topical chemical treatment approved for use in adults and children ages 2 and older and must be administered by a health care professional. Podophyllotoxin cream is reliable as a home therapy for adults but is not recommended for pregnant women because of presumed toxicity to the fetus. Each lesion must be treated individually as the therapeutic effect is localized. Other options for topical therapy include iodine and salicylic acid, potassium hydroxide, tretinoin, and imiquimod. Imiquimod has not been proven effective for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum in children and is not recommended for children due to possible adverse events. These treatments must be prescribed by a health care professional.

Low CD4 cell counts have been linked to widespread facial mollusca and therefore have become a marker for severe HIV disease. Thus far, therapies targeted at boosting the immune system have proven the most effective therapy for molluscum contagiosum in immunocompromised persons. In extreme cases, intralesional interferon has been used to treat facial lesions in these patients.

### To treat molluscum contagiosum or not-curettage: an effective, well-accepted treatment modality [^ca325ca1]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a common viral disease primarily affecting children. The objective was to compare the effectiveness of curettage as a treatment modality for MC with no treatment.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of 2,022 children with MC between 2008 and 2012. Epidemiologic, clinical, and treatment data, including effectiveness, safety, and satisfaction, were reviewed.

Results

Fifty-six percent of the children were 2 to 5 years of age. The duration of the infection was 1 to 2 years for 51%, less than 1 year for 32%, and more than 2 years for 17% of the children. Seventy percent of the children were self-referrals; 86% had had a previous examination and 76% of those had been advised not to treat the infection. The disease was mild (22%), moderate (64%), or severe (14%). A total of 1,879 patients underwent curettage; 70% were cured after one treatment and 26% after two treatments. Satisfaction was high: 97% of children and parents.

Conclusion

Active treatment should be offered despite the fact that MC is self-limiting. Curettage in an appropriate setting is very effective, with high patient satisfaction and fast cure rates.

### Modified curettage technique for molluscum contagiosum [^0f0a093d]. Pediatric Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum is a frequently occurring, virally induced cutaneous condition that affects infants, children, and adults. Although historically considered a self-limiting entity, many patients experience prolonged infections, often resistant to varied therapeutic interventions. Topical treatments achieve complete clearance in only a limited number of patients. Because of the associated pain, affected children are characteristically uncompliant to commonly used destructive modalities. We describe a modification of the traditional curettage technique to remove lesions of molluscum contagiosum, which has proven to be effective and well tolerated by a significant number of patients in our practice.

### A prospective randomized trial comparing the efficacy and adverse effects of four recognized treatments of molluscum contagiosum in children [^107bd7cd]. Pediatric Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum is a common viral disease of childhood presenting as small, firm, dome-shaped umbilicated papules. Although benign and generally self-limited, this condition is contagious and can lead to complications such as inflammation, pruritus, dermatitis, bacterial superinfection, and scars. No consensus has been established concerning the management of this condition. We conducted a prospective randomized study comparing four common treatments for molluscum contagiosum in 124 children aged 1 to 18 years. One group was treated with curettage, a second with cantharidin, a third with a combination of salicylic acid and lactic acid, and a fourth with imiquimod. Patients needing, respectively, one, two, or three visits for treatment of their mollusca were: 80.6%, 16.1%, and 3.2% for curettage, 36.7%, 43.3%, and 20.0% for cantharidin, 53.6%, 46.4%, and 0% for salicylic acid and glycolic acid, and 55.2%, 41.4%, and 3.4% for imiquimod. The rate of side effects was 4.7% for group 1, 18.6% for group 2, 53.5% for group 3, and 23.3% for group 4. Curettage was found to be the most efficacious treatment and had the lowest rate of side effects. It must be performed with adequate anesthesia and is a time-consuming procedure. Cantharidin is a useful bloodless alternative particularly in the office setting, but has moderate complications due to blisters and necessitated more visits in our experience. The topical keratolytic used was too irritating for children. Topical imiquimod holds promise but the optimum treatment schedule has yet to be determined. Finally, we believe that the ideal treatment for mollusca depends on the individual patient preference, fear, and financial status, distance from the office, and whether they have dermatitis or blood-borne infections.

### Therapy of external anogenital warts and molluscum contagiosum: a literature review [^e5847369]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Anogenital warts and mollusca contagiosum are virally induced, benign skin tumors for which there is no single preferable therapy. Treatments include physical and chemical destruction, surgical removal, and biological response modifiers to enhance the natural immune response. The choice of therapy is an art, and depends upon patient preference, finances, number of lesions, and lesional morphology. However, the therapy of these lesions can sometimes be very painful and expensive, and therapy should not be worse than the disease.

Many over-the-counter (OTC) products are marketed to treat molluscum contagiosum, a common childhood viral infection with an estimated point prevalence of 5%-11%. As optimal treatment has not been defined, a comprehensive internet search was performed to identify OTC products marketed for treating molluscum and to collect information on packaging, ingredients, application instructions, and dosing. Nine OTC products were identified and varied widely in cost, packaging size, and ingredients; six of the nine products contained Thuja occidentalis. Overall, the majority of OTC package labels do not include sufficient information about their plant-based ingredients or appropriate dosing.

### Efficacy of topical treatments for molluscum contagiosum in randomized controlled trials [^eb9d294e]. Clinics in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a common infectious dermatosis that is self-resolving, treatment can diminish discomfort and decrease the risk of autoinoculation and infection to others, because it is transmitted through direct skin contact. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of topical treatments for MC. A PubMed search following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines was performed to find randomized, controlled trials of MC treatment. The search yielded 129 publications, but only 15 studies published between 1994 and 2020 were found to fit the inclusion criteria. Treatment modalities included podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, sodium nitrite, myrtle leaf extract, phenol, Salatac Gel (salicylic acid with lactic acid), potassium hydroxide, cantharidin, SB206, and VP-102. Outcomes were extracted from the literature, and subsequent quality and risk of bias assessments were performed. All treatments were more efficacious than the control except cantharidin, potassium hydroxide, and imiquimod, which had varying degrees of efficacy throughout studies. Overall, studies were of sufficient quality and had low risk of bias, but they had small sample sizes and lacked adequate explanation of statistical analysis. Current first-line treatment entails mechanical methods such as cryotherapy and curettage, which may be frightening to children with MC, so the development and assessment of topical treatments allows for alternative efficacious techniques.

Introduction

Molluscum contagiosum (molluscum) is a common cutaneous infection caused by a DNA poxvirus that primarily affects children. The molluscum contagiosum virus is trophic to epidermal keratinocytes, where it replicates, forming hyperplastic epithelial cells organized into focal lesions. The period from inoculation to presentation of lesions on the epithelial surface has been estimated at 2–8 weeks.

With a prevalence of 5.1–11.5% in children aged 0–16 years, molluscum accounts for roughly 1% of all diagnosed skin disorders and ranks in the top 50 most common causes of disease. Molluscum is the third most common viral skin infection, behind herpes simplex virus and human papilloma virus, in children and one of the five most prevalent skin diseases worldwide but may be under-recognized. Atopic dermatitis (AD), immune deficiency, and sexual activity are additional risk factors. Patients with AD or a family history of atopy are at higher risk for molluscum infection, and the virus can also trigger the onset of AD and/or AD flares.

Molluscum is easily transmitted to other individuals. A reported 42% of pediatric patients spread the disease to a sibling. Molluscum spreads to other skin sites via autoinoculation and to other people via skin-to-skin contact, co-bathing, or via fomites.

Molluscum is often described as benign and self-limited following acquisition of host immunity. However, the average duration of infection in untreated children aged 4–15 years was 13.3 months in the largest cohort study in the UK, including 306 patients. At 24 months, 13% of cases remained unresolved.

Treatment guidelines for molluscum have not been established. A 2003 survey of US physicians across specialties found that practices and preferences for the treatment of molluscum varied widely. No medications for this condition have yet been approved by the US FDA. Many clinicians recommend mechanical or pharmacologic methods not approved by the FDA for molluscum or an "active nonintervention" approach to allow for eventual spontaneous resolution. Active treatment is most often recommended to alleviate symptoms, minimize autoinoculation and transmission to others, improve cosmetic appearance, and prevent scarring.

### Cantharidin for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum: a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial [^ba5ad428]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Our aim was to study the effects and safety of cantharidin in the treatment of molluscum contagiosum (MC), we conducted a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical cantharidin for treatment of pediatric MC in an academic ambulatory care center. Twenty-nine children aged 5–10 with a diagnosis of MC were enrolled to receive treatment with cantharidin or placebo. The main outcome measure was complete clearance of all molluscum lesions. In contrast to previous retrospective observational studies, the performance of cantharidin treatment over 2 months was not substantially better than the performance of placebo. The scope of follow-up was limited to five visits over 2 months of treatment. A longer follow-up period might have captured a greater effect of cantharidin. Over a 2 month period, the magnitude of the cantharidin treatment effects in the target population are, at best, not large. This study provided objective unbiased estimates of the magnitude of cantharidin treatment effects and provided important prospective safety data. Our subjects experienced minimal side effects when treated with cantharidin.

### Treatment of molluscum contagiosum with imiquimod in the United States: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^e765faed]. Pediatric Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Since there are concerns that imiquimod is being overprescribed for children with molluscum despite its limited efficacy, we used data from two nationally representative surveys to determine the rate at which imiquimod was being prescribed for molluscum contagiosum in the United States. From 1999–2010, there were an estimated 6.4 million visits for molluscum (95% CI: 5.5, 7.3 million), and imiquimod was prescribed at 7.0% of these visits (95% CI: 3.4, 11). Given the low frequency of patients being treated with imiquimod for molluscum, the concerns of its overuse may be unfounded.

### Curettage treatment for molluscum contagiosum: a follow-up survey study [^9755b7d8]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Although curettage is commonly used to treat molluscum contagiosum, prospective studies on its effectiveness are lacking.

Objectives

To evaluate prospectively the efficacy of curettage in the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and to identify the risk factors associated with treatment failure.

Methods

A systematic 2-month follow-up survey study was carried out on 73 patients treated by curettage for molluscum contagiosum.

Results

Treatment of molluscum contagiosum by curettage was associated with a high risk of treatment failure at week 4 (42/64, 66%) and at week 8 (25/55, 45%). Risk factors for treatment failure at week 4 and 8 were the number of lesions at day 0 (P < 0.001), the number of involved anatomical sites (P < 0.001) and concomitant atopic dermatitis (P = 0.038 and P < 0.001, at weeks 4 and 8, respectively).

Conclusions

The main risk factor for treatment failure is lesion number, underlining the importance of the early detection of the lesions or, alternatively, emphasizing the need for therapeutic options other than curettage in patients with numerous lesions.

### Efficacy and safety of topical nitric oxide-releasing berdazimer gel in patients with molluscum contagiosum: a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^231a12ee]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a common, persistent, and highly contagious skin infection caused by the molluscipoxvirus. It affects approximately 6 million people in the US annually, with the greatest incidence among children 1 to 14 years of age. Molluscipoxvirus exclusively infects humans, and it replicates in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes. The virus infects only the epidermis after contact with infected people or virus-contaminated objects. Once infected, keratinocyte proliferation manifests as the round, skin-colored to red papules with a central, umbilicated viral core characterized by hyalinized, aggregated molluscum bodies (Henderson-Paterson bodies) in the keratinocyte cytoplasm. Molluscum contagiosum proteins evade host immunity, which may contribute to virus' persistence.

Molluscum contagiosum infection is usually self-limited, yet may persist for months to years, generating a substantial health care burden and quality-of-life concerns necessitating therapeutic intervention. Treatment may also be warranted because of its highly contagious nature and concern for infecting peers or household members. Additionally, outwardly visible lesions may be associated with discomfort and psychosocial stigma, and may scar after resolution. In patients with underlying atopic dermatitis, MC lesions may be more widespread, persistent, and prone to infection. There are currently no therapeutic treatments approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for MC. Treatment options include in-office, clinician-administered physical procedures (eg, physical ablation of lesions by curettage or cryotherapy) or chemical destruction using topically applied cantharidin. These therapies may require multiple clinic visits and may be painful. Off-label prescriptions (eg, tretinoin, imiquimod, and over-the-counter products) also may be used but have not been proven to be efficacious against MC.

### Infectious diseases associated with organized sports and outbreak control [^2bd1681a]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Management of molluscum contagiosum outbreaks — time course and therapies. Resolution of uncomplicated molluscum contagiosum typically occurs spontaneously in 6 to 12 months, though complete lesion resolution can take up to 4 years. When treatment is desired, 10% potassium hydroxide and cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen have been used and appear to have similar efficacy in children, but cryotherapy may be associated with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or, uncommonly, scarring. Imiquimod was not shown to be of benefit compared with placebo in randomized controlled trials. Cantharidin can be effective in open-label and observational studies; however, in 1 small randomized controlled trial of 29 patients, improvement versus placebo was not statistically significant.

This comprehensive review article gives an up-to-date assessment of the therapeutic landscape for warts and molluscum contagiosum (MC), focusing on advances made in the last 5 years. New treatment choices include VP-102 (Ycanth) for molluscum contagiosum, potentially intralesional Vitamin D3 for warts, and topical cidofovir for both. Immunotherapy is regarded as a potential option, especially in difficult situations. Traditional therapies like cryotherapy and keratolytic medicines remain the principal options. The study emphasizes the need for personalized treatment strategies and additional research to improve therapy efficacy and safety.

### Berdazimer gel for molluscum contagiosum: an integrated analysis of 3 randomized controlled trials [^7bfb47b7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

An out-of-office therapeutic agent indicated for molluscum contagiosum is needed.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of berdazimer gel, 10.3% (a topical, antiviral, nitric oxide-releasing medication) versus vehicle.

Methods

Berdazimer gel, 10.3% or vehicle was applied once daily to all molluscum contagiosum lesions for 12 weeks in patients ≥ 6 months with 3–70 mollusca. Efficacy assessment: complete lesion clearance and partial clearance at week 12. Safety and tolerability assessment: adverse events through week 24 and local skin reactions through week 12.

Results

There were 1598 patients enrolled (n = 917 berdazimer, n = 681 vehicle). Berdazimer was superior to vehicle at week 12 in complete clearance rates, 30.0% versus 19.8% (odds ratio, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.38–2.23, P < .001). Subgroup analyses of primary efficacy showed consistent favorable efficacy for berdazimer across most subgroups, including age, sex, baseline lesion count, and disease duration. Berdazimer provided favorable outcome for partial clearance. Application-site pain (18.7% vs 4.8% in berdazimer vs vehicle) and erythema (11.7% vs 1.3%), mostly mild to moderate, were the most common local skin reactions.

Limitations

Berdazimer sodium in molluscum patients with lesions (B-SIMPLE) trials enrolled only US patients; no efficacy assessments beyond week 12.

Conclusions

Berdazimer gel, 10.3% showed favorable efficacy and safety across subgroups.

### Molluscum contagiosum and warts [^2c6db36d]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum and warts are benign epidermal eruptions resulting from viral infections of the skin. Molluscum contagiosum eruptions are usually self-limited and without sequelae, although they can be more extensive in immunocompromised persons. Spontaneous disappearance of lesions is the norm, but treatment by local destruction (curettage, cryotherapy, or trichloroacetic acid) or immunologic modulation can shorten the disease course, possibly reducing autoinoculation and transmission. Warts result from a hyperkeratotic reaction to human papillomavirus infection; nongenital warts are classified as common, periungual, flat, filiform, or plantar, based on location and shape. Warts are treated by local destruction (acids, cryotherapy, electrodesiccation-curettage), chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. The choice of treatment varies with the age and wishes of the patient, the potential side effects of the treatment, and the location of the lesions.

### Efficacy and safety of topical cantharidin treatment for molluscum contagiosum and warts: a systematic review [^d331d62b]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Topical cantharidin is routinely used for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and warts. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the efficacy and safety of topical cantharidin treatment for molluscum contagiosum and warts.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of studies assessing topical cantharidin treatment of molluscum contagiosum or warts. We searched the databases of Cochrane, EMBASE, GREAT, LILACS, MEDLINE, and Scopus. Two authors performed the study selection and data extraction.

Results

Twenty studies (1958–2018) met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Twelve studies assessed warts, and eight studies assessed molluscum contagiosum. Overall, 1752 patients were included (range 0.3–62 years; specified in 15 studies). Clearance rates with topical cantharidin for molluscum contagiosum were variable (range 15.4–100%). Significant clearance of warts with maintenance of clearance was demonstrated with topical cantharidin alone. Topical cantharidin in combination with podophyllotoxin and salicylic acid demonstrated efficacy for plantar warts (pediatric and adult; clearance rate range 81–100%; four studies had 100% clearance), with the majority clearing after a single treatment. Satisfaction with cantharidin therapy was high, especially in molluscum contagiosum. Pain (7–85.7%), blistering (10–100%), and hyper-/hypopigmentation (1.8–53.3%) were the most commonly occurring adverse effects with cantharidin treatment.

Conclusion

Topical cantharidin demonstrated clearance of warts, particularly in combination with podophyllotixin and salicylic acid, and modest benefit for pediatric molluscum contagiosum with good tolerability and safety.

### Molluscum contagiosum: report of one case with overview [^d534bb52]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum is a common skin and mucosal disease of viral origin, caused by molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) virus of poxvirus family. With the eradication of smallpox, MCV is now the only member of the poxvirus family that causes substantial disease in humans. Though frequently reported, its unusual clinical presentation makes its diagnosis a challenging task. We discuss a case of molluscum contagiosum in a 30-year-old woman along with a review of aetiology, histopathology and different possible treatment modalities.

### Intralesional immunotherapy for molluscum contagiosum: a review [^d35e69a5]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a common cutaneous viral infection with no standard treatment. The virus responsible for MC is thought to be cleared by cell mediated immunity (CMI). Intralesional immunotherapy that stimulates CMI has been shown to be an effective treatment for other cutaneous viruses. In this review, we evaluate the efficacy and safety of intralesional immunotherapy in the treatment of MC. Articles met inclusion criteria if they examined the effects of intralesional immunotherapy as a treatment for MC, with a clear outcome and reproducible methodology. 228 studies were screened and 10 studies met criteria for inclusion. Intralesional immunotherapies investigated included candida, combined measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, tuberculin purified protein derivative, vitamin D3, interferon α, and Streptococcal substrain OK-432. Studies demonstrated clearance of MC lesions following intralesional immunotherapy, with complete response rates between 36% and 100%. No serious adverse effects were noted. Intralesional immunotherapy is a safe and effective treatment option for MC in pediatric and adult patients.

### Cantharidin: its role in dermatology revisited [^dc68bcbe]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Dermatologists have been using cantharidin as a vesicant for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and warts since the 1950s. In experienced hands, treatment with cantharidin is safe, effective, and rarely associated with significant complications. There are varying methods of application and treatment regimens among practitioners; a consensus standard of care has yet to be established. This article provides an overview of cantharidin and its role in dermatology with an emphasis on mechanism of action, adverse effects, limitations of use, and how it compares with alternative treatment options. Instructions for topical application and other important considerations surrounding its use are also discussed.

### Beetle juice: a guide for the use of cantharidin in the treatment of molluscum contagiosum [^7719e111]. Dermatologic Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is an increasingly common cutaneous viral infection that primarily affects the pediatric population. MC lesions are benign, and most cases resolve within 6–9 months. Nonetheless, many patients and their parents seek active treatment of MC because of local pain, pruritus, embarrassment due to the lesions, or desire to reduce transmission to siblings. Individuals with atopic dermatitis are predisposed to severe and protracted MC, and immunocompromised patients may never clear the infection without treatment. Despite the availability of various therapies, no clear best treatment for MC has emerged. Cantharidin is a commonly used and effective therapy for MC that is generally well tolerated and has high rates of parental satisfaction. In this review, current literature regarding MC is summarized and particular focus is placed on the use of cantharidin for treating MC, including a review of the literature and detailed instructions for its use.

### Safety and efficacy of VP-102, a proprietary, drug-device combination product containing cantharidin, 0.7% (w / V), in children and adults with molluscum contagiosum: two phase 3 randomized clinical trials [^422f85b4]. JAMA Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the efficacy and safety of VP-102, a drug-device combination containing cantharidin, 0.7% (w/v), in individuals aged 2 years or older with molluscum contagiosum compared with vehicle?

Findings

In 2 identical phase 3 trials (Cantharidin Application in Molluscum Patients [CAMP-1 and CAMP-2]) with a total of 582 participants, topical application of VP-102 or vehicle every 21 days for a maximum of 4 treatments resulted in complete lesion clearance rates of 46.3% (CAMP-1) and 54.0% (CAMP-2) with VP-102 vs 18% (CAMP-1) and 13% (CAMP-2) with the vehicle. The most common adverse events were primarily mild to moderate and included application site vesicles, pain, and pruritus.

Meaning

The findings of these trials support the efficacy and safety of a proprietary cantharidin-based drug-device combination for treatment of molluscum contagiosum in children and adults.

### Pooled results of two randomized phase III trials evaluating VP-102, a drug-device combination product containing cantharidin 0.7% (w / V) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum [^65fbd290]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The CAMP trials were the first large vehicle-controlled studies using VP-102, a drug–device combination product containing a consistent formulation of cantharidin (0.7% w/v) in an applicator that allows for precise treatment for molluscum lesions through a uniform application and dosing schedule. The pooled results of the CAMP studies provide robust efficacy and safety data that support the use of VP-102 for the treatment of molluscum in patients aged ≥ 2 years and may assist healthcare professionals and caregivers with expectations of treatment outcomes.

### Efficacy and safety of topical application of 15% and 10% potassium hydroxide for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum [^161d70e9]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Molluscum contagiosum is the most common skin infection in children. One topical treatment used for Molluscum contagiosum is potassium hydroxide. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of potassium hydroxide topical treatment at different concentrations with that of placebo in terms of complete clearing of Molluscum contagiosum lesions and to assess the safety and tolerance of potassium hydroxide topical treatment.

Methods

This was a double-blind randomized clinical trial of three treatments (potassium hydroxide 10%, potassium hydroxide 15%, placebo) applied once daily up to complete clearing of lesions (maximum duration 60 days) in 53 children aged 2–6 years in primary health care pediatric offices in Catalonia, Spain.

Results

In the intention-to-treat analysis, potassium hydroxide 10% (58.8%, P = 0.03) and potassium hydroxide 15% (64.3%, P = 0.02) had efficacy superior to that of placebo (18.8%). The number of Molluscum contagiosum lesions was significantly reduced with potassium hydroxide 10% and 15%. The main efficacy outcome was achieved in 58.8% of children in the potassium hydroxide 10% group (P = 0.03 vs placebo) and in 64.3% of children in the potassium hydroxide 15% group (P = 0.02 vs placebo). Potassium hydroxide 10% and 15% were not significantly different in efficacy from each other. Potassium hydroxide 10% and placebo were better tolerated than potassium hydroxide 15%. No adverse events were reported during the study period.

Conclusions

Potassium hydroxide 10% and 15% demonstrated high rates of efficacy in clearing Molluscum contagiosum lesions, with potassium hydroxide 10% being better tolerated.

### Epidemiology and impact of childhood molluscum contagiosum: a case series and critical review of the literature [^468895c8]. Pediatric Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Parents of 30 children with clinically diagnosed molluscum contagiosum were surveyed to assess their perception of the condition, its treatment, its impact on their everyday lives, and on the children themselves. Among parents, 82% reported that molluscum contagiosum concerned them moderately or greatly. Concerns focused on physical issues associated with the infection, such as scarring, itching, chance of spread to peers, pain, and the effects of treatments. Quality of life was not affected. Molluscum contagiosum was most common among school-age children. Eighteen of 29 respondents swam in public pools, a common activity in children of this age. All epidemiologic studies of molluscum contagiosum in otherwise healthy individuals, published since 1966, have been critically reviewed herein. The review confirms an association between swimming pool use and molluscum contagiosum. Age, living in close proximity, skin-to-skin contact, sharing of fomites, and residence in tropical climates were also associated with higher rates of infection while sex, seasonality, and hygiene showed no such association.

### Clinical overview of molluscum contagiosum… [^810d9fb8]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment and recovery The lesions caused by molluscum are usually benign and resolve without scarring if left alone. Trying to remove lesions by scraping and scooping increases the risk of scarring and is not recommended for otherwise healthy people. Physical removal Physical removal such as cryotherapy, curettage and laser therapy require a trained healthcare provider and often local anesthesia. These procedures can result in post-procedural pain, irritation, and scarring. Oral therapy Gradual removal of lesions may be achieved by oral therapy with cimetidine. This option is often preferred for pediatric patients because:

- It is less painful.
- Parents can administer it at home.
- It has less chance of leaving scars. While cimetidine is safe, painless, and well tolerated, facial mollusca do not respond as well as lesions elsewhere on the body. In patients with facial mollusca, consider other treatment options, such as topical therapy.

Topical therapy There are a number of topical treatments that are available for molluscum infections. These treatments must be prescribed by a healthcare professional. Podophyllotoxin cream is a reliable home therapy for women who are not pregnant. Each lesion must be treated individually as the therapeutic effect is localized. It is not recommended during pregnancy due to the potential risk to the fetus. Other options for topical therapy include iodine and salicylic acid, potassium hydroxide and tretinoin. Another therapy, the blistering agent cantharidin, is available but must be applied in a healthcare provider's office. Imiquimod is available for adults. It has not been proven effective in children and is not recommended for children due to possible adverse events. Therapy for immunocompromised people Patients with HIV/AIDS or other immunosuppressing conditions often do not respond to traditional treatments.

Thus far, the most effective therapy for immunocompromised people who have molluscum are those that boost their immune systems. In extreme cases, intralesional interferon has been used to treat facial lesions in these patients. However, interferon can cause severe and unpleasant side effects. These side effects make interferon a less desirable treatment. Radiation therapy is also of little benefit.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^a1a72ec2]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum — ocular surface disease: Conjunctivitis and keratitis from molluscum contagiosum are due to viral shedding from the eyelid lesion(s) onto the surface of the eye. Molluscum lesions may spontaneously resolve, but they can also persist for months to years. Treatment to remove the lesions is indicated in symptomatic patients, with options including incision and curettage (aggressive enough to cause bleeding), simple excision, excision and cautery, and cryotherapy. In patients with multiple lesions, care should be taken to identify and treat nascent lesions in order to reduce the risk of recurrence, but reduction of the viral load often allows the host immunologic response to eliminate residual virus. The conjunctivitis may require weeks to resolve after elimination of the lesion. In adults, large and multiple molluscum lesions with relatively little conjunctival inflammation may indicate an immunocompromised state. Follow-up is not usually necessary unless the conjunctivitis persists, and referral to a dermatologist may be necessary for examination of other suspicious lesions.

### Efficacy and safety of topical nitric oxide-releasing berdazimer gel in patients with molluscum contagiosum: a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^90eb215f]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

This phase 3 randomized clinical trial of berdazimer, 10.3%, found that this topical, once-daily, nitric oxide−releasing medication may be a novel approach to MC treatment. To date, the B-SIMPLE4 is the largest randomized clinical trial of a medication for MC treatment to our knowledge, and it demonstrated the efficacy and safety of berdazimer in patients 6 months and older. Berdazimer is under consideration as a first-in-class therapeutic agent for MC and may provide a topical prescription alternative to other therapies used for this highly contagious and psychosocially challenging skin condition.

Introduction

Molluscum contagiosum (MC), a common, highly contagious viral skin infection caused by the molluscipoxvirus, replicates only in human skin cells and has the unique ability to produce proteins that enable the virus to evade the host's immune surveillance system. Molluscum contagiosum manifests as clusters of small raised firm bumps on infected skin and is especially common in younger children. Molluscum contagiosum lesions may be widespread, affecting sensitive body areas, causing pain, irritation, and redness, and if scratched, autoinoculation and heightened communicability. Molluscum contagiosum infections may clear without treatment yet can persist for months or years. Indeed, prolonged duration and visibility of MC lesions coupled with the potential to spread the virus can create psychosocial distress and anxiety for both the patient and caregiver.

Currently, there is lack of consensus regarding treatment approaches to MC and there is no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription medication. Therefore, many healthcare providers take a watch-and-wait strategy with an estimated 74% of patients with MC left untreated. It is unknown what impact the lack of a MC therapeutic intervention has on patient/caregiver physical and/or psychosocial well-being.

Berdazimer gel, 10.3% (SB206) is a novel, topical, nitric oxide-releasing agent under investigation as a first-in-class therapy for the treatment of MC. The B erdazimer S odium I n M olluscum P atients with Le sions (B-SIMPLE4) pivotal phase III trial of berdazimer gel, 10.3% (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04535531) enrolled the largest-ever cohort of patients with MC in a clinical trial (N = 891) with the results showing favorable efficacy and tolerability.

Relationship between time to resolution and filaggrin (FLG) mutations. Data were analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis test, p = 0.62.

Figure 3 shows the time to resolution of MC for each treatment modality. There were significant differences between treatment modalities and time to resolution of MC (p < 0.01). Participants who had a curettage at the first visit had the highest proportion of resolution within 2 weeks. For treatments other than curettage, the most common time to resolution was 2 weeks to 1 month. For "no treatment", the most common time to resolution was 6 months to 1 year. Figure S3 shows the reasons for choosing curettage among participants who underwent the procedure. "Physician's recommendation" was the most common reason for both the first and second or subsequent curettage (84.1% and 60.0% respectively). "Due to increased MC lesions" and "not cured by the first treatment" were more common for curettage at the second or subsequent visit, compared with curettage at the first visit. "Nurseries/schools encouraged to remove" was a reason given by 8% of those who underwent curettage as a first treatment. More than 20% of those who underwent curettage both at the first visit and at the second or subsequent visit gave a reason for curettage as "Told MC needs to be removed to get into the pool" (21.0% and 25.6% respectively). Figure S4 shows the treatment desired by the caregivers of participants who underwent treatment. Curettage was selected by 21.7%, followed by salicylic acid (13.7%), and no treatment (6.7%). "No specific preference" was the most common response (36.6%).

1 INTRODUCTION

Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a common viral skin infection in children, which is characterized by dome‐shaped umbilicated papules, typically measuring 1–5 mm in diameter.MC, which is caused by the molluscum contagiosum virus, is benign and resolves spontaneously in immunocompetent individuals. MC is usually transmitted by direct contact, fomites, and autoinoculation. The natural history of MC begins with the onset of a few MC papules, followed by an increase in the number of papules and development of surrounding eczema‐like lesions (molluscum dermatitis). After several months, the spontaneous regression phase begins, which involves erythema and swelling of the MC lesions, referred to as the "beginning of the end" sign. Lesion duration varies from a few months to several years. During this time, treatment may be required for worsening eczema and bacterial superinfections or for aesthetic reasons. Several MC treatment modalities can be used, including physical methods (e.g. curettage and cryotherapy), chemical methods (e.g. cantharidin and salicylic acid), and immunomodulatory methods (e.g. imiquimod). However, no consensus has been established regarding the standard of care. Therefore, treatment methods are currently determined by the patient's clinical status and can vary according to the region and the physician's specialty.

### Efficacy and safety of topical nitric oxide-releasing berdazimer gel in patients with molluscum contagiosum: a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^cac84ff9]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a highly contagious skin condition. Lesions may persist for months to years, and no US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications are currently available in the US.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of berdazimer gel, 10.3%, a novel topical nitric oxide-releasing medication, in the treatment of MC.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a multicenter, vehicle-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 randomized clinical trial (B-SIMPLE4) conducted in 55 clinics (mostly dermatology and pediatric) in the US from September 1, 2020, to July 21, 2021. Eligible participants were 6 months or older and had from 3 to 70 raised MC lesions. Patients with sexually transmitted MC or with MC only in the periocular area were excluded.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to treatment with berdazimer gel, 10.3%, or vehicle gel, applied as a thin layer to all lesions once daily for 12 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy end point was complete clearance of all MC lesions at week 12. Safety and tolerability measures included adverse event frequency and severity, and assessment of local skin reactions and scarring. Data analyses were performed from August 31, 2021, to September 14, 2021.

Results

A total of 891 participants were randomized, 444 to berdazimer, 10.3% (mean [range] age, 6.6 [0.9–47.5] years; 228 [51.4%] male; 387 [87.2%] White individuals), and 447 to vehicle (mean [range] age, 6.5 [1.3–49.0] years; 234 [52.3%] female; 382 [85.5%] White individuals). In the intention-to-treat population, 88.5% (393 patients) in the berdazimer group and 88.8% (397 patients) in the vehicle group had a lesion count performed at week 12. At week 12, 32.4% (144 patients) in the berdazimer group achieved complete clearance of MC lesions compared with 19.7% (88 patients) in the vehicle group (absolute difference, 12.7%; odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5–2.8; P < .001) with 14.4% (64 patients) of the berdazimer group discontinuing treatment because of MC clearance compared with 8.9% (40 patients) of the vehicle group. Adverse event rates were low. The most common adverse events were application-site pain and erythema, mostly mild in severity. Adverse events leading to discontinuation affected 4.1% (18 patients) of the berdazimer group and 0.7% (3 patients) of the vehicle group. The most common local skin reaction was mild to moderate erythema.

Conclusions and Relevance

Use of berdazimer gel, 10.3%, for MC appears to demonstrate favorable efficacy and safety with low adverse event rates.

### Pooled results of two randomized phase III trials evaluating VP-102, a drug-device combination product containing cantharidin 0.7% (w / V) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum [^dbba6955]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Compounded cantharidin has been used for decades to treat molluscum contagiosum but lacks rigorous clinical evidence to support its safety and efficacy. VP-102 is a shelf-stable drug–device combination product that contains topical cantharidin (0.7% weight/volume [w/v]) and is being evaluated for the treatment of molluscum.

Objectives

Our objective was to present pooled safety and efficacy analyses of VP-102 in the treatment of molluscum compared with vehicle.

Methods

Participants aged ≥ 2 years were randomized 3:2 to topical administration of VP-102 or vehicle in two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase III trials. Study drug was applied to all baseline and new lesions once every 21 days until clear or for a maximum of four applications. Assessors blinded to treatment counted all lesions at each study visit. All adverse events (AEs) were documented. Data were pooled for analyses.

Results

In total, 310 participants received VP-102 and 218 received vehicle. Mean age was 7.5 years (range 2–60) for VP-102 and 6.8 (2–54) for vehicle. Complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at day 84 occurred in 50% of VP-102 participants and 15.6% of vehicle recipients (p < 0.0001). Mean molluscum lesion counts decreased 76% for VP-102 and 0.3% for vehicle at day 84 (p < 0.0001). The most common AEs in the VP-102 group were application site blistering, pruritus, pain, and erythema, which were generally mild or moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Pooled analyses showed a significantly higher percentage of participants with complete molluscum lesion clearance and larger reductions in lesion counts with VP-102 than with vehicle. AEs were anticipated because of the pharmacodynamic properties of cantharidin.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT03377790 (first posted 19 December 2017) and NCT03377803 (first posted 19 December 2017).

### Efficacy and tolerability of an investigational nitric oxide-releasing topical gel in patients with molluscum contagiosum: a randomized clinical trial [^6dd3dfab]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Although a variety of ablative, topical, and systemic therapies are used for molluscum contagiosum (MC), none has been well studied or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of topical SB206 (berdazimer sodium gel coadministered with hydrogel) with vehicle.

Methods

A 12-week, phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial of topical SB206.

Results

A total of 256 patients (mean age, approximately 7 years) participated. Of patients who completed 12 weeks of treatment (n = 217), all MC lesions cleared in 20.0% of patients who received vehicle compared with 13.2%, 41.0%, and 35.1% of patients treated with twice daily SB206 4%, 8%, and 12%, respectively, and 41.9% of patients treated with once daily SB206 12%. Application-site erythema occurred in 10.6% of patients treated with SB206. Application-site reactions were the most common adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation, affecting 2 patients (approximately 4%) in each of the SB206 4%, 8%, and 12% twice daily groups and 0 patients in the vehicle or SB206 12% once daily groups.

Limitations

A larger study is needed to confirm the efficacy of SB206 12% once daily and provide additional safety assessments.

Conclusion

Of the doses studied, SB206 12% applied once daily provided the best balance between MC lesion clearance and tolerability for evaluation in a larger study.

### Molluscum contagiosum virus infection [^212d0b0b]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum virus is an important human skin pathogen: it can cause disfigurement and suffering in children, in adults it is less common and often sexually transmitted. Extensive and persistent skin infection with the virus can indicate underlying immunodeficiency. Traditional ablative therapies have not been compared directly with newer immune-modulating and specific antiviral therapies. Advances in research raise the prospect of new approaches to treatment informed by the biology of the virus; in human skin, the infection is localised in the epidermal layers, where it induces a typical, complex hyperproliferative lesion with an abundance of virus particles but a conspicuous absence of immune effectors. Functional studies of the viral genome have revealed effects on cellular pathways involved in the cell cycle, innate immunity, inflammation, and cell death. Extensive lesions caused by molluscum contagiosum can occur in patients with DOCK8 deficiency-a genetic disorder affecting migration of dendritic and specialised T cells in skin. Sudden disappearance of lesions is the consequence of a vigorous immune response in healthy people. Further study of the unique features of infection with molluscum contagiosum virus could give fundamental insight into the nature of skin immunity.

### Berdazimer gel for molluscum contagiosum in patients with atopic dermatitis [^a947efd4]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Controlling molluscum contagiosum (MC) infections is critical in atopic dermatitis (AD) management. This post hoc analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of berdazimer gel, 10.3% (topical, antiviral, nitric oxide-releasing medication) versus vehicle in MC patients with or without AD.

Methods

Three Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group trials (B-SIMPLE[berdazimer sodium in molluscum patients with lesions]1, -2, -4) enrolled patients 6months and older with 3–70 mollusca. Berdazimer or vehicle was applied once daily to all MC lesions for 12weeks. Data from three Phase 3 studies were integrated for subgroup efficacy and safety assessments using several weighted meta-analysis approaches. Patients with concurrent AD or a history of AD/eczema were categorized as AD+ subgroup (AD- when absent). Primary efficacy endpoint: complete lesion clearance at Week 12. Safety endpoints included adverse events (AEs) through Week 24 and local skin reactions through Week 12.

Results

Of 1598 enrolled patients, 209 (13.1%) were AD+. Baseline mean lesion counts were greater in AD+ (26.4) than AD- (19.3). Complete clearance rates were higher at Week 12 for berdazimer compared with vehicle in AD+ (n = 209; 35.0% vs. 27.4%; odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% CI, 0.7–2.5) and AD- (n = 1389; 29.1% vs. 18.9%; OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.4–2.4) subgroups. AEs in AD+ were application-site pain (21.6% with berdazimer vs. 11.9% with vehicle), dermatitis (12.8% vs. 2.4%), and erythema (9.6% vs. 7.1%).

Conclusions

Berdazimer gel showed favorable efficacy regardless of AD status. Berdazimer-induced erythema may be indistinguishable from AD symptoms or with inflammatory response upon resolution of molluscum.

### Time to resolution and effect on quality of life of molluscum contagiosum in children in the UK: a prospective community cohort study [^1150e407]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Molluscum contagiosum is one of the 50 most prevalent diseases worldwide, but scarce epidemiological data exist for childhood molluscum contagiosum. We aimed to describe the time to resolution, transmission to household child contacts, and effect on quality of life of molluscum contagiosum in children in the UK.

Methods

Between Jan 1, and Oct 31, 2013, we recruited 306 children with molluscum contagiosum aged between 4 and 15 years in the UK either by referral by general practitioner or self-referral (with diagnosis made by parents by use of the validated Molluscum Contagiosum Diagnostic Tool for Parents [MCDTP]). All participants were asked to complete a questionnaire at recruitment about participant characteristics, transmission, and quality of life. We measured quality of life with the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI). Participants were prospectively followed up every month to check on their recovery from molluscum contagiosum and transmission to other children in the same household, until the child's lesions were no longer visible.

Findings

The mean time to resolution was 13·3 months (SD 8·2). 80 (30%) of 269 cases had not resolved by 18 months; 36 (13%) had not resolved by 24 months. We recorded transmission to other children in the household in 102 (41%) of 250 cases. Molluscum contagiosum had a small effect on quality of life for most participants, although 33 (11%) of 301 participants had a very severe effect on quality of life (CDLQI score > 13). A greater number of lesions was associated with a greater effect on quality of life (H = 55·8, p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

One in ten children with molluscum contagiosum is likely to have a substantial effect on their quality of life and therefore treatment should be considered for some children, especially those with many lesions or who have been identified as having a severe effect on quality of life. Patients with molluscum contagiosum and their parents need to be given accurate information about the expected natural history of the disorder. Our data provide the most reliable estimates of the expected time to resolution so far and can be used to help set realistic expectations.

### Pooled results of two randomized phase III trials evaluating VP-102, a drug-device combination product containing cantharidin 0.7% (w / V) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum [^232f2c04]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Compounded cantharidin has been used for decades to treat molluscum contagiosum but lacks rigorous clinical evidence to support its safety and efficacy. VP-102 is a shelf-stable drug-device combination product that contains topical cantharidin (0.7% weight/volume [w/v]) and is being evaluated for the treatment of molluscum.

Objectives

Our objective was to present pooled safety and efficacy analyses of VP-102 in the treatment of molluscum compared with vehicle.

Methods

Participants aged ≥ 2 years were randomized 3:2 to topical administration of VP-102 or vehicle in two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase III trials. Study drug was applied to all baseline and new lesions once every 21 days until clear or for a maximum of four applications. Assessors blinded to treatment counted all lesions at each study visit. All adverse events (AEs) were documented. Data were pooled for analyses.

Results

In total, 310 participants received VP-102 and 218 received vehicle. Mean age was 7.5 years (range 2–60) for VP-102 and 6.8 (2–54) for vehicle. Complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at day 84 occurred in 50% of VP-102 participants and 15.6% of vehicle recipients (p < 0.0001). Mean molluscum lesion counts decreased 76% for VP-102 and 0.3% for vehicle at day 84 (p < 0.0001). The most common AEs in the VP-102 group were application site blistering, pruritus, pain, and erythema, which were generally mild or moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Pooled analyses showed a significantly higher percentage of participants with complete molluscum lesion clearance and larger reductions in lesion counts with VP-102 than with vehicle. AEs were anticipated because of the pharmacodynamic properties of cantharidin.

### Efficacy and safety of topical nitric oxide-releasing berdazimer gel in patients with molluscum contagiosum: a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^c93f1a05]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Highly contagious, MC is a viral infection that may persist for months to years, with lesions appearing and/or spreading to different areas of the body over time. Thus, control of lesion persistence and spread is a cornerstone of therapeutic success and is indicated by complete lesion clearance.

The B-SIMPLE4 trial demonstrated that berdazimer, applied topically once daily for 12 weeks by patients or caregivers, was significantly more effective than vehicle in achieving complete lesion clearance and reduced lesion counts. The B-SIMPLE4 differs from previous phase 3 study designs (B-SIMPLE1 and B-SIMPLE2) in 4 key aspects: (1) a larger sample size (larger than B-SIMPLE1 + B-SIMPLE2 combined); (2) 1:1 vs 2:1 randomization (berdazimer:vehicle); (3) stratification by baseline BOTE sign; and (4) patient-retention efforts at week 12 to ensure that lesion clearance and AEs were captured at this time point, even in patients who had experienced complete clearance or had an AE before week 12. In the absence of thresholds to interpret meaningful within-patient changes in lesion count, the totality of the B-SIMPLE4 data, including statistically significant improvements in the primary and all secondary end points, suggest clinical meaningfulness. Complete clearance at week 12 is a rigorous end point, and the 27% reduction in mean lesion count by week 4 would likely be perceived by patients and caregivers as meaningful and would encourage them to maintain compliance with the prescribed 12-week therapy. Indeed, an exit interview revealed that 23 of 30 patients or caregivers in B-SIMPLE4 who did not achieve complete clearance considered the lesion count reduction at week 12 to be meaningful. No safety concerns were observed in this study and berdazimer was well tolerated.

### Treatment of facial molluscum contagiosum with trichloroacetic acid [^f0b10120]. Pediatric Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum (MC) virus is a common cutaneous infection in the pediatric population, most commonly affecting school-aged children. Spontaneous clearing of lesions usually occurs over time; however, treatment is often sought due to cosmetic significance, pruritus, or concerns of transmission and autoinoculation. Chemical destruction with cantharidin, which is derived from blister beetle extract, is very safe and highly effective, making it the treatment of choice in the pediatric population. However, treatment of facial lesions or those in the diaper area are not recommended with this agent. Trichloroacetic acid is a safe and effective agent frequently utilized in dermatologic practice, most commonly in the treatment of verrucae. We have successfully used topical trichloroacetic acid to treat facial molluscum contagiousum and present the following technique for proper application.

### Photodynamic therapy for molluscum contagiosum infection in HIV-coinfected patients: review of 6 patients [^a4afcfae]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum, a viral disease of the skin, manifests as a smooth-surfaced, firm, and spherical papule with umbilication of the vertex. It commonly presents as multiple lesions, which may be extensive in immunocompromised patients, and may mimic cutaneous tumors in HIV co-infected patients. Infection usually persists for 6 months to 5 years before resolving naturally. Among immune-impaired persons with HIV infection is generally more persistent. To date, single and combination therapies for such patients have been unsatisfactory. Recent observations from a dermatology practice in which 6 patients with HIV and molluscum contagiosum were treated with 5-aminolevulinic acid (Levulan Kerastick) in conjunction with photodynamic therapy suggest clinical benefits; i.e., substantial reduction in lesional count and severity. Additional research is mandated.

Intent-to-treat population; VP-102-treated participants (n = 310) and vehicle-treated participants (n = 218). The percentage of participants with complete clearance was statistically significantly higher in the VP-102-treated participants starting after the first treatment (visit 2/day 21) and persisted through the end of the study (EOS visit/day 84). Participants who achieved complete clearance at earlier visits were required to be clear at the EOS visit/day 84 to be counted as achieving clearance at that visit

### Cantharidin use among pediatric dermatologists in the treatment of molluscum contagiosum [^03bf5ab8]. Pediatric Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Cantharidin is cited often in the dermatology and pediatric literature as a valuable treatment option for molluscum contagiosum (MC). However, there have been no prospective, randomized, vehicle-controlled trials that have been able to quantify cantharidin's efficacy in MC. The purpose of this study was to determine the breadth of usage of cantharidin, most frequently used protocols, and common side effects seen with use of cantharidin. An eighteen question survey was administered to the Society of Pediatric Dermatology. The survey sought to evaluate treatments used in MC and experiences with cantharidin including: protocol, side effects, specific products used, and satisfaction with cantharidin. A total of 300 surveys were distributed via email, 101 surveys were initiated, and 95 (94%) of these were completed. Cantharidin, imiquimod, benign neglect, curettage, cryotherapy, and retinoids were the most common approaches to pediatric MC reported by respondents. Ninety-two percent of respondents reported satisfaction with cantharidin's efficacy, but 79% reported side effects, with discomfort/pain and blistering being the most common. Cantharidin is a common modality in the treatment of MC among pediatric dermatologists. While efficacy data is still lacking, subjective satisfaction with cantharidin is reported. Cantharidin remains a viable treatment option for children with MC.

### Parental satisfaction, efficacy, and adverse events in 54 patients treated with cantharidin for molluscum contagiosum infection [^89252662]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the efficacy, tolerability, and parental satisfaction of cantharidin in a patient population at a pediatric dermatology referral center.

Methods

Chart review was completed for 110 patients who presented with molluscum infection and were treated with cantharidin. A total of 54 were available for follow-up by telephone interview regarding adverse effects, parental satisfaction, and overall clearance of the infection.

Results

Of those who were reachable, 96% improved after treatment with cantharidin. Parental satisfaction was 78%. Patients received an average of 2.2 treatments irrespective of outcome. Overall, 46% of patients experienced adverse events, including pain, pruritus, secondary infection, brisk immune response, and temporary hypopigmentation and 9% experienced an adverse event that they classified as severe.

Conclusions

The results contribute to the data supporting cantharidin as a safe and effective treatment of molluscum contagiosum. Compared with other treatments, it appears to be equally effective and well-tolerated and should be considered a potential front-line treatment.

### Pooled results of two randomized phase III trials evaluating VP-102, a drug-device combination product containing cantharidin 0.7% (w / V) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum [^12eb4888]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Currently there is an unmet need for a safe and effective treatment for molluscum. Practice patterns vary widely as there is no consensus on optimal treatment, likely because of the lack of level 1 data and FDA-approved treatment options. Despite compounded cantharidin's long history and widespread use, formulations can only be obtained outside the USA (which may violate US law) or through US compounding pharmacies. Compounding requires adherence to local guidance and carries uncertainties with regards to safety, efficacy, formulation stability, and concentration of the active ingredient. VP-102 is a proprietary drug–device combination product with an applicator that contains a 0.7% w/v cantharidin formulation manufactured under good manufacturing practice conditions along with visualization and bittering agents. The formulation is contained in a single-use applicator with a 1-mm tip to ensure precision application. The cantharidin used in VP-102 is ˃ 99% pure. VP-102 was used in these two large phase III trials with a consistent wash-off time and application schedule.

### Heterologous effect of influenza vaccination on molluscum contagiosum infection; a case report of siblings [^8d8833db]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

It is important to note that optimal, highly effective treatment of molluscum contagiosum has not been identified. In a population without immune deficiencies, treatments and therapies are not necessary for resolution. However, treatment is often sought with the intention of shortening the duration of infection, decreasing its severity, or limiting its further inoculation to self and others. Patients with atopic dermatitis associated with significant pruritus may have extensive MC disease given increased autoinoculation risk. Specific reasons cited for active treatment of molluscum include cosmetic significance, alleviation of pruritus, prevention of continued autoinoculation or spread to other people, and prevention of scarring or secondary bacterial infections from skin trauma.

Treatment modalities fall within three main categories- physical destruction of lesions, topical agents, or systemic treatment. A study among US physicians from a variety of specialties also shows widely differing treatment preferences. Physical destruction has included curettage, cryotherapy, and gentle squeezing or pricking with sterile instruments. Curettage removes the lesions themselves but other destructive techniques aim at damaging a lesion, potentially inducing an immune response. Topical treatments include podophyllotoxin, tretinoin, cantharidin, potassium hydroxide, imiquimod and cidofovir. These preparations are theorized to potentiate a local inflammatory response, or in the case of imiquimod, also induce an immune response. Systemic treatment with cimetidine has been studied and is thought to be effective based on its systemic immunomodulatory functions of increasing lymphocyte proliferation and inhibition of suppressor T-cell function. It is important to note that therapies often require a significant time commitment from patients and families. Additionally, side effects reported often include pain, hyperpigmentation and scarring.

### Disseminated molluscum contagiosum associated with immunomodulatory therapy [^88e0b720]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum is a common cutaneous disease caused by an infection with the molluscum contagiosum virus of the Poxviridae family. It is transmitted by direct contact and typically affects children. In immunocompetent patients, infection is self-limited with spontaneous resolution. Risk factors for infection in adult patients include sexual transmission and severe immunosuppression. Lesions in adults are usually distributed on the lower abdomen, thighs, and genital area. Adult patients who are immunosuppressed may develop many lesions in this distribution or have widespread disease., Although lesions in immunosuppressed patients may present classically as pink or skin-colored umbilicated papules, they may also be large or verrucous. Immunosuppressed patients with molluscum contagiosum have a protracted disease course.

### Chemotherapy with paclitaxel for recalcitrant molluscum contagiosum in an HIV-infected patient [^bce58ee4]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a viral skin infection seen in children, sexually active adults and immunocompromised populations. It is usually a self-limiting illness that typically spontaneously resolves without therapeutic intervention. However, when the papules are extensive or refractory causing complications or aesthetic issues, multiple treatment modalities exist to relieve symptoms, limit spread and decrease the social stigma associated with visible lesions. Treatment is especially important in HIV/AIDS infected populations, where prevalence is estimated between 5% and 18% and susceptibility to larger, widespread and recalcitrant lesions involving atypical distributions is more common. We evaluated a 38-year-old woman with a history of AIDS (CD4+ Tcell count < 25cells/µL) and poor adherence with antiretroviral therapy who presented with a 9-month history of persistent, progressively worsening facial and truncal umbilicated papules consistent with recalcitrant MC refractory to cidofovir injections. She was successfully treated with paclitaxel with complete resolution of the lesions after four cycles without adverse effects.

Among the 217 pediatricians surveyed, 118 complete responses were received (54% response rate). Survey questions and responses can be seen in Figure 3. Eighty‐eight percent (104/118) of respondents believed that between 1% and 25% of molluscum cases develop secondary infections. When molluscum lesions were thought to be superinfected clinically, 41.5% (49/118) treated empirically with antibiotics without culturing. Forty‐seven percent (55/118) of respondents reported never culturing MC lesions to evaluate for potential superinfection, and 4% (4/118) and 2% (2/118) of respondents reported always prescribing topical and systemic antibiotics for MC patients, respectively.

Introduction

Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a common viral cutaneous infection that primarily affects children, immunocompromised patients, and sexually active adults. With a prevalence between 5.1% and 11.5% in children aged 0 to 16 years, MC is the third most common viral skin infection in children and 1 of the 5 most prevalent skin diseases worldwide.

Although MC is self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals, the average duration of MC is often measured in years. The largest cohort study in 306 children younger than 15 years documented a mean of 13.3 months to resolution without intervention; 30% of the cases persisted at 1.5 years, and 13% persisted at 2 years.

A survey of US physicians found that the treatment of MC varies widely. The lack of treatment guidelines and categorization of the infection as benign and self-limiting, may lead physicians to wait for natural clearance. Molluscum contagiosum may be associated with pain, itching, eczema, and secondary bacterial infections. Reasons for treatment of MC include alleviating discomfort, reducing risk of autoinoculation and spread to others, preventing scarring, and eliminating social stigma.

Although there is no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for MC, cantharidin, an extract from blister beetles, has been used to treat MC for more than 60 years. The exact mechanism of action of cantharidin in MC is unknown, although cantharidin causes degradation of desmosomes in the epidermis and blistering, which is hypothesized to promote shedding of infected keratinocytes. However, the ability of physicians to use cantharidin for the treatment of MC has been restricted owing to its limited availability, lack of formulation standardization, and variations in concentration, treatment durations, and application methods. Herein, we present the results of 2 large, vehicle-controlled phase 3 clinical trials (Cantharidin Application in Molluscum Patients [CAMP-1 and CAMP-2]) that evaluated the treatment of MC using VP-102, a proprietary drug-device combination containing cantharidin, 0.7% (w/v), in a shelf-stable formulation following a standardized treatment schedule.

### Association between filaggrin gene mutations and the clinical features of molluscum contagiosum: the yamanashi adjunct study of the Japan environment and children's study [^6654f120]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

We found that treatment modality had a significant effect on the time to resolution of MC. Although curettage resulted in the shortest time to resolution, there is a possibility of reverse causation because this was an observational study. Treatment other than curettage may have been chosen if the number of MC lesions was high. A US study reported no significant difference in time to resolution according to treatment modalities. However, in that study, no treatment for MC was chosen in 73% of cases, and curettage was chosen in only 4% of patients. Therefore, those data cannot be compared with the results of our study. There may be both medical and social reasons why curettage is the major treatment modality for MC in Japan. In our study, dermatologists were more likely than pediatricians to choose excision, while pediatricians were more likely than dermatologists to choose no treatment. This result is consistent with data from the US showing differences in treatment choice for MC, based on physician specialty. In Japan, caregivers are free to choose a clinic to attend, rather than their general practitioner, and 72% of participants in this study were diagnosed with MC by a dermatologist. Furthermore, the most common reason for curettage was "physician recommendation" (84%), and the most common response for the treatment the caregiver desired was "no specific preference" (37%), followed by curettage (22%), and no treatment (7%). These data suggest that the decision to treat MC in Japan is largely influenced by the preference of the physician. In addition, there could be social demands that encourage the choice of curettage. Among participants who underwent curettage, the reasons for curettage were "Nurseries/schools encouraged to remove" (8%) and "Told MC needs to be removed to get into the pool" (21%). However, the Japanese Society of Pediatric Dermatology and other societies have stated that "MC is known to be transmitted through direct skin‐to‐skin contact or through swimming board/kickboard. However, the virus is not known to be transmitted through water, therefore, it is not a problem for infected patients to get into the pool."
