## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prenatal care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching goals and principles of prenatal care. Then, I should verify the timing and content of the initial visit. Next, I will review screening and diagnostic testing across trimesters, followed by individualized visit frequency and care models. After that, I need to ensure management of special populations and high-risk conditions is addressed. Finally, I will integrate social determinants, shared decision-making, and quality metrics, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: prenatal care aims to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes through early, continuous, and risk-stratified screening, counseling, and intervention, ideally beginning before 10 weeks' gestation or at first presentation, with a comprehensive assessment of medical, social, and structural drivers of health to guide individualized care plans [^114b1KeS] [^113xvG9N].

> I need to check the initial visit components carefully. Early comprehensive assessment should include dating, vitals, BMI, and a full history with prior pregnancies, chronic conditions, medications, and family/genetic risks; laboratory screening for HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis, rubella immunity, CBC, urinalysis, and urine culture; and counseling on folic acid, nutrition, physical activity, and teratogen avoidance, with shared decision-making embedded from the outset [^113xvG9N] [^114b1KeS] [^111KGmUR].

> Wait, let me verify HIV screening specifics because this is easy to misstate. Universal opt-out HIV testing is recommended at the first prenatal visit, with repeat testing in the third trimester for those at high risk or in higher-incidence settings, and rapid testing at delivery if status is unknown. Results should be available within 1 hour, and if reactive, immediate intrapartum prophylaxis should be initiated while confirmatory testing proceeds, with linkage to HIV care for comanagement [^111mMYWY] [^112zecX1] [^114ML1Jj].

> Hold on, I should verify infectious disease screening beyond HIV. Screening for hepatitis B, syphilis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria should occur early. Group B Streptococcus culture is recommended at 35–37 weeks with intrapartum prophylaxis for those who test positive or have prior GBS bacteriuria. And vaccination counseling should include Tdap between 27–36 weeks in each pregnancy, annual influenza, and COVID-19 vaccination as recommended, with counseling on other indicated immunizations [^11475s7J] [^114DNUbZ] [^113xvG9N].

> Let me consider first-trimester screening and diagnostics next. I should confirm that all pregnant individuals should be offered prenatal genetic screening and diagnostic testing options regardless of age, with noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) generally offering superior sensitivity for common aneuploidies compared to traditional serum screening, and that pre- and post-test counseling are essential to support informed decision-making. Additionally, a first-trimester ultrasound for dating, viability, and early anomaly detection is standard, with a routine anatomy scan at 18–20 weeks [^113PPCJn] [^1166PZdw] [^112VmhRi] [^113dNt3W].

> I will now examine second-trimester priorities. Universal screening for gestational diabetes is recommended at 24–28 weeks, with earlier screening for those with risk factors. Screening for anemia and platelet count should be repeated, and the detailed fetal anatomic survey at 18–20 weeks should be completed, with counseling on findings and follow-up plans as indicated [^111m2ZkP] [^113C3HNT] [^113xvG9N].

> Next, I should review third-trimester care. Repeat HIV testing is advised for high-risk individuals or in higher-incidence settings, GBS screening at 35–37 weeks guides intrapartum prophylaxis, and fetal growth assessment and antepartum testing are individualized based on risk. For patients aged 40 or older, antepartum surveillance and growth ultrasounds are reasonable given increased stillbirth risk, and delivery timing should be discussed with shared decision-making, noting that induction at 39 weeks is often favored in advanced maternal age due to rising stillbirth risk thereafter [^114ML1Jj] [^116ZzWcb] [^113fgQtB].

> Let me think about visit frequency and care models, because the traditional 12–14 visit schedule is being revisited. Tailored prenatal care delivery should individualize visit frequency based on medical and social needs, integrate telemedicine where appropriate to complete guideline-based services, and consider group prenatal care, which has been associated with improved knowledge, satisfaction, and reduced preterm birth, particularly among African-American patients, without evidence of harm [^112HXGrj] [^1146RH4N] [^112GtNxS] [^11618sJu].

> I should double-check special populations and high-risk conditions. For advanced maternal age, offer first-trimester ultrasound, discuss and offer genetic screening/diagnostic testing, consider third-trimester growth ultrasounds and antepartum surveillance, and plan delivery timing proactively. For diabetes, emphasize preconception glycemic optimization, first-trimester HbA1c, individualized glucose targets, and postpartum endocrine follow-up. For opioid or stimulant use disorder, prioritize medication-assisted treatment without delay, coordinate prenatal care, and address legal/reporting concerns that may deter engagement. For multiple gestation, consider specialized clinics and closer surveillance given higher risks [^116ZzWcb] [^111gjYZK] [^116C45Hu] [^114zBSsH] [^111z3Rb8].

> But wait, what about social determinants and equity — they materially shape outcomes. I need to ensure universal screening for depression, anxiety, intimate partner violence, substance use, and food insecurity early in pregnancy, and actively address unmet social needs through health system and community referrals; interpregnancy care should begin during prenatal visits with counseling on birth spacing and contraception using shared decision-making, especially given disparities in short interpregnancy intervals [^113xvG9N] [^111BJYML] [^113QC27P].

> Hold on, I should verify that shared decision-making and patient engagement are consistently emphasized. ACOG's 2025 consensus explicitly calls for engaging patients in developing their care plans, and prenatal care should be anchored in informed consent, reproductive autonomy, and culturally sensitive communication, including careful, unbiased counseling when pregnancy options are considered early in care [^111KGmUR] [^113jKmFp].

> Let me reconsider quality metrics and system-level supports. Adequacy of prenatal care has historically been measured by timing of initiation and number of visits, but emerging frameworks emphasize content quality, patient experience, and outcomes; regionalized levels of maternal care, standardized documentation of infectious disease status, and collaborative models that include midwifery and nursing can improve access, equity, and coordination of care [^116ZdeD4] [^117U5Ki3] [^11475s7J] [^112rA1Lx].

> In summary, I need to ensure the care plan is individualized, evidence-based, and equity-focused: start early with comprehensive assessment, deliver guideline-concordant screening and counseling across trimesters, tailor visit frequency and modalities to patient needs, proactively manage high-risk conditions, integrate social determinants and shared decision-making, and leverage system supports to improve maternal–infant outcomes and patient experience [^114b1KeS] [^113xvG9N] [^112HXGrj].

Prenatal care is a **preventive health service** that supports maternal and infant health through regular visits, screening, and counseling [^113xvG9N]. Early and consistent prenatal care is linked to **better outcomes**, including reduced preterm birth, low birth weight, and maternal complications [^113xvG9N]. Core elements include risk assessment, screening for infections and genetic conditions, ultrasound dating/anatomy scans, and education on nutrition, activity, and warning signs [^113xvG9N]. Care should be **individualized** — tailoring visit frequency, integrating telehealth, and addressing social determinants — to improve access and equity [^114b1KeS] [^112HXGrj]. Group prenatal care is an effective alternative for some patients, and all pregnant patients should be offered **options counseling** and supported in informed decision-making [^112GtNxS] [^113jKmFp].

---

## Objectives and goals of prenatal care

The **primary objectives** of prenatal care include:

- **Early identification and management**: Detect and address maternal and fetal risk factors early [^113xvG9N].

- **Preventive care**: Provide immunizations, folic acid supplementation, and screening for infections and genetic conditions [^113xvG9N].

- **Education and counseling**: Offer guidance on nutrition, physical activity, and healthy behaviors during pregnancy [^111KrLu1].

- **Support and empowerment**: Foster informed decision-making and maternal autonomy [^111KGmUR].

| Individualized care | - Tailored care plans based on medical and social needs <br/> - Telemedicine integration <br/> - Addressing social determinants of health [^114b1KeS] |

---

## Recommended schedule of prenatal visits

The **frequency of prenatal visits** is individualized based on maternal and fetal risk factors:

- **Low-risk pregnancies**: Typically every 4 weeks until 28 weeks, every 2 weeks until 36 weeks, then weekly until delivery [^115b62H2].

- **High-risk pregnancies**: More frequent visits based on clinical judgment and patient needs [^115b62H2].

- **Telemedicine**: Considered for routine follow-up and monitoring when appropriate [^1146RH4N].

---

## Screening tests and interventions

Prenatal care includes **various screening tests and interventions** to identify and manage potential complications:

- **Genetic screening**: Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), first-trimester screening, and diagnostic tests (CVS, amniocentesis) [^113PPCJn].

- **Infectious disease screening**: HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis, and group B Streptococcus [^11475s7J].

- **Ultrasound examinations**: Dating ultrasound, anatomy scan, and growth assessments [^115Tfnnc].

- **Immunizations**: Influenza, Tdap, and COVID-19 vaccines recommended during pregnancy [^114DNUbZ].

---

## Impact of prenatal care on maternal and infant outcomes

Prenatal care significantly improves maternal and infant outcomes by **reducing preterm birth and low birth weight** through early detection and management of risk factors [^112cQ3mT]. It also lowers maternal morbidity and mortality by identifying and addressing complications such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes [^113xvG9N]. Additionally, it enhances maternal health behaviors, including smoking cessation, nutrition, and physical activity [^111KrLu1].

---

## Barriers to accessing prenatal care

Several **barriers** can limit access to prenatal care, including:

- **Socioeconomic factors**: Low income, lack of insurance, and transportation challenges [^114eJTJ7].

- **Structural barriers**: Limited availability of providers, long wait times, and inflexible clinic hours [^115VDCkD].

- **Cultural and linguistic barriers**: Language differences and cultural beliefs affecting care-seeking behavior [^notfound].

---

## Innovations and improvements in prenatal care

Recent innovations aim to enhance prenatal care delivery, including **tailored care models** that individualize visit frequency and content based on patient needs [^112HXGrj], telemedicine integration to improve access and convenience [^1146RH4N], and group prenatal care, which provides education, social support, and improved outcomes [^11618sJu]. Emphasis on addressing social determinants of health and patient preferences also improves equity and satisfaction [^116dXPPW].

---

## Role of healthcare providers

Healthcare providers play a critical role in delivering **evidence-based care**, educating patients, and supporting informed decision-making [^111KGmUR]. They must address patient preferences, cultural beliefs, and social determinants of health to ensure equitable and effective care [^111BJYML].

---

Prenatal care is a **comprehensive, preventive service** that improves maternal and infant outcomes through early identification, management, education, and support. Individualized, accessible, and equitable care models — including telemedicine and group care — enhance the effectiveness and experience of prenatal care [^116dXPPW] [^11618sJu].

### Update: interim guidelines for health care providers caring for pregnant women and women of reproductive age with possible zika virus exposure-United States, 2016 [^112HVjvM]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

CDC has updated its interim guidelines for U.S. health care providers caring for pregnant women during a Zika virus outbreak (1). Updated guidelines include a new recommendation to offer serologic testing to asymptomatic pregnant women (women who do not report clinical illness consistent with Zika virus disease) who have traveled to areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission. Testing can be offered 2–12 weeks after pregnant women return from travel. This update also expands guidance to women who reside in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission, and includes recommendations for screening, testing, and management of pregnant women and recommendations for counseling women of reproductive age (15–44 years). Pregnant women who reside in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission have an ongoing risk for infection throughout their pregnancy. For pregnant women with clinical illness consistent with Zika virus disease, * testing is recommended during the first week of illness. For asymptomatic pregnant women residing in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission, testing is recommended at the initiation of prenatal care with follow-up testing mid-second trimester. Local health officials should determine when to implement testing of asymptomatic pregnant women based on information about levels of Zika virus transmission and laboratory capacity. Health care providers should discuss reproductive life plans, including pregnancy intention and timing, with women of reproductive age in the context of the potential risks associated with Zika virus infection.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 8: interpregnancy care [^113QC27P]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Interventions to increase optimally spaced pregnancies — family planning counseling and contraceptive guidance should begin during prenatal care and address disparities and patient-centered decision-making. Providing guidance to women and their families about the benefits of intervals longer than 6 months between pregnancies is emphasized, and women of lower socioeconomic status and women of color appear to be at risk of the shortest interpregnancy intervals. In the United States, 45% of pregnancies are unplanned, and one in three women become pregnant before the recommended 18-month interpregnancy interval. Counseling should begin during prenatal care with a conversation about the woman's interest in future childbearing and can start by asking, "Would you like to become pregnant in the next year?" or, for women in the immediate postpartum period, "When would you like to become pregnant again?" The counseling should include a discussion about birth spacing and its role in providing sufficient time to optimize health before the next pregnancy, and this optimization can improve outcomes for the subsequent pregnancy as well as across the woman's lifespan. Counseling should include a discussion of all contraceptive options (including implants, intrauterine devices, hormonal methods, barrier methods, lactational amenorrhea, and natural family planning). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use and U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use can be used to facilitate evidence-based contraception counseling to meet an individual patient's family planning and pregnancy spacing needs. Counseling should use a shared decision-making approach so that the woman can make an autonomous and informed decision; health care providers also should ask what methods women have found to be effective and acceptable in the past, and be aware that family planning counseling may be perceived differently by women who historically have been marginalized and who have experienced coercive counseling and social policies.

### Group prenatal care and perinatal outcomes: a randomized controlled trial [^11618sJu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether group prenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes, psychosocial function, and patient satisfaction and to examine potential cost differences.

Methods

A multisite randomized controlled trial was conducted at two university-affiliated hospital prenatal clinics. Pregnant women aged 14–25 years (n = 1,047) were randomly assigned to either standard or group care. Women with medical conditions requiring individualized care were excluded from randomization. Group participants received care in a group setting with women having the same expected delivery month. Timing and content of visits followed obstetric guidelines from week 18 through delivery. Each 2-hour prenatal care session included physical assessment, education and skills building, and support through facilitated group discussion. Structured interviews were conducted at study entry, during the third trimester, and postpartum.

Results

Mean age of participants was 20.4 years; 80% were African American. Using intent-to-treat analyses, women assigned to group care were significantly less likely to have preterm births compared with those in standard care: 9.8% compared with 13.8%, with no differences in age, parity, education, or income between study conditions. This is equivalent to a risk reduction of 33% (odds ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.44–0.99, P = 0.045), or 40 per 1,000 births. Effects were strengthened for African-American women: 10.0% compared with 15.8% (odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.38–0.92, P = 0.02). Women in group sessions were less likely to have suboptimal prenatal care (P < .01), had significantly better prenatal knowledge (P < .001), felt more ready for labor and delivery (P < .001), and had greater satisfaction with care (P < .001). Breastfeeding initiation was higher in group care: 66.5% compared with 54.6%, P < .001. There were no differences in birth weight nor in costs associated with prenatal care or delivery.

Conclusion

Group prenatal care resulted in equal or improved perinatal outcomes at no added cost.

### Well-woman preventive visits: a recommendation from the Women's Preventive Services Initiative [^115NxdJe]. WPSI (2022). High credibility.

Well-woman preventive services — implementation considerations state that well-woman preventive services may include, but are not limited to, assessment of physical and psychosocial function, primary and secondary prevention and screening, risk factor assessments, immunizations, counseling, education, prepregnancy care, and many services necessary for prenatal, postpartum and interpregnancy care. Visits should allow sufficient time to address and coordinate services, and a team-based approach may facilitate delivery of services. Recommended services are evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of "A" or "B" in the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force, and immunizations that have in effect a recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recommended services for adolescents also include evidence-informed preventive care and screenings provided for in the comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration, and for women, such additional preventive care and screenings as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration. The Recommendations for Well-Woman Care – A Well-Woman Chart provides a framework for incorporating preventive health services for women into clinical practice.

### Revised recommendations for HIV testing of adults, adolescents, and pregnant women in health-care settings [^1151g8up]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2006). Medium credibility.

HIV testing in pregnancy — screening recommendations: HIV screening should be included in the routine panel of prenatal screening tests for all pregnant women, and HIV screening is recommended after the patient is notified that testing will be performed unless the patient declines (opt-out screening). Separate written consent for HIV testing should not be required; general consent for medical care should be considered sufficient to encompass consent for HIV testing. Repeat screening in the third trimester is recommended in certain jurisdictions with elevated rates of HIV infection among pregnant women.

### When NIPT finds possible cancer-NCI… [^114LLp2g]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

When Prenatal DNA Tests Point to Cancer, by Sarah Schmelling A blood test that may detect cancer has received some attention recently. But, unlike other blood tests being studied as ways to screen for cancer, it wasn't designed for that purpose. This test is a prenatal blood test that analyzes free-floating bits of DNA, known as cell-free DNA, from the fetus. Specifically, tests of this type screen for an irregular number of chromosomes, called fetal aneuploidy. But in the decade or so that noninvasive prenatal blood tests — often called NIPT — have been in clinical use, there have been some cases in which the results indicated that a fetal aneuploidy was present, but additional testing found the fetus had normal chromosomes. In some of these cases, women who received these false-positive prenatal screening results were subsequently diagnosed with cancer, either during the pregnancy or after childbirth.

Also in 2013, there was a report of a woman who had multiple aneuploidies found in her prenatal test results. Two different labs carried out three tests, all with the same results, suggesting that it was a real finding, but the fetus was normal. It was only after the birth of the baby, when the woman complained of pelvic pain and a more extensive workup was done, that she was shown to have pelvic bone fractures that were the result of a neuroendocrine tumor that had spread. The tumor was shedding fragments of DNA into the woman's bloodstream that were being detected by the prenatal test. The idea is to develop the evidence for a specific, prospective workup to determine whether the person has a malignancy and needs cancer management right away, even while they are pregnant. There's also a part of the study that will help us better understand the patient's experience in these situations. The hope is that we can detect malignancies as early as possible.

Also, despite the abnormal test results, not everyone in the study has turned out to have cancer. We have detected other conditions, such as fibroids, that can also release unusual DNA fragments into the blood. We also want patients and providers to know that a pregnant person can safely undergo cancer treatment, particularly during the late second trimester to third trimester when the workup would be complete. The goal is to start treatment as soon as possible and not wait another 4 or 5 months until after delivery.

### Levels of maternal care: obstetric care consensus No, 9 [^117U5Ki3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Levels of maternal care — summary recommendations and grade: To standardize a complete and integrated regionalized system of perinatal care and risk-appropriate maternal care, a classification system for levels of maternal care as defined in Table 1 is recommended, and each higher level of care includes and builds on the capabilities of the lower levels. All facilities need the capability to stabilize and provide initial care for any patient, manage common obstetric emergencies such as hemorrhage and hypertension, and birth centers, basic (level I), and specialty care (level II) hospitals should collaborate with subspecialty care and regional perinatal health facilities to develop and maintain maternal transport plans and cooperative agreements. Collaborating receiving hospitals should openly accept transfers, and the decision to transfer a patient is dependent on the health care provider's judgment of the severity of illness, balancing the need for a higher level of care with risks associated with moving the woman out of her community. Pregnant women should receive the same level of trauma care as nonpregnant patients, and the appropriate care level for patients should be driven by their medical need and not limited to or governed by financial constraints. Because obesity is extremely common, all facilities should have appropriate equipment for the care and delivery of pregnant women with obesity; the degree of obesity may be 1 of the factors that affect decisions for transfer, and there are no well-established body mass index cutoff levels to determine level-specific care for pregnant women or women in the postpartum period with obesity. All facilities should have infrastructure and guidelines for data collection, storage, and retrieval that allow regular review for trends; levels of maternal and neonatal care may not match within facilities, and a pregnant woman should be cared for at the facility that best meets her needs as well as her neonate's needs. All maternity facilities should have the necessary institutional support, including financial, to meet the needs of level-appropriate maternal care, including provision of health care personnel, facility resources, and collaborative relationships with perinatal hospitals within their region. The grade of recommendations shown is 1C Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Women's and care providers' perspectives of quality prenatal care: a qualitative descriptive study [^112rA1Lx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

While intended to inform the development of items for the Quality of Prenatal Care Questionnaire, the study findings also provide direction for the planning and delivery of prenatal care. As noted, the findings reflect a number of the published prenatal care guidelines and, in particular, resonate with the Canadian Family-Centred Maternity and Newborn Care: National Guidelines. These national guidelines recommend that: pregnancy be considered a state of health; women be valued and respected; the relationship between a woman and her care provider be consultative and interactive; and care providers facilitate informed decision making. Our study findings also are congruent with other aspects of these guidelines that address the importance of access to care, accommodation of a woman's personal support system, continuity of care, screening and assessment, and health promotion counseling.

Putting many of the elements of quality prenatal care into practice requires clinician time. However, fee-for-service models are disincentives to spending time with pregnant women. Moreover, in Canada the relatively few family physicians who offer maternity care combined with the low number of registered midwives puts pressure on obstetricians to provide care to both low- and high-risk pregnant women. Collaborative models of care may be the answer not only to improving access to primary maternity care in Canada but also to enhancing the quality of prenatal care women receive. Increasing access to midwifery care, which integrates many of the essential components of quality care because it is women-centred, embraces shared decision making, and incorporates emotional care, also may serve to promote quality prenatal care.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 19: breastfeeding promotion in the prenatal period (revised 2024) [^1128CJmc]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Prenatal breastfeeding promotion — scope and rationale: The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) recommend prenatal breastfeeding promotion in step 3 of the Ten Steps for Successful Breastfeeding. Historically, counseling and support received prenatally is undervalued and insufficient for expressed needs. The purpose of this protocol is to summarize interventions and strategies that promote and normalize breastfeeding and to support breastfeeding outcomes, with a focus on interventions during the prenatal period. As previously outlined in this series volume, building a breastfeeding-friendly office where patients seek prenatal care is a strong intervention that can promote breastfeeding, and the following recommendations are supported by the most consistent evidence found in current literature and expert opinion.

### The experience of pregnant women in contexts of vulnerability of prenatal primary nursing care: a descriptive interpretative qualitative study [^115jnD5j]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A pregnant woman who "is threatened by physical, psychological, cognitive and/or social risk factors in combination with lack of adequate support and/or adequate coping skills", is considered to be in a context of vulnerability. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), these contexts contribute to maternal death, stillbirths, prematurity or growth restriction. While, in some countries, midwives may play an important role in prenatal care, in Quebec, Canada, this role is taken by nurses for women in contexts of vulnerability through government programs provided by local community service centers (LCSC). Prenatal nursing care, including, for example, care coordination of care among providers, identification of risks for complications between (e.g. eating disorders or abnormal signs and symptoms during pregnancy), and promotion of healthy lifestyles, can improve pregnancy outcomes among women who are likely to underutilize prenatal care, namely by delaying seeking medical attention or having an insufficient number of follow-ups. The primary care nurse can play a key role in prenatal care by promoting maximum utilization of services. Nurse can contribute to the early detection and management of complications, in addition to preparing women for childbirth, as well as maintaining and improving health. Specifically, the nurse must support women in contexts of vulnerability by identifying their needs to prepare them for their new role.

WHO prenatal care guidelines propose recommendations to improve utilization and quality of prenatal care. While the aim should be the promotion of a positive experience, pregnant women's experience is complex and stems from a subjective interpretation of their prenatal nursing care. A thematic synthesis by our research team aimed to systematically review the literature to describe the prenatal primary nursing care experience of pregnant women in contexts of vulnerability. We observed that women in contexts of vulnerability have needs and expectations throughout their pregnancy. The fulfillment of these needs and expectations shapes their experience and guides their decision to continue, cease or modify their prenatal nursing care. However, their experience may be influenced by some factors not identified in this review. The aim of this study was to describe factors influencing the prenatal primary nursing care experience of pregnant women in contexts of vulnerability. A better understanding of factors influencing this experience could help improve prenatal primary nursing care.

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^113PPCJn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Prenatal genetic screening and diagnostic testing recommendation — We recommend that prenatal genetic screening (serum screening with or without nuchal translucency ultrasonography or cell-free DNA screening) and diagnostic testing (chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis) options be discussed and offered to all pregnant individuals regardless of age or risk of chromosomal abnormality. After review and discussion, every patient has the right to pursue or decline prenatal genetic screening and diagnostic testing. (GRADE 1A)

### Levels of maternal care: obstetric care consensus No, 9 [^114LprP6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine grading system — best practice is described as "Recommendation in which either (1) there is enormous amount of indirect evidence that clearly justifies strong recommendation (direct evidence would be challenging, and inefficient use of time and resources, to bring together and carefully summarize), or (2) recommendation to contrary would be unethical".

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^116TAzrY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine grading system — 2C weak recommendation, low-quality evidence: For 2C, clarity of risk and benefit states "Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits, risks, and burdens; benefits may be closely balanced with risks and burdens". The quality of supporting evidence is "Evidence from observational studies, unsystematic clinical experience, or randomized, controlled trials with serious flaws. Any estimate of effect is uncertain". The implications are "Very weak recommendation; other alternatives may be equally reasonable". Suggested language includes "We suggest it is an option". and "We suggest that it may or might be reasonable".

### Providing quality family planning services in the United States: recommendations of the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (revised 2024) [^113yNu9w]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Early pregnancy management — prenatal counseling and care directs providers to provide initial prenatal counseling for persons considering or planning to continue a pregnancy, including offering education on healthy prenatal practices, prescribing folic acid and reviewing urgent warning signs and symptoms; it states that all pregnant people should be offered screening for STIs (including gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis and HIV) and counseled about risk reduction strategies and potential risks to newborns, with treatment provided in accordance with the most current CDC STI Treatment Guidelines if needed; providers should initiate referrals, ideally with a warm handoff, for any needed services not provided on-site, including prenatal care and planning for birth, and even providers who do not offer full-scope prenatal care can and should offer basic early pregnancy care encompassing management of urgent complications, screening for medication use and other relevant conditions, and education on folic acid use and other time-sensitive topics.

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^115SkaMx]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from 2020 demonstrate the continued upward trend in the mean age of pregnant individuals in the United States. Observational studies demonstrate that pregnancy in older individuals is associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes-for both the pregnant patient and the fetus-that might differ from those in a younger pregnant population, even in healthy individuals with no other comorbidities. There are several studies that suggest advancing age at the time of pregnancy is associated with greater disparities in severe maternal morbidity and mortality. This document seeks to provide evidence-based clinical recommendations for minimizing adverse outcomes associated with pregnancy with anticipated delivery at an advanced maternal age. The importance and benefits of accessible health care from prepregnancy through postpartum care for all pregnant individuals cannot be overstated. However, this document focuses on and addresses the unique differences in pregnancy-related care for women and all those seeking obstetric care with anticipated delivery at age 35 years or older within the framework of routine pregnancy care. This Obstetric Care Consensus document was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction with the authors listed above.

Limitations of ADA Standards of Medical Care in the Context of GDM

Time of pregnancy for the diagnosis of GDM ADA guidelines define GDM as "diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior to gestation". ADA clearly states that IADPSG criteria as well as the diagnostic criteria used in the two-step approach were not derived from women enrolled in the first half of pregnancy. In light of this observation, the rationale behind extending the diagnostic criteria to the entire second trimester (13–28 weeks) and selectively excluding the first trimester (< 13 weeks) is not clear. World Health Organization (WHO) 2013 and FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) guidelines recommend diagnosis of GDM if the IADPSG criteria are fulfilled anytime during the pregnancy. Clearly, more consensus is needed on the applicability of a diagnosis of GDM during early pregnancy.
Use of term "overt diabetes prior to gestation" in the GDM definition In 2010, an IADPSG consensus panel introduced a new term, "overt diabetes during pregnancy", which demarcated women with GDM from those with hyperglycemia of greater severity. This term was used to label women who were diagnosed with diabetes (as per standard criteria for diagnosis outside the pregnancy) for the first time during the pregnancy. A similar definition was used by WHO 2013 guidelines, albeit with a different term "diabetes in pregnancy". The term "overt diabetes prior to gestation" used in the ADA definition (see above) is not in alignment with our current understanding of GDM and should have been "overt diabetes during gestation".
Use of the term "prediabetes" in the context of pregnancy One of the recommendations states "test for undiagnosed prediabetes and diabetes at the first prenatal visit in those with risk factors using standard diagnostic criteria". The use of term "prediabetes" in pregnant women is not backed by scientific evidence. This term has never been used previously by any other organizations such as WHO and IADPSG. Further, in the accompanying text, the guidelines recommend that women with "intermediate hyperglycemia" at the first prenatal visit should be diagnosed and treated as GDM. Does this mean that the terms GDM and prediabetes could be used interchangeably?
Inconsistent use of terminology While the 2019 ADA document used the term "pre-existing pre-gestational diabetes" for values clearly indicative of diabetes, this has been replaced by another term "diabetes complicating pregnancy" in the current version. It is not clear whether this term has been used in the same context or has been intended to include the subgroup of women with hyperglycemia meeting threshold of overt diabetes in pregnancy, but without known pre-existing diabetes.

4 PRECONCEPTION INTERVENTIONS FOR THE PREVENTION OF PRETERM BIRTH: DO THEY WORK?

No matter how early women begin their prenatal visits, they arrive late to prevent most of the adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. That is why many national and international organizations suggest preconception healthcare promotion at every encounter a person of reproductive age has with the healthcare system.

Although the generally recommended mechanisms are based on three axes (screening, promotion, and intervention or referral), these components are rarely translated into practical tools for action and decision‐making in the clinical setting. However, there are many conditions for which scientific evidence has demonstrated that clinical interventions effectively improve pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth (Table 1).

All pregnant women should be offered screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria, syphilis, rubella, and hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus infection early in pregnancy. Women at increased risk should be tested for hepatitis C infection, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. All women should be questioned about their history of chickenpox and genital or orolabial herpes. Routine screening for bacterial vaginosis is not recommended. Influenza vaccination is recommended in women who will be in their second or third trimester of pregnancy during flu season. Women should be offered vaginorectal culture screening for group B streptococcal infection at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation. Colonized women and women with a history of group B streptococcal bacteriuria should be offered intrapartum intravenous antibiotics. Screening for gestational diabetes remains controversial. Women should be offered labor induction after 41 weeks' gestation.

Subsequent prenatal visits — actions at every visit: Obstetric visit frequency should be individualized, with an uncomplicated first pregnancy typically examined every 4 weeks until 28 weeks' gestation, every 2 weeks from 28–36 weeks' gestation, and then every week until delivery. People with medical or obstetric complications might require closer surveillance, and parous people without medical or obstetric complications who have had prior normal pregnancy outcomes may be seen less frequently as long as additional appointments are available as needed. During each regularly scheduled visit, the obstetric provider should evaluate blood pressure, patient weight, uterine size for progressive growth and consistency with gestational age, and presence of fetal heart activity at appropriate gestational ages, and after quickening should ask about fetal movement at each prenatal visit thereafter.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend routine screening for pregnant women for evidence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and syphilis, and vaginal-rectal colonization with group B Streptococcus For each of these pathogens, there are important opportunities to provide maternal treatment, prevent vertical transmission of the pathogen during the prenatal or intrapartum periods, and/or administer neonatal treatment immediately after birth. Such prevention and/or treatment measures are critical to limiting maternal and neonatal morbidity; however, this is dependent on recognition of maternal disease status. A significant number of women in the United States receive either inadequate prenatal care or inadequate screening for these pathogens. The time of admission to labor and delivery units represents an important opportunity to detect at-risk pregnant women and infants. To optimize both maternal and neonatal health, the Joint Commission issued new guidance effective July 1, 2018, mandating documentation of maternal disease status for these pathogens in the maternal medical record and documentation of positive results in the newborn medical record. Immediate peripartum testing for women with inadequate screening is also required. These measures should allow for timely interventions to improve maternal health and ideally to prevent perinatal disease transmission to the newborn.

Special Considerations

Pregnancy

All pregnant women should be tested for HIV during the first prenatal visit. A second test during the third trimester, preferably at < 36 weeks' gestation, should be considered and is recommended for women who are at high risk for acquiring HIV, women who receive health care in jurisdictions with high rates of HIV infection, and women served in clinical settings in which prenatal screening identifies ≥ 1 pregnant woman with HIV per 1,000 women screened. Diagnostic algorithms for HIV for pregnant women do not differ from those for nonpregnant women (see STI Detection Among Special Populations). Pregnant women should be informed that HIV testing will be performed as part of the routine panel of prenatal tests; for women who decline HIV testing, providers should address concerns that pose obstacles, discuss the benefits of testing (e.g. early HIV detection, treatment, and care for improving health of the mother and reducing perinatal transmission of HIV), and encourage testing at subsequent prenatal visits. Women who decline testing because they have had a previous negative HIV test result should be informed about the importance of retesting during each pregnancy. Women with no prenatal care should be tested for HIV at the time of delivery.

Testing pregnant women is crucial because knowledge of infection status can help maintain the woman's health, and it enables receipt of interventions (i.e. ART or specialized obstetrical care) that can substantially reduce the risk for perinatal transmission of HIV. Pregnant women with diagnosed HIV infection should be educated about the benefits of ART for their own health and for reducing the risk for HIV transmission to their infant. In the absence of ART, a mother's risk for transmitting HIV to her neonate is approximately 30%; however, risk can be reduced to < 2% through ART, obstetrical interventions (i.e. elective cesarean delivery at 38 weeks' pregnancy), and breastfeeding avoidance. Pregnant women with HIV infection should be linked to an HIV care provider experienced in managing HIV in pregnancy and provided antenatal and postpartum treatment and advice. Detailed and regularly updated recommendations for managing pregnant patients with HIV infection are available at.

HIV Infection Among Neonates, Infants, and Children

Diagnosis of HIV infection in a pregnant woman indicates the need for evaluating and managing the HIV-exposed neonate and considering whether the woman's other children, if any, might be infected. Detailed recommendations regarding diagnosis and management of HIV infection among neonates and children of mothers with HIV are beyond the scope of these guidelines but are available at. Exposed neonates and children with HIV infection should be referred to physicians with expertise in neonatal and pediatric HIV management.

### International society for prenatal diagnosis 2022 debate 3-fetal genome sequencing should be offered to all pregnant patients [^114KgpME]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2023). Medium credibility.

Prenatal trio exome sequencing (ES) has become integrated into the care for pregnant women when the fetus has structural anomalies. Details regarding optimizing indications for prenatal exome sequencing, its detection rates with different categories of fetal anomalies, and principles of interpretation of pathogenicity of sequence variants are still under investigation. However, there is now growing consensus about its benefits for finding the cause of fetal structural anomalies. What is not established, is whether exome or genome sequencing (GS) has a place in the care of all pregnant women. This report is a summary of the debate on this topic at the 26th International Conference on Prenatal Diagnosis and Therapy. Both expert debaters considered the advantages and disadvantages. Advantages include the ability to diagnose serious childhood conditions without a prenatally observable phenotype, which creates the potential of early treatments. Disadvantages include difficulties with variant classification, counseling complexities, healthcare cost, and the burden on healthcare systems and families, in particular with the discovery of adult-onset disorders or variants of uncertain significance. Although both debaters weighed the balance of these conflicting arguments differently, they agreed that more research is needed to further explore the clinical utility and ethical aspects of GS for all pregnant women.

The one-size-fits-all model of prenatal care has remained largely unchanged since 1930. New models of prenatal care delivery can improve its efficacy, equity, and experience through tailoring prenatal care to meet pregnant people's medical and social needs. Key aspects of recently developed prenatal care models include visit schedules based on needed services, telemedicine, home measurement of routine pregnancy parameters, and interventions that address social and structural drivers of health. Several barriers that affect the individual, provider, health system, and policy levels must be addressed to facilitate implementation of new prenatal care delivery models.

Every woman of reproductive age who is capable of becoming pregnant is a candidate for preconception care, regardless of whether she is planning to conceive. Preconception care is aimed at identifying and modifying biomedical, behavioral, and social risks through preventive and management interventions. Key components include risk assessment, health promotion, and medical and psychosocial interventions. Patients should formulate a reproductive life plan that outlines personal goals about becoming pregnant based on the patient's values and resources. Preconception care can be provided in the primary care setting and through activities linked to schools, workplaces, and the community.

### How to choose a test for prenatal genetic diagnosis: a practical overview [^112VmhRi]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Establishing the diagnosis of a fetal genetic disease in utero expands decision-making opportunities for individuals during pregnancy and enables providers to tailor prenatal care and surveillance to disease-specific risks. The selection of prenatal genetic tests is guided by key details from fetal imaging, family and obstetrical history, suspected diagnoses and mechanisms of disease, an accurate understanding of what abnormalities each test is designed to detect, and, at times, the gestational age at which testing is initiated. Pre- and posttest counseling, by or in conjunction with providers trained in genetics, ensure an accurate understanding of genetic tests, their potential results and limitations, estimated turnaround time for results, and the clinical implications of their findings. As prenatal diagnosis and testing options continue to expand rapidly, it is increasingly important for obstetrical providers to understand how to choose appropriate genetic testing and contextualize the clinical implications of their results.

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^116ZzWcb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Antepartum care — We suggest that pregnancy with anticipated delivery at the age 35 years or older be recognized as a risk factor for adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes, and nuanced counseling will be dependent on specific age and comorbidities. We recommend daily low-dose aspirin for the reduction of preeclampsia for pregnant individuals aged 35 years or older in the setting of at least 1 other moderate risk factor. Given increased rates of multiple gestations for pregnant individuals with anticipated delivery at the age of 35 years or older, we suggest a first-trimester ultrasonogram. We recommend that prenatal genetic screening and diagnostic testing options be discussed and offered to all pregnant individuals regardless of age or risk of chromosomal abnormality, and that every patient has the right to pursue or decline prenatal genetic screening and diagnostic testing. We suggest a detailed fetal anatomic ultrasonogram for pregnant individuals with anticipated delivery at the age of 35 years or older. Due to increased risk of both large-for-gestational-age and small-for-gestational-age neonates, we suggest an ultrasonogram for growth assessment in the third trimester for pregnant individuals with anticipated delivery at age 40 years or older. We suggest offering antenatal fetal surveillance for pregnant individuals with anticipated delivery at age 40 years or older given the increased risk of stillbirth. We recommend proceeding with delivery in well-dated pregnancies at 39 0/7–39 6/7 weeks of gestation for individuals with anticipated delivery at age 40 years or older due to increasing rates of neonatal morbidity and stillbirth beyond this gestational age. We suggest counseling that vaginal delivery is safe and appropriate if there are no other maternal or fetal indications for cesarean delivery, that counseling include discussion of cesarean delivery risks, comorbidities, and patient preferences and goals, and that advancing patient age alone is not an indication for cesarean delivery.

### Prenatal care: an evidence-based approach [^113xvG9N]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Well-coordinated prenatal care that follows an evidence-based, informed process results in fewer hospital admissions, improved education, greater satisfaction, and lower pregnancy-associated morbidity and mortality. Care initiated at 10 weeks or earlier improves outcomes. Identification and treatment of periodontal disease decreases preterm delivery risk. A prepregnancy body mass index greater than 25 kg per m2 is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertension, miscarriage, and stillbirth. Advanced maternal and paternal age (35 years or older) is associated with gestational diabetes, hypertension, miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, aneuploidy, birth defects, and stillbirth. Rho(D) immune globulin decreases alloimmunization risk in a patient who is RhD-negative carrying a fetus who is RhD-positive. Treatment of iron deficiency anemia decreases the risk of preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal depression. Ancestry-based genetic risk stratification using family history can inform genetic screening. Folic acid supplementation (400 to 800 mcg daily) decreases the risk of neural tube defects. All pregnant patients should be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria, sexually transmitted infections, and immunity against rubella and varicella and should receive tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap), influenza, and COVID-19 vaccines. Testing for group B Streptococcus should be performed between 36 and 37 weeks, and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis should be initiated to decrease the risk of neonatal infection. Because of the impact of social determinants of health on outcomes, universal screening for depression, anxiety, intimate partner violence, substance use, and food insecurity is recommended early in pregnancy. Screening for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks is recommended for all patients. People at risk of preeclampsia, including those diagnosed with COVID-19 in pregnancy, should be offered 81 mg of aspirin daily starting at 12 weeks. Chronic hypertension should be treated to a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg.

### Decision-making for prenatal genetic screening: how will pregnant women navigate a growing number of aneuploidy and carrier screening options? [^115eQrT3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we have identified significant clinical and ethical challenges to ensuring that patients have the information and decision support needed to make informed choices about their prenatal genetic screening options during pregnancy. Thus, it is necessary for healthcare providers and systems to revisit how to structure the medical decision-making processes during the onset of prenatal care in a way that is commensurate with advances in prenatal genomics. It is unlikely that one approach will solve the challenges presented by emerging genomic applications in prenatal care. Instead, we must look for a combination of resources to best prepare for the individualized needs of patients as they consider their prenatal genetic screening and diagnostic testing options. This presents a prime opportunity for innovation, not just in leveraging advances in digital educational tools and resources, but approaches to optimize the important discussions that patients may have with their healthcare provider over the course of the pregnancy.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^114eJTJ7]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV prevention related to pregnancy — implementation progress, challenges, and opportunities notes that over the last 3 decades, cases of perinatal transmission in the United States have declined due to many factors, including widespread opt-out prenatal HIV testing, maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART), maternal and infant prophylaxis, scheduled cesarean delivery, avoidance of breastfeeding, and other interventions; in 2012, an estimated 161 persons under the age of 13 years were diagnosed with perinatally acquired HIV infection in the United States. An HIV diagnosis in a pregnant woman may be missed if prenatal HIV testing is not routine or if repeat testing is not offered after a prior negative test. Women with HIV who are uninsured or who live in rural or low prevalence communities may face barriers to affordable prenatal/postpartum care or providers skilled in managing pregnant women with HIV, and implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and continued support for federally funded reproductive health programs may improve access. Providers can consult the Clinicians Consultation Center for reproductive issues, community-based HIV testing programs can identify women at high risk before or during pregnancy, and state and local health departments vary in capacity for active surveillance and follow-up, particularly since some jurisdictions do not require reporting of HIV-exposed infants.

### Updated recommendations for use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (tdap) in pregnant women – advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), 2012 [^114DNUbZ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

ACIP Recommendations for Pregnant Women

ACIP recommends that providers of prenatal care implement a Tdap immunization program for all pregnant women. Health-care personnel should administer a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy, irrespective of the patient's prior history of receiving Tdap.

Guidance for Use

To maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant, optimal timing for Tdap administration is between 27 and 36 weeks gestation although Tdap may be given at any time during pregnancy. For women not previously vaccinated with Tdap, if Tdap is not administered during pregnancy, Tdap should be administered immediately postpartum.

Special Situations

Pregnant women due for tetanus booster

If a tetanus and diphtheria booster vaccination is indicated during pregnancy (i.e. > 10 years since previous Td), then Tdap should be administered. Optimal timing is between 27 and 36 weeks gestation to maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant.

Wound management for pregnant women

As part of standard wound management to prevent tetanus, a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine might be recommended for wound management in a pregnant woman if ≥ 5 years have elapsed since the previous Td booster. If a Td booster is recommended for a pregnant woman, health-care providers should administer Tdap.

Pregnant women with unknown or incomplete tetanus vaccination

To ensure protection against maternal and neonatal tetanus, pregnant women who never have been vaccinated against tetanus should receive three vaccinations containing tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids. The recommended schedule is 0, 4 weeks, and 6 through 12 months. Tdap should replace 1 dose of Td, preferably between 27 and 36 weeks gestation to maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant.

Cocooning

ACIP recommends that adolescents and adults (e.g. parents, siblings, grandparents, child-care providers, and health-care personnel) who have or anticipate having close contact with an infant aged < 12 months should receive a single dose of Tdap to protect against pertussis if they have not received Tdap previously. Guidance will be forthcoming on revaccination of persons who anticipate close contact with an infant, including postpartum women who previously have received Tdap.

Upon detection of a fetal structural anomaly, it is important to offer the pregnant woman an immediate consultation with a maternal‐fetal medicine specialist and a medical geneticist. Patients should be informed that prenatal ultrasound at 18–20 weeks can detect major structural anomalies in approximately 30%–60% of such cases. Suspected or confirmed fetal structural anomalies warrant an immediate referral to a tertiary ultrasound unit to optimize therapeutic strategies. PMC aims to discuss diagnostic tests, possible outcomes, treatment options, and emotional aspects, helping parents make informed decisions about their pregnancy.

### Optimizing use of existing prenatal genetic tests: screening and diagnostic testing for aneuploidy [^1123Jj2d]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Screening and diagnostic testing for detection of fetal aneuploidy has been an integral part of prenatal care for over three decades. The recent introduction of new technologies, such as cell free DNA (cfDNA) screening and preimplantation genetic screening, has created increased complexity for obstetrical care providers. Inconsistencies among the professional society recommendations have caused confusion and disparities in practice. As we work to responsibly incorporate new technologies, clear guidelines with consensus among relevant professional societies are needed. In January of 2017, a workshop was convened during the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Pregnancy Meeting. Representatives from many stakeholder groups were present with the goal to develop a framework for introduction of new genetic tests into clinical practice. This paper provides consensus recommendations from this workshop on the use of existing prenatal screening and diagnostic testing for aneuploidy.

### Revised recommendations for HIV testing of adults, adolescents, and pregnant women in health-care settings [^112zecX1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2006). Medium credibility.

Pregnant women — screening recommendations and labor management: Universal HIV testing with notification should be performed for all pregnant women as early as possible during pregnancy. HIV screening should be included in the routine panel of prenatal screening tests for all pregnant women, and patients should be informed that HIV screening is recommended for all pregnant women and that it will be performed unless they decline (opt-out screening). HIV screening should be repeated in the third trimester of pregnancy for women known to be at high risk for HIV, and providers should explore and address reasons for declining HIV testing. Pregnant women should receive appropriate health education, including information regarding HIV and its transmission, as a routine part of prenatal care, and access to clinical care, prevention counseling, and support services is essential for women with positive HIV test results. Repeat HIV testing in the third trimester is recommended for all women in jurisdictions with elevated HIV or AIDS incidence. Rapid HIV testing should be performed for all women in labor who do not have documentation of results from HIV testing during pregnancy, and immediate initiation of appropriate antiretroviral prophylaxis should be recommended on the basis of a reactive rapid HIV test result, without awaiting the result of confirmatory testing.

### Committee opinion no: 635: prenatal and perinatal human immunodeficiency virus testing: expanded recommendations [^116r6MgW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Given the enormous advances in the prevention of perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), it is clear that early identification and treatment of all pregnant women with HIV is the best way to prevent neonatal infection and also improve women's health. Furthermore, new evidence suggests that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy in the course of infection is beneficial for individuals infected with HIV and reduces the rate of sexual transmission to partners who are not infected. Screening should be performed after women have been notified that HIV screening is recommended for all pregnant patients and that they will receive an HIV test as part of the routine panel of prenatal tests unless they decline (opt-out screening). Obstetrician-gynecologists or other obstetric providers should follow opt-out prenatal HIV screening where legally possible. Repeat HIV testing in the third trimester is recommended for women in areas with high HIV incidence or prevalence and women known to be at risk of acquiring HIV infection. Women who were not tested earlier in pregnancy or whose HIV status is otherwise undocumented should be offered rapid screening on labor and delivery using the opt-out approach where allowed. If a rapid HIV test result in labor is reactive, antiretroviral prophylaxis should be immediately initiated while waiting for supplemental test results. If the diagnosis of HIV infection is established, the woman should be linked into ongoing care with a specialist in HIV care for comanagement.

### Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112BrR2C]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others on asymptomatic bacteriuria screening — positions across organizations — note support for screening in pregnancy by infectious disease and obstetric groups, mixed guidance on timing, and broad recommendations against screening in nonpregnant adults. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses the Infectious Diseases Society of America's recommendations for screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women and treatment for those who screen positive. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends screening in pregnant women with urine culture once during the first trimester, although this was issued as a "weak" recommendation and the quality of evidence was considered "low". The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has no specific recommendation to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant persons; however, the AAP recommends that clinicians treat pregnant persons and perform a test of cure if asymptomatic bacteriuria is found to be present on a urine culture. In 2008, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommended screening in pregnant women at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit, whichever comes first. The AAP, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence all recommend against screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant, premenopausal women.

### Developing and applying a' living guidelines' approach to WHO recommendations on maternal and perinatal health [^112KFhfh]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Updating WHO recommendations is time-intensive and resource-intensive, requiring systematic collection and appraisal of the evidence related to benefits and harms, how stakeholders value the relevant outcomes, feasibility, acceptability, cost-effectiveness and implementation considerations. This evidence is then considered by an international panel of experts and stakeholders to formulate the recommendations. Identifying the recommendations that should be prioritised for updating would allow a more rational use of limited resources, while improving responsiveness to new, potentially important evidence. A new, dynamic system of prioritising and updating WHO MPH recommendations, combined with literature surveillance, has been developed and implemented, to respond rapidly to important changes in available evidence and ensure that accurate, relevant and up-to-date guidance is available to women, clinicians, policymakers and other stakeholders globally. In this article we describe the development and application of this approach to WHO global recommendations on MPH.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 752 summary: prenatal and perinatal human immunodeficiency virus testing [^114ML1Jj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Given the enormous advances in the prevention of perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), it is clear that early identification and treatment of all pregnant women with HIV is the best way to prevent neonatal infection and also improve women's health. Furthermore, new evidence suggests that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy in the course of infection is beneficial for individuals infected with HIV and reduces the rate of sexual transmission to partners who are not infected. Screening should be performed after women have been notified that HIV screening is recommended for all pregnant patients and that they will receive an HIV test as part of the routine panel of prenatal tests unless they decline (opt-out screening). Human immunodeficiency virus testing using the opt-out approach, which is currently permitted in every jurisdiction in the United States, should be a routine component of care for women during prepregnancy and as early in pregnancy as possible. Repeat HIV testing in the third trimester, preferably before 36 weeks of gestation, is recommended for pregnant women with initial negative HIV antibody tests who are known to be at high risk of acquiring HIV infection; who are receiving care in facilities that have an HIV incidence in pregnant women of at least 1 per 1,000 per year; who are incarcerated; who reside in jurisdictions with elevated HIV incidence; or who have signs and symptoms consistent with acute HIV infection (eg, fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, oral ulcers, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or transaminase elevation). Rapid screening during labor and delivery or during the immediate postpartum period using the opt-out approach should be done for women who were not tested earlier in pregnancy or whose HIV status is otherwise unknown. Results should be available 24 hours a day and within 1 hour. If a rapid HIV test result in labor is reactive, antiretroviral prophylaxis should be immediately initiated while waiting for supplemental test results. If the diagnosis of HIV infection is established, the woman should be linked into ongoing care with a specialist in HIV care for comanagement.

### Optimum maternal healthcare service utilization and infant mortality in Ethiopia [^112cQ3mT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

In this study, optimum maternal healthcare service utilisation is defined as the utilisation of WHO-recommended ANC visits, tetanus injection, skilled delivery, place of delivery and postnatal checks. The WHO recommends that a pregnant woman should receive a minimum of four ANC visits. According to the WHO, the essential components of a basic prenatal care program are the identification of pregnancy, management of pregnancy-related complications, treatment of underlying illnesses, disease screening, preventive measures including tetanus toxoid immunisation, de-worming, iron and folic acid, treatment of malaria in pregnancy, a birth and emergency preparedness plan, promotion of healthy behaviours at home, helping the pregnant woman and her partner prepare emotionally and physically for birth and care of their baby, and the promotion of postnatal family planning/birth spacing.

Poor utilisation of maternal healthcare services has a significant impact on child health outcomes. Utilisation of recommended ANC during pregnancy improves maternal and child health outcomes. Evidence from DHS data from 17 SSA countries showed that having prenatal care provided by a skilled practitioner reduced the odds of neonatal mortality by 30%. Findings from a systematic review in Ethiopia also showed that ANC utilisation reduced neonatal mortality by 34%. Having optimum ANC follow-up for either chronic or acute diseases during pregnancy can prevent further complications occurring for mothers and infants and reduce the prevalence of low birth weight by improving the nutritional status of a mother during pregnancy.

### Screening for gestational diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111m2ZkP]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force — gestational diabetes screening recommendations state that pregnant persons at 24 weeks of gestation or after should undergo screening for gestational diabetes (Screen for gestational diabetes. Grade: B), whereas for pregnant persons before 24 weeks of gestation the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms for screening for gestational diabetes (Grade: I statement). This applies to pregnant persons who have not been previously diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Implementation options, if the person is pregnant and is at least 24 weeks of gestation, include a 2-step process with an oral glucose challenge test followed by an oral glucose tolerance test, or a 1-step process in which the diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test is administered to all patients. One-time screening should be performed at or after 24 weeks of gestation, and typically in the US screening occurs prior to 28 weeks of gestation; however, it can occur later in persons who enter prenatal care after 28 weeks of gestation.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^114zBSsH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Pregnant and postpartum patients — assessment recommendations — Clinicians should incorporate additional elements into the comprehensive assessment of stimulant use disorder (StUD) for patients who are pregnant, including providing referrals to prenatal care providers if not already established (Low certainty, Strong Recommendation) and reviewing eligibility criteria for locally available programs that specifically address biopsycosocial needs related to pregnancy and parenting (eg, childcare, WIC programs; Low certainty, Strong Recommendation). Coordination of prenatal care and treatment of StUD is encouraged (Low certainty, Strong Recommendation). When screening for acute issues, complications, and sequalae associated with stimulant use in patients who are pregnant, clinicians should pay particular attention to factors that impact pregnancy and fetal development (Low certainty, Strong Recommendation).

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^112ZbdB2]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Specific to clinical providers (in addition to above recommendations) — recommended services for pregnant women with HIV: Offer an ART regimen during the prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum periods, regardless of maternal CD4 cell count, to prevent perinatal transmission and thereafter for the woman's health and to prevent HIV transmission to others, according to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommendations, and inform women about options for free or subsidized ART, such as AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) or pharmaceutical drug assistance programs to help address financial concerns that may deter ART use. Screen and treat women for STDs that may increase risk of HIV transmission during pregnancy, do not use invasive prenatal and intrapartum procedures unless women have started an effective ART regimen and are ideally, virally suppressed at the time of the procedure, inform women of delivery options that can reduce the risk of perinatal transmission, discuss risks and benefits of cesarean delivery and recommend scheduled cesarean delivery at 38 weeks gestation for women with suboptimal viral suppression near the time of delivery (i.e. HIV RNA levels > 1000 copies/mL), and notify infant health care providers of impending birth of HIV-exposed infants and any anticipated complications.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^111JYZms]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV prevention related to pregnancy — prenatal testing, maternal autonomy, and ART adherence are addressed as follows: Routine use of opt-out testing during prenatal care has increased the number of women who receive prenatal HIV testing and gain access to perinatal HIV prevention strategies. Nevertheless, cases of perinatal transmission continue to occur in the United States, primarily in women who are exposed to HIV or diagnosed with HIV infection after pregnancy is recognized or who decline services that prevent perinatal transmission. When providers notify pregnant women who have declined prenatal HIV testing that their newborn's HIV positive test results indicate maternal infection, they should offer these women voluntary HIV prevention and care services but respect their right to decline them. A woman's decision to use antiretroviral medications during pregnancy is voluntary and must honor her autonomy. Providers who are familiar with state laws about maternal and infant testing, case reporting, HIV disclosure, and protocols for confidential exchange of health information are in the best position to address these concerns while respecting patient autonomy about HIV testing. Providers can encourage pregnant women to stand and maintain high adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens that are safe during pregnancy by offering information about how to manage side effects and how to obtain affordable ART through insurance, the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), or other drug assistance programs.

### Strengthening antenatal care services for all: implementing imaging ultrasound before 24 weeks of pregnancy [^114ZhrQ3]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Summary box

A guideline panel review of updated evidence convened by the WHO has resulted in 2016 recommendation on routine antenatal ultrasound being retained and reaffirmed.
Given the many complexities surrounding the inclusion of routine ultrasound services in antenatal care, WHO, in collaboration with the MOMENTUM Country and Global Leadership project, has published a new evidence brief highlighting implementation considerations to support countries to implement this recommendation within their health systems.
As new evidence-based interventions emerge and are included in the global recommendations to improve health and well-being of pregnant populations, the global maternal newborn health community must ensure that their introduction and implementation takes local context into account and employs an inclusive, equitable, health systems approach with a continuous learning agenda.

### Optimizing preconception care and interventions for improved population health [^117FAj6W]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

There is growing literature indicating that optimal preconception health is associated with improved reproductive, perinatal, and pediatric outcomes. Given that preconception care is recommended for all individuals planning a pregnancy, medical providers and public health practitioners have a unique opportunity to optimize care and improve health outcomes for reproductive-aged individuals. Knowledge of the determinants of preconception health is important for all types of health professionals, including policy makers. Although some evidence-based recommendations have already been implemented, additional research is needed to identify factors associated with favorable health outcomes and to ensure that effective interventions are made in a timely fashion. Given the largely clinical readership of this journal, this piece is primarily focused on clinical care. However, we acknowledge that optimizing preconception health for the entire population at risk of pregnancy requires broadening our strategies to include population-health interventions that consider the larger social systems, structures, and policies that shape individual health outcomes.

### Every mother and every fetus matters: a positive pregnancy test = multiple offerings of reproductive risk screening for personal, family, and specific obstetrical-fetal conditions [^117YWWR5]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To focus on the evidence-based screening test options and timing as part of the overall "pregnant-woman-centered" preconception and prenatal care journey. The requirement and need for a focused "pregnant-woman-centered" prenatal care process with time for informed consent and shared decision making are important for optimal prenatal care.

Methods

A structured quality improvement (QI) review (Squire 2.0) was undertaken to examine the appropriate reproductive screening process in the periods of preconception and during pregnancy.

Results

First, the broader prenatal care structure was evaluated which, second, enabled the directed reproductive risk screening processes to be offered within an informed consent process. Four international preconception and prenatal evidence-based guidance consensus would routinely offer specific gestational age reproductive risk screening elements: totaling 21 screening elements (three preconception; nine first trimester; three second trimester; four third trimester; one intrapartum; and one postpartum).

Conclusion

The best evidence-based opportunity for comprehensive and collaborative prenatal care with appropriate screening elements requires: a single national access healthcare system; expert evidence-based guideline creation; collaborative maternity care providers based for risk assessment, triage, and management; a pregnant-woman-centered care model of maternity care; clearly identified evidence-based gestational age directed screening elements; international preconception and prenatal guideline consensus.

### Should prenatal care providers offer pregnancy options counseling? [^112gd4Cb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

In this exploratory study, we aim to understand which pregnant women, if any, might benefit from pregnancy options counseling upon entry into prenatal care. We base our determination on a validated measure of decision certainty about the pregnancy (as an objective indication of clinical need), as well as a direct question of interest in receiving counseling from their provider (as an indication of patient preference). We also seek to understand women's level of comfort discussing their pregnancy intentions and options with their provider, as an indication of potential harm should providers raise the topic of pregnancy options during a visit.

### Developing and applying a' living guidelines' approach to WHO recommendations on maternal and perinatal health [^112gbNe7]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Step 5: Developing recommendations with a 'living' guideline development group

After the meeting, the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth editorial team initiated the creation or updating of Cochrane reviews on the effectiveness of interventions related to the high-priority questions and developed the corresponding evidence profiles. In order to help guideline panels make evidence-informed decisions, WHO staff developed GRADE evidence-to-decision (EtD) frameworks for each high-priority question. These frameworks have been used previously in WHO MPH guidelines, and allow explicit and transparent assessment of prespecified criteria (including desirable and undesirable effects, values and preferences, resource requirements, equity, acceptability and feasibility). Assessments of how stakeholders value the outcomes, and on equity, acceptability and feasibility, were informed by recent qualitative evidence syntheses on antenatal and intrapartum care. Where needed, new qualitative evidence syntheses were conducted.

In June 2017, the WHO steering group identified approximately 50 experts and stakeholders from the six WHO regions to constitute a WHO MPH 'living' guideline development group (GDG). This is a diverse pool of stakeholders skilled in critical appraisal, guideline development, implementation, clinical practice, policy and programmes relating to maternal and newborn health. The mix of experts and stakeholders was based on considerations of previous GDG membership for existing WHO MPH guidelines, while allowing for introduction of new members with specific expertise relating to content, programmatic area or guideline development methods. 'Living guidelines' panels were drawn from this pool by matching recommendations under consideration with individual expertise. Thus a group of approximately 15–20 individuals from the MPH GDG (with appropriate geographical and gender balance, and thematic expertise) was convened virtually on an as-needed basis. Partner organisations are invited to observe and contribute to guideline panel meetings, but are not permitted to vote (in the event a formal vote is required).

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^111gjYZK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Preexisting diabetes (PDM) increases the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Reduction of maternal hyperglycemia prior to and during pregnancy can reduce these risks. Despite compelling evidence that preconception care (PCC), which includes achieving strict glycemic goals, reduces the risk of congenital malformations and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, only a minority of individuals receive PCC. Suboptimal pregnancy outcomes demonstrated in real-world data highlight the need to further optimize prenatal glycemia. New evolving technology shows promise in helping to achieve that goal. Dysglycemia is not the only driver of poor pregnancy outcomes in PDM. The increasing impact of obesity on pregnancy outcomes underscores the importance of optimal nutrition and management of insulin sensitizing medications during prenatal care for PDM.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the care of individuals with PDM that lead to a reduction in maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes.

Methods

The Guideline Development Panel (GDP) composed of a multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 10 clinically relevant questions related to the care of individuals with diabetes before, during and after pregnancy. The GDP prioritized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of different interventions (eg, PCC, nutrition, treatment options, delivery) during the reproductive life cycle of individuals with diabetes, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 10 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and develop recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from 2 patient representatives and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations.

Results

In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy intention at every reproductive, diabetes, and primary care visit. Screening for pregnancy intent is also suggested at urgent care/emergency room visits when clinically appropriate (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations. In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest use of contraception when pregnancy is not desired (2 | ⊕⊕OO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence in women with diabetes, where PCC-including contraception as a key component-showed a clinically significant association with improvements in first-trimester HbA1c and the rate of congenital malformations, together with indirect evidence from the general population regarding the reduction of unplanned pregnancies and pregnancy terminations with the use of contraception. In individuals with T2DM, we suggest discontinuation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) before conception rather than discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on limited data on risk of exposure to GLP-1RA receptor agonists during pregnancy. In pregnant individuals with T2DM already on insulin, we suggest against routine addition of metformin (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the benefit of adding metformin to insulin to achieve decrease in rates of large for gestational age infants did not outweigh the potential harm of increasing the risk of small for gestational age infants or adverse childhood outcomes related to changes in body composition. In individuals with PDM, we suggest either a carbohydrate-restricted diet (< 175g/day) or usual diet (> 175g/day) during pregnancy (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the available evidence was limited and very indirect, resulting in significant uncertainty about the net benefits or harms. As such, the evidence was insufficient to support a recommendation either for or against a carbohydrate intake cutoff of 175g/day. In pregnant individuals with T2DM, we suggest either the use of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (2 | ⊕OOO). There is lack of direct evidence supporting superiority of CGM use over SMBG for T2DM during pregnancy. There is indirect evidence supporting improved glucometrics with the use of CGM for individuals with T2DM outside of pregnancy, substantial improvements in neonatal outcomes for individuals with T1DM using CGM during pregnancy and the potential for decreasing adverse pregnancy outcomes with improved glucometrics in individuals with T2DM. In individuals with PDM using a CGM, we suggest against the use of a single 24-hour CGM target < 140mg/dL (7.8mmol/L) in place of standard-of-care pregnancy glucose targets of fasting < 95mg/dL (5.3mmol/L), 1-hour postprandial < 140mg/dL (7.8mmol/L), and 2-hour postprandial < 120 mg/dL (6.7mmol/L) (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence that associated adverse pregnancy outcomes with a fasting glucose > 126mg/dL (7mmol/L). In individuals with T1DM who are pregnant, we suggest the use of a hybrid closed-loop pump (pump adjusting automatically based on CGM) rather than an insulin pump with CGM (without an algorithm) or multiple daily insulin injections with CGM (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on a meta-analysis of RCTs which demonstrated improvement in glucometrics with increased time in range (MD +3.81%; CI -4.24 to 11.86) and reduced time below range (MD -0.85%; CI -1.98 to 0.28) with the use of hybrid closed-loop pump technology. In individuals with PDM, we suggest early delivery based on risk assessment rather than expectant management (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence that risks may outweigh benefits of expectant management beyond 38 weeks gestation and that risk assessment criteria may be useful to inform ideal delivery timing. In individuals with PDM (including those with pregnancy loss or termination), we suggest postpartum endocrine care (diabetes management), in addition to usual obstetric care (2 | ⊕OOO). As the postpartum period frequently overlaps with preconception, this was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced HbA1c at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations.

Conclusion

The data supporting these recommendations were of very low to low certainty, highlighting the urgent need for research designed to provide high certainty evidence to support the care of individuals with diabetes before, during, and after pregnancy. Investment in implementation science for PCC is crucial to prevent significant mortality and morbidity for individuals with PDM and their children. RCTs to further define glycemic targets in pregnancy and refinement of emerging technology to achieve those targets can lead to significant reduction of harm and in the burden of diabetes care. Data on optimal nutrition and obesity management in pregnancy are lacking. More research on timing of delivery in women with PDM is also needed.

### Revised recommendations for HIV testing of adults, adolescents, and pregnant women in health-care settings [^117ABoCW]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2006). Medium credibility.

HIV screening and consent in pregnancy — Screening should occur after a woman is notified that HIV screening is recommended and that she will receive an HIV test unless she declines (opt-out screening). HIV testing must be voluntary and free from coercion, and no woman should be tested without her knowledge. Pregnant women should receive oral or written information on HIV infection, interventions to reduce mother-to-infant transmission, meanings of positive and negative results, and an opportunity to ask questions and to decline testing. No additional process or written documentation of informed consent beyond that required for other routine prenatal tests should be required for HIV testing. If a patient declines an HIV test, this decision should be documented in the medical record.

The updated guidelines by the Institute of Medicine regarding gestational weight gain provide clinicians with a basis for practice. Health care providers who care for pregnant women should determine a woman's body mass index at the initial prenatal visit and counsel her regarding the benefits of appropriate weight gain, nutrition and exercise, and, especially, the need to limit excessive weight gain to achieve best pregnancy outcomes. Individualized care and clinical judgment are necessary in the management of the overweight or obese woman who is gaining (or wishes to gain) less weight than recommended but has an appropriately growing fetus.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^116C45Hu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — pregnant women with opioid use disorder: The first priority in evaluation should be to identify emergent or urgent medical conditions that require immediate referral; a medical examination and psychosocial assessment are recommended, but completion of assessments should not delay initiating pharmacotherapy, and if not completed before treatment, assessments should be completed as soon as possible thereafter. Obstetricians and gynecologists, and other health professionals that care for pregnant women, should be alert to signs and symptoms of opioid use disorder because pregnant women with opioid use disorder are more likely to present late in pregnancy, miss appointments, experience poor weight gain, or exhibit signs of withdrawal or intoxication. The psychosocial needs of pregnant women should be assessed and patients offered or referred to psychosocial treatment based on individual needs, and a woman's decision to decline psychosocial treatment or lack of availability should not preclude or delay pharmacological treatment during pregnancy. Counseling and testing for HIV should be provided, tests for hepatitis B and C and liver enzymes are suggested, and hepatitis A and B vaccinations is recommended for those whose hepatitis serology is negative. Drug and alcohol testing should be used to monitor adherence and substance use with informed consent from the mother, recognizing potential adverse legal and social consequences and varying state laws, and laws that mandate reporting for substance use and for obtaining treatment seem to prevent women from obtaining prenatal care and worsen outcomes.

### Inadequate prenatal care utilization and associated factors in S ã o Luís, Brazil [^112xitWe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Despite these improvements, 29.8% of the women studied started prenatal care with a delay, although in 2010 the rate of appropriate use of prenatal care (58.2%) was higher than in 1997/98 (47.3%). Although practically all women attended at least one prenatal visit, it is still a challenge to provide prenatal care according to the model proposed by the Brazilian Health Ministry, which recommends that all women attend the first visit by the 12 th week of pregnancy and complete at least six visits.

The rate of adequate prenatal care use considered in the present study was based on the guidelines of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. This rate was used because the ones proposed by Kessner and by Kotelchuck follow the recommendations of the ACOG, which requires a large number of visits in order to consider prenatal care use to be adequate. The World Health Organization and some studies have questioned whether this number of visits may be excessive, since it has been demonstrated that there is no difference in perinatal outcomes when the number of visits of low-risk pregnant women is reduced. However, a Cochrane systematic review on the evidence for the number of prenatal visits and perinatal outcomes concluded that reduced visits programmes of antenatal care are associated with an increase in perinatal mortality compared to standard care.

### Systematic review of the measurement properties of indices of prenatal care utilization [^116ZdeD4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Prenatal care utilization indices included in this review focus on quantifying the timing and amount of care used and therefore, they do not assess the quality or content of the prenatal services delivered. Because these quantitative indices use data that are routinely collected in administrative health datasets or electronic medical records, they offer a viable alternative to develop audit indicators for quality improvement purposes, and to explore associations between adequacy of prenatal care and pregnancy and birth outcomes at a population level via observational research designs. Other questionnaires have been developed and validated to evaluate the content and quality of prenatal care based on women's satisfaction and values. There is a need to develop theoretically-grounded measures that are able to capture both quantitative and qualitative dimensions of prenatal care utilization and quality. Additional studies evaluating the validity, reliability and responsiveness of measures of prenatal care utilization are needed. A clear reporting of the procedures to measure measurement properties of the indices may facilitate their selection and use for clinical, surveillance, and research purposes.

Differences remain in the scientific literature and in CPG (e.g. ACOG, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada) regarding recommendations about the timing and the frequency of prenatal care. However, what is common in these and other CPG is the notion that the frequency of prenatal care visits progressively increases with advancing gestation. Novel developments in screening tests during the first trimester of pregnancy and the notion that important complications that occur later in pregnancy can be predicted in the first trimester have recently reinforced the idea of having more visits at the beginning of pregnancy. Finally, preconception care should be considered part of the spectrum of prenatal care, given that it is likely that many underlying comorbidities are identified prior to pregnancy. This has important implications for stratification of women into high and low risk groupings, which ultimately dictates an adequate frequency of prenatal care for the remainder of their pregnancy.

3 RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH PRETERM BIRTH

Both the preconception and postnatal periods present opportunities to advise on optimal women's health in preparation for a subsequent pregnancy. Moreover, clinical conditions that might lead to adverse perinatal outcomes, such as preterm birth, can be prevented or managed. In addition to those mentioned in the document published by the FIGO Committee on Well Woman Health Care and the FIGO Committee on the Impact of Pregnancy on Long‐Term Health, we strongly recommend considering risk factors that influence the duration of pregnancy.

### Synopsis of the 2023 U.S. department of VA and U.S. DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of pregnancy [^111ZiCK7]. Military Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Topics considered outside the scope — Recognizing this clinical practice guideline (CPG) as a comprehensive guideline for routine pregnancy care, the scope is specifically prenatal and postpartum; therefore, recommendations for intrapartum and delivery management, except for delivery timing, were excluded. The resource provides initial evaluation and management guidance including referral indications to an advanced prenatal care provider but does not include extensive guidance on the comprehensive management of complicated pregnancies. Guidance on alternative birthing options such as home births is not included; the Work Group would defer to recommendations published by national organizations and would recommend staying abreast of new research and evidence. Although the Work Group recognizes that abortion care is a critical component of comprehensive pregnancy health care that plays a major role in reducing maternal morbidity and mortality and in promoting reproductive justice and freedom, specific guidance on provision of abortion care was considered outside the scope of this guideline.

### Strengthening antenatal care services for all: implementing imaging ultrasound before 24 weeks of pregnancy [^115Tfnnc]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Reaffirmed recommendation for one obstetric ultrasound scan before 24 weeks gestation

In 2016, the WHO published WHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience, a landmark global guideline for pregnancy care. These recommendations aim to empower all women and adolescent girls to access the type of person-centred ANC that they want and need and provide a sound foundation for such care in accordance with a human rights-based approach. This was the first set of WHO guidelines that included one obstetric ultrasound scan before 24 weeks gestation. A guideline panel review of updated evidence convened by WHO has resulted in this recommendation being retained and reaffirmed (box 1). Given the complexities surrounding inclusion of routine ultrasound services in ANC, WHO, in collaboration with MOMENTUM Country and Global Leadership, has published a new evidence brief highlighting implementation considerations to support countries to operationalise this recommendation.

Box 1

One ultrasound scan before 24 weeks of gestation is recommended for pregnant women to estimate gestational age, improve detection of fetal anomalies and multiple pregnancies, reduce induction of labour for post-term pregnancy and improve a woman's pregnancy experience.

### Should prenatal care providers offer pregnancy options counseling? [^113jKmFp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Health care providers play an important role in ensuring that women have the information and services they need to make informed decisions about their pregnancies. Pregnancy options counseling is an opportunity for the pregnant woman to consider, in conversation with her provider, whether she wants to continue the pregnancy and parent the child, continue the pregnancy with a plan for adoption, or have an abortion. Nearly half of pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended, indicating there may be a substantial number of women who might benefit from options counseling in early pregnancy.

A number of leading professional societies have produced guidelines on offering information and referrals for prenatal care, adoption services, and abortion services to pregnant patients. These guidelines describe a provider's professional and ethical obligation to provide unbiased, non-directive counseling on all available pregnancy options or, if he or she cannot due to personal beliefs, make a timely referral to another provider. This obligation is framed as fundamental to respecting patients' autonomy.

### Components and timing of prenatal care [^1131GPv9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The primary objective for prenatal care has not changed in the past 100 years: to have the pregnancy end with a healthy baby and mother. By identifying risk factors for pregnancy complications or other maternal health concerns that need to be addressed, the provider hopes to optimize pregnancy outcome. By using a series of screening and diagnostic tests, as well as serially trending certain components of the physical examination, the provider monitors the ongoing "health" of the pregnancy. As the ability to screen and intervene has improved over the last century, the issues to be assessed have expanded to include not only medical aspects of care but also barriers to access, psychologic considerations, and patient education about general health, pregnancy, and childbirth.

### Michigan plan for appropriate tailored healthcare in pregnancy prenatal care recommendations: a practical guide for maternity care clinicians [^11165Wv6]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Prenatal care is an important preventive service designed to improve the health of pregnant patients and their infants. Prenatal care delivery recommendations have remained unchanged since 1930, when the 12–14 in-person visit schedule was first established to detect preeclampsia. In 2020, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in collaboration with the University of Michigan, convened a panel of maternity care experts to determine new prenatal care delivery recommendations. The panel recognized the need to include emerging evidence and experience, including significant changes in prenatal care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, pre-existing knowledge of the importance of individualized care plans, the promise of telemedicine, and the significant influence of social and structural determinants of health (SSDoH) on pregnancy outcomes. Recommendations were derived using the RAND-UCLA appropriateness method, a rigorous e-Delphi method, and are designed to extend beyond the acute public health crisis. The resulting Michigan Plan for Appropriate Tailored Healthcare in pregnancy (MiPATH) includes recommendations for key aspects of prenatal care delivery: (1) the recommended number of prenatal visits, (2) the frequency of prenatal visits, (3) the role of monitoring routine pregnancy parameters (blood pressure, fetal heart tones, weight, and fundal height), (4) integration of telemedicine into routine care, and (5) inclusion of (SSDoH). Resulting recommendations demonstrate a new approach to prenatal care delivery that incorporates medical, SSDoH, and patient preferences, to develop individualized prenatal care delivery plans. The purpose of this document is to outline the new MiPATH recommendations and to provide practical guidance on implementing them in routine practice.

### Revised recommendations for HIV testing of adults, adolescents, and pregnant women in health-care settings [^1132v5hk]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2006). Medium credibility.

Timing of HIV testing in pregnancy — To promote informed and timely therapeutic decisions, health-care providers should test women for HIV as early as possible during each pregnancy, and women who decline early should be encouraged to be tested at a subsequent visit. A second HIV test during the third trimester, preferably < 36 weeks of gestation, is cost-effective even in areas of low HIV prevalence and may be considered for all pregnant women. A second HIV test during the third trimester is recommended for women in facilities where prenatal screening identifies at least one HIV-infected pregnant woman per 1,000 women screened, for women at high risk for acquiring HIV, and for women with signs or symptoms consistent with acute HIV infection; when acute retroviral syndrome is a possibility, a plasma RNA test should be used with an HIV antibody test to diagnose acute HIV infection.

We suggest offering a group model of prenatal care as an acceptable alternative to individual provider appointments, with 2023 category noted as "Not reviewed, Deleted" and 2023 recommendation number "NA". We recommend that all healthy, pregnant women without known contraindications participate in regular mild to moderate exercise sessions, three or more times per week, with 2023 category "Reviewed, Deleted" and "NA". We suggest that women with uncomplicated pregnancies continue a standard work schedule throughout their pregnancy, with 2023 category "Not reviewed, Amended" and 2023 recommendation number "8". We recommend folic acid (at least 400 micrograms daily) to be taken starting one month before conception and continued throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding, with 2023 category "Not reviewed, Deleted" and "NA".

### Obstetric ethics: an essential dimension of planned home birth [^116wqhx8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (the College) Committee Opinion, "Planned Home Birth", invokes two core concepts of obstetric ethics, the right of a woman to make a medically informed decision about delivery and the informed consent process. We set out a framework for obstetric ethics that empowers the autonomy of pregnant women by focusing on when, in beneficence-based clinical judgment, clinical management should be offered, should be recommended, and should be recommended against in the informed consent process. Using this ethical framework, we show that the College statement does not provide adequate guidance to obstetricians in fulfilling their ethical obligations in the informed consent process with pregnant women who express an interest in, or preference for planned home birth. Obstetricians have an ethical obligation to disclose the increased risks of perinatal and neonatal mortality and morbidity from planned home birth in the context of American healthcare and should recommend against it. Obstetricians should recommend hospital-based delivery and respond to refusal of these recommendations with respectful persuasion. As a matter of beneficence-based professional integrity, obstetricians should not participate in planned home birth. At the same time, obstetricians have a beneficence-based obligation to continue to provide prenatal and emergency obstetric care. The obstetric profession should continuously strive to make hospital births more humane and support home-birth-like environments in the hospital as well as continuously improve safety for both pregnant and fetal patients.

### Screening for HIV: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113RhSgY]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

HIV screening intervals and prenatal rescreening — CDC and specialty-society guidance are summarized as follows: The CDC recommends annual screening in persons at increased risk and notes clinicians may screen high-risk men who have sex with men more frequently (eg, every 3 or 6 months); routine rescreening may not be necessary for persons without increased risk since the last negative test. The USPSTF found no evidence on the yield of repeat prenatal screening vs 1-time screening in a single pregnancy. The CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend repeat prenatal screening during the third trimester for women with risk factors or in high-incidence settings, and the CDC notes that repeat screening during the third trimester in all women who test negative early in pregnancy may be considered; women screened during a previous pregnancy should be rescreened in subsequent pregnancies.

### Specialised antenatal clinics for women with a multiple pregnancy for improving maternal and infant outcomes [^111z3Rb8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Regular antenatal care for women with a multiple pregnancy is accepted practice, and while most women have an increase in the number of antenatal visits, there is no consensus as to what constitutes optimal care. 'Specialised' antenatal clinics have been advocated as a way of improving outcomes for women and their infants.

Objectives

To assess, using the best available evidence, the benefits and harms of 'specialised' antenatal clinics compared with 'standard' antenatal care for women with a multiple pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

All published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials with reported data that compared outcomes in mothers and babies with a multiple pregnancy who received antenatal care specifically designed for women with a multiple pregnancy (as defined by the trial authors) with outcomes in controls who received 'standard' antenatal care (as defined by the trial authors).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two of the review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality. Both review authors extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. We graded the quality of the evidence using GRADEpro software.

Main Results

Findings were based on the results of a single study with some design limitations. Data were available from one study involving 162 women with a multiple pregnancy. For the only reported primary outcome, perinatal mortality, we are uncertain whether specialised antenatal clinics makes any difference compared to standard care (risk ratio (RR) 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 4.03; 324 infants, very low quality evidence). Women receiving specialised antenatal care were significantly more likely to birth by caesarean section (RR 1.38; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.81; 162 women, moderate quality evidence). Data were not reported in the study on the following primary outcomes: small-for-gestational age, very preterm birth or maternal death. There were no differences identified between specialised antenatal care and standard care for other secondary outcomes examined: postnatal depression (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.20; 133 women, very low quality evidence), breastfeeding (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.68; 123 women, very low quality evidence), stillbirth (RR 0.68; 0.12 to 4.04) or neonatal death (RR 2.05; 95% CI 0.19 to 22.39) (324 infants).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently limited information available from randomised controlled trials to assess the role of 'specialised' antenatal clinics for women with a multiple pregnancy compared with 'standard' antenatal care in improving maternal and infant health outcomes. The value of 'specialised' multiple pregnancy clinics in improving health outcomes for women and their infants requires evaluation in appropriately powered and designed randomised controlled trials.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^114zsFkF]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV testing for pregnant women and their partners — operational guidance emphasizes that "The start of prenatal care enables routine HIV testing of pregnant women and their partners". An "opt-out consent approach (whereby a woman is tested unless she specifically declines testing) that is consistent with state laws has been shown to yield higher testing acceptance", and "This approach also hastens HIV diagnosis and management and use of interventions to prevent sexual or perinatal transmission". Because "pregnancy can increase the risk of HIV transmission and acquisition and new infection induces a rapid rise in viral load", "repeated testing of pregnant women and their partners can identify persons at high risk of transmitting or acquiring HIV during pregnancy". Moreover, "Testing of HIV-uninfected male partners of HIV-infected pregnant women and repeat testing of HIV-uninfected pregnant women during the third trimester are particularly important", and "Expedited HIV testing of women who have unknown HIV infection status when presenting in labor can quickly identify women with preliminary positive tests who warrant immediate interventions to prevent perinatal transmission".

### Expect with Me: development and evaluation design for an innovative model of group prenatal care to improve perinatal outcomes [^114CUvve]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Expect With Me group prenatal care

Expect With Me group prenatal care was designed based on: (1) principles of group care; (2) evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating improved birth outcomes for women receiving prenatal care in a group format; (3) clinical guidelines for prenatal care delivery; and (4) research on patient and provider engagement through social media and technology. Designed with national dissemination as a primary consideration, Expect With Me incorporates the best evidence-based aspects of existing models of group care with a novel IT platform to improve patient engagement and support, enhance health behaviors and decision making, connect providers and patients, and improve health service delivery.

Expect With Me provides care to groups of 8–12 women of the same gestational age. Women receiving Expect With Me begin prenatal care in the traditional manner. Formal intake (history, exam) is performed at an initial visit prior to group assignment. All prenatal care thereafter occurs within a group setting, except for health issues that require privacy and cervical assessments in late pregnancy. Ultrasounds and laboratory screenings occur per ACOG clinical guidelines. Expect With Me is implemented from week 14 of pregnancy (after initial individual assessment) through delivery, following the same schedule as individual care. However, group visits are 90–120 min each, and follow a unique structured curriculum that incorporates the standard content of prenatal care, and emphasizes critical contemporary health issues relevant to pregnancy, such as nutrition, physical activity, stress/mental health, and sexual health. Table 1 summarizes the timing and recommended topics to be covered during each session. Participants may bring their partner, family member, or other support person to group sessions.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 731: group prenatal care [^115VDCkD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Individual prenatal care is intended to prevent poor perinatal outcomes and provide education to women throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period through a series of one-on-one encounters between a woman and her obstetrician or other obstetric care provider. Concerns regarding increasing health care costs, health care provider availability, dissatisfaction with wait times, and the minimal opportunity for education and support associated with the individual care model have given rise to interest in alternative models of prenatal care. One alternative model, group prenatal care, may be beneficial or preferred for some practice settings and patient populations, although individual prenatal care remains standard practice. Group prenatal care models are designed to improve patient education and include opportunities for social support while maintaining the risk screening and physical assessment of individual prenatal care. Bringing patients with similar needs together for health care encounters increases the time available for the educational component of the encounter, improves efficiency, and reduces repetition. Evidence suggests patients have better prenatal knowledge, feel more ready for labor and delivery, are more satisfied with care in prenatal care groups, and initiate breastfeeding more often. There is no evidence that suggests that group prenatal care causes harm. Individual and group care models warrant additional study with a goal of demonstrating differences in outcomes and identifying populations that benefit most from specific care models.

### Alternative versus standard packages of antenatal care for low-risk pregnancy [^114qa9tJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The number of visits for antenatal (prenatal) care developed without evidence of how many visits are necessary. The content of each visit also needs evaluation.

Objectives

To compare the effects of antenatal care programmes with reduced visits for low-risk women with standard care.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (23 March 2015), reference lists of articles and contacted researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing a reduced number of antenatal visits, with or without goal-oriented care, versus standard care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked for accuracy. We assessed studies for risk of bias and graded the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included seven trials (more than 60,000 women): four in high-income countries with individual randomisation; three in low- and middle-income countries with cluster randomisation (clinics as the unit of randomisation). Most of the data included in the review came from the three large, well-designed cluster-randomised trials that took place in Argentina, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Zimbabwe. All results have been adjusted for the cluster design effect. All of the trials were at some risk of bias as blinding of women and staff was not feasible with this type of intervention. For primary outcomes, evidence was graded as being of moderate or low quality, with downgrading decisions due to risks of bias and imprecision of effects. The number of visits for standard care varied, with fewer visits in low- and middle- income country trials. In studies in high-income countries, women in the reduced visits groups, on average, attended between 8.2 and 12 times. In low- and middle- income country trials, many women in the reduced visits group attended on fewer than five occasions, although in these trials the content as well as the number of visits was changed, so as to be more 'goal-oriented'. Perinatal mortality was increased for those randomised to reduced visits rather than standard care, and this difference was borderline for statistical significance (risk ratio (RR) 1.14; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.31; five trials, 56,431 babies; moderate-quality evidence). In the subgroup analysis, for high-income countries the number of deaths was small (32/5108), and there was no clear difference between the groups (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.80, two trials); for low- and middle-income countries perinatal mortality was significantly higher in the reduced visits group (RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.32, three trials). There was no clear difference between groups for our other primary outcomes: maternal death (RR 1.13, 95%CI 0.50 to 2.57, three cluster-randomised trials, 51,504 women, low-quality evidence); hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (various definitions including pre-eclampsia) (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.12, six studies, 54,108 women, low-quality evidence); preterm birth (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.11; seven studies, 53,661 women, moderate-quality evidence); and small-for-gestational age (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09, four studies 43,045 babies, moderate-quality evidence). Reduced visits were associated with a reduction in admission to neonatal intensive care that was borderline for significance (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.02, five studies, 43,048 babies, moderate quality evidence). There were no clear differences between the groups for the other secondary clinical outcomes. Women in all settings were less satisfied with the reduced visits schedule and perceived the gap between visits as too long. Reduced visits may be associated with lower costs.

Authors' Conclusions

In settings with limited resources where the number of visits is already low, reduced visits programmes of antenatal care are associated with an increase in perinatal mortality compared to standard care, although admission to neonatal intensive care may be reduced. Women prefer the standard visits schedule. Where the standard number of visits is low, visits should not be reduced without close monitoring of fetal and neonatal outcome.

### Barriers and facilitators related to use of prenatal care by inner-city women: perceptions of health care providers [^111uxzux]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The Chief Public Health Officer's Report on the State of Public Health in Canada emphasizes that "Ongoing prenatal care is important to achieving a healthy pregnancy and birth, and positively influencing the health of the child in the early years. It provides a pregnant woman with the opportunity to access health information and identify risks and underlying factors that can influence her health and the health of her fetus/child" (p. 52). In Canada, a variety of health care providers deliver primary prenatal care (PNC) services, most notably family physicians, obstetricians, midwives and nurse practitioners. In addition, primary care nurses, public health nurses, social workers, and nutritionists are often involved in PNC. A series of visits with a primary health care provider, beginning in the first trimester and continuing at recommended intervals throughout the pregnancy, constitutes the norm for PNC in Canada, although debate exists on the ideal frequency and content of PNC visits. Women are defined as receiving inadequate PNC if they obtain less than the recommended number of visits, commence care after the first trimester, or receive no PNC at all.

### FIGO good practice recommendations on the use of prenatal corticosteroids to improve outcomes and minimize harm in babies born preterm [^111J7AF2]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

For women with a singleton or a multiple pregnancy in situations where active neonatal care is appropriate, and for whom preterm birth is anticipated between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation, one course of prenatal corticosteroids should ideally be offered 18 to 72 h before preterm birth is expected to improve outcomes for the baby. However, if preterm birth is expected within 18 h, prenatal corticosteroids should still be administered. One course of corticosteroids includes two doses of betamethasone acetate/phosphate 12 mg IM 24 h apart, or two doses of dexamethasone phosphate 12 mg IM 24 h apart. In women in whom preterm birth is expected within 72 h and who have had one course of corticosteroids more than a week previously, one single additional course of prenatal corticosteroids could be given at risk of imminent delivery. Prenatal corticosteroids should not be offered routinely to women in whom late preterm birth between 34 and 36 weeks is anticipated. In addition, prenatal corticosteroids should not be given routinely before cesarean delivery at term. Neither should prenatal corticosteroids be given "just in case". Instead, prenatal steroid administration should be reserved for women for whom preterm birth is expected within no more than 7 days, based on the woman's symptoms or an accurate predictive test.

### Tailored prenatal care delivery for pregnant individuals: ACOG clinical consensus no. 8 [^112ZKTPG]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Prenatal care is one of the most common preventive services in the United States; it is designed to improve the health and well-being of pregnant and birthing individuals and their children through evidence-based services. Despite the prevalence of prenatal care, formalized models of prenatal care delivery have changed little since they were first published in 1930. The purpose of this Clinical Consensus document is to offer guidance on a transformative approach to the provision of prenatal care in three key areas: 1) addressing unmet social needs, 2) frequency of prenatal visits and monitoring, and 3) incorporation of telemedicine and alternative care modalities. Implementing a sustainable paradigm shift in a century-old care-delivery approach will take time; however, this document will guide maternity care professionals and their teams in the use of new prenatal care delivery models.

### Update on prenatal care [^111j6QEV]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Many elements of routine prenatal care are based on tradition and lack a firm evidence base; however, some elements are supported by more rigorous studies. Correct dating of the pregnancy is critical to prevent unnecessary inductions and to allow for accurate treatment of preterm labor. Physicians should recommend folic acid supplementation to all women as early as possible, preferably before conception, to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Administration of Rho(D) immune globulin markedly decreases the risk of alloimmunization in an RhD-negative woman carrying an RhD-positive fetus. Screening and treatment for iron deficiency anemia can reduce the risks of preterm labor, intrauterine growth retardation, and perinatal depression. Testing for aneuploidy and neural tube defects should be offered to all pregnant women with a discussion of the risks and benefits. Specific genetic testing should be based on the family histories of the patient and her partner. Physicians should recommend that pregnant women receive a vaccination for influenza, be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria, and be tested for sexually transmitted infections. Testing for group B streptococcus should be performed between 35 and 37 weeks' gestation. If test results are positive or the patient has a history of group B streptococcus bacteriuria during pregnancy, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered to reduce the risk of infection in the infant. Intramuscular or vaginal progesterone should be considered in women with a history of spontaneous preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, or shortened cervical length (less than 2.5 cm). Screening for diabetes should be offered using a universal or a risk-based approach. Women at risk of preeclampsia should be offered low-dose aspirin prophylaxis, as well as calcium supplementation if dietary calcium intake is low. Induction of labor may be considered between 41 and 42 weeks' gestation.

### SARS-CoV-2 in the context of past coronaviruses epidemics: consideration for prenatal care [^117VyyyC]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Since December 2019, the novel SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has resulted in millions of cases and more than 200000 deaths worldwide. The clinical course among nonpregnant women has been described, but data about potential risks for women and their fetus remain scarce. The SARS and MERS epidemics were responsible for miscarriages, adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes, and maternal deaths. For COVID-19 infection, only nine cases of maternal death have been reported as of 22 April 2020, and pregnant women seem to develop the same clinical presentation as the general population. However, severe maternal cases, as well as prematurity, fetal distress, and stillbirth among newborns have been reported. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic greatly impacts prenatal management and surveillance and raise the need for clear unanimous guidelines. In this narrative review, we describe the current knowledge about coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2) risks and consequences on pregnancies, and we summarize available current candidate therapeutic options for pregnant women. Finally, we compare current guidance proposed by The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the World Health Organization to give an overview of prenatal management which should be utilized until future data appear.
