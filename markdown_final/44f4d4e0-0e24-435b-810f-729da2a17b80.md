## Question

48 year old woman with new onset anxiety, panic attacks, palpitations

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 48-year-old woman with new-onset anxiety, panic attacks, and palpitations, and wants to understand the reasoning process for evaluating and managing this presentation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the differential diagnosis and which conditions most plausibly explain this triad. Then, I should verify the immediate workup priorities, especially thyroid disease and cardiac evaluation. Next, I will review medication and substance contributors. After that, I need to outline a staged diagnostic plan and initial management, including psychiatric and cardiac safety. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, monitoring, and red flags that warrant urgent escalation, making sure each step aligns with guideline-based care and labeling data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem framing: new-onset anxiety, panic attacks, and palpitations in a 48-year-old woman can reflect primary psychiatric disease, but I must not miss endocrine, cardiovascular, medication-induced, or substance-related causes. Thyroid disease is particularly important here given female predominance and age-related risk, so I should keep hyperthyroidism high on the list while also considering panic disorder, medication effects, and arrhythmias, and I should verify that my approach mirrors guideline-based initial evaluation of thyrotoxicosis and arrhythmia workups [^116xqtXM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to construct a prioritized differential. Primary psychiatric diagnoses include panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, but I should confirm that endocrine etiologies like hyperthyroidism are excluded first because they can mimic or exacerbate anxiety and palpitations. Cardiovascular causes such as atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, and structural heart disease can present with palpitations and secondary anxiety. Medication-induced effects from sympathomimetics, stimulants, or serotonergic agents can provoke anxiety and tachycardia. Substance use including caffeine, cannabis, and nicotine should be screened, as cannabis in particular can acutely precipitate anxiety and panic in some users [^113iEarw].

> I will now examine the immediate workup priorities, and I should double-check that thyroid disease is addressed first-line. The recommended initial test for suspected thyrotoxicosis is serum TSH; if suppressed, I should follow with free T4 and consider T3, and if Graves' disease is suspected, TRAb testing is accurate and cost-effective compared with imaging; I also need to check for thyroid antibodies and consider imaging only if the etiology remains unclear after serology, keeping in mind that thyroid dysfunction can drive anxiety, tremor, and palpitations [^116xqtXM] [^11394R32] [^1132njm6].

> Next, I should review the cardiac evaluation because palpitations with anxiety still warrant rhythm assessment. Let me first confirm an ECG to screen for atrial fibrillation, SVT, or other arrhythmias; if the ECG is non-diagnostic and symptoms persist, ambulatory ECG monitoring with Holter or event recorder is reasonable; given age and symptoms, I should also consider echocardiography if structural heart disease is suspected or if there are red flags such as syncope or exertional symptoms, aligning with arrhythmia and structural heart disease evaluation principles [^111WBuE4].

> Wait, let me verify medication and substance contributors before labeling this as primary anxiety. I need a thorough medication reconciliation to identify serotonergic antidepressants, sympathomimetics, decongestants, stimulants, or thyroid hormone overtreatment; I should also ask about caffeine, nicotine, and cannabis, since cannabis can acutely trigger anxiety and panic and is a notable contributor to ED visits for anxiety symptoms; if epinephrine exposure is relevant, its adverse effects include anxiety, tremor, and palpitations, reinforcing the need to check for exogenous catecholamine sources [^113iEarw] [^114hxGJ5] [^114jsXZJ].

> Let me consider endocrine differentials beyond primary hyperthyroidism. I should confirm whether menopausal transition could contribute to anxiety and palpitations, and I need to check for secondary causes of hyperthyroidism such as thyroiditis or exogenous thyroid hormone excess; if clinical features suggest pheochromocytoma, I should add fractionated metanephrines, but given the absence of classic triad features here, that test can be deferred unless symptoms escalate or blood pressure patterns raise suspicion [^notfound].

> I should double-check psychiatric comorbidities and safety. Panic disorder is suggested by episodic surges with chest discomfort, dyspnea, dizziness, and fear of dying, but I must ensure medical causes are excluded before confirming a primary psychiatric diagnosis; once medical causes are ruled out, validated screening tools like the GAD-7 and Panic Disorder Severity Scale can structure assessment and track response, and I should also screen for depression and suicidality given their co-occurrence and treatment implications [^notfound].

> Now, I will outline a staged diagnostic plan and make sure it is coherent. Stage 1 includes focused history, exam, TSH with reflex free T4/T3, ECG, CBC, CMP, and targeted medication/substance review; Stage 2 adds TRAb if TSH is suppressed, ambulatory ECG if palpitations persist, and echocardiography if structural disease is suspected; Stage 3 reserves advanced endocrine testing such as adrenal imaging or metanephrines only if clinical suspicion remains high after initial results, which keeps the workup efficient and evidence-based [^116xqtXM] [^11394R32].

> But wait, what if symptoms are severe or there are red flags; I need to ensure acute management is safe. If hyperthyroidism is confirmed, initiate beta-blocker for symptomatic control while arranging endocrine follow-up; if significant arrhythmia is found, manage per arrhythmia protocols and consider anticoagulation if atrial fibrillation is diagnosed; if anxiety is disabling while medical workup proceeds, short-term anxiolytic or beta-blocker may be considered cautiously, balancing risks and avoiding agents with QT liability or withdrawal syndromes [^1145bCYo].

> For initial psychiatric management once medical causes are excluded or concurrently while urgent medical evaluation proceeds, I should confirm that SSRIs or SNRIs are first-line for panic disorder, with CBT as an effective adjunct. I need to check for drug interactions and QT risk if considering citalopram, which carries dose-limiting guidance and ECG monitoring recommendations in at-risk patients, and I should counsel on early activation side effects and suicidality monitoring during initiation and dose changes [^114LtSM7] [^1145bCYo] [^113Ab6Aw] [^114U9c2T].

> I need to ensure follow-up and monitoring are explicit. Reassess in 2–4 weeks to review labs, symptom trajectory, and medication tolerability; if hyperthyroidism is diagnosed, arrange endocrinology referral; if arrhythmia is identified, arrange cardiology follow-up; if a psychiatric diagnosis is confirmed, monitor for clinical worsening, suicidality, and functional improvement, adjusting therapy accordingly and maintaining coordination across specialties [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that mandate urgent escalation. Syncope, chest pain, severe dyspnea, sustained tachycardia, or hemodynamic instability require immediate emergency evaluation; likewise, if thyroid storm is suspected, this is a medical emergency requiring inpatient care; and if QT-prolonging drugs are in the regimen and palpitations occur, prompt ECG and electrolyte correction are indicated given torsades risk [^117CUnvS].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. The most likely and high-yield path is to screen for hyperthyroidism first with TSH and reflex testing, perform an ECG for arrhythmia screening, and review medications and substances meticulously; if these are unrevealing, pivot to structured psychiatric assessment and evidence-based treatment for panic disorder, while maintaining vigilance for evolving cardiac or endocrine clues that would redirect the workup and management plan [^116xqtXM].

---

In a 48-year-old woman with new-onset anxiety, panic attacks, and palpitations, **prioritize thyroid disease** [^notfound] and **cardiac arrhythmias** as the most likely causes, with menopause, medication/substance effects, and primary anxiety disorders also on the list. Start with **TSH, free T4, and ECG** [^116xqtXM], then add CBC, CMP, and 24-hour urine catecholamines if pheochromocytoma is suspected. If initial tests are inconclusive, use Holter or event monitoring, echocardiography, and ambulatory ECG to detect intermittent arrhythmias. Management is cause-specific: treat hyperthyroidism, correct electrolytes, adjust or stop offending drugs, and use SSRIs or CBT for primary anxiety; **beta-blockers help control palpitations and anxiety symptoms** [^notfound].

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

### Initial laboratory tests

- **Thyroid function tests**: TSH, free T4, free T3 to assess for hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism [^notfound].
- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate for anemia or infection.
- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**: Assess electrolytes, renal, and hepatic function.
- **24-hour urine catecholamines**: If pheochromocytoma is suspected.

---

### Cardiac evaluation

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Identify arrhythmias or ischemia [^notfound].
- **Holter monitor or event monitor**: Detect intermittent arrhythmias.
- **Echocardiography**: Evaluate structural heart disease.
- **Ambulatory ECG monitoring**: For unexplained palpitations or syncope.

---

### Additional evaluations

Additional evaluations include a **psychiatric assessment** to screen for anxiety, panic disorder, and depression, and a **medication and substance review** to identify contributors such as stimulants, antidepressants, thyroid hormones, alcohol, and cannabis [^113iEarw].

---

## Management strategies

### Medical management

- **Treat underlying medical conditions**: Hyperthyroidism, arrhythmias, electrolyte disturbances.
- **Medication adjustment**: Discontinue or adjust offending medications.
- **Pharmacotherapy**: SSRIs, SNRIs, benzodiazepines (short-term), beta-blockers for palpitations and anxiety symptoms [^114LtSM7].

---

### Psychological interventions

Psychological interventions include **cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)** — effective for anxiety and panic disorders — and **mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)** to reduce anxiety and improve coping.

---

### Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications include **caffeine and alcohol reduction**, regular **physical activity**, and **stress management techniques** such as yoga, meditation, and relaxation exercises.

---

## Prognosis and follow-up

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with appropriate diagnosis and management; however, **regular follow-up** is essential to monitor treatment response, adjust therapy, and address recurrence or complications.

---

A 48-year-old woman with new-onset anxiety, panic attacks, and palpitations requires a **comprehensive evaluation** to identify underlying medical, psychiatric, or medication-related causes. Effective management involves treating identified conditions, adjusting medications, and using pharmacotherapy and psychological interventions to achieve symptom control and improve quality of life.

Regarding the use of acetaminophen ER PO (also known as Tylenol 8HR) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: generally acceptable for use. In September 2025, the ACOG reaffirmed that acetaminophen remains the analgesic and antipyretic of choice during pregnancy. Judicious use at the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration, in consultation with an obstetrician-gynecologist or other obstetric care professional, remains consistent with best practice. The current weight of evidence does not support a causal link between prenatal acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders. The drug acetaminophen ER PO (also known as Tylenol 8HR) is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 4 Years of Age

The effectiveness of levetiracetam for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients was established in one multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 5), conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial seizures, uncontrolled by standard epileptic drugs (AEDs). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1–2 AEDs, who experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either levetiracetam or placebo. The enrolled population included 116 patients (levetiracetam N = 60, placebo N = 56) with refractory partial- onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows: 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N = 4 treated with levetiracetam), 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N = 8 treated with levetiracetam), 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N = 20 treated with levetiracetam), and 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N = 28 treated with levetiracetam). The study consisted of a 5-day evaluation period which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Levetiracetam dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in average daily partial-onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central reader using a 48-hour video EEG performed during the last two days of the 4-day maintenance period. A total of 109 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A statistically significant difference between levetiracetam and placebo was observed (see Figure 5). The treatment effect associated with levetiracetam was consistent across age groups.

### Citalopram hydrobromide (citalopram) [^114U9c2T]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking citalopram.

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.

Panic, anxiety and depression in COPD — psychological and rehabilitation interventions: The causes of depression and anxiety symptoms in people with COPD are multifactorial and include behavioral, social and biological factors. Pulmonary rehabilitation may help reduce anxiety symptoms. The efficacy of antidepressants in people with COPD has been inconclusive, possibly as a result of methodological issues in the published trials. Cognitive behavioral therapy and mind-body interventions (e.g., mindfulness-based therapy, yoga, and relaxation) can reduce anxiety and depression; mind-body interventions also improve physical outcomes such as lung function, dyspnea, exercise capacity and fatigue in people with COPD and psychological problems. Fatigue in people with COPD can be improved by self-management education, pulmonary rehabilitation, nutritional support and mind-body interventions.

### Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) [^1135eq4S]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors

In both sexes of rats, tirzepatide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) in a 2-year study at clinically relevant plasma exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. It is unknown whether MOUNJARO causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as human relevance of tirzepatide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

MOUNJARO is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of MOUNJARO and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with MOUNJARO. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin values may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values > 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

5.2 Acute Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, or MOUNJARO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

After initiation of MOUNJARO, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue MOUNJARO and initiate appropriate management.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride (Paxil) [^111N3hcg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Safety data for PAXIL CR is from 11 short-term, placebo‑controlled clinical trials including 3 studies in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1, 2, and 3), 3 studies in patients with panic disorder (PD) (Studies 4, 5, and 6), 1 study in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) (Study 7), and 4 studies in female patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) (Studies 8, 9, 10, and 11) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. These 11 trials included 1627 patients treated with Paxil CR.

Studies 1 and 2 were 12-week studies that enrolled patients 18 to 65 years old who received PAXIL CR at doses ranging from 25 mg to 62.5 mg once daily. Study 3 was a 12-week study in patients 60 to 88 years old who received PAXIL CR at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 50 mg once daily.
Studies 4, 5, and 6 were 10-week studies in patients 19 to 72 years old who received PAXIL CR at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 75 mg once daily.
Study 7 was a 12-week study that enrolled adult patients who received PAXIL CR at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 37.5 mg once daily.
Studies 8, 9, and 10 were 12‑week, placebo‑controlled trials in female patients 18 to 46 years old who received PAXIL CR at doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg once daily. Study 11 was a 12-week placebo‑controlled trial in patients 18 to 46 years old who received PAXIL CR 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses (luteal phase dosing) at doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg once daily.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1125hA23]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to monitor for increased serum creatinine and for increased serum potassium levels when ACEis, ARBs, or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are used, or for hypokalemia when diuretics are used at routine visits and 7–14 days after initiation or after a dose change.

### Thyroid, unspecified (thyroid) [^111e6quD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Tests

Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical evaluation. The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid preparation bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of all thyroid medications except T3. When the total serum T4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T4 levels is warranted. Specific measurements of T4 and T3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine.

### Ivabradine [^117FvMcJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Clinically significant adverse reactions that appear in other sections of the labeling include:

Atrial Fibrillation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Bradycardia and Conduction Disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

Most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 1% of patients are bradycardia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation and luminous phenomena (phosphenes). (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Annora Pharma Private Limited at 1–866–495–1995 or FDA at 1–800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adult Patients with Heart Failure

In SHIFT, safety was evaluated in 3,260 patients treated with ivabradine and 3,278 patients given placebo. The median duration of ivabradine exposure was 21.5 months.

The most common adverse drug reactions in the SHIFT trial are shown in Table 2 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), (5.3)].

Luminous Phenomena (Phosphenes)

Phosphenes are phenomena described as a transiently enhanced brightness in a limited area of the visual field, halos, image decomposition (stroboscopic or kaleidoscopic effects), colored bright lights, or multiple images (retinal persistency). Phosphenes are usually triggered by sudden variations in light intensity. Ivabradine can cause phosphenes, thought to be mediated through ivabradine effects on retinal photoreceptors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Onset is generally within the first 2 months of treatment, after which they may occur repeatedly. Phosphenes were generally reported to be of mild to moderate intensity and led to treatment discontinuation in < 1% of patients; most resolved during or after treatment.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The following adverse reactions have been identified in adults during post-approval use of ivabradine: syncope, hypotension, torsade de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, angioedema, erythema, rash, pruritus, urticaria, vertigo, and diplopia, and visual impairment.

### Citalopram [^1145bCYo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The citalopram dose should be limited in certain populations. The maximum dose should be limited to 20 mg once daily in patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers or those patients receiving concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, since higher citalopram exposures would be expected. The maximum dose should also be limited to 20 mg once daily in patients with hepatic impairment and in patients who are greater than 60 years of age because of expected higher exposures [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4), Drug Interactions (7), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Electrolyte and/or ECG monitoring is recommended in certain circumstances. Patients being considered for treatment with citalopram tablets who are at risk for significant electrolyte disturbances should have baseline serum potassium and magnesium measurements with periodic monitoring. Hypokalemia (and/or hypomagnesemia) may increase the risk of QTc prolongation and arrhythmia, and should be corrected prior to initiation of treatment and periodically monitored. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients for whom citalopram use is not recommended unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks for a particular patient (see above). These include those patients with the cardiac conditions noted above, and those taking other drugs that may prolong the QTc interval.

Discontinue citalopram tablets in patients who are found to have persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms. If patients taking citalopram tablets experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, e.g., dizziness, palpitations, or syncope, the prescriber should initiate further evaluation, including cardiac monitoring.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Alport syndrome, more specifically with respect to kidney function monitoring, ERA/ERN ERKNet/ESPN 2025 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining regular screenings for microhematuria and microalbuminuria using urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio at 1–2-year intervals, along with annual BP monitoring, in asymptomatic adults with heterozygous pathogenic or likely pathogenic COL4A3 or COL4A4 variants. Individualize the screening interval based on age, familial history, and comorbidities.

### Fluoxetine [^114LtSM7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.4 Panic Disorder

The effectiveness of fluoxetine in the treatment of Panic Disorder was demonstrated in 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies of adult outpatients who had a primary diagnosis of Panic Disorder (DSM-IV), with or without agoraphobia.

Study 1 (N = 180 randomized) was a 12-week flexible-dose study. Fluoxetine was initiated at 10 mg/day for the first week, after which patients were dosed in the range of 20 to 60 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and tolerability. A statistically significantly greater percentage of fluoxetine-treated patients were free from panic attacks at endpoint than placebo-treated patients, 42% versus 28%, respectively.

Study 2 (N = 214 randomized) was a 12-week flexible-dose study. Fluoxetine was initiated at 10 mg/day for the first week, after which patients were dosed in a range of 20 to 60 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and tolerability. A statistically significantly greater percentage of fluoxetine-treated patients were free from panic attacks at endpoint than placebo-treated patients, 62% versus 44%, respectively.

### Olodaterol respimat inhalation spray (striverdi respimat) [^113Fft3H]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

The expected signs and symptoms with overdosage of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and occurrence or exaggeration of any of the signs and symptoms, e.g., myocardial ischemia, angina pectoris, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, palpitations, dizziness, nervousness, insomnia, anxiety, headache, tremor, dry mouth, muscle spasms, nausea, fatigue, malaise, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. As with all inhaled sympathomimetic medications, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with an overdose of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT.

Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and supportive therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases of overdosage.

### Tiotropium bromide and olodaterol (stiolto respimat) [^116CsWnV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

STIOLTO RESPIMAT contains both tiotropium bromide and olodaterol; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to STIOLTO RESPIMAT.

Tiotropium

High doses of tiotropium may lead to anticholinergic signs and symptoms. However, there were no systemic anticholinergic adverse effects following a single inhaled dose of up to 282 mcg tiotropium in 6 healthy volunteers. In a study of 12 healthy volunteers, bilateral conjunctivitis and dry mouth were seen following repeated once-daily inhalation of 141 mcg of tiotropium. Dry mouth/throat and dry nasal mucosa occurred in a dose-dependent [10–40 mcg daily] manner, were observed following 14-day dosing of up to 40 mcg tiotropium bromide inhalation solution in healthy subjects.

Olodaterol

The expected signs and symptoms with overdosage of olodaterol are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and occurrence or exaggeration of any of the signs and symptoms, e.g., myocardial ischemia, angina pectoris, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, palpitations, dizziness, nervousness, insomnia, anxiety, headache, tremor, dry mouth, muscle spasms, nausea, fatigue, malaise, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. As with all inhaled sympathomimetic medications, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with an overdose of olodaterol.

Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of STIOLTO RESPIMAT together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and supportive therapy.

### Pindolol [^113uXiE8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In open, long-term studies up to 4 years, no evidence of diminution of the blood pressure lowering response was observed.

An average 3-pound increase in body weight has been noted in patients treated with pindolol tablets alone, a larger increase than was observed with propranolol or placebo. The weight gain appeared unrelated to blood pressure response and was not associated with an increased risk of heart failure, although edema was more common than in control patients. Pindolol tablets do not have a consistent effect on plasma renin activity.

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents has not been established, but several mechanisms have been postulated: 1) an effect on the central nervous system resulting in a reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery, 2) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic receptor sites, leading to decreased cardiac output, 3) an inhibition of renin release. These mechanisms appear less likely for pindolol than other beta-blockers in view of the modest effect on resting cardiac output and renin.

Beta-blockade therapy is useful when it is necessary to suppress the effects of beta-adrenergic agonists in order to achieve therapeutic goals. However, in certain clinical situations, (e.g., cardiac failure, heart block, bronchospasm), the preservation of an adequate sympathetic tone may be necessary to maintain vital functions. Although a beta-antagonist with ISA such as pindolol tablets does not eliminate sympathetic tone entirely, there is no controlled evidence that it is safer than other beta-blockers in such conditions as heart failure, heart block, or bronchospasm or is less likely to cause those conditions. In single-dose studies of the effects of beta-blockers on FEV1, pindolol tablets were indistinguishable from other non-cardioselective agents in its reduction of FEV1, and its reduction in the effectiveness of an exogenous beta-agonist.

Exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction and ventricular dysrhythmias have been reported after abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with coronary artery disease. Abrupt withdrawal of these agents in patients without coronary artery disease has resulted in transient symptoms, including tremulousness, sweating, palpitation, headache, and malaise. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these phenomena, among them increased sensitivity to catecholamines because of increased numbers of beta receptors.

### Exenatide (BYDUREON BCise) [^116gAff1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors

In both genders of rats, exenatide extended-release caused a dose-related and treatment-duration–dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures compared to controls [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. A statistically significant increase in malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in female rats receiving exenatide extended-release at 27-times clinical exposure compared to controls and higher incidences were noted in males above controls in all treated groups at ≥ 2-times clinical exposure. The potential of exenatide extended-release to induce C-cell tumors in mice has not been evaluated. Other glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have also induced thyroid C-cell adenomas and carcinomas in male and female mice and rats at clinically relevant exposures. It is unknown whether BYDUREON BCISE will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as the human relevance of exenatide extended-release-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.

BYDUREON BCISE is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk of MTC with the use of BYDUREON BCISE and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with BYDUREON BCISE. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low specificity of serum calcitonin testing for MTC and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have values > 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

### Epinephrine (adrenalin) [^114hxGJ5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Common adverse reactions to systemically administered epinephrine include anxiety, apprehensiveness, restlessness, tremor, weakness, dizziness, sweating, palpitations, pallor, nausea and vomiting, headache, and respiratory difficulties. These symptoms occur in some persons receiving therapeutic doses of epinephrine, but are more likely to occur in patients with heart disease, hypertension, or hyperthyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

The true incidence of adverse reactions associated with the systemic use of epinephrine is difficult to determine. Adverse reactions reported in observational trials, case reports, and studies are listed below by body system:

Cardiovascular: angina, arrhythmias, hypertension, pallor, palpitations, tachyarrhythmia, tachycardia, vasoconstriction, ventricular ectopy and stress cardiomyopathy.

Rapid rises in blood pressure associated with epinephrine use have produced cerebral hemorrhage, particularly in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Neurological: disorientation, impaired memory, panic, psychomotor agitation, sleepiness, tingling.

Psychiatric: anxiety, apprehensiveness, restlessness.

Other:

Patients with Parkinson's disease may experience psychomotor agitation or a temporary worsening of symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Diabetic patients may experience transient increases in blood sugar.

Injection into the buttock has resulted in cases of gas gangrene [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Rare cases of serious skin and soft tissue infections, including necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis caused by Clostridia (gas gangrene), have been reported following epinephrine injection in the thigh [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Nexterone) [^1176QwGh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Thyroid Abnormalities

NEXTERONE Premixed Injection inhibits peripheral conversion of throxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause increased T3 levels, and increased levels of inactive reverse T3 (rT3) in clinically euthyroid patients. Monitor thyroid function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter, particularly in elderly patients, and in any patient with a history of thyroid nodules, goiter, or other thyroid dysfunction.

Hyperthyroidism may induce arrhythmia breakthrough. If any new signs of arrhythmia appear, the possibility of hyperthyroidism should be considered.

Antithyroid drugs, β-adrenergic blockers, temporary corticosteroid therapy may be necessary to treat the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The action of antithyroid drugs may be delayed in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis because of substantial quantities of preformed thyroid hormones stored in the gland. Radioactive iodine therapy is contraindicated because of the low radioiodine uptake associated with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.

NEXTERONE Premixed Injection induced hyperthyroidism may be followed by a transient period of hypothyroidism. In some clinically hypothyroid amiodarone-treated patients, free thyroxine index values may be normal. Manage hypothyroidism by reducing the dose of or discontinuing amiodarone and thyroid hormone supplementation.

5.10 Neonatal Injury

Amiodarone can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Fetal exposure may increase the potential for adverse experiences including cardiac, thyroid, neurodevelopmental, neurological and growth effects in neonate. Inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus if NEXTERONE Premixed Injection is administered during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking NEXTERONE [see Pregnancy (8.1)].

5.11 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with intravenous amiodarone including shock (sometimes fatal), cardiac arrest, and the following manifestations: hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, cyanosis, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, flushing, hyperhidrosis and cold sweat.

5.12 Phlebitis

Infusion site phlebitis has occurred in patients receiving intravenous amiodarone. Intravenous amiodarone concentrations greater than 3 mg/mL have been associated with a high incidence of peripheral vein phlebitis.

### Thioridazine hydrochloride [^111WBuE4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Certain circumstances may increase the risk of Torsades de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including 1) bradycardia, 2) hypokalemia, 3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval, 4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval, and 5) for thioridazine in particular, its use in patients with reduced activity of P450 2D6 or its coadministration with drugs that may inhibit P450 2D6 or by some other mechanism interfere with the clearance of thioridazine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).

It is recommended that patients being considered for thioridazine treatment have a baseline ECG performed and serum potassium levels measured. Serum potassium should be normalized before initiating treatment and patients with a QTc interval greater than 450 msec should not receive thioridazine treatment. It may also be useful to periodically monitor ECG's and serum potassium during thioridazine treatment, especially during a period of dose adjustment. Thioridazine should be discontinued in patients who are found to have a QTc interval over 500 msec.

Patients taking thioridazine who experience symptoms that may be associated with the occurrence of Torsades de pointes (e.g., dizziness, palpitations, or syncope) may warrant further cardiac evaluation; in particular, Holter monitoring should be considered.

Cannabis and mental health disorders — evidence synthesis: A National Academies review reports moderate evidence that cannabis use is associated with increased risk for the development of depression and social anxiety disorder — but not other anxiety disorders; limited evidence links cannabis use with increased severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety symptoms, and it supported a dose-response effect on suicidality while high quality research on PTSD development or depressive disorder course was found to be lacking. Evidence appears strongest for associations with psychotic symptoms or disorders, particularly among individuals with a genetic predisposition, with a 2014 review rating the cannabis–schizophrenia relationship as "medium" and a synthesis of five fair-to-high quality reviews suggesting a "moderate to large" dose-dependent association with psychotic disorder development. Acute adverse effects — particularly among naive users — may include anxiety, paranoia, suicidal thoughts, and/or panic, are likely exacerbated by higher tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content, may account for up to 25–30% of cannabis-related emergency department visits, and anxiety and depression may also be reported with cannabis withdrawal.

### Octreotide acetate (BYNFEZIA pen) [^112mWejW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Thyroid Function Abnormalities

Octreotide suppresses secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which may result in hypothyroidism. Baseline and periodic assessment of thyroid function (TSH, total, and/or free T4) is recommended during chronic therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

5.5 Steatorrhea and Malabsorption of Dietary Fats

New onset steatorrhea, stool discoloration and loose stools have been reported in patients receiving somatostatin analogs, including octreotide. Somatostatin analogs reversibly inhibit secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile acids, which may result in malabsorption of dietary fats and subsequent symptoms of steatorrhea, loose stools, abdominal bloating, and weight loss. If new occurrence or worsening of these symptoms are reported in patients receiving octreotide, evaluate patients for potential pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and manage accordingly.

5.6 Changes in Vitamin B12 Levels

Depressed vitamin B12levels and abnormal Schilling's tests have been observed in some patients receiving octreotide therapy and monitoring of vitamin B12levels is recommended during BYNFEZIA PEN therapy.

### Siponimod (Mayzent) [^11513cuc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 First Dose Monitoring in Patients With Certain Preexisting Cardiac Conditions

Because initiation of MAYZENT treatment results in a decrease in heart rate (HR), first-dose 6-hour monitoring is recommended for patients with sinus bradycardia [HR less than 55 beats per minute (bpm)], first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

First Dose 6-Hour Monitoring

Administer the first dose of MAYZENT in a setting where resources to appropriately manage symptomatic bradycardia are available. Monitor patients for 6 hours after the first dose for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly pulse and blood pressure measurement. Obtain an ECG in these patients at the end of the Day 1 observation period.

Additional Monitoring After 6-Hour Monitoring

If any of the following abnormalities are present after 6 hours (even in the absence of symptoms), continue monitoring until the abnormality resolves:

The heart rate 6 hours postdose is less than 45 bpm
The heart rate 6 hours postdose is at the lowest value postdose, suggesting that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect on the heart may not have occurred
The ECG 6 hours postdose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block

If post-dose symptomatic bradycardia, bradyarrhythmia, or conduction-related symptoms occur, or if ECG 6 hours post-dose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block or QTc greater than or equal to 500 msec, initiate appropriate management, begin continuous ECG monitoring, and continue monitoring until the symptoms have resolved if no pharmacological treatment is required. If pharmacological treatment is required, continue monitoring overnight and repeat 6-hour monitoring after the second dose.

Advice from a cardiologist should be sought to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy (which may include overnight monitoring) during treatment initiation, if treatment with MAYZENT is considered in patients:

With some preexisting heart and cerebrovascular conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
With a prolonged QTc interval before dosing or during the 6-hour observation, or at additional risk for QT prolongation, or on concurrent therapy with QT prolonging drugs with a known risk of torsades de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]
Receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that slow heart rate or AV conduction [see Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)]

### Liraglutide (Saxenda) [^111RxiP3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors

Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether SAXENDA will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and liraglutide use in humans.

SAXENDA is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of SAXENDA and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with SAXENDA. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC, and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values greater than 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

5.2 Acute Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including liraglutide [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. After initiation of SAXENDA, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue SAXENDA and initiate appropriate management.

### Dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate [^117CUnvS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Cardiac Effects

Dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate causes dose-dependent QTc prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. QT prolongation can cause torsades de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia, with the risk increasing as the degree of prolongation increases. When initiating dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate in patients at risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, electrocardiographic (ECG) evaluation of QT interval should be conducted at baseline and 3 to 4 hours after the first dose. This includes patients concomitantly taking/initiating drugs that prolong the QT interval or that are strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, and patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) or left ventricular dysfunction (LVD). LVH and LVD are more likely to be present in patients with chronic hypertension, known coronary artery disease, or history of stroke. LVH and LVD can be diagnosed utilizing echocardiography or another suitable cardiac imaging modality.

Strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors include, but are not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil.

Reevaluate ECG if risk factors for arrhythmia change during the course of treatment with dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate. Risk factors include concomitant use of drugs associated with QT prolongation, electrolyte abnormality (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), bradycardia, and family history of QT abnormality. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia should be corrected prior to initiation of therapy with dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate, and should be monitored during treatment.

If patients taking dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, e.g., syncope or palpitations, dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate should be discontinued and the patient further evaluated.

### Citalopram (Citalopram hydrobromide) [^113Ab6Aw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The citalopram dose should be limited in certain populations. The maximum dose should be limited to 20 mg/day in patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers or those patients who may be taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, since higher citalopram exposures would be expected. The maximum dose should also be limited to 20 mg/day in patients with hepatic impairment and in patients who are greater than 60 years of age because of expected higher exposures.

Electrolyte and/or ECG monitoring is recommended in certain circumstances. Patients being considered for citalopram treatment who are at risk for significant electrolyte disturbances should have baseline serum potassium and magnesium measurements with periodic monitoring. Hypokalemia (and/or hypomagnesemia) may increase the risk of QTc prolongation and arrhythmia, and should be corrected prior to initiation of treatment and periodically monitored. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients for whom citalopram use is not recommended (see above), but, nevertheless, considered essential. These include those patients with the cardiac conditions noted above, and those taking other drugs that may prolong the QTc interval.

Citalopram should be discontinued in patients who are found to have persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms. If patients taking citalopram experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, e.g., dizziness, palpitations, or syncope, the prescriber should initiate further evaluation, including cardiac monitoring.

### Levothyroxine sodium [^117NCGh2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolism – T4is slowly eliminated. The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately eighty percent of circulating T3is derived from peripheral T4by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4and T3, with T4deiodination also occurring at a number of additional sites, including the kidney and other tissues. Approximately 80% of the daily dose of T4is deiodinated to yield equal amounts of T3and reverse T3(r T3). T3and r T3are further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation.

Elimination – Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged, where it is hydrolyzed and eliminated in feces as the free hormones. Urinary excretion of T4decreases with age.

### Levothyroxine and liothyronine (adthyza thyroid) [^1165V6m1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Tests

Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical evaluation. The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid preparation bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of all thyroid medications except T3. When the total serum T4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T4 levels is warranted. Specific measurements of T4 and T3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine.

Drug Interactions

Oral Anticoagulants

Thyroid hormones appear to increase catabolism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. If oral anticoagulants are also being given, compensatory increases in clotting factor synthesis are impaired. Patients stabilized on oral anticoagulants who are found to require thyroid replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started. If a patient is truly hypothyroid, it is likely that a reduction in anticoagulant dosage will be required. No special precautions appear to be necessary when oral anticoagulant therapy is begun in a patient already stabilized on maintenance thyroid replacement therapy.

Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemics

Initiating thyroid replacement therapy may cause increases in insulin or oral hypoglycemic requirements. The effects seen are poorly understood and depend upon a variety of factors such as dose and type of thyroid preparations and endocrine status of the patient. Patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemics should be closely watched during initiation of thyroid replacement therapy.

Cholestyramine or Colestipol

Cholestyramine or colestipol binds both levothyroxine (T4) and liothyronine (T3) in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones. In vitro studies indicate that the binding is not easily removed. Therefore four to five hours should elapse between administration of cholestyramine or colestipol and thyroid hormones.

Estrogen, Oral Contraceptives

Estrogens tend to increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBg). In a patient with a nonfunctioning thyroid gland who is receiving thyroid replacement therapy, free levothyroxine (T4) may be decreased when estrogens are started thus increasing thyroid requirements. However, if the patient's thyroid gland has sufficient function, the decreased free levothyroxine (T4) will result in a compensatory increase in levothyroxine (T4) output by the thyroid. Therefore, patients without a functioning thyroid gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if estrogens or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Safety data for Paroxetine HCL CR is from 11 short-term, placebo‑controlled clinical trials including 3 studies in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1, 2, and 3), 3 studies in patients with panic disorder (PD) (Studies 4, 5, and 6), 1 study in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) (Study 7), and 4 studies in female patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) (Studies 8, 9, 10, and 11) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. These 11 trials included 1627 patients treated with Paroxetine HCL CR.

Studies 1 and 2 were 12-week studies that enrolled patients 18 to 65 years old who received Paroxetine HCL CR at doses ranging from 25 mg to 62.5 mg once daily. Study 3 was a 12-week study in patients 60 to 88 years old who received Paroxetine HCL CR at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 50 mg once daily.
Studies 4, 5, and 6 were 10-week studies in patients 19 to 72 years old who received Paroxetine HCL CR at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 75 mg once daily.
Study 7 was a 12-week study that enrolled adult patients who received Paroxetine HCL CR at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 37.5 mg once daily.
Studies 8, 9, and 10 were 12‑week, placebo‑controlled trials in female patients 18 to 46 years old who received Paroxetine HCL CR at doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg once daily. Study 11 was a 12-week placebo‑controlled trial in patients 18 to 46 years old who received Paroxetine HCL CR 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses (luteal phase dosing) at doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg once daily.

### Hypothyroidism: a review [^113Titvo]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypothyroidism:

- **Definition**: Hypothyroidism is a chronic endocrine disease associated with the deficiency of thyroxine and T3 thyroid hormones.
- **Pathophysiology**: Hypothyroidism is most frequently caused by a failure of the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones (99%). Other causes include the underproduction of TSH by the pituitary gland and deficiency of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism in the US is estimated at 300 per 100,000 population and 4,300 per 100,000 population, respectively. Hypothyroidism is 2–8 times more prevalent in women than men, and it's prevalence increases with age.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include weight gain, fatigue, proximal weakness, decreased concentration, depression, diffuse muscle pain, menstrual irregularities, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, and sensory neuropathy. A severe form of hypothyroidism-myxedema coma- presents with altered mental status, hypothermia, hyponatremia and bradycardia. The disease decreases productivity and QoL.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Hypothyroidism is not associated with an increase in mortality. Treatment is well tolerated and results in improved QoL in most patients. However, untreated hypothyroidism leads to disease progression and ultimately, coma and death.

Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 4 Years of Age

The effectiveness of levetiracetam for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients was established in one multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 5), conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial seizures, uncontrolled by standard epileptic drugs (AEDs). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 to 2 AEDs, who experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either levetiracetam or placebo. The enrolled population included 116 patients (levetiracetam N = 60, placebo N = 56) with refractory partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows: 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N = 4 treated with levetiracetam), 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N = 8 treated with levetiracetam), 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N = 20 treated with levetiracetam), and 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N = 28 treated with levetiracetam). The study consisted of a 5-day evaluation period which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Levetiracetam dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in average daily partial-onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central reader using a 48-hour video EEG performed during the last two days of the 4-day maintenance period. A total of 109 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A statistically significant difference between levetiracetam and placebo was observed (see Figure 5). The treatment effect associated with levetiracetam was consistent across age groups.

### Thyroid, porcine (Armour thyroid) [^114AzbBq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Information for the Patient —

Patients on thyroid hormone preparations and parents of children on thyroid therapy should be informed that:

1. Replacement therapy is to be taken essentially for life, with the exception of cases of transient hypothyroidism, usually associated with thyroiditis, and in those patients receiving a therapeutic trial of the drug.

2. They should immediately report during the course of therapy any signs or symptoms of thyroid hormone toxicity, e.g., chest pain, increased pulse rate, palpitations, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, nervousness, or any other unusual event.

3. In case of concomitant diabetes mellitus, the daily dosage of antidiabetic medication may need readjustment as thyroid hormone replacement is achieved. If thyroid medication is stopped, a downward readjustment of the dosage of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent may be necessary to avoid hypoglycemia. At all times, close monitoring of urinary glucose levels is mandatory in such patients.

4. In case of concomitant oral anticoagulant therapy, the prothrombin time should be measured frequently to determine if the dosage of oral anticoagulants is to be readjusted.

5. Instruct patients to discontinue biotin or any biotin-containing supplements for at least 2 days before thyroid function testing is conducted.

6. Partial loss of hair may be experienced by children in the first few months of thyroid therapy, but this is usually a transient phenomenon and later recovery is usually the rule.

Laboratory Tests —

Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical evaluation. The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid preparation bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of all thyroid medications except T3. When the total serum T4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T4 levels is warranted. Specific measurements of T4 and T3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine.

### Dulaglutide (Trulicity) [^113SAKhe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors

In male and female rats, dulaglutide causes a dose-related and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) after lifetime exposure [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have induced thyroid C-cell adenomas and carcinomas in mice and rats at clinically relevant exposures. It is unknown whether TRULICITY will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of dulaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

One case of MTC was reported in a patient treated with TRULICITY in a clinical trial. This patient had pretreatment calcitonin levels approximately 8 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). An additional case of C-cell hyperplasia with elevated calcitonin levels following treatment was reported in the cardiovascular outcomes trial (REWIND). Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.

TRULICITY is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of TRULICITY and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g. a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with TRULICITY. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin values may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values > 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^114kdfou]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering erythromycin in patients with GP.
Recognize that erythromycin improves symptoms of GP due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than a direct antiemetic effect. Recognize that erythromycin's effects on symptoms and gastric motility are through its motilin receptor agonist properties and are unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Administer low doses, such as 40–150 mg PO, 30 minutes before meals, to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses, such as 250–500 mg. Use erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension to administer smaller, better-tolerated doses, as erythromycin tablets are only available in high doses. Recognize that tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use of erythromycin; maintain efficacy using drug holidays, such as 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy. Be aware of safety concerns with erythromycin, including the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use, drug interactions as it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor, and QT-prolongation. Consider using azithromycin as a substitute for erythromycin, with similar safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance.
