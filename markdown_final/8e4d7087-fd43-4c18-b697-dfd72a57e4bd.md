## Question

lower back pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing lower back pain, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and its burden. Then, I should verify the diagnostic triage framework and red flags. Next, I will review the focused history and examination, followed by when to image and when not to image. After that, I need to classify the pain phenotype and prognosis. Then, I will outline first-line management for acute, subacute, and chronic non-specific low back pain, including pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic options. Finally, I should consider special populations, implementation gaps, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure each step is supported by high-quality sources and that I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its scope. Low back pain is pain between the lower ribs and gluteal folds, and most cases are non-specific, meaning no identifiable pathoanatomical cause is found, accounting for roughly 80–90% of presentations, which aligns with contemporary epidemiology and guideline framing [^111u7ABT] [^115NutWU]. Hold on, I should verify the burden claim: yes, low back pain remains the leading global cause of years lived with disability, with a point prevalence near 7.8% and rising fastest in low- and middle-income countries, underscoring the need for high-value, guideline-concordant care [^113XbUP3] [^112PiHY2].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic triage framework. I need to ensure I separate non-specific low back pain from radicular pain and from serious pathology using a red flag–based approach, because only a small minority harbor fracture, infection, malignancy, or cauda equina syndrome, and missing these carries substantial harm [^111u7ABT] [^114LwQnw]. Wait, let me verify the red flags I'm listing against a high-credibility source: the VA/DoD guideline enumerates cauda equina features, infection risks, fracture risks, and cancer features, which matches the canonical set I plan to use for triage and escalation decisions [^111QmWoY] [^1165KgWy].

> I will now examine the focused history and physical examination. I need to check for pain location and radiation, onset and course, aggravating and relieving factors, prior episodes, and functional impact, while screening for the red flags above and psychosocial drivers such as fear-avoidance, catastrophizing, and depression, which predict chronicity and disability [^111u7ABT] [^113XbUP3]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse mental health screening as part of routine evaluation; yes, the VA/DoD recommends mental health screening and considering psychosocial factors in treatment selection, reinforcing the biopsychosocial model in practice [^1165KgWy].

> For the physical examination, let me think about what is essential and what is low yield. I should confirm that a focused neurologic exam including strength, sensation, reflexes, and straight leg raise is appropriate, while avoiding low-yield tests like palpatory tenderness or provocative maneuvers that do not change management in non-specific cases, and I should document any neurologic deficits or gait abnormalities that would shift triage toward imaging or referral [^114FkcQK] [^115G2Ryv]. Wait, I initially thought palpation might help localize a pain generator, but I need to correct that impulse; in non-specific low back pain, such findings rarely alter management and can distract from high-yield assessments and education [^112kaxsD].

> Now, imaging decisions. I should double-check the principle: do not routinely image uncomplicated acute non-specific low back pain without red flags, because imaging rarely changes outcomes and may provoke harm through incidental findings and downstream procedures [^114TUFYz] [^1165S5xV]. Let me verify the magnitude of overuse: systematic reviews show roughly one in four primary care patients and one in three emergency department patients get imaged, with complex imaging rising over time despite guideline advice, which reinforces the need for stewardship and patient education [^111o9SBv]. But wait, what if the patient insists on imaging? I need to ensure shared decision-making that explains the lack of benefit and potential harms, and reserve imaging for progressive neurologic deficits, suspected serious pathology, or failure of conservative care beyond about 4–6 weeks when the pretest probability of a surgically actionable lesion rises [^114TUFYz] [^1165S5xV].

> Next, I should review classification and prognosis. Let me verify the categories: acute less than 6 weeks, subacute 6–12 weeks, and chronic beyond 12 weeks, with the acknowledgment that many patients follow a recurrent trajectory rather than a linear recovery, which shapes expectations and follow-up planning [^111u7ABT] [^112BMibx]. I should confirm prognosis: most acute episodes improve substantially within 6 weeks, yet about two-thirds still report pain at 3–12 months, and risk of chronicity is higher with high initial pain intensity, psychological distress, and multisite pain, which supports early stratified care and psychosocial interventions [^111u7ABT] [^111XafBa].

> For acute non-specific low back pain, I need to ensure first-line management is conservative and education-first. Advice to stay active as tolerated, avoid bed rest, and provide clear reassurance about the favorable natural history are foundational, and I should pair this with simple analgesia such as NSAIDs as needed, noting that benefits are modest and primarily facilitative of activity rather than disease-modifying [^111u7ABT] [^111o4mKT]. Wait, let me verify the role of exercise in acute non-specific pain; the updated Cochrane review suggests very low certainty of clinically relevant benefit versus sham or no treatment in the short term, so I should frame exercise as optional early on and escalate if symptoms persist, aligning with a stepped care model [^111uTyi9] [^115NutWU].

> For subacute low back pain, I should confirm that persistent symptoms warrant structured rehabilitation. Supervised exercise therapy, manual therapy, and cognitive-behavioral approaches can reduce pain and disability, and I should consider stratified models such as the Keele STarT Back tool to tailor intensity to risk of persistent symptoms, which improves outcomes and cost-effectiveness in primary care [^111u7ABT] [^111YhYd1]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse psychologically informed physical therapy; yes, contemporary guidelines emphasize addressing fear-avoidance and catastrophizing within rehabilitation frameworks to mitigate chronicity risk [^111u7ABT].

> For chronic non-specific low back pain, I need to ensure a multidisciplinary, nonpharmacologic core with selective pharmacologic adjuncts. Exercise therapy remains first-line with clinically meaningful average improvements in pain and function, and I should match the modality to patient preference and baseline characteristics, as subgroups may benefit differentially from strength, motor control, or aerobic approaches [^112zjBS5] [^111cqLeK]. Let me reconsider pharmacologic options: NSAIDs can be used judiciously, and duloxetine is a reasonable next step for persistent symptoms, while opioids should generally be avoided; I should also consider acupuncture as a conditional option given small-to-moderate effects versus no treatment but limited advantage over sham in some analyses [^114ULniU]. I should confirm that interventional procedures and surgery are reserved for carefully selected refractory cases after exhaustive conservative care, given limited and heterogeneous evidence and potential harms [^1144ayFA].

> Special populations require tailored thinking. In older adults, I need to maintain a high index of suspicion for fracture, malignancy, and spinal stenosis, and remember that structural abnormalities on imaging are common even in asymptomatic individuals, so clinical correlation is paramount before attributing causality [^114LwQnw] [^115rVAJa]. In children and adolescents, most back pain is non-specific, but I should exclude serious pathology and consider unique entities such as spondylolysis, guided by careful history and examination rather than routine imaging [^114V4zw9]. For individuals with achondroplasia, chronic limb and lower back pain are common and warrant proactive assessment and management planning within a multidisciplinary context [^116ah69D].

> I should double-check implementation gaps and how to address them. Overimaging remains prevalent despite strong recommendations, and quality improvement initiatives show that multicomponent strategies with clinical decision support and feedback can reduce inappropriate imaging, though sustaining gains requires ongoing prompts and system-level reinforcement [^111o9SBv] [^111MDypC]. But wait, patient expectations often drive imaging requests, so I need to invest time in education that reframes back pain as a common, self-limited condition and clarifies that imaging rarely changes treatment, using decision aids and shared decision-making to align care with evidence [^114TUFYz] [^11581kLH].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical decision pathway and sanity-check it against guidelines. Start with red flag screening and focused history and exam; if no red flags, avoid imaging and initiate education, activity, and simple analgesia for acute symptoms; reassess at 2–4 weeks and escalate to structured physical therapy and psychosocial interventions if not improving; reserve imaging and specialty referral for persistent deficits, progressive neurologic compromise, or failure of conservative care; throughout, embed risk stratification and address modifiable prognostic factors to prevent chronicity and recurrence [^1165KgWy] [^111u7ABT] [^115NutWU]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with stepped, stratified care principles; yes, this approach mirrors contemporary guideline frameworks emphasizing triage, minimal early intervention, and targeted escalation based on risk and response [^115NutWU] [^111u7ABT].

Lower back pain is most often **non-specific and self-limited** [^111u7ABT], with 90% of cases resolving within 6 weeks [^112wRCco]; however, recurrence is common and a minority develop chronic pain [^113XbUP3]. Evaluation should focus on **red flags** (malignancy, infection, fracture, cauda equina) [^111QmWoY] and neurologic deficits [^1165KgWy]; routine imaging is not indicated without these features [^114TUFYz] [^1165S5xV]. First-line management is **conservative**, emphasizing education, activity, and NSAIDs or muscle relaxants for short-term relief [^111u7ABT] [^111o4mKT]; opioids are not first-line and surgery is reserved for refractory cases with clear indications [^116MmT2N]. Persistent or severe cases warrant **targeted imaging** and specialist referral [^1165KgWy].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

- **Prevalence**: Low back pain affects approximately 7.3% of the global population at any given time, with a lifetime prevalence of 70–84% [^1118scP2].
- **Risk factors**: Occupational hazards (heavy lifting, prolonged sitting), obesity, smoking, psychological distress, and sedentary lifestyle [^113XbUP3] [^111PBmET].
- **Chronicity**: About 23% of cases become chronic, defined as pain persisting beyond three months [^1118scP2].

---

## Clinical presentation and classification

Low back pain is classified by **duration and etiology**:

| **Classification** | **Duration** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute | < 6 weeks | - Most cases are self-limited <br/> - Often non-specific [^111u7ABT] |
| Subacute | 6–12 weeks | - Transition phase <br/> - Risk of chronicity increases [^notfound] |
| Chronic | > 12 weeks | - Persistent pain <br/> - Often multifactorial <br/> - May require multidisciplinary care [^111u7ABT] |

---

Non-specific low back pain accounts for **~90% of cases**, with no identifiable structural cause [^111u7ABT] [^115NutWU].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### History and physical examination

History should characterize pain (location, duration, intensity, aggravating/relieving factors), screen for **red flags** (malignancy, infection, fracture, cauda equina syndrome) [^111QmWoY], and assess neurologic symptoms (radiculopathy, weakness, sensory changes) [^1165KgWy]. The **physical examination** includes inspection, palpation, range of motion, neurologic assessment (motor strength, sensory testing, reflexes), and special tests (straight leg raise, femoral nerve stretch) [^114FkcQK].

---

### Imaging and laboratory tests

Imaging is not routinely indicated for acute non-specific low back pain without **red flags** [^114TUFYz] [^1165S5xV]. MRI or CT is reserved for persistent symptoms (> 6 weeks) with red flags or when surgery is contemplated [^1165KgWy]. Laboratory tests are generally unnecessary unless infection or inflammatory disease is suspected [^1165KgWy].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

- **Education and reassurance**: Emphasize the benign nature of most cases, encourage activity, and avoid bed rest [^111u7ABT] [^115NutWU].
- **Physical therapy**: Exercise therapy, including aerobic activities, strength training, and flexibility exercises, is effective in reducing pain and disability [^112zjBS5] [^111cqLeK].
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: NSAIDs and muscle relaxants are first-line for short-term relief; opioids are not recommended for routine use due to limited efficacy and potential harms [^113L7mAU] [^111o4mKT].

---

### Interventional and surgical management

Interventional procedures such as epidural steroid injections may provide **short-term relief** for radiculopathy but do not improve long-term outcomes [^113naTCY]. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases with clear indications, such as persistent radiculopathy or spinal instability [^116MmT2N].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **generally favorable**, with most acute cases resolving within 6 weeks [^111u7ABT]; however, recurrence is common, occurring in 24–33% of cases. Chronic low back pain affects approximately 23% of the population and significantly impacts quality of life and functionality [^1118scP2].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Exercise**: Regular physical activity, including core strengthening and flexibility exercises, reduces the risk of recurrence [^notfound].
- **Ergonomics**: Proper lifting techniques and workplace ergonomics minimize occupational risk factors [^notfound].
- **Weight management**: Maintaining a healthy weight reduces mechanical stress on the spine [^notfound].

---

Lower back pain is a common, often self-limited condition; **most cases resolve with conservative care**, though recurrence is common. Persistent or severe cases may require targeted imaging and specialist referral.

### What low back pain is and why we need to pay attention [^113XbUP3]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Low back pain is a very common symptom. It occurs in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries and all age groups from children to the elderly population. Globally, years lived with disability caused by low back pain increased by 54% between 1990 and 2015, mainly because of population increase and ageing, with the biggest increase seen in low-income and middle-income countries. Low back pain is now the leading cause of disability worldwide. For nearly all people with low back pain, it is not possible to identify a specific nociceptive cause. Only a small proportion of people have a well understood pathological cause-eg, a vertebral fracture, malignancy, or infection. People with physically demanding jobs, physical and mental comorbidities, smokers, and obese individuals are at greatest risk of reporting low back pain. Disabling low back pain is over-represented among people with low socioeconomic status. Most people with new episodes of low back pain recover quickly; however, recurrence is common and in a small proportion of people, low back pain becomes persistent and disabling. Initial high pain intensity, psychological distress, and accompanying pain at multiple body sites increases the risk of persistent disabling low back pain. Increasing evidence shows that central pain-modulating mechanisms and pain cognitions have important roles in the development of persistent disabling low back pain. Cost, health-care use, and disability from low back pain vary substantially between countries and are influenced by local culture and social systems, as well as by beliefs about cause and effect. Disability and costs attributed to low back pain are projected to increase in coming decades, in particular in low-income and middle-income countries, where health and other systems are often fragile and not equipped to cope with this growing burden. Intensified research efforts and global initiatives are clearly needed to address the burden of low back pain as a public health problem.

### Analgesia for non-specific low back pain [^111u7ABT]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

What is low back pain?

Low back pain (synonymous with "primary" low back pain) is pain felt between the lower ribs and the buttocks. This differs from radicular low back pain, which is when a spinal nerve root is affected, resulting in pain that extends down the legs. Approximately 90% of cases are non-specific, meaning a specific cause has not been identified. The causes of the remaining 10%, affecting around < 1 in 100 in primary careand about 5 in 100 in emergency departments, include fractures, infections, malignancies, inflammatory disorders such as spondylarthritis, spinal stenosis, or non-spinal problems such as kidney problems or menstrual related pain.

The prognosis for a new episode of non-specific low back pain is good. Most people recover from acute low back pain within a few weeks irrespective of any treatment. Some people, however, develop chronic low back pain (typically defined as symptoms lasting for over three months), either as a fluctuating/recurring or continuous problem. Of those who present to primary care with acute low back pain, a quarter will have some ongoing pain or functional impairment at three months (chronic pain), although the estimates from individual studies range widely from 2% to 48%.

2. Low back pain is still the number one cause of disability in the world

Low back pain is a common problem affecting all age groups from children to the elderly. While highly disabling in only a very small proportion of those affected, its high prevalence means that in 2015, low back pain was responsible for 60·1 million disability-adjusted life-years; a 54% increase since 1990, with the biggest increase seen in low-income and middle-income countries. In the latest data from the Global Burden of Disease Project published in 2017, the global point prevalence of low back pain was 7.8%, meaning that 577 million people are affected at any one time. Focusing on Africa, a 2018 systematic review (65 studies) found the lifetime, annual, and point prevalence of low back pain was 47% (95% confidence interval [CI] 37–58), 57% (95% CI 51–63) and 39% (95% CI 30–47), respectively, comparable or higher than what has been observed in population studies in high income countries.

### Pain and the brain: lower back pain [^117ULrRc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic lower back pain is a common and frequently disabling problem, but an organic cause cannot always be identified. Pain often co-occurs with mood and anxiety disorders, but when patients present with somatic symptoms in the primary care setting, clinicians often overlook mood and anxiety symptoms. Because appropriate treatment includes both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies, a team approach that includes both mental health and primary care professionals is warranted to alleviate the patient's pain, manage psychiatric comorbidities, and improve the patient's functioning and quality of life. Additionally, when prescribing pain medication, clinicians should monitor patients for substance misuse.

### Low back pain: a call for action [^112k5uDi]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Low back pain is the leading worldwide cause of years lost to disability and its burden is growing alongside the increasing and ageing population. 1 Because these population shifts are more rapid in low-income and middle-income countries, where adequate resources to address the problem might not exist, the effects will probably be more extreme in these regions. Most low back pain is unrelated to specific identifiable spinal abnormalities, and our Viewpoint, the third paper in this Lancet Series, 2,3 is a call for action on this global problem of low back pain.

### Low back pain [^116MmT2N]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Low back pain is a common problem that is the leading cause of disability and is associated with high costs. Evaluation focuses on identification of risk factors indicating a serious underlying condition and increased risk for persistent disabling symptoms in order to guide selective use of diagnostic testing (including imaging) and treatments. Nonpharmacologic therapies, including exercise and psychosocial management, are preferred for most patients with low back pain and may be supplemented with adjunctive drug therapies. Surgery and interventional procedures are options in a minority of patients who do not respond to standard treatments.

### Expenditures and health care utilization among adults with newly diagnosed low back and lower extremity pain [^111Kdqz9]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the nationwide patterns of health care utilization in patients newly diagnosed with low back and lower extremity pain?

Findings

In this cohort study of nearly 2.5 million US patients diagnosed with low back or lower extremity pain between 2008 and 2015, only 1.2% received surgery, but this subset of patients accounted for 29.3% of total 12-month costs. Many received care inconsistent with guidelines, such as early imaging.

Meaning

The findings suggest that few patients with new episodes of low back or lower extremity pain progress to surgery, and overimaging of low back or lower extremity pain is associated with a significant, avoidable cost burden for a condition that is typically self-limited.

---

### Non-specific low back pain [^115NutWU]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Non-specific low back pain affects people of all ages and is a leading contributor to disease burden worldwide. Management guidelines endorse triage to identify the rare cases of low back pain that are caused by medically serious pathology, and so require diagnostic work-up or specialist referral, or both. Because non-specific low back pain does not have a known pathoanatomical cause, treatment focuses on reducing pain and its consequences. Management consists of education and reassurance, analgesic medicines, non-pharmacological therapies, and timely review. The clinical course of low back pain is often favourable, thus many patients require little if any formal medical care. Two treatment strategies are currently used, a stepped approach beginning with more simple care that is progressed if the patient does not respond, and the use of simple risk prediction methods to individualise the amount and type of care provided. The overuse of imaging, opioids, and surgery remains a widespread problem.

### Triage for nonspecific lower-back pain [^112QNZGQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Unremitting lower-back pain has long been a costly and personally devastating problem in society. Guidelines for the treatment of lower-back pain have provided evidence-based recommendations to help identify patients who will benefit from specific types of treatment in an effort to reduce costs and human suffering. However, there is little evidence that these guidelines are being applied in the daily practice of health care providers. Practical information is required to assist health care providers in triaging patients for specific treatments so that interventions can be targeted only to those who need them. In this way, iatrogenic complications and unnecessary costs can be contained. This chapter provides information on how to triage the patient with nonspecific lower-back pain for optimal care. The recommendations are supported by evidence-based guidelines, and when these are not available, best practice principles. Because appropriate treatment varies depending on the length of time a patient is suffering from lower-back pain, the chapter is divided into recommendations for acute, subacute, chronic and recurrent phases of lower-back pain.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of low back pain [^111PBmET]. Journal of Pain Research (2012). Low credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) is amongst the top ten most common conditions presenting to primary care clinicians in the ambulatory setting. Further, it accounts for a significant amount of health care expenditure; indeed, over one third of all disability dollars spent in the United States is attributable to low back pain. In most cases, acute low back pain is a self-limiting disease. There are many evidence-based guidelines for the management of LBP. The most common risk factor for development of LBP is previous LBP, heavy physical work, and psychosocial risk factors. Management of LBP includes identification of red flags, exclusion of specific secondary causes, and comprehensive musculoskeletal/neurological examination of the lower extremities. In uncomplicated LBP, imaging is unnecessary unless symptoms become protracted. Reassurance that LBP will likely resolve and advice to maintain an active lifestyle despite LBP are the cornerstones of management. Medications are provided not because they change the natural history of the disorder, but rather because they enhance the ability of the patient to become more active, and in some cases, to sleep better. The most commonly prescribed medications include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and muscle relaxants. Although NSAIDs are a chemically diverse class, their similarities, efficacy, tolerability, and adverse effect profile have more similarities than differences. The most common side effects of NSAIDs are gastrointestinal. Agents with cyclo-oxygenase 2 selectivity are associated with reduced gastrointestinal bleeding, but problematic increases in adverse cardiovascular outcomes continue to spark concern. Fortunately, short-term use of NSAIDs for LBP is generally both safe and effective. This review will focus on the role of NSAIDs in the management of LBP.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^111hB52Z]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis & Treatment of Low Back Pain — diagnostic questions: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against obtaining laboratory tests to assess for inflammatory disease in patients with sacroiliac joint pain (Grade of Recommendation: I). For pain diagram findings, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address these questions, and for assessment tools or questionnaires to identify the cause of acute, subacute or chronic low back pain, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question. For whether certain history and physical examination findings would warrant obtaining advanced imaging studies, a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question; however, the Work Group Consensus Statement notes that in the absence of reliable evidence, it is the work group's opinion that, in patients with severe and intractable pain syndromes who have failed medical/interventional treatment, advanced imaging may be indicated, and that subgroups have shown higher or lower incidences of radiographic abnormalities based on acuity, tenderness to palpation and provocation maneuvers, but the utility of these findings in guiding treatment is not clear.

### Awareness of the German population of common available guidelines of how to cope with lower back pain [^1111BbGN]. Pain Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Several countries developed guidelines in order to provide a systematic approach for treatment of (chronic) lower back pain. The risk of suffering from (chronic) lower back pain differs significantly within the general population. A serious lack of research exists concerning the risk factor "dysfunctional behavior of the subjects in terms of acute lower back pain".

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge of the German population regarding the availability of guidelines about managing lower back pain.

Study Design

Prospective observational cohort study.

Setting

We interviewed 983 subjects by phone. The study population included 50–70-year-old men and women with German residency and sufficient language ability.

Results

Of all the subjects, 70.2% claimed that they suffered at least once in their lifetime with lower back pain. Lower back pain with radiating symptoms occurred in 28.7%. Women were affected significantly more frequently compared to the epidemiological data. Of all the subjects with lower education, 82.9% suffered from lower back pain at least once in their lifetime compared to only 62.4% of people with university degrees. Education was also a protective factor for lower back pain with radiating pain. People who completed secondary modern school were 42% less likely to suffer from lower back pain than those who did not graduate. Knowing active rules of conduct occurred significantly more often at higher educational levels (i.e. all kinds of sports and exercises requiring physical strength, flexibility, power, agility, coordination, grace, balance and control, in particular stretching exercises) odds ratio = 7.78, physical activities odds ratio = 3.92, relaxation exercises odds ratio = 3.51).

Limitations

Data acquisition was performed by an external company and therefore provided only limited options for external validity. Furthermore data acquisition was restricted to 50–70-year-old patients, since this age group is at higher risk of suffering from lower back pain. A conclusion upon the knowledge of the whole population has to be drawn with caution, especially when considering the size of the study population. The life-time prevalence of lower back pain was assessed by interviewing patients about prior episodes of lower back pain. Slightly biased results may have occurred since the memory of prior episodes might result in too many or too few episodes.

Conclusion

The study revealed a lack of awareness of common available guidelines and an uneven distribution of existing knowledge throughout the population. Passive coping strategies like taking pain medication or ointment therapy were favored over active coping strategies like gymnastics, physical activities, and relaxation exercises. Respondents with a higher level of education suffered significantly less often from lower back pain and tended toward active treatment strategies. Respondents with lower levels of education more often demanded passive treatment strategies. The general population, especially those with lower education, is not sufficiently aware of behavioral strategies for managing lower back pain as proposed in available guidelines.

### Lumbar spine MRI for low back pain: indications and yield [^116i7t8Z]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Low back pain is one of the most common causes of physician visits in the United States with an enormous socioeconomic burden. Because of this burden, numerous studies have focused on its diagnosis and management. New technologies have been quickly adopted with the hope that they will improve our understanding of the physiopathology of the disease and assist us in alleviating patients' pain and discomfort. Unfortunately, previous studies have not been able to show that higher utilization of advanced imaging technology is associated with improvements in patient outcome. This article highlights practices that are evidence-based versus those that are common, or heterogeneous, but not supported by existing evidence. We also highlight outstanding areas for further research.

Conclusion

Clinicians and researchers should be encouraged to follow standardized practices in accordance with evidence-based medicine guidelines. The use of such guidelines will decrease variation in care, allowing researchers to more easily design and conduct comparative effectiveness studies of diagnostic imaging.

Acute low back pain, defined as less than 6 weeks in duration, does not require imaging in the absence of "red flags" that may indicate a cause, such as fracture, infection, or malignancy. When imaging is indicated, it is important to rule out a host of abnormalities that may be responsible for the pain and any associated symptoms. A common mnemonic VINDICATE can help ensure a thorough consideration of the possible causes.

Diagnosis & treatment of low back pain — diagnostic question scope: Diagnosis Question 3 asks whether, in patients with acute low back pain, there are history or physical examination findings that would predict that an episode will resolve within one month; Diagnosis Question 6 asks what patient characteristics increase or decrease the risk of developing chronic low back pain after an acute episode; Diagnosis Question 9 asks whether a psychological evaluation assists with identifying patients with low back pain who are at risk for developing chronic pain or disability. The work group considered these questions together as the vast majority of the literature evaluating the conversion from acute to chronic pain combined various demographic, social, psychological and physical examination findings in predictive models.

### Low back pain [^114GS117]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Low back pain affects individuals of all ages and is a leading contributor to disease burden worldwide. Despite advancements in assessment and treatment methods, the management of low back pain remains a challenge for researchers and clinicians alike. One reason for the limited success in identifying effective treatments is the large variation in the manifestations, possible causes, precipitating and maintaining factors, course, prognosis and consequences in terms of activity interference and quality of life. However, despite these challenges, steady progress has been achieved in the understanding of back pain, and important steps in the understanding of the psychological and social risk factors, genetics and brain mechanisms of low back pain have been made. These new findings have given impetus to the development of new diagnostic procedures, evidence-based screening methods and more targeted interventions, which underscore the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of low back pain that integrates biological, psychological and social aspects.

### Evaluating and managing acute low back pain in the primary care setting [^115fTqge]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Acute low back pain is a common reason for patient calls or visits to a primary care clinician. Despite a large differential diagnosis, the precise etiology is rarely identified, although musculoligamentous processes are usually suspected. For most patients, back symptoms are nonspecific, meaning that there is no evidence for radicular symptoms or underlying systemic disease. Because episodes of acute, nonspecific low back pain are usually self-limited, many patients treat themselves without contacting their primary care clinician. When patients do call or schedule a visit, evaluation and management by primary care clinicians is appropriate. The history and physical examination usually provide clues to the rare but potentially serious causes of low back pain, as well as to identify patients at risk for prolonged recovery. Diagnostic testing, including plain x-rays, is often unnecessary during the initial evaluation. For patients with acute, nonspecific low back pain, the primary emphasis of treatment should be conservative care, time, reassurance, and education. Current recommendations focus on activity as tolerated (though not active exercise while pain is severe) and minimal if any bed rest. Referral for physical treatments is most appropriate for patients whose symptoms are not improving over 2 to 4 weeks. Specialty referral should be considered for patients with a progressive neurologic deficit, failure of conservative therapy, or an uncertain or serious diagnosis. The prognosis for most patients is good, although recurrence is common. Thus, educating patients about the natural history of acute low back pain and how to prevent future episodes can help ensure reasonable expectations.

### Non-specific low back pain [^1118scP2]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Non-specific low back pain has become a major public health problem worldwide. The lifetime prevalence of low back pain is reported to be as high as 84%, and the prevalence of chronic low back pain is about 23%, with 11–12% of the population being disabled by low back pain. Mechanical factors, such as lifting and carrying, probably do not have a major pathogenic role, but genetic constitution is important. History taking and clinical examination are included in most diagnostic guidelines, but the use of clinical imaging for diagnosis should be restricted. The mechanism of action of many treatments is unclear, and effect sizes of most treatments are low. Both patient preferences and clinical evidence should be taken into account for pain management, but generally self-management, with appropriate support, is recommended and surgery and overtreatment should be avoided.

### The impact of contextual effects in exercise therapy for low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111cqLeK]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Low back pain is the most common musculoskeletal complaint worldwide. It is also the leading global cause of years lived with disability, and this disability results in enormous economic costs. In at least 95% of all cases of low back pain, the low back pain is considered nonspecific, meaning not attributable to a known cause or illness. Many people with low back pain, particularly in primary care settings, are treated with physiotherapy and then in particular exercise therapy. A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines by Oliveira et al. found that primary care guidelines for low back pain recommend exercise therapy, although the type of exercise recommended varies widely.

There is consensus that exercise therapy is effective in improving pain and disability in low back pain, but effect sizes in research tend to be small or moderate. In their Cochrane systematic review, Hayden et al. found a mean difference of − 15.2 points (95% confidence interval (CI) − 18.3 to − 12.2) for pain and a mean difference of − 6.8 (95% CI − 8.3 to − 5.3) for physical functioning (the inverse of disability), both on a scale of 0–100 favoring exercise therapy compared to no treatment, placebo treatment, or usual care.

### Expenditures and health care utilization among adults with newly diagnosed low back and lower extremity pain [^117RKWVq]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 80% of the US population will experience low back pain (LBP) or lower extremity pain (LEP) at least once in their lifetime. These conditions are common reasons for physician visits. Acute LBP is usually a self-limited condition. Most patients will experience symptomatic resolution irrespective of treatment. Although current guidelines recommend nonpharmacological and conservative measures, the costs of care associated with LBP and LEP remain significant. In 2013, spinal conditions, defined as both neck and back pain, accounted for the third largest portion of total national health spending after diabetes and ischemic heart disease.

Identifying practice patterns that unnecessarily increase health care spending in patients with LBP and LEP will inform national health care policy. Guidelines of LBP and LEP management discourage use of defined health care services, deeming them potentially unnecessary. Most guidelines agree that imaging should be reserved to identify surgical candidates, recommending that imaging be avoided within 30 days of diagnosis or without exhausting conservative treatment options, such as physical therapy, first. Patients with LBP and LEP often receive treatments that are neither standardized nor evidence based. Such heterogeneity of treatment patterns makes analysis of health service use challenging.

We present a retrospective cohort study of newly diagnosed, opiate-naive patients with LBP and LEP in the United States with the goal of assessing costs of care and treatment variation in this population. Because management may differ for chronic LBP or LEP, we restricted our analysis to patients with new diagnoses of LBP or LEP; patients with chronic LBP or LEP may have more complex history and, thus, be more likely to receive medical and surgical intervention. Within this patient population with acute LBP or LEP, we compare detailed cost information between patients who receive surgery and those who do not, using longitudinal follow-up data from the time of their diagnosis. This study characterizes the total health care costs of patients who receive care that is inconsistent with guidelines for the conservative management of LBP and LEP.

Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lower back pain is a common disorder; the estimated global point prevalence of activity limiting lower back pain lasting more than 1 day was 11.9 ± 2.0% between 1980 and 2009. Lower back pain can be broadly categorized as nonspecific or specific. Nonspecific refers to lower back pain for which there is no clear causal relationship between the symptoms, physical findings and imaging findings whereas, for specific lower back pain, there is a pathoanatomical relationship between the pain and one or more pathological process. A review by Deyo and Weinstein found that among patients with specific lower back pain, 4% were diagnosed with disc herniation, 3% with spinal stenosis and 2% with spondylolisthesis. However, most cases of lower back pain (80–90%) are nonspecific and are often caused by non-pathological functional disturbances, such as sacroiliac joint syndrome. The causes of lower back pain can be mechanical, neuropathic or secondary to another cause. Approximately 90% of patients suffering from back pain achieve remission within 6 weeks.

### Effectiveness of treatments for acute and subacute mechanical non-specific low back pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^111XafBa]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Low back pain is a common symptom in people of all ages and socioeconomic status. The worldwide point prevalence of low back pain (acute, subacute and chronic) was 7.83% (95% CI 7.04 to 8.64) in 2017, with 577 million people affected at any one time. In 2017, low back pain was responsible for around 65 million years lived with disability, representing a deterioration of about 17.5% since 2007 mainly owing to population growth and ageing, with the greatest increase recorded for low-income and middle-income countries. People more often leave their job because of low back pain than diabetes, hypertension, neoplasm, asthma, heart and respiratory disease combined. About one in four adults in the United States had low back pain that lasted for at least 24 hours within the previous 3 months, with 7.6% adults reporting at least one episode of severe acute low back pain within a 1-year period. Moderate-to-severe pain and impairment of motor and psychological functions due to low back pain are the primary reasons for seeking medical consultation from a general practitioner.

Despite its high prevalence, low back pain has a generally good prognosis. While a specific cause of low back pain can seldom be identified, the most prevalent type is mechanical, non-specific low back pain (NS-LBP). Most episodes of acute and subacute NS-LBP improve significantly within 6 weeks, and the average pain intensity is moderate (6 on a 100-point scale; 95% CI 3 to 10) by 12 months. However, two-thirds of people with low back pain still experience pain at 3 months (67%, 95% CI 50% to 83%) and at 12 months (65%, 95% CI 54% to 75%).

Most guidelines agree on the first line of care in case of acute episode: advice, reassurance and encouragement to engage in light physical activity. When second-line treatment is needed, a range of therapeutic interventions (pharmacological and physiotherapy) for acute NS-LBP are available. The relative effects of various treatment options, when each option is compared against all others, are not well known. This uncertainty is reflected in the variety of recommendations in recent guidelines for acute NS-LBP. We explored the relative efficacy of currently available treatments for acute and subacute mechanical NS-LBP in terms of benefit and harm via a systematic review of the literature and network meta-analysis (NMA).

### Nonspecific lower-back pain: surgical versus nonsurgical treatment [^111ffzy2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

We review evidence-based treatments for patients seeking care for lower-back pain and patients who have been diagnosed with nonspecific lower-back pain. The review is based on selected systematic reviews and national and international guidelines for the treatment of lower-back pain. Additional randomized controlled trials (ie, possibly those not previously included in the latest systematic reviews) were reviewed and added based on recommended procedures for the evaluation of methodological quality (ie, strong, moderate, and weak). In acute nonspecific lower-back pain (0–4 weeks duration of pain) there is moderate to strong evidence that self-care with over-the-counter medication and maintaining activity as tolerated or treatment with a limited number of sessions of manipulative therapy is effective for pain relief. In subacute nonspecific lower-back pain (4–12 weeks duration of pain) there is weak to moderate evidence that a graded activity program including exercises and cognitive behavioral treatment in combination is more efficient than usual care with regard to return to work. There is strong evidence that these programs reduce work absenteeism. In cases of chronic nonspecific lower-back pain (> 12 weeks duration of pain) a variety of treatments are available with limited and similar efficacy on pain and disability reduction. There is moderate evidence that surgery in chronic nonspecific lower-back pain is as effective as cognitive behavioral treatment with regard to pain, function, mood and return to work. Surgical indications for chronic nonspecific lower-back pain remain ill defined.

### Sex and gender considerations in low back pain clinical practice guidelines: a scoping review [^116RZbmP]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) is defined as pain located in the area between the posterior lower margins of the 12 th ribs and the gluteal folds, and may occur with associated lower limb pain/neurological involvement.LBP can be classified as acute (less than 6 weeks), subacute (6 to 12 weeks) or chronic (greater than 12 weeks). The origin of LBP is multifactorial, and is divided into non-specific LBP (NSLBP), specific, and serious pathologies. According to the 2017 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study, LBP was ranked number one for years lived with disability in 1990, 2007 and 2017, with increasing rates of occurrence for all ages.

LBP research indicates significant differences between genders regarding prevalence, degree of disability and number of comorbidities; which are all higher in individuals who identify as women. Despite known differences, research studies that focus on LBP inconsistently report or fail to integrate sex or gender differences into their design, analysis and conclusions, and it is common to observe sex and gender terms used interchangeably. This practice can not only lead to misinterpretation of results, but also impact how evidence is applied.

### Barriers and progress in the treatment of low back pain [^112BMibx]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nearly everyone gets low back pain (LBP) at least once in their lifetime making the effective treatment of this common complaint of widespread interest. It is the most common reason for middle-aged people to visit their family doctor with approximately 6% to 9% of adults consulting for this condition each year. Although many LBP patients stop consulting within three months, 60% to 80% of people still report pain or disability a year later, and up to 40% of those who have taken time off work will have future episodes of work absence. Hence, previous ideas of acute (less than four weeks), sub-acute (four weeks to 12 weeks) and chronic LBP (more than 12 weeks) are gradually being superseded by the view of LBP as a chronic, recurrent condition with an untidy pattern of symptomatic episodes, remissions and recurrences. Dunn and colleagues proposed four trajectories for LBP patients representing different paths over time; persistent mild, recovering, severe chronic and fluctuating, paths that have been since confirmed in other samples. The societal cost of LBP-related work absence is considerable. Patients with LBP account for more than $90 billion annually in health care expenses in the US and $9.17 billion in total costs in Australia. In the UK, costs are in the region of 1% to 2% of gross national product with National Health Service (NHS) costs alone of £251 million annually.

Recent years have seen an exponential increase in research focused on LBP and early criticisms about poor quality studies have largely been addressed by recent trials using rigorous methodology. Many practice guidelines are now available to help practitioners choose treatments that are safe and effective. A sobering reflection however is that no treatment has large, significant and consistent benefits for patients with non-specific LBP. Despite decades of research and improved quality of clinical trials, the reality is that the treatments we have to offer patients tend to produce small effects, often only in the short term and none appear to change effectively the longer-term prognostic paths or trajectories for patients.

In this commentary I will discuss the variety of current treatment options and recent guideline recommendations, then consider the trends in results of recent high quality trials and the potential explanations for them before suggesting key alternative approaches of potentially more value in achieving better patient outcomes in the future.

### How common is imaging for low back pain in primary and emergency care? Systematic review and meta-analysis of over 4 million imaging requests across 21 years [^111o9SBv]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To (1) estimate the proportion of patients seeking care for low back pain (LBP) who are imaged and (2) explore trends in the proportion of patients who received diagnostic imaging over time. We also examined the effect of study-level factors on estimates of imaging proportion.

Data Sources

Electronic searches of MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases from January 1995 to December 2017.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Observational designs and controlled trials that reported imaging for patients presenting to primary care or emergency care for LBP. We assessed study quality and calculated pooled proportions by care setting and imaging type, with strength of evidence assessed using the GRADE system.

Results

45 studies were included. They represented 19 451 749 consultations for LBP that had resulted in 4 343 919 imaging requests/events over 21 years. Primary care: moderate quality evidence that simple imaging proportion was 16.3% (95% CI 12.6% to 21.1%) and complex imaging was 9.2% (95% CI 6.2% to 13.5%). For any imaging, the pooled proportion was 24.8% (95% CI 19.3%to 31.1%). Emergency care: moderate quality evidence that simple imaging proportion was 26.1% (95% CI 18.2% to 35.8%) and high-quality evidence that complex imaging proportion was 8.2% (95% CI 4.4% to 15.6%). For any imaging, the pooled proportion was 35.6% (95%CI 29.8% to 41.8%). Complex imaging increased from 7.4% (95% CI 5.7% to 9.6%) for imaging requested in 1995 to 11.4% (95% CI 9.6% to 13.5%) in 2015 (relative increase of 53.5%). Between-study variability in imaging proportions was only partially explained by study-level characteristics; there were insufficient data to comment on some prespecified study-level factors.

Summary/Conclusion

One in four patients who presented to primary care with LBP received imaging as did one in three who presented to the emergency department. The rate of complex imaging appears to have increased over 21 years despite guideline advice and education campaigns.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of low back pain in children and adolescents [^114V4zw9]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Back pain is common in children and adolescents. Most cases of back pain are non-specific and self-limiting. In children and adolescents, pain is usually related to the posterior elements of the spine and disc-related problems are rare. Serious pathology, including malignancy and infection needs to be excluded. Evaluation and management is challenging and requires a thorough history and physical exam, and understanding of the immature skeleton. Diagnostic imaging is useful in the evaluation of a child or adolescent with low back pain and can help guide management. This article will review common causes of back pain in the pediatric population.

### Improving appropriate imaging for non-specific low back pain [^115tEBou]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Background

LBP is a common condition in the United States — approximately 80% of adults have LBP at some point during their life and roughly 30% of the adult population suffer from LBP at any given time. Although LBP is the most common cause of disability in the United States, it often has no identifiable anatomic or physiologic cause. Many patients seeking care for LBP receive lumbar spine radiography, CT or MRI. However, for most patients with acute non-specific LBP, symptoms resolve within 4 weeks and the use of routine imaging may result in unnecessary radiation exposure and add unnecessary costs and wasted time for patients without improved patient outcomes.

National quality guidelines, such as The National Committee of Quality Assurance's Health Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS), established the quality measure for use of image studies for LBP in efforts to improve rates of appropriate imaging in the healthcare setting. Despite these evidence-based guidelines, significant variability in clinical practice exists, with imaging studies often used to diagnose aetiology of acute non-specific LBP.

### Effectiveness of strategies for implementing guideline-concordant care in low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113L7mAU]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, low back pain is highly prevalent and a leading cause of disability. Clinical practice guidelines serve as important resources to improve the quality of care for low back pain by synthesising and appraising existing evidence, and providing recommendations for evidence-informed management. However, a time lag exists in the translation of evidence into practiceand in many cases, the management of low back pain is inconsistent with guideline-concordant care.

International guidelines, such as ones from the World Health Organization, Europe, United States of America and Australia, present similar core recommendations for managing low back pain, including providing education/advice to patients, discouraging routine imaging use, and reducing analgesic use, such as opioids. Such recommendations are informed by evidence demonstrating that education/advice can provide small, short-term improvements in pain management, and routine imaging does not confer clinical benefits yet can prolong recovery in patients with non-specific low back pain. Further, guidelines are shifting from a focus on analgesic to non-analgesic treatments, due to the limited evidence of efficacy and risk of harm associated with many analgesics.,

Despite the consistency of recommendations for the management of low back pain across international guidelines, there is variation in the care provided in practice. Guideline implementation involves the use of strategies aimed to facilitate uptake, use or adoption of guideline-concordant care, change healthcare professionals' behaviours and improve patient outcomes. Previous research has shown that the use of implementation strategies by guideline developers may increase the uptake of clinical practice guidelines, compared to passive dissemination. However, for low back pain, current evidence to support the effectiveness of guideline implementation strategies is limited and findings from systematic reviews on this topic are inconsistent. Considering that implementation research is a rapidly evolving area, and a number of implementation studies in low back pain have been published, since the last systematic review on this topic in 2016, an up-to-date systematic review with meta-analysis is warranted.

This systematic review aimed to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of implementation strategies for improving the uptake of one or more of three guideline recommendations for the management of low back pain: providing education/advice, discouraging routine imaging use, and/or reducing analgesic use. This review hypothesised that implementing low back pain guideline recommendations would promote guideline-concordant care among healthcare professionals and organisations.

### The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) evidence-based clinical guideline of interventional treatments for low back pain [^116VKpj6]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The ASPN Back Guideline provides a comprehensive framework for the safe and effective utilization of interventional treatments for lumbar disorders. Interventional treatments should be utilized based on the published efficacy and relative risk data. Over the last several years, many novel techniques and procedures for lower back disorders have been developed. The authors of ASPN Back believe that this guideline will help identify gaps in the literature and provide guidance on future evidence development. Given the broad scope of interventional treatments for lower back pain, many less established interventions were not included. This represents a limitation of this guideline and provides an opportunity to make future guidelines even more robust. The ASPN Back Guideline will be updated at regular intervals to include new therapies and evidence.

### Exercise treatment effect modifiers in persistent low back pain: an individual participant data meta-analysis of 3514 participants from 27 randomised controlled trials [^112zjBS5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Low back pain is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Exercise therapy is widely recommended to treat persistent non-specific low back pain. While evidence suggests exercise is, on average, moderately effective, there remains uncertainty about which individuals might benefit the most from exercise.

Methods

In parallel with a Cochrane review update, we requested individual participant data (IPD) from high-quality randomised clinical trials of adults with our two primary outcomes of interest, pain and functional limitations, and calculated global recovery. We compiled a master data set including baseline participant characteristics, exercise and comparison characteristics, and outcomes at short-term, moderate-term and long-term follow-up. We conducted descriptive analyses and one-stage IPD meta-analysis using multilevel mixed-effects regression of the overall treatment effect and prespecified potential treatment effect modifiers.

Results

We received IPD for 27 trials (3514 participants). For studies included in this analysis, compared with no treatment/usual care, exercise therapy on average reduced pain (mean effect/100 (95% CI) -10.7 (-14.1 to -7.4)), a result compatible with a clinically important 20% smallest worthwhile effect. Exercise therapy reduced functional limitations with a clinically important 23% improvement (mean effect/100 (95% CI) -10.2 (-13.2 to -7.3)) at short-term follow-up. Not having heavy physical demands at work and medication use for low back pain were potential treatment effect modifiers-these were associated with superior exercise outcomes relative to non-exercise comparisons. Lower body mass index was also associated with better outcomes in exercise compared with no treatment/usual care. This study was limited by inconsistent availability and measurement of participant characteristics.

Conclusions

This study provides potentially useful information to help treat patients and design future studies of exercise interventions that are better matched to specific subgroups. PROTOCOL PUBLICATION: https://doi.org/10.1186/2046-4053-1-64.

### Rehabilitation management of low back pain-it's time to pull it all together! [^11548Bu8]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is defined as "a symptom for which we are currently unable to reliably identify the pathology". This painful musculoskeletal problem is highly prevalent and recurrent in nature: the lifetime prevalence is estimated to be 84%, and ~55% of patients will have at least 10 episodes in their lifetime. With a point prevalence of ~25%, chronic LBP is a major health burden and is ranked as the most disabling pathology with respect to global burden of disease. In terms of disability adjusted life-years, LBP is the leading cause of years lived with disability in both developed and developing countries.

Despite an intense focus and increased research funding, the self-reported levels of disability in individuals with LBP have not improved in the last decade. This situation prevails, notwithstanding the presence of multiple monodisciplinary classification tools designed to target patient-specific treatments, the presence of 15 international multidisciplinary guidelines for treatment of LBP, and the publication of numerous systematic reviews/meta-analyses on LBP. Each of these tools is designed to aid the clinical provider in identifying an optimal diagnosis and treatment approach, but it is likely that each has inherent limitations that fail to provide proper aid when dealing with the multidimensional complexities associated with LBP. For example, monodisciplinary (ie, physiotherapy) classification tools–often focus on diagnosis and interventional measures solely for cases that involve pathoanatomical nociceptive presentations. Guidelines and systematic reviews/meta-analyses typically provide evidence for only discreet interventions. Clinical pathways of care, which are mainly derived from guidelines, might propose more comprehensive solutions to merge real-life clinical care with best practice. Recently, clinical care pathways have been proposed,–yet their foci remain limited to the same specific biomechanical and psychological features found in LBP guidelines.

### Acute nontraumatic back pain: risk stratification, emergency department management, and review of serious pathologies [^113f9aXz]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute back pain is a common presenting complaint in the emergency department that leads to a great deal of resource utilization. The differential diagnosis is long and most cases are caused by benign pathology that will resolve on its own. Imaging is over-used and rarely helps. This article presents an algorithmic approach using red flags in the history and physical examination that will help physicians better identify the small of patients with serious conditions that, if untreated, will result in significant neurological damage.

### Common health issues and advised treatments reported in an ultraendurance ocean rowing race [^113U7grP]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Inshore rowers commonly report musculoskeletal injury to the lower back, and occasionally knee pain, often caused by excessive loading. Risk factors for lower back pain in these rowers include: rowing for more than 30 minutes; rapid increases in training, competition loads and intensities; previous lower back problems; rough water; fatigue or poor technique. Ocean rowers can row between 10 and 16 hours a day for months at a time. This constant motion can overload lower lumbar regions and knee joints causing pain similar to inshore rowers (figure 1). Incidences of severe knee pain could also be caused by foot steering systems. This twisting motion, together with rough sea-states, throws rowers off balance mid-stroke, causing awkward loading of the knee joints. Educating rowers in effective pain management progression and the biomechanics of their injuries may help them effectively manage pain and limit joint strain.

Musculoskeletal complaints were common throughout the race, especially in the first four weeks. Ocean rowing is an amateur sport, with limited professional guidance in rower preparation and training. This may leave athletes inadequately prepared for the physical challenges involved and explain the high volume of musculoskeletal injuries seen early in the race. Further research into appropriate pre-race strength training programmes, with exercise regimes adapted to the individual, may aid rower preparation and reduce injury frequencies.

Regular monitoring of a rower's pain levels using standardised rating scales will help determine severity, and when longer lasting injuries might benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. Screening for previous lower back pain may help susceptible rowers better prepare and manage any symptoms experienced at sea. Performing different exercises while at sea may be difficult, but modifications to a rower's shift pattern may help provide time for recovery management. Awareness of associated neurological symptoms or decline in mental health is essential to ensure rower safety at sea and directing further investigations and management.

Box 2
What patients need to know

Most cases of LBP are simple strains and sprains of the back that, while painful and unpleasant, improve rapidly just like a sprained ankle
Having an image (x ray or CT or MRI scan) of your back does not usually help to find the cause of the back pain or guide treatment
The treatment for most cases of back pain is the same whether imaging is used or not; and we have seen that those who have unnecessary imaging often have a delayed recovery
Unnecessary imaging has some risks, including radiation exposure and delay in appropriate treatment, and has been associated with worse patient outcomes and an increase in unnecessary surgery
You may know other people who have had an x ray, CT, or MRI of their back that showed "changes"; but most of the changes seen on imaging are normal and are more common the older you get, just like grey hair and wrinkles. As these changes also occur in people without back pain, their relevance is unclear

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^1116VEYT]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Approach to Evaluation and Management

Optimal management of patients presenting with lateral hip and/or thigh pain requires a systematic approach for accurate diagnosis of underlying pathology contributing to symptoms. This section describes evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the most common causes of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults.

Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (GTPS)

GTPS is defined as pain and tenderness to palpation over the greater trochanter (GT). Until the early 2000s this entity was most frequently called "greater trochanteric bursitis"; however, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that approximately 20% of people with tenderness over the GT have imaging-proven bursitis. Non-inflammatory pathology is often seen on imaging, such as gluteal tendonosis, gluteal tendon tears, and/or enthesopathy at the GT. GTPS is often caused by relative weakness of the hip abductor muscles, especially the gluteus medius, which leads to excessive gluteal tendon shearing over the GT and eventual tendonopathy.

GTPS often coexists with other musculoskeletal lumbopelvic and hip conditions. Additionally, it is often a secondary pain generator resulting from suboptimal biomechanics. In fact, in people with low back pain, GTPS has a prevalence of up to 45%, and it commonly occurs in people with knee OA, as well. GTPS is more common in women, possibly because they have a wider pelvis structure. It may be associated with nighttime pain when lying on the affected side, pain with prolonged standing, and pain or paresthesias radiating down the lateral thigh along the course of the iliotibial band. Table 2 reviews additional common pain characteristics which can be elicited during the patient history to help distinguish GTPS from other conditions.

### Do not routinely offer imaging for uncomplicated low back pain [^11581kLH]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Patient perspectives

Clinicians often report that they order imaging when patients specifically request it. Systematic reviews of surveys and interviews suggest that about half of patients expect imaging from their health provider because they believe it can help rule out a sinister cause for the pain. Some patients also believe that imaging can identify the cause better than the clinician's physical exam and facilitate a more tailored approach to treatment. There is still considerable uncertainty as to what alternatives to imaging would convey the diagnosis of non-specific LBP satisfactorily from the patient's perspective. Future research should focus on this area to develop strategies for explaining LBP to patients.

### Improving appropriate imaging for non-specific low back pain [^111MDypC]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is a common condition in the United States, with approximately 80% of adults who will have LBP at some point during their life and roughly 30% of the adult population suffering from LBP at any given time. Although LBP is the most common cause of disability in the United States, it often has no identifiable anatomic or physiologic cause. Many patients seeking care for non-specific LBP receive X-rays and other imaging studies. However, for most acute LBP patients, symptoms resolve within 4 weeks and the use of routine imaging may result in unnecessary radiation exposure and add unnecessary costs and wasted time for patients without contributing to patient outcomes. The specific aim of the quality improvement (QI) project was to determine the effect of a multicomponent intervention to enhance the appropriate imaging utilisation for acute LBP to ≥ 90%. During the first 6 months of the QI project, 191 patients with LBP were seen. Of those patients, 156 (81.7%) received appropriate imaging over the 6-month intervention period, missing our targeted goal. Furthermore, this rate declined to baseline values after termination of the intervention, suggesting the need for additional prompts to sustain the initial intervention effect. Following a health system-wide deployment of practice-based alerts and quality score cards, the appropriate utilisation rate increased again and quickly to the target rate of 90%. To reduce variability in our clinical practice and to sustain an appropriate utilisation rate will require continued work. Health systems must find efficient methods to reduce LBP imaging and increase appropriate management of non-specific LBP in primary care. Increasing concordance with imaging guidelines can lessen harm associated with unnecessary radiation exposure and result in significant cost savings.

Since the 2012 CPG, recommendations have been made for nonpharmacologic interventions as first-choice treatments for chronic pain conditions and LBP, and accordingly this AOPT CPG update focused on synthesizing new evidence with the purpose of making recommendations for specific nonpharmacologic treatments.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^111QmWoY]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) — history and physical examination guidance and red flags are outlined as follows. Conducting a history and physical examination is considered standard of care and a cornerstone of clinical decision making, and history and physical examination should include assessment of signs and symptoms of serious underlying pathology. Signs and symptoms of serious underlying pathology requiring additional diagnostic workup and prompt treatment are generally referred to as "red flags". For cauda equina syndrome or conus medullaris syndrome, red flags include urinary retention, urinary or fecal incontinence, saddle anesthesia, changes in rectal tone, and severe/progressive lower extremity neurologic deficits. Infection red flags include fever, immunosuppression, IV drug use, and recent infection, indwelling catheters (e.g., central line, Foley). Fracture risk red flags include history of osteoporosis, chronic use of corticosteroids, older age (≥ 75 years old), recent trauma, and younger patients at risk for stress fracture (e.g., overuse). Cancer red flags include history of cancer with new onset of LBP, unexplained weight loss, failure of LBP to improve after 1 month, age > 50 years, and multiple risk factors present.

### Improving appropriate imaging for non-specific low back pain [^117AkWjA]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Focus group findings

Each focus group discussion lasted approximately 60 min and included 13 participants (7 women, age 49 ± 13 years). Most discussants indicated that LBP had a significant deleterious effect on or prevented normal daily activities.

Two main interconnected themes were identified that highlighted common experiences across the three group discussions and among focus group discussants. Anonymised quotes that captured the sentiment or shared experiences of the overall groups are presented with assigned participant codes in the following sections.

Insistence on imaging to diagnose aetiology of their LBP

We found that participants with non-specific LBP want imaging to identify the cause of pain and to seek a definitive diagnosis. Most were troubled and confused about why their physicians were reluctant or refused to order imaging even though the course of treatment would unlikely change based on the results.

I think that [imaging] should be one of the first things done if a patient comes to their office. Because how can you diagnose what's wrong or say what's wrong if you don't see it on a clear picture?–LBP04, woman

So, I think when patients walk in with a chief complaint about low back, you can't treat a patient just because the patient's coming in saying 'my back is hurting'.This is why [we need imaging]. Well, we're coming to the doctor. You're the expert. You're the one that went to school; we didn't. Regardless of what we tell you, you need to see it on the picture — LBP05, woman

First thing I come back to is when we sit there and talk about back pain and what someone wants. You got to find [through imaging] specifically what it is [that is causing my LBP] — LBP07, man

Clearly, the participants' assertions that physicians cannot understand the root cause of their pain without imaging and shared feelings that they are not getting an appropriate evaluation for back pain pose significant challenges to clinicians from following the recommendations in practice.

### Acupuncture for chronic nonspecific low back pain [^114ULniU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic nonspecific low back pain (LBP) is very common; it is defined as pain without a recognizable etiology that lasts for more than three months. Some clinical practice guidelines suggest that acupuncture can offer an effective alternative therapy. This review is a split from an earlier Cochrane review and it focuses on chronic LBP.

Objectives

To assess the effects of acupuncture compared to sham intervention, no treatment, or usual care for chronic nonspecific LBP.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, two Chinese databases, and two trial registers to 29 August 2019 without restrictions on language or publication status. We also screened reference lists and LBP guidelines to identify potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for chronic nonspecific LBP in adults. We excluded RCTs that investigated LBP with a specific etiology. We included trials comparing acupuncture with sham intervention, no treatment, and usual care. The primary outcomes were pain, back-specific functional status, and quality of life; the secondary outcomes were pain-related disability, global assessment, or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the studies, assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. We meta-analyzed data that were clinically homogeneous using a random-effects model in Review Manager 5.3. Otherwise, we reported the data qualitatively. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 33 studies (37 articles) with 8270 participants. The majority of studies were carried out in Europe, Asia, North and South America. Seven studies (5572 participants) conducted in Germany accounted for 67% of the participants. Sixteen trials compared acupuncture with sham intervention, usual care, or no treatment. Most studies had high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding of the acupuncturist. A few studies were found to have high risk of detection, attrition, reporting or selection bias. We found low-certainty evidence (seven trials, 1403 participants) that acupuncture may relieve pain in the immediate term (up to seven days) compared to sham intervention (mean difference (MD) -9.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.82 to -4.61, visual analogue scale (VAS) 0–100). The difference did not meet the clinically important threshold of 15 points or 30% relative change. Very low-certainty evidence from five trials (1481 participants) showed that acupuncture was not more effective than sham in improving back-specific function in the immediate term (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.16, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.06; corresponding to the Hannover Function Ability Questionnaire (HFAQ, 0 to 100, higher values better) change (MD 3.33 points; 95% CI -1.25 to 7.90)). Three trials (1068 participants) yielded low-certainty evidence that acupuncture seemed not to be more effective clinically in the short term for quality of life (SMD 0.24, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.45; corresponding to the physical 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12, 0–100, higher values better) change (MD 2.33 points; 95% CI 0.29 to 4.37)). The reasons for downgrading the certainty of the evidence to either low to very low were risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. We found moderate-certainty evidence that acupuncture produced greater and clinically important pain relief (MD -20.32, 95% CI -24.50 to -16.14; four trials, 366 participants; (VAS, 0 to 100), and improved back function (SMD -0.53, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.34; five trials, 2960 participants; corresponding to the HFAQ change (MD 11.50 points; 95% CI 7.38 to 15.84)) in the immediate term compared to no treatment. The evidence was downgraded to moderate certainty due to risk of bias. No studies reported on quality of life in the short term or adverse events. Low-certainty evidence (five trials, 1054 participants) suggested that acupuncture may reduce pain (MD -10.26, 95% CI -17.11 to -3.40; not clinically important on 0 to 100 VAS), and improve back-specific function immediately after treatment (SMD: -0.47; 95% CI: -0.77 to -0.17; five trials, 1381 participants; corresponding to the HFAQ change (MD 9.78 points, 95% CI 3.54 to 16.02)) compared to usual care. Moderate-certainty evidence from one trial (731 participants) found that acupuncture was more effective in improving physical quality of life (MD 4.20, 95% CI 2.82 to 5.58) but not mental quality of life in the short term (MD 1.90, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.55). The certainty of evidence was downgraded to moderate to low because of risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. Low-certainty evidence suggested a similar incidence of adverse events immediately after treatment in the acupuncture and sham intervention groups (four trials, 465 participants) (RR 0.68 95% CI 0.46 to 1.01), and the acupuncture and usual care groups (one trial, 74 participants) (RR 3.34, 95% CI 0.36 to 30.68). The certainty of the evidence was downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision. No trial reported adverse events for acupuncture when compared to no treatment. The most commonly reported adverse events in the acupuncture groups were insertion point pain, bruising, hematoma, bleeding, worsening of LBP, and pain other than LBP (pain in leg and shoulder).

Authors' Conclusions

We found that acupuncture may not play a more clinically meaningful role than sham in relieving pain immediately after treatment or in improving quality of life in the short term, and acupuncture possibly did not improve back function compared to sham in the immediate term. However, acupuncture was more effective than no treatment in improving pain and function in the immediate term. Trials with usual care as the control showed acupuncture may not reduce pain clinically, but the therapy may improve function immediately after sessions as well as physical but not mental quality of life in the short term. The evidence was downgraded to moderate to very low-certainty considering most of studies had high risk of bias, inconsistency, and small sample size introducing imprecision. The decision to use acupuncture to treat chronic low back pain might depend on the availability, cost and patient's preferences.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^1165KgWy]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD clinical practice guideline (CPG) for low back pain — 2017 recommendations: For patients with low back pain, we recommend that clinicians conduct a history and physical examination, that should include identifying and evaluating neurologic deficits (e.g., radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication), red flag symptoms associated with serious underlying pathology (e.g., malignancy, fracture, infection), and psychosocial factors. For patients with low back pain, we suggest performing a mental health screening as part of the low back pain evaluation and taking results into consideration during selection of treatment. For patients with acute axial low back pain (i.e., localized, non-radiating), we recommend against routinely obtaining imaging studies or invasive diagnostic tests. For patients with low back pain, we recommend diagnostic imaging and appropriate laboratory testing when neurologic deficits are serious or progressive or when red flag symptoms are present.

### Management of chronic low back pain in 2007–2008 [^116xXuSy]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To report and critically appraise the current state of managing chronic (and subacute) low back pain as reflected in recently published guidelines and results from latest trials.

Recent Findings

Although occurrence rates of and social benefits for back pain are apparently on the decline (at least in Germany), it is still one of the most frequent and costly health disorders in Western countries. Ten percent of the adult German population suffers from chronic disabling back pain. For this group, a plethora of interventions is recommended. The most recent guideline from the US alone enumerates eight different treatments based on 'moderate-quality evidence'. Latest (often high-quality) trials from 2006 to 2007 strengthen the evidence base, only modestly, owing to their conflicting and/or confusing results.

Summary

Recommendations for the management of chronic disabling nonspecific back pain have made little progress over the past 10 years. The field still suffers from a 'strong weakness' due to a generally weak body of evidence. Progress can be expected when the effects of an intervention can be reliably calibrated against comparators of known (in)effectiveness. At present, an individualized clinical approach seems most appropriate. Patients and doctors are free to choose, according to their experiences and preferences, from recommended treatments.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^115rVAJa]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many physicians assume that an older adult with low back pain (LBP) and concomitant lateral hip/thigh pain has lumbar spinal stenosis. However, in reality there are myriad causes of lateral hip/thigh pain in older adults and the diagnosis of this pain can be challenging due to pain referral patterns. First, the hip and nearby lumbopelvic structures share innervation from common nerve roots, so pain referral patterns from pathology of these structures overlap. Second, faulty mechanics of the lumbar spine and/or hip can lead to compensatory movement patterns and eventually result in multiple pain generators. These challenges are illustrated in a study by Sembrano and colleagues. In a sample of 200 patients presenting for evaluation by a spine surgeon, only 65% had isolated spine pain, whereas 17.5% had a combination of hip, spine, and/or sacroiliac (SI) joint pain. Lastly, diagnosing the etiology of hip and lumbopelvic pain in older adults is challenging in that many people have structural abnormalities on imaging studies that are asymptomatic. For instance, 93% of asymptomatic people 60–80 years old have MRI evidence of disc degeneration, 36% have a herniated disc, and 21% have spinal stenosis. Additionally, only 46.5% of women ages 65 years and older who have radiographic evidence of hip osteoarthritis (OA) report hip pain "on most days for at least 1 month".

Qualitative interviews allowed the astronauts to describe their pain experiences during the flight. When exposed to microgravity, Astronaut 1 described experiencing lower back pain and headaches. Although the lower back pain decreased after two to three days on the International Space Station (ISS), they continued to experience "a higher number of headaches than usual". They also mentioned feelings of "nausea, disorientation, and general discomfort", which gradually improved in two to three days. Notably, they expressed relief at the absence of shoulder pain during the seventeen days in space, stating: "I didn't notice any shoulder pain at all during the seventeen days I was in space. That was great!". However, upon returning to Earth, they reported that the shoulder pain had returned "to where it was before". Additionally, they mentioned experiencing muscle pain and stiffness, especially in their calves, immediately after return, likening it to having had intense calf training. They also described lower back pain, characterized as "spasms", although seven days after their return to Earth, they reported that muscle pain and lower back pain had mostly decreased, commenting: "my muscles are getting used to carrying my body in 1G".

Astronaut 2 described previous episodes of common pain, usually related to injuries such as a tibia fracture four years prior. During space training and aboard the ISS, they experienced predictable discomfort in their tibia, exacerbated by exercise and prolonged standing. In microgravity, they reported significant lower back pain from the outset and also mentioned pain in their left iliotibial band. Upon returning to Earth, they continued to feel pain in their distal tibia, especially when initiating movement after prolonged periods of rest.

Finally, sensory changes in both astronauts included increased thresholds for mechanical touch detection, temporal summation of pain, heat pain thresholds, and differences in conditioned pain modulation after the flight. Therefore, this study suggests that spaceflight can affect various aspects of sensory perception and regulation in astronauts.

### Red flags to screen for malignancy and fracture in patients with low back pain: systematic review [^114LwQnw]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain is a major cause of disability, leading to considerable healthcare expenditure around the world, especially in high income countries. The difficulty in providing a definitive diagnosis for most presentations of back pain has given rise to the term "non-specific low back pain", which is generally considered to be benign and can be managed in a primary care setting. Some patients, however, present with low back pain as the initial manifestation of a more serious pathology, such as malignancy, spinal fracture, infection, or cauda equina syndrome. Spinal fracture and malignancy are the most common serious pathologies affecting the spine. In patients with low back pain presenting to primary care, between 1% and 4% will have a spinal fractureand in less than 1% malignancy, whether primary tumour or metastasis, will be the underlying cause.

### The need for multidimensional stratification of chronic low back pain (LBP) [^111YhYd1]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) is currently ranked as the single leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide. Despite extensive study and numerous clinical practice guidelines, treatment costs for LBP continue to increase without improvement in functional outcomes. In the US, the annual expenditure related to LBP ($86 billion) has reached levels comparable to the care of diabetes ($98 billion), cancer ($89 billion), and nonspine arthritis ($80 billion).

Although many acute episodes of LBP resolve, substantial numbers of patients suffer repeated relapses requiring treatment. A recent review reported that 75% of patients experiencing an episode of LBP continue to report pain at 6 weeks (subacute phase), and 66% continue to report pain at 3 months (chronic phase). Up to 25% of LBP persists in a constant, chronic state and incurs the largest costs (approximately 75%) in terms of health care utilization and loss of productivity.

At the primary care level, most current clinical practice guidelines dichotomize LBP patients to those with specific LBP (a small group with easily identifiable pain source, e.g. infection) or with implied mechanical or "non-specific" LBP (a large group, > 80%). Patients with nonspecific LBP are heterogeneous in terms of clinical characteristics and prognosis, and thus are more likely to respond favorably to specific treatment, rather than the current "one-size-fits-all" approach. Evidence warranting moderate to low confidence suggests that a more specific approach to management leads to tailored treatments (i.e. stratified management) and improved outcomes. – Using a classification system based on mechanical patterns of symptom dominance and stratified management, Hall et al.found improved clinical outcomes compared with nonspecific management in an observational study. Results of a randomized control trial conducted in the UK suggests that stratified management based on psychosocial factors, using the Keele STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST) that separates LBP patients into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for persistent disabling back pain, is cost-effective compared with usual care. Recently, a National Institutes of Health Pain Consortium charged a Research Task Force to draft standards for research on chronic LBP. Their recommendations were for stratification by severity of pain and disability.

### Exercise therapy for treatment of acute non-specific low back pain [^111uTyi9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability globally. It generates considerable direct costs (healthcare) and indirect costs (lost productivity). The many available treatments for LBP include exercise therapy, which is practised extensively worldwide.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of exercise therapy for acute non-specific low back pain in adults compared to sham/placebo treatment or no treatment at short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term follow-up.

Search Methods

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2005. We conducted an updated search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two trial registers. We screened the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews published since 2004.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that examined the effects of exercise therapy on non-specific LBP lasting six weeks or less in adults. Major outcomes for this review were pain, functional status, and perceived recovery. Minor outcomes were return to work, health-related quality of life, and adverse events. Our main comparisons were exercise therapy versus sham/placebo treatment and exercise therapy versus no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We evaluated outcomes at short-term follow-up (time point within three months and closest to six weeks after randomisation; main follow-up), intermediate-term follow-up (between nine months and closest to six months), and long-term follow-up (after nine months and closest to 12 months); and we used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 23 studies (13 from the previous review, 10 new studies) that involved 2674 participants and provided data for 2637 participants. Three small studies are awaiting classification, and four eligible studies are ongoing. Included studies were conducted in Europe (N = 9), the Asia-Pacific region (N = 9), and North America (N = 5); and most took place in a primary care setting (N = 12), secondary care setting (N = 6), or both (N = 1). In most studies, the population was middle-aged and included men and women. We judged 10 studies (43%) at low risk of bias with regard to sequence generation and allocation concealment. Blinding is not feasible in exercise therapy, introducing performance and detection bias. There is very low-certainty evidence that exercise therapy compared with sham/placebo treatment has no clinically relevant effect on pain scores in the short term (mean difference (MD) -0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.79 to 4.19; 1 study, 299 participants). The absolute difference was 1% less pain (95% CI 4% more to 6% less), and the relative difference was 4% less pain (95% CI 20% more to 28% less). The mean pain score was 20.1 (standard deviation (SD) 21) for the intervention group and 20.9 (SD 23) for the control group. There is very low-certainty evidence that exercise therapy compared with sham/placebo treatment has no clinically relevant effect on functional status scores in the short term (MD 2.00, 95% CI -2.20 to 6.20; 1 study, 299 participants). The absolute difference was 2% worse functional status (95% CI 2% better to 6% worse), and the relative difference was 15% worse (95% CI 17% better to 47% worse). The mean functional status score was 15.3 (SD 19) for the intervention group and 13.3 (SD 18) for the control group. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for pain and functional status by one level for risk of bias and by two levels for imprecision (only one study with fewer than 400 participants). There is very low-certainty evidence that exercise therapy compared with no treatment has no clinically relevant effect on pain or functional status in the short term (2 studies, 157 participants). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by two levels for imprecision and by one level for inconsistency. One study associated exercise with small benefits and the other found no differences. The first study was conducted in an occupational healthcare centre, where participants received one exercise therapy session. The other study was conducted in secondary and tertiary care settings, where participants received treatment three times per week for six weeks. We did not pool data from these studies owing to considerable clinical heterogeneity. In two studies, there were no reported adverse events. One study reported adverse events unrelated to exercise therapy. The remaining studies did not report whether any adverse events had occurred. Owing to insufficient reporting of adverse events, we were unable to reach any conclusions on the safety or harms related to exercise therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

Exercise therapy compared to sham/placebo treatment may have no clinically relevant effect on pain or functional status in the short term in people with acute non-specific LBP, but the evidence is very uncertain. Exercise therapy compared to no treatment may have no clinically relevant effect on pain or functional status in the short term in people with acute non-specific LBP, but the evidence is very uncertain. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low for inconsistency, risk of bias concerns, and imprecision (few participants).

### Effectiveness of treatments for acute and subacute mechanical non-specific low back pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^1136v7X9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Ultimately, understanding the balance between benefits and harms of non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions is a key step to better serving people with NS-LBP. After first line of care, NS-LBP should be managed with non-pharmacological treatments which seem to mitigate pain and disability in the first week. Among pharmacological interventions, NSAIDs and muscle relaxants appear to offer the best net balance at immediate-term for pain and disability.

What is already known

Non-specific low back pain (NS-LBP) is a leading cause of pain and disability worldwide.
Among the therapeutic interventions for NS-LBP, it is not clear which intervention offers the best benefit–harm balance.
Uncertainty in the management of NS-LBP is reflected in the often discordant guideline recommendations.

What are the new findings

Among non-pharmacological interventions, pain and disability reduction were best achieved by heat wrap, manual therapy and exercise at immediate-term of follow-up.
Among pharmacological interventions, pain and disability reduction were best achieved by NSAIDs and muscle relaxants at immediate-term of follow-up.
Paracetamol had no benefit over inert treatments at any follow-up assessment; evidence was largely uncertain.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain [^111o4mKT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute low back pain (LBP) is a common health problem. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used in the treatment of LBP, particularly in people with acute LBP. In 2008, a Cochrane Review was published about the efficacy of NSAIDs for LBP (acute, chronic, and sciatica), identifying a small but significant effect in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo for short-term pain reduction and global improvement in participants with acute LBP. This is an update of the previous review, focusing on acute LBP.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NSAIDs compared to placebo and other comparison treatments for acute LBP.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and two trials registers for randomised controlled trials (RCT) to 7 January 2020. We also screened the reference lists from relevant reviews and included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that assessed the use of one or more types of NSAIDs compared to placebo (the main comparison) or alternative treatments for acute LBP in adults (≥ 18 years); conducted in both primary and secondary care settings. We assessed the effects of treatment on pain reduction, disability, global improvement, adverse events, and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials to be included in this review, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted the data. If appropriate, we performed a meta-analysis, using a random-effects model throughout, due to expected variability between studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 32 trials, with a total of 5356 participants (age range 16 to 78 years). Follow-up ranged from one day to six months. Studies were conducted across the globe, the majority taking place in Europe and North-America. Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean region were not represented. We considered seven studies at low risk of bias. Performance and attrition were the most common biases. There was often a lack of information on randomisation procedures and allocation concealment (selection bias); studies were prone to selective reporting bias, since most studies did not register their trials. Almost half of the studies were industry-funded. There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective in short-term (≤ 3 weeks) reduction of pain intensity (visual analogue scale (VAS), 0 to 100) than placebo (mean difference (MD) -7.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.98 to -3.61; 4 RCTs, N = 815). There is high quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term improvement in disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), 0 to 24) than placebo (MD -2.02, 95% CI -2.89 to -1.15; 2 RCTs, N = 471). The magnitude of these effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term global improvement than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75; 5 RCTs, N = 1201), but there was substantial heterogeneity (I² 52%) between studies. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events when using NSAIDs compared to placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.18; 6 RCTs, N = 1394). There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference between the proportion of participants who could return to work after seven days between those who used NSAIDs and those who used placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.23; 1 RCT, N = 266). There is low quality evidence of no clear difference in short-term reduction of pain intensity between those who took selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAIDs compared to non-selective NSAIDs (mean change from baseline -2.60, 95% CI -9.23 to 4.03; 2 RCTs, N = 437). There is moderate quality evidence of conflicting results for short-term disability improvement between groups (2 RCTs, N = 437). Low quality evidence from one trial (N = 333) reported no clear difference between groups in the proportion of participants experiencing global improvement. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events between those who took COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.50; 2 RCTs, N = 444). No data were reported for return to work.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated Cochrane Review included 32 trials to evaluate the efficacy of NSAIDs in people with acute LBP. The quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low, thus further research is (very) likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect, and may change the estimates. NSAIDs seemed slightly more effective than placebo for short-term pain reduction (moderate certainty), disability (high certainty), and global improvement (low certainty), but the magnitude of the effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There was no clear difference in short-term pain reduction (low certainty) when comparing selective COX-2 inhibitors to non-selective NSAIDs. We found very low evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events in both the comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo and selective COX-2 inhibitors versus non-selective NSAIDs. We were unable to draw conclusions about adverse events and the safety of NSAIDs for longer-term use, since we only included RCTs with a primary focus on short-term use of NSAIDs and a short follow-up. These are not optimal for answering questions about longer-term or rare adverse events.

### Interventional therapies, surgery, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain: an evidence-based clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society [^1144ayFA]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Clinical practice guideline.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations on use of interventional diagnostic tests and therapies, surgeries, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain of any duration, with or without leg pain.

Summary Of Background Data

Management of patients with persistent and disabling low back pain remains a clinical challenge. A number of interventional diagnostic tests and therapies and surgery are available and their use is increasing, but in some cases their utility remains uncertain or controversial. Interdisciplinary rehabilitation has also been proposed as a potentially effective noninvasive intervention for persistent and disabling low back pain.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel was convened by the American Pain Society. Its recommendations were based on a systematic review that focused on evidence from randomized controlled trials. Recommendations were graded using methods adapted from the US Preventive Services Task Force and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group.

Results

Investigators reviewed 3348 abstracts. A total of 161 randomized trials were deemed relevant to the recommendations in this guideline. The panel developed a total of 8 recommendations.

Conclusion

Recommendations on use of interventional diagnostic tests and therapies, surgery, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation are presented. Due to important trade-offs between potential benefits, harms, costs, and burdens of alternative therapies, shared decision-making is an important component of a number of the recommendations.

### Analgesic effects of treatments for non-specific low back pain: a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized trials [^114rTh1D]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Estimates of treatment effects reported in placebo-controlled randomized trials are less subject to bias than those estimates provided by other study designs. The objective of this meta-analysis was to estimate the analgesic effects of treatments for non-specific low back pain reported in placebo-controlled randomized trials.

Methods

Medline, Embase, Cinahl, PsychInfo and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for eligible trials from earliest records to November 2006. Continuous pain outcomes were converted to a common 0–100 scale and pooled using a random effects model.

Results

A total of 76 trials reporting on 34 treatments were included. Fifty percent of the investigated treatments had statistically significant effects, but for most the effects were small or moderate: 47% had point estimates of effects of < 10 points on the 100-point scale, 38% had point estimates from 10 to 20 points and 15% had point estimates of > 20 points. Treatments reported to have large effects (> 20 points) had been investigated only in a single trial.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis revealed that the analgesic effects of many treatments for non-specific low back pain are small and that they do not differ in populations with acute or chronic symptoms.

### Evaluating lower back pain with the aid of imaging… [^114FkcQK]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Lower back pain is a problem commonly treated by family physicians and the most common cause of work disability in the United States. Most patients have simple back pain that resolves spontaneously or with minor interventions. The major task is to identify the 5 percent of patients who have serious disorders. Jarvik and Deyo discuss the differential diagnosis of lower back pain and review the appropriate work-up. Because the symptoms and pathologic causes may not be obviously related, making a definitive diagnosis can be difficult. The differential diagnosis can be categorized into mechanical causes that do not involve inflammation or infection; nonmechanical causes that include inflammation, infection, and infiltrative disease; and visceral causes that do not involve the spine. Some diagnoses, which remain controversial, include spinal instability and internal disc disruption.

The approach to correctly diagnosing lower back pain involves identifying underlying systemic disease, recognizing neurologic impairment that may require surgery, and acknowledging any psychosocial factors contributing to the pain. Sciatica is often the first clue to neurologic involvement in back pain, especially in younger adults. True radicular pain usually travels to below the knee. Herniated intervertebral discs, generally involving the L5 or S1 nerve roots, are the most common cause of sciatica. Spinal stenosis results from bone abnormality, soft tissue pressure, or both, and it occurs more commonly in older adults. The classic symptom of spinal stenosis is neurogenic claudication when the patient is standing. Numbness and tingling also may be present, with symptom relief when the patient is sitting and the spine is flexed.

Cauda equina syndrome, resulting from local compression, is a surgical emergency, with the most common symptoms being urinary retention, sciatica, sensory and motor deficits, abnormal straight-leg raising, and decreased sphincter tone. Sensory deficits frequently are present over the buttocks, thighs, and perineum. The authors used a comprehensive MEDLINE search to evaluate diagnostic strategies for lower back pain. Plain radiographs are the most common mode used. Anteroposterior and lateral views may be useful for revealing alignment, disc and vertebral body height, and gross impression of bone density and architecture. Oblique and spot lateral views are not routinely recommended by the former Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.

### Acute lumbar disk pain: navigating evaluation and treatment… [^113naTCY]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Conservative Management For 90 percent of patients with lumbar disk herniation, acute sciatica starts to improve within six weeks and resolves by 12 weeks with conservative care. 15 Several nonsurgical treatments have proven effective in improving symptoms of lumbar disk herniation and should be considered first-line in the first six weeks of conservative management. Bed rest is less effective for sciatica than activity. In general, bed rest should be limited to avoid muscle deconditioning.
16. Several medications have been used to treat lumbar disk herniation pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants have been shown to be effective in the treatment of nonspecific low back pain, but these therapies have not been as extensively studied with lumbar disk herniation pain.

Physical therapy typically has had a role in conservative management of lumbar disk herniation, although best evidence suggests there is little to support its effectiveness for improving pain or functional status. 22 Cost-effectiveness analysis concludes that physical therapy is no more cost-effective than usual conservative management without physical therapy. 23 The effectiveness of physical therapy modalities, including therapeutic ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and traction is difficult to assess because of limited quantity and quality of studies. Therapeutic ultrasound and TENS may provide short-term benefit, 24, 25 but data on traction are conflicting, with recent systematic reviews concluding that traction is not effective.
26. Nonsurgical Invasive Treatments Invasive nonsurgical treatments involve injections into the epidural space or the herniated disk. Steroids have been used in both locations to reduce inflammation.

Epidural steroid injections may provide moderate short-term improvement of pain, but do not impact long-term outcomes, such as impairment of function, need for surgery, and pain after three months. 31 There is fair evidence that injections done under radiologic guidance are more effective than injections without this guidance in terms of improving pain at intermediate follow-up, and disability at short-term and intermediate follow-up. 22 Epidural steroid injections have a role for certain patients in the management of short-term pain from lumbar disk herniation. A study of intradiscal corticosteroid injections has not shown benefit over placebo for treatment of discogenic pain.
32. Patient Counseling The natural history of lumbar disk herniation reveals that large herniations typically reabsorb with time, .
