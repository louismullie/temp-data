## Question

What can cause a fasting blood glucose of 106

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what can cause a fasting blood glucose of 106 mg/dL, how to interpret this value, what mechanisms might explain it, and what steps should be taken next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify this value against current diagnostic thresholds. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology that typically produces impaired fasting glucose. Next, I will review risk factors and population-specific considerations. After that, I need to check for potential non-glycemic contributors and measurement pitfalls. Finally, I will outline a practical, evidence-based evaluation and management plan, including when to consider pharmacotherapy, and I will confirm the need for repeat testing before labeling prediabetes definitively.

> Let me first confirm the classification. A fasting plasma glucose of 106 mg/dL falls within the ADA-defined impaired fasting glucose range of 100–125 mg/dL, which is considered prediabetes. Importantly, this is not diagnostic of diabetes, which requires FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL, A1C ≥ 6.5%, or 2-hour OGTT ≥ 200 mg/dL, and in asymptomatic individuals should be confirmed with repeat testing before making a firm diagnosis [^113RXHy2] [^113RPQFH] [^117MLamS].

> Wait, let me verify the threshold history so I don't overstate anything. The ADA lowered the IFG lower limit from 110 to 100 mg/dL in 2003 to better align with IGT prevalence and capture more at-risk individuals, whereas WHO retained 110 mg/dL for IFG. This explains why some sources still cite 110 mg/dL and why 106 mg/dL sits firmly in ADA prediabetes but below WHO IFG, underscoring the need to document which criteria are being used locally [^114BoucV] [^117MLamS] [^1144ENGx].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology. Impaired fasting glucose in this range typically reflects increased hepatic glucose production and early defects in basal insulin secretion, with insulin resistance contributing. These defects often coexist with metabolic syndrome features such as central adiposity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, which together amplify progression risk to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [^114dkxDC] [^117MLamS] [^113MwR1P].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk without context. I should confirm that even within "normal" FPG, higher values carry a graded increase in diabetes risk; for example, FPG 91–99 mg/dL roughly doubles diabetes risk compared with < 81 mg/dL, so 106 mg/dL is beyond that and confers higher risk, especially when combined with factors like BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, which markedly increase hazard ratios for incident diabetes in young and middle-aged adults [^114iTrLg] [^113oz1h4] [^113MwR1P].

> Let me consider population-specific nuances. In children and adolescents, the same ADA thresholds apply, but routine FPG screening is not broadly recommended; if measured, 100–125 mg/dL is prediabetes and warrants lifestyle counseling and risk-factor assessment, with attention to ethnic disparities in youth type 2 diabetes prevalence and metabolic risk clustering [^116xdQrx] [^11141my5]. In pregnancy, by contrast, thresholds are stricter; persistent FPG > 110 mg/dL before 18 weeks suggests early dysglycemia and merits closer surveillance and individualized targets, so 106 mg/dL is borderline in that context and should be interpreted with obstetric guidance [^115YEmVW] [^115s6dvM].

> But wait, what if the elevation is not purely glycemic in origin. I need to check for non-glycemic contributors and measurement issues: diurnal variation means afternoon FPG averages about 5 mg/dL lower than morning, so a 106 mg/dL in the afternoon could reflect a higher true fasting value. Certain medications can raise FPG, notably statins and atypical antipsychotics like olanzapine. Liver disease and NAFLD can worsen insulin resistance and modestly elevate FPG. And improper fasting, sample handling, or using serum rather than plasma can bias results, so confirming true fasting status and repeating testing is prudent [^112Z6VhF] [^11292SN2] [^114kfepw] [^112esaJ4] [^113yiD4Q].

> Next, I should review the immediate evaluation. Let me first confirm the result with repeat testing using plasma glucose after a proper ≥ 8-hour fast, and consider obtaining an A1C to characterize chronic glycemia. If results are discordant or if symptoms or risk factors suggest postprandial dysglycemia, a 75-g OGTT can uncover isolated IGT, which carries higher cardiovascular risk than isolated IFG and may change management [^113RXHy2] [^113RPQFH] [^114dkxDC].

> I need to ensure a comprehensive risk assessment accompanies the labs. I should screen for metabolic syndrome components, including waist circumference, blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL, and liver enzymes, because NAFLD and hepatic insulin resistance correlate with IFG and progression risk. I should also document family history, physical inactivity, sleep apnea risk, and medication exposures that worsen glycemia [^117MLamS] [^113LxHUD] [^112esaJ4].

> Now, regarding management, let me think about first-line therapy. Structured lifestyle intervention is the cornerstone: aim for 5–10% weight loss if overweight or obese, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity, dietary patterns that reduce refined carbohydrates and saturated fats, and behavioral support; these measures reduce progression to diabetes by roughly 58% in high-risk populations with IGT, and while most prevention trials enrolled people with IGT, ADA-endorsed guidance supports lifestyle for IFG as well, with intensity scaled to risk [^114BoucV] [^117NkuDy] [^113MwR1P].

> Hold on, I should verify when pharmacotherapy is reasonable. For individuals at particularly high risk — such as those with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², FPG 110–125 mg/dL, A1C ≥ 6.0%, or a history of gestational diabetes — consider metformin for diabetes prevention, with GLP-1 receptor agonists or pioglitazone as alternatives in selected cases; in older adults, the balance of benefits and risks should be individualized, and any drug therapy should be paired with lifestyle measures and monitored for tolerability [^112uHobf] [^117NkuDy] [^114s1n2M].

> I should double-check the need for ongoing surveillance. Reassess FPG or A1C every 6–12 months to detect progression, reinforce lifestyle, and recalibrate risk; if FPG approaches 110–115 mg/dL or A1C nears 6.0%, intensify intervention and reconsider pharmacologic prevention, recognizing that not all individuals with prediabetes progress and that some revert to normal glycemia with sustained lifestyle change [^112uHobf] [^112r17CD].

> In summary, a fasting glucose of 106 mg/dL signifies ADA-defined impaired fasting glucose and prediabetes, reflecting early hepatic insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. Confirm with repeat testing, evaluate for metabolic syndrome and reversible contributors, and initiate intensive lifestyle therapy, escalating to pharmacologic prevention in those at highest risk, while remembering that risk exists on a continuum even below current thresholds and that individualized, longitudinal care yields the best outcomes [^117MLamS] [^113RXHy2] [^113MwR1P].

A fasting glucose of 106 mg/dL indicates **impaired fasting glucose (IFG)** [^117MLamS] and reflects early insulin resistance or beta-cell dysfunction [^114dkxDC]. It is not diagnostic of diabetes [^113RPQFH] but signals increased risk for type 2 diabetes [^114BoucV] and cardiovascular disease [^116Yugg3]. Common causes include obesity, physical inactivity, poor diet, and family history [^116Di56J]; medications such as corticosteroids or atypical antipsychotics [^114kfepw] can also raise fasting glucose. Confirm with repeat fasting glucose or A1c [^113RXHy2], then address risk with weight loss, exercise, and dietary changes [^112uHobf]; consider metformin if high risk or progression occurs [^117NkuDy].

---

## Physiological mechanisms

Several **physiological mechanisms** can explain a fasting glucose of 106 mg/dL:

- **Insulin resistance**: Reduced sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin, leading to increased hepatic glucose production and elevated fasting glucose [^114weENV].

- **Beta-cell dysfunction**: Impaired insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells, resulting in inadequate glucose clearance [^114dkxDC].

- **Increased hepatic glucose production**: Excessive glucose production by the liver during fasting, contributing to elevated fasting glucose levels [^114weENV].

---

## Clinical significance

A fasting glucose of 106 mg/dL is clinically significant because it indicates **prediabetes** [^117MLamS] and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [^113FkE2t] and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [^112VfXTQ]. Prediabetes is a metabolic state characterized by impaired glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and beta-cell dysfunction [^114s1n2M].

---

## Risk factors

Several **risk factors** are associated with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) [^117MLamS]:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Obesity | Excess body weight, particularly abdominal obesity, is strongly associated with insulin resistance and elevated fasting glucose [^113LxHUD]. |
| Physical inactivity | Sedentary lifestyle contributes to insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism [^notfound]. |
| Poor diet | High intake of refined carbohydrates, sugary foods, and saturated fats can increase fasting glucose levels [^notfound]. |
| Family history | Genetic predisposition to diabetes and metabolic disorders increases the risk of IFG [^notfound]. |
| Age | The risk of IFG increases with age, particularly after 45 years [^notfound]. |
| Ethnicity | Certain ethnic groups, such as African American, Hispanic, Asian American, and Native American populations, have a higher risk of IFG [^notfound]. |
| Medications | Certain medications, such as corticosteroids, atypical antipsychotics (e.g. olanzapine) [^114kfepw], and statins, can elevate fasting glucose levels [^11292SN2]. |

## Diagnostic criteria

According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is defined as a fasting plasma glucose level of **100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L)** [^117MLamS]. Diabetes mellitus is diagnosed when fasting glucose is **≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L)** [^113RPQFH] or when hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is **≥ 6.5%** [^116Wk4rG].

---

## Recommended next steps

If a fasting glucose of 106 mg/dL is detected, the following steps are recommended:

- **Confirmatory testing**: Repeat fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test or perform an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to confirm the diagnosis of IFG [^116xdQrx].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Implement lifestyle changes, including weight loss, increased physical activity, and dietary improvements, to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes [^112uHobf].

- **Pharmacological intervention**: Consider pharmacological therapy, such as metformin, in individuals with high risk factors or progressive glycemia despite lifestyle interventions [^117NkuDy].

- **Regular monitoring**: Monitor fasting glucose levels regularly to track progression and adjust treatment accordingly [^114bbupQ].

A fasting glucose of 106 mg/dL indicates **impaired fasting glucose (IFG)** [^117MLamS], reflecting early insulin resistance or beta-cell dysfunction. It is not diagnostic of diabetes but signals increased risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [^113MwR1P]. Confirm with repeat testing, then prioritize lifestyle changes; consider metformin if risk is high or progression occurs [^117NkuDy].

2 METHODS

2.1 Protocol and registration

The protocol of this systematic review was registered on International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta‐analysis Protocols (INPLASY.COM) (Registration Number: 202490045). The review was reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA‐2020).

2.2 Eligibility criteria

Cross‐sectional studies and the baseline surveys of cohort studies (which can be regarded a special type of cross‐sectional studies) conducted in adults without previously diagnosed diabetes and reported relevant outcome data were eligible for this systematic review. 'Previously diagnosed diabetes' was defined as having ever been diagnosed with diabetes or currently taking blood glucose‐lowering drugs as reported by participants. The outcomes of interest were the proportions of different subgroups defined by combinations of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c levels among people with newly detected diabetes or pre‐diabetes. Taking people with diabetes as an example, there were seven possible subgroups: (1) 2hPG elevated alone; (2) FPG elevated alone; (3) HbA1c elevated alone; (4) both 2hPG and FPG elevated; (5) both 2hPG and HbA1c elevated; (6) both FPG and HbA1c elevated; (7) all the three measures elevated. Similarly, for people with pre‐diabetes, there were also seven subgroups. Eligible studies were required to have reported either the proportion of each subgroup directly or the data that can be used to calculate it (i.e. the number of participants in each subgroup and the total number of patients with newly detected diabetes or pre‐diabetes), but did not have to use the same criteria to define diabetes and pre‐diabetes (the studies using ADA criteria and those using other criteria were analysed separately; see Section 2.6). Also, eligible studies were not required to be explicitly restricted to individuals with type 2 diabetes, for two reasons. First, our pilot literature search showed that most potentially eligible studies did not differentiate type 2 diabetes from total diabetes, which indicated that there would be little data available for analysis if it were limited to type 2 diabetes. Second, as well documented, type 2 diabetes accounts for over 90% of all diabetes. Thus, it would be reasonable to consider our findings as primarily derived from and applicable to type 2 diabetes populations.

Key Points

Question

Is fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level in combination with anthropometric variables associated with a 10-year risk of diabetes?

Findings

In this cohort study of 44 992 individuals, the 10-year cumulative risk of incident diabetes was 12.8%. Fasting plasma glucose level, body mass index, older age, and male sex were associated with diabetes development, with significant interaction among these variables.

Meaning

These data facilitate identification and treatment of those who are at highest risk of diabetes development despite having a normal FPG level.

### Association between fasting blood glucose and all-cause mortality in a rural Chinese population: 15-year follow-up cohort study [^111nJn7S]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Yanhong Li et al. found a U-shaped relationship between early blood glucose concentrations and PICU mortality. When the blood glucose concentration is 110–140 mg/dl (6.1–7.8 mmol/l), the risk of all-cause mortality is the lowest. The People's Republic of China-USA (PRC-USA) collaborative study also found a significant U-shaped relationship between fasting blood glucose levels and all-cause mortality, and the result of the study showed that both low (< 80 mg/dl) and high (≥ 126 mg/dl) fasting blood glucose levels were significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality in the Chinese general population.

Our results showed that fasting blood glucose levels in this population had a significant U-shaped relationship with mortality risk and that this relationship was not affected by other risk factors; both higher and lower fasting blood glucose levels were significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, which is consistent with the results of some studies. The mechanism for the association between high fasting blood glucose levels and risk of all-cause mortality is very clear; high fasting blood glucose causes complications such as CVD and chronic kidney disease, both of which increase the risk of death. While the mechanism for the relationship between low fasting blood glucose and risk of all-cause mortality is not that clear, studies have shown that hypoglycemia may be associated with low energy consumption, resulting in poor health and increased bodily susceptibility to diseases, thus increasing the risk of death. Additionally, other studies have suggested that the relationship between low levels of fasting blood glucose and all-cause mortality risk may be explained by brain damage during hypoglycemia. Our study is based on a rural Chinese population, of low socioeconomic status. It may be that inadequate intake of nutrients in this population leads to an increased risk of death from malnutrition. This study provides a relatively safe fasting blood glucose range (5.6 – < 6.1 mmol/l) for the regional population in rural China, but this relatively safe fasting blood glucose range is higher than in previous studies, probably because our population generally has a low BMI, which may be caused by malnutrition. Therefore, more trials are needed to verify the results.

### Prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance in nondiabetic U.S. adults [^1127b8Zr]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Three years after a landmark study demonstrated that early diagnosis of and intervention of pre-diabetes can substantially reduce progression to type 2 diabetes, the majority of people with IFG and/or IGT were undiagnosed and untreated. Whether this is due to physicians being unaware of the evidence, unconvinced by the evidence, or clinical inertia is unclear. Consideration should be given to national policies to improve upon this situation such as public and provider education programs.

The Hoorn study began in 1989–1990, involving 2,484 men and women ages 50–75 years, with follow-up evaluations performed in 1996, 2000, 2005, and 2007 including oral glucose tolerance testing (GTT), A1C, lipids, blood pressure, and anthropometric measures. Using the WHO criterion with a cut point of 110 mg/dl, 12% had IFG, while 35% had IFG by the ADA criterion of 100 mg/dl; 5 and 4% had newly diagnosed and previously known diabetes, respectively. Others have reported a similar increase in IFG with the lower ADA criterion. Consequently, individuals with IGT satisfying the ADA criterion have considerably lower risk of diabetes than those satisfying the WHO criterion. In the Hoorn dataset, individuals with either IFG (based on fasting glucose ≥ 110 mg/dl) or IGT alone had 33–34% 6-year cumulative incidence of diabetes, while 65% of those having both elevated fasting and 2-h glucose developed diabetes during the same period. Hoorn study data comparing glucose tolerance in 1998 and 2005 similarly suggested that the 110 mg/dl cut point more strongly predicts CVD mortality than the 100 mg/dl cut point. Dekker showed data from the Diabetes Epidemiology: Collaborative Analysis of Diagnostic Criteria in Europe (DECODE) study favoring the use of 2-h glucose without a threshold for mortality, as the 2-h glucose increased from ≤ 3 to ≥ 11.1 mmol/l/l, while there is a definite difference in outcome for fasting glucose between ≥ 7 and < 7 mmol/l/l. Similar evidence of greater association with mortality of 2-h than of fasting glucose was found in analysis of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study.

### Normal fasting plasma glucose and risk of type 2 diabetes [^111Bhh2G]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing worldwide. Prediction methods are a matter of discussion. A recent study showed an alteration of normal linear trajectories for fasting and postload plasma glucose concentrations and insulin sensitivity and secretion 3–6 years before diagnosis. Other studies showed an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes among normoglycemic subjects, particularly in those with a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) range of 91–99 mg/dL. Clear information regarding Mediterranean populations is lacking. We investigated whether the higher tertiles of within-normal-range FPG concentrations in a northern Italian population can help identify people at increased risk.

### Diurnal variation in fasting plasma glucose… [^112EV5s1]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Context Current diagnostic criteria for diabetes are based on plasma glucose levels in blood samples obtained in the morning after an overnight fast, with a value of 7. 0 mmol/L or more indicating diabetes. However, many patients are seen by their physicians in the afternoon. Because plasma glucose. for 10 minutes. Plasma was frozen at −70°C until analysis. Plasma glucose was measured using a hexokinase reference method. The coefficient of variation for this method was 1. 6% at a glucose concentration of
5. 5 mmol/L, and 1. 8% for a glucose concentration. through 12 hours to 5. 40 mmol/L in those who fasted 16 hours or more. In afternoon subjects, there was a clinically insignificant decrease from 5. 13 mmol/L in those who fasted 4 through 8 hours, to 5.
06. from subjects examined in the morning, the fasting plasma glucose value distinguishing diabetic from nondiabetic individuals is 7.

0 mmol/L. In NHANES. III, this corresponds to the 97. 2th percentile of fasting plasma glucose. For afternoon subjects, the 97. 2th percentile value for fasting glucose was
6. 33 mmol/L. Similarly, the diagnostic value. for impaired fasting glucose in morning subjects corresponded to the 89. 8th percentile; this value in afternoon subjects was
5. 66 mmol/L. As found for glucose, mean fasting serum insulin and C peptide levels were significantly higher in subjects examined in the morning, compared with those examined in the afternoon. These data from a nationally representative sample of adults demonstrate that there are clinically significant differences in fasting plasma glucose.

3.4 The proportions of different combinations of, andamong participants newly detected with diabetes

Of the 25 studies reporting data on newly detected diabetes,15 were conducted in the general population and all of these adopted the ADA diagnostic criteria. Meta‐analysis of the 15 studies showed that the weighted prevalence of diabetes was 15% (see Table S4 for results of other scenarios). As shown in Figures 2A and S1, among adults with newly detected diabetes (n = 24 214), 69% (95% CI, 61%–75%; I² = 99%) had elevated 2hPG, 44% (95% CI, 41%–51%; I² = 97%) elevated FPG, and 61% (95% CI, 52%–69%; I² = 99%) elevated HbA1c; 11% (95% CI, 7%–16%; I² = 99%) had normal 2hPG but elevated FPG (regardless of their HbA1c levels); 7% (95% CI, 3%–11%; I² = 99%) had normal 2hPG and HbA1c but elevated FPG (i.e. isolated FPG elevation); 20% (95% CI, 12%–24%; I² = 99%) had normal 2hPG and normal FPG but elevated HbA1c (i.e. isolated HbA1c elevation).

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1118fPA5]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Monogenic diabetes — most common causes and clinical features detail gene-specific patterns and thresholds. HNF1A-MODY shows a large rise in 2-h plasma glucose (PG) on oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (> 90 mg/dL [> 5 mmol/L]) with low hs-CRP and sensitivity to sulfonylureas. GCK-MODY shows a small rise in 2-h PG on OGTT (< 54 mg/dL [< 3 mmol/L]) with stable, nonprogressive elevated fasting blood glucose and typically does not require treatment. HNF4A-MODY may have large birth weight (macrosomia) and transient neonatal hypoglycemia and is sensitive to sulfonylureas. Neonatal diabetes due to KCNJ11 can be permanent or transient with intrauterine growth restriction and possible developmental delay and seizures and is responsive to sulfonylureas; ABCC8 can be permanent or transient with intrauterine growth restriction, rarely developmental delay, and sulfonylurea responsiveness. 6q24 paternal duplications cause transient neonatal diabetes with macroglossia and umbilical hernia with mechanisms including UPD6, paternal duplication, or maternal methylation defect that may be treatable with medications other than insulin.

### Pathogenesis of fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: implications for therapy [^114MC2v7]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

The premise of all of these studies, as well as others that my colleagues and I have performed, is that an understanding of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes enables the development of targeted therapies that are directed toward correcting specific metabolic defects in a given individual. I, as well as many other investigators, believe that such therapies are likely to be more effective and have a lower risk than would occur if everyone were treated the same regardless of the underlying cause of their hyperglycemia. While we do not yet have sufficient knowledge to truly individualize therapy, in my opinion this approach will be the norm in the not too distant future.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113RXHy2]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF screening tests and diagnostic thresholds state that prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be detected by fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Type 2 diabetes is consistent with a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL (6.99 mmol/L) or greater, an HbA1c level of 6.5% or greater, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or greater; prediabetes is consistent with a fasting plasma glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.55–6.94 mmol/L), an HbA1c level of 5.7% to 6.4%, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.77–11.04 mmol/L). Because HbA1c measurements do not require fasting, they are more convenient than using a fasting plasma glucose level or an OGTT; the OGTT is performed fasting and measures blood glucose 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, and the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes should be confirmed with repeat testing before starting interventions.

### Cardiovascular health promotion in children: challenges and opportunities for 2020 and beyond: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^11141my5]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Fasting blood glucose and youth type 2 diabetes prevalence — At 12 to 19 years of age, the prevalence of ideal fasting blood glucose is notably higher in girls (80%) than boys (63%), and between 20% and 38% of children exhibit intermediate or poor fasting plasma glucose. Mexican Americans exhibit the lowest prevalence of ideal fasting blood glucose (58%) compared with non-Hispanic whites (73%) and non-Hispanic blacks (79%) at the same age. Because a very small number of NHANES 2007 to 2008 participants 12–19 years of age were noted to have poor status for fasting blood glucose levels (n = 5), the accuracy of the prevalence estimates from this sample is limited. SEARCH is an observational, multicenter study focusing on physician-diagnosed diabetes mellitus in individuals < 20 years of age, and in 2009 the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus among adolescents 10 through 19 years of age was 0.046%, with lower rates in boys (0.038%) than girls (0.058%). The highest prevalence in children 10 to 19 years of age was observed in American Indians (0.120%), followed by black (0.106%), Hispanic (0.079%), and Asian/Pacific-Islander (0.034%) youth, with the lowest in non-Hispanic white youth (0.017%); children 10 to 14 years had 0.023% compared with 15 to 19 years at 0.068%. Estimates from the population-based surveillance study should be used in conjunction with estimates from the NHANES data to monitor changes in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Child with suspected hyperglycemia [^114gBqCp]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Laboratory abnormalities — pre-diabetes is defined as fasting blood glucose: 100–125 mg/ dl, 2 hour post prandial glucose: 140–200 mg/dl after glucose load of 1 gm/kg (maximum dose: 75 gm) or HbA1c: 5.7–6.4%, while diabetes is defined as fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl, 2 hour post prandial glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl after glucose load of 1 gm/ kg (maximum dose: 75 gm), HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or random blood glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl in patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia; in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, result should be repeated.

### Management of diabetes in pregnancy: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115fnj3h]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Table 15.2 — blood glucose goals in pregnancies associated with diabetes details targets by diabetes type: for type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes, fasting 70–95 mg/dL (3.9–5.3 mmol/L), 1-h postprandial 110–140 mg/dL (6.1–7.8 mmol/L), and 2-h postprandial 100–120 mg/dL (5.6–6.7 mmol/L); for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) treated with insulin, fasting 70–95 mg/dL (3.9–5.3 mmol/L), 1-h 110–140 mg/dL (6.1–7.8 mmol/L), and 2-h 100–120 mg/dL (5.6–6.7 mmol/L); for GDM not treated with insulin, fasting < 95 mg/dL (< 5.3 mmol/L), 1-h < 140 mg/dL (< 7.8 mmol/L), and 2-h < 120 mg/dL (< 6.7 mmol/L). GDM blood glucose goals are recommended by the Fifth International Workshop-Conference on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus, and lower glucose limits do not apply to individuals with type 2 diabetes treated with nutrition alone; aim for less stringent goals if these cannot be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, and the optimal goal includes either a 1-h or 2-h postprandial glucose level within the column for the type of diabetes.

### Can' personalized diagnostics' promote earlier intervention for dysglycaemia? Hypothesis ready for testing [^114Jt8NH]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The risk associated with progression to diabetes as well as for cardiovascular complications increases along a continuum, rather than being threshold-dependent. How can we identify those with glucose levels in the upper reaches of normal who are most in need of a preventive intervention? With present criteria, we are likely excluding many individuals who have heightened risk. We introduce here the possibility of using a "personalized" glucose profile to encourage early intervention in subjects in whom glucose metabolism is deteriorating (on an individual level) but not yet abnormal on a population-based norm. We further suggest that "personalized profiles" of hemoglobin A1c and basal plasma insulin may also help encourage appropriately early intervention. That the first line therapies are so effective, safe and simple make these more sensitive approaches very attractive.

The actual cut points used may not, Alberti noted, be correct. The upper limit is the diabetes criterion, while the lower is an arbitrary figure. Those with IGT at levels exceeding 170 mg/dl fasting glucose probably have considerably greater risk than those with 2-h glucose levels closer to 140 mg/dl. The IFG criteria based on equalizing the numbers of individuals with IFG and IGT do not appear to be an evidence-based recommendation, and it is more accurate to understand that there is a continuum of risk within the glucose levels currently considered to represent pre-diabetes. First-phase insulin secretion becomes abnormal beginning at a fasting glucose of 95 mg/dl, Alberti stated, and he suggested that there is no real glucose cut point for CVD risk and that it is not clear why the risk of elevated 2-h glucose exceeds that of elevated fasting glucose.

One might, Alberti suggested, simply change the terminology and state that individuals with IFG or IGT in fact have diabetes, as has been suggested by the finding of retinopathy within populations of individuals with pre-diabetes. However, it would be rather complicated to abruptly double the number of individuals with diagnosed diabetes. What, he asked, is the pathophysiological basis for pre-diabetes? Islet abnormalities, insulin resistance, and genetic polymorphisms have been found, and the apparent distinction that IGT represents decreased glucose disposal while IFG is a state of glucose overproduction may be of importance. How, he asked, should we endeavor to detect individuals with pre-diabetes? This becomes an issue particularly if the GTT is not routinely performed, he stated, suggesting that it may be useful to develop screening approaches to determine appropriate candidates for the GTT, perhaps screening individuals based on obesity, family history or ethnic group, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or CVD. A possible stepwise approach is to start with a questionnaire such as that described by Tuomilehto (as summarized in ref.), perhaps supplemented by waist circumference measurement, followed first by fasting glucose measurement and then the GTT. Although A1C might be measured rather than performing a GTT, Alberti preferred the latter, suggesting that development of a home kit with oral glucose and test strips might be useful in population screening. An interesting study would compare the natural history of pre-diabetic individuals found by screening, pre-diabetic individuals found by history, and individuals having diabetes at initial presentation.

### Prediabetes: lifestyle, pharmacotherapy or regulation? [^115AEWui]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The rapidly rising number of people with diabetes worldwide has led to multiple attempts to identify effective means of preventing type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle interventions have shown impressive efficacy in multiple clinical trials of people with impaired glucose tolerance, but, as currently formulated, appear to have very little impact on impaired fasting glucose. Attempts to roll out lifestyle interventions beyond clinical trials have generally recruited too few people to have a chance of influencing the population prevalence of diabetes. Several drugs have also been shown to reduce the incidence of diabetes, but until such drugs can be shown to prevent the clinical consequences of diabetes, it is unlikely that guidelines will recommend their widespread use for diabetes prevention. Population-level interventions, including education and regulation, are attractive, as they have the potential to influence a high proportion of the population. Favourable effects of a sugar sweetened beverage tax on consumption are encouraging, but data on its influence on diabetes are not yet available.

### Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose [^116Di56J]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose form an intermediate stage in the natural history of diabetes mellitus. From 10 to 15 percent of adults in the United States have one of these conditions. Impaired glucose tolerance is defined as two-hour glucose levels of 140 to 199 mg per dL (7.8 to 11.0 mmol) on the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and impaired fasting glucose is defined as glucose levels of 100 to 125 mg per dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol per L) in fasting patients. These glucose levels are above normal but below the level that is diagnostic for diabetes. Patients with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose have a significant risk of developing diabetes and thus are an important target group for primary prevention. Risk factors for diabetes include family history of diabetes, body mass index greater than 25 kg per m2, sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, dyslipidemia, history of gestational diabetes or large-for-gestational-age infant, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Blacks, Latin Americans, Native Americans, and Asian-Pacific Islanders also are at increased risk for diabetes. Patients at higher risk should be screened with a fasting plasma glucose level. When the diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose is made, physicians should counsel patients to lose 5 to 7 percent of their body weight and engage in moderate physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week. Drug therapy with metformin or acarbose has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of diabetes. However, medications are not as effective as lifestyle changes, and it is not known if treatment with these drugs is cost effective in the management of impaired glucose tolerance.

### Pathogenesis of fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: implications for therapy [^114ThGMQ]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

The situation is quite different in people with diabetes. People with so-called mild type 2 diabetes have both fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia. In these studies, fasting glucose averaged ∼7.2 mmol/l before glucose ingestion and increased to ∼11 mmol/l after glucose ingestion. Despite higher glucose concentrations, peak insulin concentrations did not differ from those observed in the nondiabetic subjects. Furthermore, they were not achieved until 2 h after glucose ingestion. People with so-called severe type 2 diabetes have still higher fasting glucose concentrations, in this instance ∼10 mmol/l, and experience marked and prolonged hyperglycemia after eating. Once again, insulin secretion was delayed and peak insulin concentrations did not occur until 2 h after glucose ingestion. In addition, insulin concentrations during the 2 h after eating were lower than those observed in either people with mild diabetes or in people who did not have diabetes. Glucagon concentrations tended to be higher in people with either mild or severe diabetes before glucose ingestion and did not suppress and, if anything, paradoxically increased after glucose ingestion.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^113ffoED]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

This study has some limitations. First, due to the small number of studies included in individual meta‐analyses (particularly those for pre‐diabetes) or significant heterogeneity among studies, funnel plots were either not feasible or could be misleading, which limited our ability to investigate the possibility of publication bias. Second, previous studies have shown that the phenotypes of pre‐diabetes differed with gender, age and other characteristics. However, due to the lack of detailed information on these characteristics in the included studies, we were unable to present the distribution of different combinations of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c levels in different subgroups defined by age, gender and body mass index. Third, as with other meta‐analyses of single‐group proportions, we observed significant heterogeneity among studies. This heterogeneity was unlikely caused by different diagnostic criteria because the studies using non‐ADA criteria were few (≤ 2 in all analytic scenarios) and small in sample size and were analysed separately. Subgroup analyses showed that the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes and the contribution of HbA1c elevation to them were both higher in the small studies, and the contribution of HbA1c elevation was also higher in Asian studies. Given that large studies typically produce more robust estimates than do small ones, the actual prevalence of diabetes could be lower than 15% (the overall estimate from meta‐analysis of all studies) and close to 11% (the overall estimate from meta‐analysis of large studies). The much higher contribution of HbA1c to the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes in Asian populations (70.4% vs. 42.5% in non‐Asian for diabetes) suggests that the use of HbA1c for diagnosis in these populations should be particularly carefully considered, taking into account the large number of new cases and the magnitude of possible treatment efficacy in these cases.

Table 2.1 — Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals — Diagnosis can be established by any of the following: A1C ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is NGSP certified and standardized to the DCCT assay; fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h; 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG) ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The test should be performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water; or, in an individual with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L). Random is any time of the day without regard to time since previous meal. In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, diagnoses require two abnormal results from different tests which may be obtained at the same time (e.g. A1C and FPG), or the same test at two different time points.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is a growing global public health concern, affecting over 537 million individuals worldwide — over 90% of whom have type 2 diabetes. Even more people are affected by pre‐diabetes, an intermediate stage between normoglycaemia and diabetes, although the introduction of this term has caused some concerns about over‐diagnosis and over‐treatment. Detection of diabetes and pre‐diabetes aims to identify individuals at increased risk of macrovascular (e.g. cardiovascular disease) and microvascular complications (e.g. retinopathy) and inform subsequent interventions, including pharmacological treatment. The diagnostic criteria for diabetes have been revised several times over the past few decades. Two‐hour post‐load glucose (2hPG) was first used to diagnose diabetes, and then fasting blood glucose (FPG) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were added to the diagnostic criteria. Likewise, the criteria for diagnosing pre‐diabetes include impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and elevated HbA1c. According to the latest guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), a diagnosis of diabetes or pre‐diabetes can be made when any of these glycaemic indicators exceed their respective thresholds. Although diagnostic practice in other countries or populations may vary in terms of the more commonly used diagnostic measures (e.g. whether HbA1c testing is preferred), the cutoffs adopted (e.g. the lower thresholds of FPG and HbA1c for diagnosing pre‐diabetes) and diagnostic rigour (e.g. whether repeat testing is required if the first testing is positive), most countries' guidelines recommend that 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c can all be used for the diagnosis of diabetes and pre‐diabetes. The increase in the number of diagnostic measures would inevitably increase the number of new cases and prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes, because the test results of different diagnostic measures do not align with each other perfectly. For example, in the case of isolated FPG elevation, the FPG level exceeds the diagnostic threshold for diabetes, while 2hPG and HbA1c are 'normal'

Section 1 — diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) — Diagnosis can be made by any of the following: fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration ≥ 126 mg/dL (after ≥ 8 h or overnight fast), plasma glucose (PG) concentration ≥ 200 mg/dL 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose load following an overnight fast, a random PG concentration ≥ 200 mg/dL with symptoms of hyperglycemia, or hemoglobin A1c (A1c) level ≥ 6.5%. Diagnosis of DM requires 2 abnormal test results from the same sample or on different days; however, a glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms confirms DM.

### Impaired glucose tolerance as a disease [^111sbtHD]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Current criteria for diagnosing diabetes, based on fasting plasma glucose levels during administration of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), are poorly sensitive and are only modestly predictive of microvascular risk. The period after administration of OGTT is far more predictive and more closely resembles the postprandial state where microvascular risk is elevated. However, persons who do not yet exhibit symptoms of diabetes may nonetheless have impaired glucose tolerance or dysglycemia, whereby macrovascular disease can develop at a glucose level lower than the threshold for microvascular disease and can progress in a graded fashion. This article reviews the factors that may cause dysglycemia (including insulin resistance and obesity) and how diet, blood pressure control, and the use of statins or glycemic/insulin sensitizing may reduce cardiovascular risk in this prediabetic population.

C. Categories of increased risk for diabetes

In 1997 and 2003, The Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus recognized an intermediate group of individuals whose glucose levels, although not meeting criteria for diabetes, are nevertheless too high to be considered normal. This group was defined as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG levels of 100 mg/dl [5.6 mmol/l] to 125 mg/dl [6.9 mmol/l]) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (2-h OGTT values of 140 mg/dl [7.8 mmol/l] to 199 mg/dl [11.0 mmol/l]).

Individuals with IFG and/or IGT have been referred to as having pre-diabetes, indicating the relatively high risk for the future development of diabetes. IFG and IGT should not be viewed as clinical entities in their own right but rather risk factors for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD). IFG and IGT are associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension. Structured lifestyle intervention, aimed at increasing physical activity and producing 5–10% loss of body weight, and certain pharmacological agents have been demonstrated to prevent or delay the development of diabetes in people with IGT (see Table 7). It should be noted that the 2003 ADA Expert Committee report reduced the lower FPG cut point to define IFG from 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) to 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l), in part to make the prevalence of IFG more similar to that of IGT. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) and many other diabetes organizations did not adopt this change.

### Normal fasting plasma glucose and risk of type 2 diabetes [^115iGgf7]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To investigate the association of normal fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and the risk for type 2 diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Data concerning 13,845 subjects, aged 40–69 years, who had their FPG measured at least three times between 1992 and 2008 were extracted from a database. Three FPG groups were defined (51–82, 83–90, and 91–99 mg/dL). A Cox proportional hazards analysis was applied to estimate the risk of incident diabetes adjusted for other risk factors.

RESULTS

During 108,061 person-years of follow-up (8,110 women and 5,735 men), 307 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were found. The final model demonstrated a hazard ratio of 2.03 (95% CI 1.18–3.50) for 91–99 mg/dL and 1.42 (0.42–4.74) for 83–90 mg/dL.

CONCLUSIONS

Our data suggest that FPG between 91 and 99 mg/dL is a strong independent predictor of type 2 diabetes and should be used to identify people to be further investigated and aided with preventive measures.

For WHO 2011, IFG is 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L) and "A1c is not recommended for diagnosis of intermediate glycemia". For IEC 2009, high risk by A1c is 6.0%–6.4% (42–46 mmol/mol) and the comment states "Restricted to higher risk group than ADA definition for T2DM prevention".

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 The diagnostic dilemma

Diabetes can be clinically diagnosed based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2‐hour plasma glucose following a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (2hOGTT) or glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). All three metrics are continuous variables in human populations with no inflection points that differentiate between normal glucose metabolism and chronic hyperglycaemia. Marked overlap in what's normal and what's abnormal led to the use of 'prediabetes' as a clinical diagnosis for individuals with inconclusive test results. Normal, prediabetic and diabetic reference ranges recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) represent the medical community's best estimate of what can be expected in metabolically normal people compared to those with Type 2 diabetes. Periodic prediabetes screening is now recommended for all people between 35 and 70 years of age based on FPG, 2hOGTT or HbA1c. The problem with this multimetric approach is that prediabetes diagnoses based on these three common clinical tests often disagree.,

1.2 Are two metrics better than one?

In an effort to develop a more specific, timely and unambiguous approach to diabetes diagnosis, Selvin et al.proposed a two‐dimensional, single‐sample definition of confirmed undiagnosed diabetes as having both FPG and HbA1c levels above their respective ADA diabetes cutpoints. The investigators used this confirmation‐by‐agreement approach to analyse data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and found that 'A single‐sample confirmatory definition of diabetes had a high positive predictive value for subsequent diagnosis and was strongly associated with clinical end points'. The authors defined unconfirmed undiagnosed diabetes as having either FPG or HbA1c but not both above their respective cutpoints and suggested that diagnostic ambiguity should be addressed by monitoring FPG and HbA1c over time.

### Estimation and implications of the genetic architecture of fasting and non-fasting blood glucose [^114WtMN7]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The genetic regulation of post-prandial glucose levels is poorly understood. Here, we characterise the genetic architecture of blood glucose variably measured within 0 and 24h of fasting in 368,000 European ancestry participants of the UK Biobank. We found a near-linear increase in the heritability of non-fasting glucose levels over time, which plateaus to its fasting state value after 5h post meal (h² = 11%; standard error: 1%). The genetic correlation between different fasting times is > 0.77, suggesting that the genetic control of glucose is largely constant across fasting durations. Accounting for heritability differences between fasting times leads to a ~16% improvement in the discovery of genetic variants associated with glucose. Newly detected variants improve the prediction of fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes in independent samples. Finally, we meta-analysed summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of random and fasting glucose (N = 518,615) and identified 156 independent SNPs explaining 3% of fasting glucose variance. Altogether, our study demonstrates the utility of random glucose measures to improve the discovery of genetic variants associated with glucose homeostasis, even in fasting conditions.

Prediabetes — definition and glycemic thresholds: People with prediabetes are defined by the presence of IFG and/or IGT and/or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol). IFG is defined as FPG levels from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) and 2-h PG levels during 75-g OGTT from 140 to 199 mg/dL (from 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L). The World Health Organization and a number of diabetes organizations define the IFG lower limit at 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L), whereas in 2003 the ADA adopted the range of 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L). Prediabetes is associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension; the presence of prediabetes should prompt comprehensive screening for cardiovascular risk factors and risk management.

### Approach to the patient with prediabetes [^113vaqsQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Prediabetes consists of impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance and is a significant risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes, microvascular, and macrovascular disease. The values used to define prediabetes are arbitrary, because prediabetes represents an intermediary category along the continuum from normal glucose levels and tolerance to overt hyperglycemia. The progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes occurs over many years, strong evidence to support intervention to delay the progression from prediabetes to diabetes. Large, randomized prospective studies with lifestyle intervention and/or various modes of pharmacotherapy have demonstrated successful delay of diabetes. Several issues in the management of prediabetes remain controversial, such as the role of pharmacotherapy and when to escalate treatment. This article will review some of the issues surrounding the identification and treatment of prediabetes, with an interpretation of the available data to help guide management.

### Prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance in nondiabetic U.S. adults [^114wNfLx]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Study variables and definitions

The current ADA definition for IFG is blood glucose 100–125 mg/dl after an 8-h fast. When the IFG category was initially introduced by the ADA, IFG was defined as 110–125 mg/dl after fasting. In 2003, the ADA lowered the threshold of IFG to better capture those who met the World Health Organization's (WHO) criteria for IGT. WHO defines IGT as a glucose level of 140–199 mg/dl 2 h after a glucose load. We compared the estimates of the prevalence of pre-diabetes using the old and the new fasting blood glucose criterion.

Subjects were asked if their physicians have ever told them that they have "borderline diabetes, pre-diabetes, impaired fasting glucose, or impaired glucose tolerance". A prior diagnosis of pre-diabetes was considered to be a "yes" to any of the four terms.

The ADA recommends metformin alone as the antihyperglycemic of choice based upon the DPP results. However, because NHANES does not indicate the class of antihyperglycemic used for IFG/IGT, we could only determine whether any antihyperglycemic medication was given. Lifestyle modification included either exercise, diet modification, or both. Subjects who averaged at least 30 min of vigorous or moderate activity daily for the previous 30 days were considered "compliant" with ADA recommendations for treatment of IFG/IGT. Vigorous activity was defined as activity that causes "heavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate". Moderate activity was defined as activity that causes "moderate sweating or slight to moderate increases in breathing or heart rate". Subjects were asked if they maintained their activity levels over the last year relative to the last 30 days. Provider recommendation for diet modification included reporting either counseling to reduce weight or counseling to reduce fat/calorie intake, or both. NHANES did not indicate the chronological order of the physician recommendations and the actual change in exercise or diet, so it was not possible to determine if lifestyle behaviors changed in response to the recommendations.

### Decreased insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity are associated with liver function in subjects with fasting glucose between 100 and 109 mg / dL in Taiwanese population [^112esaJ4]. Pancreas (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, the American Diabetes Association recommended that the lower limit for the diagnosis of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) should be reduced from 110 to 100 mg/dL in the analysis of the associated risk factors of IFG. It has been proposed that liver dysfunction may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. A primary aim was to investigate the relationship between liver enzyme and insulin resistance (IR) in IFG group. The secondary aim was to investigate IR and beta-cell function assessed by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR and HOMA-%B, respectively) in subjects with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) between 100 and 109 mg/dL.

Methods

We enrolled 284 subjects whose medical history and physical examination required tests to screen for metabolic abnormalities. In addition, we also excluded all factors affecting glucose or insulin metabolism. According to the FPG level, they were divided into the following groups: group A, FPG < 100 mg/dL; group B, FPG = 100 to 109 mg/dL; group C, FPG = 110 to 125 mg/dL.

Results

Group B as compared with group A had significant increase of HOMA-IR and decrease of HOMA-%B. Among the whole population, the fasting insulin level, the fasting glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, aspartate aminotransferase, and the diastolic blood pressure all increased significantly as the glycemic status progressed, whereas HOMA-%B levels decreased significantly as the glycemic status progressed. The lipid profile, alkaline phosphatase, and systolic blood pressure did not differ significantly among 3 different glycemic classifications.

Conclusions

Study results indicate that, first, there was a significant decrease of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in subjects with fasting glucose from 100 to 109 mg/dL compared with subjects with normal fasting glucose. Second, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase were associated with IR as the glycemic status progressed in the IFG group.

Evidence cited includes a 2021 systematic review of seven randomized controlled trials (n = 338) in obese patients with T2DM showing that effects on HbA1c, lipid profile, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and blood pressure were equivalent between intermittent fasting (IF) and a standard diet, with median follow-up of 24 weeks, while weight loss favored IF by 1.89 kg (95% CI: -2.91 to -0.86 kg). Safety concerns include that patients taking medication with the potential to cause hypoglycemia should exercise caution and that the risk of having a hypoglycemic event was twofold greater during periods of IF.

This has led to the designation of "prediabetes", which is an intermediate form of dysglycemia on a spectrum ranging from normal to overt diabetes. The American Diabetes Association defines prediabetes as a fasting glucose of 100 to < 126 mg/dL (impaired fasting glucose [IFG]), a 2-h plasma glucose of 140 to < 200 mg/dL after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]), or HbA 1c 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) to < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol). Fasting glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL portends an increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women, and mortality. HbA 1c levels 5.5% (37 mmol/mol) to < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) are associated with an increased risk of diabetes and CVD compared with levels < 5.5% (37 mmol/mol) even after adjustment for fasting glucose and key CVD risk factors. Because of these associated risks, surveillance of prediabetes allows better prediction of diabetes trends and of the resources that will be required to treat rising diabetes.

### Screening and diagnosis of prediabetes: where are we headed? [^1136UrjM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

It is currently estimated that more than 300 million people have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), putting them at increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its adverse consequences. In addition, many others are at risk on the basis of a family history of T2DM, obesity, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Screening for risk should include both blood glucose testing in high-risk populations and prescreening (e.g. by questionnaire, waist circumference measurement) to identify high-risk individuals in overall low-risk populations; these individuals should then undergo glucose testing. Fasting plasma glucose measurement cannot diagnose IGT; the preferred definite test for diagnosis is oral glucose tolerance testing.

### Fasting plasma glucose concentrations for specified HbA1c goals in Korean populations: data from the fifth Korea national health and nutrition examination survey (KNHANES V-2, 2011) [^114B4AZW]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2016). Low credibility.

Third, it is important that FPG is accurately measured for the screening or diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes, although it was reported that it would be inappropriate to use the fasting glucose criteria alone for screening diabetes and the 2-h glucose seems to be a particularly important diagnostic tool in Asian populations. In fact, most Korean people take regular (biennial) medical examinations at the National Health Insurance Corp including fasting glucose measurement. Any suspicious findings on the results can be sufficient to suggest that they need a doctor's exam or inspections for an accurate diagnosis and any necessary treatments. However, many Korean people think that prediabetes and diabetes are screened as a result of these examinations even though health screening is not for diagnosis, and they are not worried about these hyperglycemic states if normal or slightly elevated serum glucose levels are measured. Furthermore, many laboratories including the National Health Examination measure serum glucose even though guidelines rather recommend measurement of plasma because large-scale medical checkups require a simple and cost-effective sample collection method. Our previous hospital-based report using data from 2028 persons for the evaluation of metabolic abnormalities including impaired fasting glucose or dyslipidemia suspected through health examinations in the National Health Insurance Corp. or by personal medical checkup showed that 22.1% had newly diagnosed diabetes according to FPG. Even, among participants with normoglycemia according to serum glucose, 14.2% had newly diagnosed diabetes according to FPG diagnostic criteria. It is thought that these findings may be one of the important reasons why the diagnosis of diabetes, which is the fifth-leading cause of death in Korea, could be underestimated.

### Baseline fasting glucose level, age, sex, and body mass index and the development of diabetes in US adults [^1177c6Lv]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

Overall, this cohort study demonstrates that even within normal ranges, a higher baseline FPG level continues to be a robust marker of future diabetes development. However, an individual's risk is substantially altered depending on sex, age, and BMI. These variables facilitate an individualized risk-to-benefit assessment when discussing strategies to lower progression to diabetes and associated comorbidities.

### GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin-(9–39) elevates fasting blood glucose levels in congenital hyperinsulinism owing to inactivating mutations in the ATP-sensitive K + channel [^116mKRjY]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Effect of exendin-(9–39) on fasting blood glucose.

After a 12-h overnight fast, mean baseline blood glucose concentration at time 0 was not different on vehicle and exendin-(9–39) days (5.8 ± 1.3 mmol/L [105.3 ± 23 mg/dL] vs. 5.9 ± 1.2 mmol/L [105.6 ± 22.3 mg/dL], respectively; P = 0.819) (Fig. 1). Of note, three of the subjects had a baseline blood glucose concentration > 7 mmol/L (127 mg/dL). During vehicle infusion, blood glucose decreased in all subjects, and eight of the subjects developed hypoglycemia with blood glucose concentrations < 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL); three of the eight required an intravenous infusion of dextrose for symptomatic hypoglycemia and blood glucose concentrations < 3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL). The time to hypoglycemia during vehicle infusion varied among the subjects, with three subjects developing hypoglycemia within the first 3 h of the study (or an ∼15-h fast), while the other five developed hypoglycemia after 3 h. In contrast, during exendin-(9–39) infusion, hypoglycemia did not occur in any of the subjects. Mean nadir blood glucose concentration was significantly greater during exendin-(9–39) infusion compared with vehicle infusion (4.9 ± 1.1 mmol/L [88.4 ± 19.5 mg/dL] vs. 3.5 ± 0.3 mmol/L [63.4 ± 5.3 mg/dL]; P = 0.009) (Fig. 1). Mean blood glucose AUC from 0 min to the end of the infusion at 360 min was significantly greater during exendin-(9–39) infusion compared with vehicle (2,096 ± 454 mmol ⋅ min/L [37,734 ± 8176 mg ⋅ min/dL] vs. 1,678 ± 281 mmol ⋅ min/L [30,201 ± 5,050 mg ⋅ min/dL]; P = 0.013). Blood glucose AUC was significantly greater during exendin-(9–39) infusion compared with vehicle at all dose levels (100 pmol/kg/min: 489 ± 88 mmol ⋅ min/L [8,808 ± 1,580 mg ⋅ min/dL] vs. 425 ± 87 mmol ⋅ min/L [7,654 ± 1,573 mg ⋅ min/dL], P = 0.012; 300 pmol/kg/min: 480 ± 124 mmol ⋅ min/L [8,642 ± 2,227 mg ⋅ min/dL] vs. 365 ± 64 mmol ⋅ min/L [6,562 ± 1,158 mg ⋅ min/dL], P = 0.023; and 500 pmol/kg/min: 433 ± 106 mmol ⋅ min/L [7,789 ± 1,903 mg ⋅ min/dL] vs. 303 ± 31 mmol ⋅ min/L [5,456 ± 563 mg ⋅ min/dL], P = 0.009).

Serum glucose level before FDG administration — fasting and glucose thresholds are specified to ensure appropriate imaging conditions: the main objectives of patient preparation with at least 4 h of fasting are to ensure low blood glucose and low insulinaemia, and efforts should be made to decrease blood glucose to normal levels (typically 4–7 mmol/L), though hyperglycaemia should not represent an absolute contraindication; blood glucose level must be measured prior to administering FDG, and a calibrated and validated method must be used if plasma glucose is used to correct standardized uptake values (SUVs); on arrival, glucose should not be below 4 mmol/L (about 70 mg/dL); for clinical studies, if plasma glucose is lower than 11 mmol/L (about 200 mg/dL) the FDG PET/CT study can be performed; for research studies, the recommended upper plasma glucose levels may range between 7 and 8.3 mmol/L (126 mg/dL and 150 mg/dL), with the upper threshold specified in the protocol and patients outside the specified range often excluded.

### Baseline fasting glucose level, age, sex, and body mass index and the development of diabetes in US adults [^114EPACK]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

With regard to choice of diagnostic test, measuring the FPG level has the advantage of being widely available and inexpensive, but the associated fasting requirement is burdensome, and the test is associated with significant biological variation. There is an increasing move toward the use of HbA 1c level, or a combination of FPG level and HbA 1c level for diagnosis of diabetes. Using the HbA 1c level overcomes many of the disadvantages of using the FPG level, but it is more expensive, not as widely available, and may be influenced by factors other than glucose, including race and ethnicity and change in erythrocyte life span. Discriminating based on FPG level vs HbA 1c level will detect different populations, and these tests individually and combined are less sensitive and specific than the criterion standard oral glucose tolerance test. In a study using data from 117 worldwide studies, 29% participants with screening-detected diabetes had elevated FPG levels, 37% had isolated elevated HbA 1c levels, and 31% had an elevation in both parameters. However, 55% of those with screening-detected diabetes in central and eastern Europe and 45% in high-income Western regions had isolated abnormal FPG levels. Both abnormal FPG and HbA 1c levels are associated with increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular disease, and there are effective approaches for delaying type 2 diabetes across both categories, with more intensive approaches advised for those at highest risk. Based on this evidence, by relying on serial FPG measurements, we will have missed some individuals with diabetes in our cohort and possibly overestimated diabetes among individuals who erroneously did not fast for the test. However, our approach was in keeping with prior studies, and congruent with our study population demographics and the overall practice across REP clinical sites throughout the study period.

### Impaired fasting glucose, blood pressure and cardiovascular disease mortality [^116Yugg3]. Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L [110 to 125 mg/dL]) is a common glycemic disorder which usually progress to diabetes mellitus. The relationships between impaired fasting glucose, other risk factors including blood pressure, and mortality have never been clearly investigated. We studied 63 443 consecutive men (ages 21 to 60 years), each of whom had a routine health examination with a fasting plasma glucose measurement. Men with known ischemic cardiac disease and treatment for diabetes or hypertension were excluded. Impaired fasting glucose was found in 10 773 (17.0%) of these men. Mean body mass index, serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and systolic, diastolic, and pulse blood pressure were significantly higher for men with impaired fasting glucose compared with those men with normal fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 3.9 to 6.0 mmol/L). When adjusted for confounding variables, relative risk of 8-year cardiovascular mortality associated with impaired fasting glucose was dependent on systolic blood pressure level (1.02 [95% CI: 0.62 to 1.70] when < 140 mm Hg and 2.10 [95% CI: 1.16 to 3.80] between 140 and 160 mm Hg). Inversely, relative risk of 8-year cardiovascular mortality associated with moderate systolic hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg) compared with normal systolic blood pressure (< 140 mm Hg) was highly dependent on the glycemic status (2.97 [95% CI: 1.58 to 5.55] for men with impaired fasting glucose compared with 1.35 [95% CI: 0.84 to 2.18] in those with normal fasting glucose). Similar results were found concerning overall mortality. In conclusion, the presence of moderate systolic hypertension can identify subjects with impaired fasting glucose who are at risk of cardiovascular and overall mortality, and vice versa, probably through the metabolic syndrome.

### American college of endocrinology pre-diabetes consensus conference: part one [^1146iXRS]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Jacqueline Dekker (Amsterdam, the Netherlands) discussed the Hoorn Study, emphasizing the need for evidence-based prevention of diabetes and vascular complications. She discussed the complex history of criteria for diabetes and pre-diabetes. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) definitions of diabetes accept fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l/l) and 2-h post–75-g glucose load levels ≥ 200 mg/dl (≥ 11.1 mmol/l). In 2003, the ADA suggested that the lower limit of IFG be reduced from 110 to 100 mg/dl, putting it in conflict with the WHO guidelines. Genuth and Kahn have recently argued that neither IGT nor IGT is useful. Recently, there have been proposals that A1C should be used in the diagnosis of diabetes. There are, then, a number of approaches to assessing diabetes risk: those based on direct measures (IFG and IGT) and those based on markers like A1C and the presence of metabolic syndrome. Dekker proposed that we endeavor to understand the performance of the differing definitions and the prevalence of the (pre-) disease states so defined, their agreement, and their associations with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and with diabetes from the dual perspectives of clinical care and public health interests.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^117RVmWh]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

Some studies found that the association of fasting blood glucose (FPG) or glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) elevation with diabetic complications was not statistically significant after controlling for the confounding caused by 2‐h post‐load glucose (2hPG) elevation. Furthermore, inclusion of HbA1c as a diagnostic measure for diabetes has raised some concerns about over‐diagnosis and over‐treatment. This study aimed to quantify the contributions of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes respectively, by synthesising global data, which can serve as essential parameters in cost‐effectiveness analysis and inform updates of practice guidelines about prevention and control of diabetes.

Materials and Methods

The levels of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c were classified as either 'elevated' or 'normal' Each distinct combination of these markers (e.g. 'elevated 2hPG, normal FPG and normal HbA1c') defined a unique subgroup, resulting in a total of seven subgroups for both diabetes and pre‐diabetes. The contribution of 2hPG elevation to diabetes prevalence was calculated as its proportion among all diabetes cases; the same approach was applied to FPG and HbA1c elevations, as well as to pre‐diabetes prevalence. To retrieve global data, five electronic databases (i.e. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang) were searched from their inception to February 2024. Studies that fulfilled the following criteria were considered eligible: (1) were conducted in adults without previously diagnosed diabetes; (2) were cross‐sectional studies or baseline surveys of cohort studies (which can be regarded as a special type of cross‐sectional studies); and (3) reported directly or allowed for calculation of the proportion of each subgroup out of all diabetes and/or the proportion of each subgroup out of all pre‐diabetes. A 10‐item tool selected from literature was used to appraise the quality of included data. The proportions of each subgroup among all diabetes cases were meta‐analysed across eligible studies with the random‐effects model using the MetaXL software. Similar meta‐analyses were conducted for pre‐diabetes.

Results

Thirty‐two eligible studies were identified, with 25 reporting on newly detected diabetes (n = 289 094) and 15 on pre‐diabetes (n = 221 988) and the majority of them using identical diagnostic cutoffs proposed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The mean age of participants ranged from 24 to 68 years (median of mean ages: 51). Twenty‐four studies (75%) were assessed as at low risk for ≥ 7 out of the 10 quality items. In the general population, based on the ADA criteria, the weighted prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes was 15% and 69%, respectively. Among those with newly detected diabetes (n = 24 214), 69% had elevated 2hPG, 44% elevated FPG and 61% elevated HbA1c; 7% had isolated FPG elevation; 20% had isolated HbA1c elevation. Among those with newly detected pre‐diabetes (n = 133 621), 33% had elevated 2hPG, 51% elevated FPG and 68% elevated HbA1c; 17% had isolated FPG elevation; 34% had isolated HbA1c elevation. Sensitivity analyses stratified by participant comorbidities and study quality produced results consistent with the main findings.

Conclusions

The largest contributors to the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes are 2hPG and HbA1c, respectively. Isolated FPG and HbA1c elevations account for over a quarter of all diabetes and more than half of all pre‐diabetes.

Furthermore, our UR found high-certainty evidence supporting the positive effect of IF on fasting insulin levels. This finding is consistent with previous study that have demonstrated a slight reduction in fasting insulin concentrations caused by IF with IER regimens (MD = −0.89 μU/mL; 95% CI: −1.56 to −0.22; p = 0.009). The underlying mechanism behind the effect of IF on fasting insulin levels involves several metabolic pathways. IF helps regulate insulin levels by activating cellular repair processes, reducing overall calorie intake, improving insulin sensitivity, enhancing autophagic flux, promoting metabolic flexibility, and reducing in oxidative stress.,

In our study, we found no perceptible alteration in fasting glucose levels. However, it is worth noting that there are studies with different findings. For instance, Chen et al.conducted a meta-analysis where participants underwent TRE for 6–48 weeks, and they observed a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose levels following the IF period compared to a habitual diet group. These contrasting results underscore the complexity of the relationship between IF and fasting blood glucose levels. Factors such as the duration of IF, the population, and individual metabolic differences may contribute to the observed discrepancies. Therefore, further research is necessary to gain a better understanding of the effects of IF on fasting blood glucose levels, taking into account various factors that may influence the outcomes.

### Optimal hyperglycemia thresholds in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a cross sectional study of oncologists' practices [^111cVVrk]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Thresholds to define hyperglycemia in cancer patients vary significantly in the literature. Storey et al. reviewed 30 studies that used a wide range of blood glucose levels to define hyperglycemia (e.g. 99 to < 126 mg/dL, greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL, greater than 200 mg/dL). Other studies used quartiles in accordance with the mean glucose levels beginning at 106 mg/dL, 106.7–117.2 mg/dL, 117.3–142.6 mg/dL, and ending at 142.6 mg/dL, while others described a classification of mild, moderate and severe, beginning at 121 mg/dL. Only seven of the 30 studies used the American Diabetes Association (ADA)'s criteria for diagnosing prediabetes and diabetes. Diabetes is defined by the ADA as a fasting blood glucose equal or greater than 126 mg/dL, or a 2-h plasma glucose following an oral glucose tolerance test equal-to or greater than 200 mg/dL, or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) equal-to or greater than 6.5%, or a random plasma glucose equal-to or greater than 200 mg/dL in patients with symptoms of hyperglycemia.

Despite individual efforts to guide and educate oncologists and oncology nurses on how to manage diabetes and hyperglycemia in cancer patients, it was not until May 2022 that a multidisciplinary team working on behalf of the United Kingdom Chemotherapy Board and the Joint British Diabetes Society for Inpatient Care created guidelines for the management of hyperglycemia in cancer patients with or without prior diabetes starting anticancer or glucocorticoid therapy. The document also provides guidance on identifying cancer patients who are at risk for hyperglycemic episodes and new onset diabetes mellitus. Neither the United States (US) nor the European oncology guidelines include details for the appropriate management of hyperglycemia in patients undergoing chemotherapy. In the US, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 included specific blood glucose thresholds to classify hyperglycemia severity on a grade from 1–5. However, the currently used CTCAE version 5.0 presents a qualitative description of each severity level based on the medical and therapeutic interventions needed, without specifying any quantitative thresholds. Furthermore, few package inserts for anticancer medications that are known to cause hyperglycemia include recommendations for dose-holding or reductions according to blood glucose level. Considering this relative lack of guidance, it is unclear what target blood glucose levels clinicians in cancer centers use in clinical practice when managing patients with cancer experiencing hyperglycemia.

### Does elevated plasma triglyceride level independently predict impaired fasting glucose? the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) [^111ut4Fd]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, elevated triglycerides (TGs), low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and high fasting glucose tend to coexist. A cluster of these risk factors, also called the metabolic syndrome, significantly increases risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is defined as fasting glucose between 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L), and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is defined as a 2-h value of the oral glucose tolerance test of 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) to 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). People with IFG or IGT are considered to have prediabetes; IFG and IGT form the intermediate stage in the development of diabetes. Clinical trials have consistently demonstrated that lifestyle and pharmacological interventions can significantly reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes among individuals with prediabetes. There are ∼79 million American adults with IFG, and 15–30% of them will develop type 2 diabetes within 5 years without lifestyle changes. One may speculate that early prevention of IFG may be an effective and important strategy to address the growing burden of diabetes.

IFG often coexists with other metabolic syndrome components and is included in the definition of the metabolic syndrome in epidemiological studies; nevertheless, the temporal association of other cardiometabolic risk factors, particularly elevated TGs with IFG has not been well examined. As people with normal fasting glucose can also have elevated TGs and other cardiometabolic risk factors, it is reasonable to assume that those with higher TGs and other cardiometabolic risk factors may have a greater risk of developing IFG. Elevated TGs have been used in diabetes risk prediction models, but little is known about whether elevated TG levels also increase the risk for IFG independently of central obesity, HDL-C, and elevated blood pressure (BP).

The primary objective of this study was to examine 1) the association of elevated TGs with the development of IFG independently of other metabolic syndrome components (large waist circumference [WC], low HDL-C, and elevated BP) and 2) the predictive value of elevated TGs with regard to IFG risk.

### Assessing the preprandial glucose target: 100 mg / dL versus 110 mg / dL [^116Qfsrv]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the potential value of lowering the impaired fasting glucose (IFG) cut point from 110 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL.

Methods

Data from pertinent published studies are analyzed in an effort to identify the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality under various glycemic conditions.

Results

The risk of developing diabetes increases with advancing age. The relationship is strongest when the 2-hour plasma glucose level is analyzed, whereas the fasting plasma glucose level is generally stable and changes little with aging. The 2-hour plasma glucose level has a linear relationship with cardiovascular disease and mortality. Most patients with acute myocardial infarction have high 2-hour plasma glucose levels but normal fasting plasma glucose values. Increased mortality risk based on the fasting plasma glucose level does not appear until values of approximately 7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) and remains relatively flat at lower levels.

Conclusion

Lowering the cut point for IFG from 6.1 mmol/L to 5.6 mmol/L (110 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL) increases the prevalence of IFG but does not predict mortality below 7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL).

### Normal fasting plasma glucose and risk of type 2 diabetes [^111oP9N7]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the association of normal fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and the risk for type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

Data concerning 13,845 subjects, aged 40–69 years, who had their FPG measured at least three times between 1992 and 2008 were extracted from a database. Three FPG groups were defined (51–82, 83–90, and 91–99 mg/dL). A Cox proportional hazards analysis was applied to estimate the risk of incident diabetes adjusted for other risk factors.

Results

During 108,061 person-years of follow-up (8,110 women and 5,735 men), 307 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were found. The final model demonstrated a hazard ratio of 2.03 (95% CI 1.18–3.50) for 91–99 mg/dL and 1.42 (0.42–4.74) for 83–90 mg/dL.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that FPG between 91 and 99 mg/dL is a strong independent predictor of type 2 diabetes and should be used to identify people to be further investigated and aided with preventive measures.

### Prediabetes [^113MwR1P]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Prediabetes or intermediate hyperglycaemia represents a preliminary stage in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition to an increased likelihood of developing T2DM, individuals with prediabetes have an elevated risk of various vascular and non-vascular complications. No consensus has been achieved on the ideal screening strategy for prediabetes, with fasting plasma glucose concentration, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and the oral glucose tolerance test being the most frequently measured parameters. The two major phenotypes of prediabetes, that is, impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, may represent different pathophysiologies with varying natural history, risk of adverse outcomes and responsiveness to treatment. Most of the evidence for managing prediabetes focuses on lifestyle modification with or without medications in individuals with overweight or obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Whether these interventions are beneficial in individuals with impaired fasting glucose and those of normal body weight is unclear, as is the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of pharmacotherapy for treating prediabetes. Large-scale national T2DM prevention programmes are currently under way to assess whether the benefits of interventions for prediabetes can be translated to the community setting.

### Pathogenesis of fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: implications for therapy [^114weENV]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this research is to gain a greater understanding of the cause of fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia in people with type 2 diabetes. Endogenous glucose production is excessive before eating and fails to appropriately suppress after eating in people with type 2 diabetes. This is due in part to impaired insulin-induced suppression of endogenous glucose production, which is observed early in the evolution of type 2 diabetes. Increased rates of gluconeogenesis and perhaps glycogenolysis contribute to hepatic insulin resistance. Insulin-induced stimulation of hepatic glucose uptake and hepatic glycogen synthesis are reduced in people with type 2 diabetes primarily due to decreased uptake of extracellular glucose presumably because of inadequate activation of hepatic glucokinase. Delayed insulin secretion results in higher peak glucose concentrations particularly when suppression of glucagon is impaired, whereas insulin resistance prolongs the duration of hyperglycemia, which can be marked when both hepatic and extra-hepatic insulin resistance are present. The premise of these studies, as well as those performed by many other investigators, is that an understanding of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes will enable the development of targeted therapies that are directed toward correcting specific metabolic defects in a given individual. I, as well as many other investigators, believe that such therapies are likely to be more effective and to have a lower risk than would occur if everyone were treated the same regardless of the underlying cause of their hyperglycemia. While we do not yet have sufficient knowledge to truly individualize therapy, in my opinion this approach will be the norm in the not too distant future.

### Olanzapine pamoate (Zyprexa) [^114kfepw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus

Healthcare providers should consider the risks and benefits when prescribing olanzapine to patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or having borderline increased blood glucose level (fasting 100–126 mg/dL, nonfasting 140–200 mg/dL). Patients taking olanzapine should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients starting treatment with olanzapine should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including olanzapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. While relative risk estimates are inconsistent, the association between atypical antipsychotics and increases in glucose levels appears to fall on a continuum and olanzapine appears to have a greater association than some other atypical antipsychotics.

Mean increases in blood glucose have been observed in patients treated (median exposure of 9.2 months) with olanzapine in phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). The mean increase of serum glucose (fasting and nonfasting samples) from baseline to the average of the 2 highest serum concentrations was 15.0 mg/dL.

In a study of healthy volunteers, subjects who received olanzapine (N = 22) for 3 weeks had a mean increase compared to baseline in fasting blood glucose of 2.3 mg/dL. Placebo-treated subjects (N = 19) had a mean increase in fasting blood glucose compared to baseline of 0.34 mg/dL.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113yiD4Q]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Fasting or 2-hour plasma glucose testing — In individuals without symptoms, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG) can be used for screening and diagnosis of diabetes, while measurement of random plasma glucose is sufficient to diagnose diabetes when symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis are present plus random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL [≥ 11.1 mmol/L]. In nonpregnant individuals, FPG (or A1C) is typically preferred for routine screening due to the ease of administration; however, the 2-h PG (OGTT) testing protocol diagnoses more diabetes than the other two tests and is preferentially recommended for screening for some conditions (e.g., cystic fibrosis-related diabetes or posttransplantation diabetes mellitus). Individuals may have difficulty fasting for the full 8-h period or may misreport their fasting status, and glycolysis and sample handling can affect results; people should follow a mixed eating pattern with at least 150 g of carbohydrates on the 3 days prior to OGTT, and antecedent carbohydrate restriction in the days prior to OGTT can falsely elevate postchallenge glucose levels, potentially resulting in a false-positive OGTT.

### Fasting glucose level and the risk of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases [^112agnFa]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The basis of the association between low fasting glucose levels and risk for CVD in people without diabetes is unclear. Wei et al. hypothesized that long-term exposure to low fasting plasma glucose may serve as a risk factor for CVD mortality, perhaps through abnormal cardiac activity and thrombosis, particularly in patients with atherosclerosis. Tanne et al. reported a J-shape relationship between fasting plasma glucose and incident ischemic cerebrovascular events in patients with preexisting atherothrombotic disease and suggested that hypoglycemia or rapid changes in plasma glucose may lead to elevations of counter-regulatory hormones, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, and these increases induce vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. In a pooled analysis of data from 97 cohorts involving people without vascular disease on enrollment, an increase in risk for vascular disease death was observed in those with blood glucose level < 70 mg/dL on enrollment. The cohort of Tanne et al. was comprised of patients with documented coronary heart disease. Because CVD risk factors and development of CVD are usually associated with metabolic abnormalities that increase fasting plasma glucose, additional studies need to be conducted to understand if low fasting plasma glucose levels are a consequence of impending disease (i.e. reverse causation) or if they have a role in precipitating acute CVD events.

Limitations of our findings need to be considered. First, single fasting glucose measurements are subject to substantial within-person variation and we did not perform 2-h glucose tolerance testing. Measurement error and between-study variability may have attenuated our results, adding to the identification of a narrow range of fasting glucose levels for optimal survival. Additionally, we measured serum glucose, not the currently recommended plasma glucose. However, because all measurements were of serum glucose, our findings should not be biased. Second, we lacked information on the evolution of fasting glucose levels and incidence of diabetes during follow-up, and we cannot identify if the increased risk associated with IFG depends on future evolution to diabetes or on other pathways. Third, we lacked data on other metabolic abnormalities associated with overweight and obesity and fat distribution. Fourth, the outcomes were obtained from admission records and death certificates. Because the outpatient records were not included, the incidence of CVD morbidity in our study may be lower than actual incidence.

### Cardiovascular health promotion in children: challenges and opportunities for 2020 and beyond: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115r1zA8]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Fasting blood glucose in pediatric cardiovascular health — thresholds and applicability: A fasting blood glucose level of < 100 mg/dL was set as the ideal for pediatric patients, but measurement of fasting blood glucose is not a current or proposed recommendation for routine pediatric care. The American Diabetes Association defines impaired glucose tolerance as a fasting blood glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dL and diabetes mellitus as a fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL. Puberty-related changes in glucose have not been documented, suggesting that the use of a single cut point for glucose may be reasonable.

### Postprandial hyperglycemia: implications for practice [^113859KD]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Despite the growing consensus that postprandial glucose levels provide a more accurate and valuable early marker of diabetes symptoms than fasting plasma glucose, the ability to forestall diabetic complications by managing postprandial hyperglycemia has not been proved. Patients who are not considered to have diabetes mellitus may have impaired glucose tolerance (and increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease), and targeting nonfasting glucose can reduce insulin requirements for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1 diabetes mellitus). The challenge now is to determine what fasting glucose levels merit intervention, when and how they should be determined, and who should measure them. After outlining the discrepancies and lack of consensus between measurement guidelines developed by different professional organizations, the author then reviews options for treating postprandial hyperglycemia, including prepackaged meals, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, acarbose therapy, and fast-acting insulin preparations.

### Impaired fasting glucose and outcomes of ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome treated with primary percutaneous intervention among patients without previously known diabetes mellitus [^116ezBiw]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Fasting blood glucose levels (FG) are related to adverse outcomes in all patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), probably more so than admission glucose (AG) levels. We sought to examine this correlation among patients with ST-elevation AMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PPCI).

Methods

Our cohort included 570 consecutive patients without previously known diabetes mellitus who were treated with PPCI for ST-elevation AMI. The cohort was divided according to FG levels measured on days 2 to 4 of hospitalization, while the patients were clinically stable: FG ≤ 100 mg/dL, normal range; FG 100–110 mg/dL, mildly impaired FG; FG 110–126 mg/dL, significantly impaired FG; FG ≥ 126 mg/dL, diabetic range.

Results

One third of the cohort had impaired FG, of whom 20% had FG levels in the diabetic range. There was a weak correlation between AG and FG levels (r = 0.38, P = 0.000). In the multivariate analysis, adjusted for AG quartiles, patients with FG ≥ 110 mg/dL were more likely to die within 30 days (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.03–2.70, P = 0.04). Admission glucose levels did not independently impact on 30-day mortality (odds ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.50–1.90, P = 0.96).

Conclusions

Fasting blood glucose levels may be routinely assessed among patients with ST-elevation AMI undergoing PPCI, possibly aiding in risk prognostication and the tailoring of therapy.

Finally, the natural history of prediabetes is somewhat reassuring. Approximately two-thirds of people with prediabetes do not develop diabetes. In the placebo arm of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcome Study (DPPOS), 65% of participants had not developed diabetes 5.7 years after the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) had ended. Similarly, 69% of people with prediabetes in the Framingham Offspring Study had not developed diabetes 27 to 30 years later. In people with prediabetes who were older than 60 years enrolled in the Swedish National Study on Aging who were followed for 12 years, 23% died and 13% developed diabetes. Even assuming that all the individuals who died had developed diabetes before doing so (highly unlikely), 64% of those still living would not have developed diabetes. Furthermore, a mean of one-third, with a wide range of 13–69% depending on the diagnostic criteria used to diagnose prediabetes and euglycemia, returned to normal glucose regulation over time.

### Diabetes mellitus: screening and diagnosis [^111fpLCj]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diagnoses made by family physicians. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to blindness, limb amputation, kidney failure, and vascular and heart disease. Screening patients before signs and symptoms develop leads to earlier diagnosis and treatment, but may not reduce rates of end-organ damage. Randomized trials show that screening for type 2 diabetes does not reduce mortality after 10 years, although some data suggest mortality benefits after 23 to 30 years. Lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions decrease progression to diabetes in patients with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. Screening for type 1 diabetes is not recommended. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for abnormal blood glucose and type 2 diabetes in adults 40 to 70 years of age who are overweight or obese, and repeating testing every three years if results are normal. Individuals at higher risk should be considered for earlier and more frequent screening. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening for type 2 diabetes annually in patients 45 years and older, or in patients younger than 45 years with major risk factors. The diagnosis can be made with a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg per dL or greater; an A1C level of 6.5% or greater; a random plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater; or a 75-g two-hour oral glucose tolerance test with a plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater. Results should be confirmed with repeat testing on a subsequent day; however, a single random plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater with typical signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia likely indicates diabetes. Additional testing to determine the etiology of diabetes is not routinely recommended.

### New sub-phenotyping of subjects at high risk of type 2 diabetes: what are the potential clinical implications? [^1134nGKe]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Prediabetes is defined as a condition of abnormal glucose metabolism, characterised by plasma glucose above normal range but not as high as required for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM). It represents a heterogeneous entity of intermediate glucose metabolism, including impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and borderline glycated haemoglobin. Prediabetes is being increasingly recognised as an important metabolic state not only predisposing to a higher probability of future progression to DM, but also to an increased risk of different micro- and macrovascular complications. The recently proposed sub-phenotyping of individuals at increased risk of type 2 DM, which distinguishes six different clusters, offers the opportunity for the improvement in screening, prevention, and treatment algorithms. Such progress should also enable more efficient and cost-effective strategies aimed at decreasing the disease burden associated with prediabetes.

### Inadequacies of absolute threshold levels for diagnosing prediabetes [^112Zcqz7]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Prediabetes comprising Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) and Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) represents an intermediate stage of altered glucose metabolism between normal glucose levels and type 2 diabetes mellitus and is associated with an increased risk for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is considerable evidence that glucose levels lower than those meeting the current definition of prediabetes may also be associated with similar risks particularly in high-risk individuals. Prediabetes is often unrecognized and therefore constitutes a major public health concern suggesting the need for earlier intervention than is currently recommended.

### Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia: the current status on definition and intervention [^114dkxDC]. Diabetic Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

A workshop was convened by the International Diabetes Federation to review the latest information relating to the risks associated with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) for future diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The workshop sought to address three questions: (i) are the current definitions of IGT and IFG appropriate; (ii) are IFG and IGT risk factors, risk markers or diseases; (iii) what interventions (if any) should be recommended for people with IFG and IGT? The determinants of elevated fasting glucose and 2-h plasma glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test (2-HPG) levels differ. Raised hepatic glucose output and a defect in early insulin secretion are characteristic of the former, and peripheral insulin resistance is most characteristic of the latter. Therefore, it is not surprising that the concordance between the categories of IFG and IGT is limited. In all prevalence studies to date only half or less of people with IFG have IGT, and even a lower proportion (20–30%) with IGT also have IFG. In the majority of populations studied, IGT is more prevalent than IFG, and there is a difference in phenotype and gender distribution between the two categories. IFG is substantially more common amongst men and IGT slightly more common amongst women. The prevalence of IFG tends to plateau in middle age whereas the prevalence of IGT rises into old age. Both IFG and IGT are associated with a substantially increased risk of developing diabetes, with the highest risk in people with combined IFG and IGT. Because IGT is commoner than IFG in most populations it is more sensitive (but slightly less specific) for identifying people who will develop diabetes. In most populations studied, 60% of people who develop diabetes have either IGT or IFG 5 years or so before, with the other 40% having normal glucose tolerance at that time. The limited published data suggest that both isolated IFG (I-IFG) and isolated IGT (I-IGT) are similarly associated with cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia, with the highest risk in those with combined IFG and IGT. However, some data have suggested that I-IGT is more strongly associated with hypertension and dyslipidaemia (features of the metabolic syndrome) than I-IFG. In unadjusted analyses both IFG and IGT are associated with CVD and total mortality. In separate analyses for fasting and 2-HPG adjusted for other cardiovascular risk factors (from the DECODE study) there remains a continuous relationship between 2-HPG and mortality, but an independent relationship with fasting glucose is only found above 7.0 mmol/l. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are continuously and positively associated with CVD and total mortality independent of other CVD risk factors. Life style interventions, including weight loss and increased physical activity, are highly effective in preventing or delaying the onset of diabetes in people with IGT. Two randomized controlled trials of individuals with IGT found that life style intervention studies reduce the risk of progressing to diabetes by 58%. The oral hypoglycaemic drugs metformin and acarbose have also been shown to be effective, but less so than the life style measures. Similar data do not yet exist for the effectiveness of such interventions in people with I-IFG. Larger studies are required to evaluate the effects of interventions on cardiovascular outcomes in people with IGT. Cost effective strategies to identify people with IGT for intervention should be developed and evaluated. The use of simple risk scores to assess who should undergo an oral glucose tolerance test is one promising approach, although these will need to be population-specific. In conclusion, IGT and IFG differ in their prevalence, population distribution, phenotype, and risk of total mortality and CVD. The consensus of the workshop was: 1. The diagnostic thresholds for all categories of glucose intolerance should be revisited in the light of the latest evidence. There was no clear consensus (with current evidence) on whether IFG and IGT should be classified as diseases, but they clearly represent risk factors and risk markers for diabetes and CVD, respectively. 2. Both IGT and IFG are similarly associated with an increased risk of diabetes, but IGT is more strongly associated with CVD outcomes. 3. Risks are higher when IGT and IFG coexist. 4. Life style interventions are highly effective in delaying or preventing the onset of diabetes in people with IGT and may reduce CVD and total mortality, but the latter requires formal testing.

### Screening for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents [^116xdQrx]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Diagnostic thresholds for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents: A fasting plasma glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L), an HbA1c level of 5.7% to 6.4%, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L) are consistent with prediabetes, whereas a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or greater, an HbA1c level of 6.5% or greater, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or greater are consistent with the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; the diagnosis of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes should be confirmed with repeat testing before starting interventions.

### Cost-effectiveness of alternative thresholds of the fasting plasma glucose test to identify the target population for type 2 diabetes prevention in adults aged ≥ 45 years [^1115J3No]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is an intermediate state of hyperglycemia in which fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels do not meet the criteria for diabetes but are consistently elevated above what is considered normal. The concept of IFG has been endorsed by leading professional organizations and adopted as one measure for identifying the high-risk population for type 2 diabetes preventive interventions in clinical settings and large-scale, community-based prevention programs.

Despite the increasing use of FPG testing to identify the high-risk state, the appropriate threshold for the lower limit of IFG remains unclear. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) currently uses 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) as the threshold to define IFG, while the World Health Organization and the European Diabetes Epidemiology Group recommends using 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L). Varying standards exist in large part because there is no clear threshold at which an FPG value can be associated with a sharp increase in the risk of future diabetes and its complications. Recent ADA guidelines also recommend glycated hemoglobin (A1C) as a blood test to identify people at high risk for type 2 diabetes and such a continuous relationship with the incidence of diabetes and its complications also has been observed for A1C.

When FPG is used to identify the target population for type 2 diabetes prevention, the choice of the IFG-defining FPG threshold ultimately affects the intervention's cost-effectiveness. A lower FPG threshold would result in more people being eligible for intervention, which would likely lead to more cases of diabetes being prevented or delayed. However, a lower threshold might be less cost-effective because it incurs costs for intervening in a population with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. To better understand the potential cost implications, major clinical and public health organizations called for systematic economic analyses of the FPG thresholds. Our study sought to estimate and compare the long-term cost-effectiveness of alternative FPG thresholds for identifying high-risk adults for inclusion in type 2 diabetes prevention programs.

### Normal fasting plasma glucose levels and type 2 diabetes in young men [^114iTrLg]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

The normal fasting plasma glucose level was recently defined as less than 100 mg per deciliter (5.55 mmol per liter). Whether higher fasting plasma glucose levels within this range independently predict type 2 diabetes in young adults is unclear.

Methods

We obtained blood measurements, data from physical examinations, and medical and lifestyle information from men in the Israel Defense Forces who were 26 to 45 years of age.

Results

A total of 208 incident cases of type 2 diabetes occurred during 74,309 person-years of follow-up (from 1992 through 2004) among 13,163 subjects who had baseline fasting plasma glucose levels of less than 100 mg per deciliter. A multivariate model, adjusted for age, family history of diabetes, body-mass index, physical-activity level, smoking status, and serum triglyceride levels, revealed a progressively increased risk of type 2 diabetes in men with fasting plasma glucose levels of 87 mg per deciliter (4.83 mmol per liter) or more, as compared with those whose levels were in the bottom quintile (less than 81 mg per deciliter [4.5 mmol per liter], P for trend < 0.001). In multivariate models, men with serum triglyceride levels of 150 mg per deciliter (1.69 mmol per liter) or more, combined with fasting plasma glucose levels of 91 to 99 mg per deciliter (5.05 to 5.50 mmol per liter), had a hazard ratio of 8.23 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.6 to 19.0) for diabetes, as compared with men with a combined triglyceride level of less than 150 mg per deciliter and fasting glucose levels of less than 86 mg per deciliter (4.77 mmol per liter). The joint effect of a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or more and a fasting plasma glucose level of 91 to 99 mg per deciliter resulted in a hazard ratio of 8.29 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.8 to 17.8), as compared with a body-mass index of less than 25 and a fasting plasma glucose level of less than 86 mg per deciliter.

Conclusions

Higher fasting plasma glucose levels within the normoglycemic range constitute an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes among young men, and such levels may help, along with body-mass index and triglyceride levels, to identify apparently healthy men at increased risk for diabetes.

### Fasting glucose levels within the high normal range predict cardiovascular outcome [^115DsWed]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose metabolism are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, it is still not clear whether glucose levels can predict CVD risk among patients without diabetes. The primary aim of this study is to assess whether normoglycemic fasting plasma glucose (FPG) is associated with increased risk of CVD outcomes in healthy patients.

Methods

We obtained blood measurements, data from physical examination, and medical and lifestyle information from 10,913 men and women who were evaluated in the Institute for Preventive Medicine of Sheba Medical Center. Enrolled were participants with FPG < 100 mg/dL as well as 100 to 125 mg/dL, who were free of diagnosis of CVD. The participants were actively screened for coronary disease using a stress test. Primary end points were coronary heart disease or self-reported cerebral vascular disease.

Results

A total of 1,119 incident cases of CVD occurred during a mean follow-up of 4.3 years. Subjects with fasting glucose levels in the high normal range (95–99 mg/dL) had an increased CVD risk when compared with levels < 80 mg/dL, (HR 1.53; CI 95% [1.22–1.91], P < .001). A multivariate model, adjusted for age, sex, family history of CVD, blood pressure, body mass index, smoking status, pharmacologic treatment, serum triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, revealed an independent increased risk of CVD with rising FPG levels in the normal range.

Conclusion

Elevated CVD risk is strongly and independently associated with glucose levels within the normoglycemic range. Fasting plasma glucose may help in identifying apparently healthy persons with early metabolic abnormalities who are at increased risk for CVD before progression to prediabetes and overt diabetes mellitus.

### Mechanisms of improved glucose handling after metabolic surgery: the big 6 [^115Uk9Zf]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

For some time, it has been clear that elevated glucose is detrimental to the organism. A plethora of medicines have been introduced to reduce the fasting and postprandial glucose levels (including insulin, glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 [GLP-1] agonists, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitors, among others). Although these medications are useful to reduce tissue exposure to glucose, no single compound and no combination have been able to totally normalize the blood sugar. Thus, it was astonishing when it was reported that surgery of the gastrointestinal tract could not only reduce obesity but also normalize the blood sugar. These discoveries have transformed diabetes research. What is it about bariatric surgery that causes the remarkable amelioration of glucose homeostasis dysregulation? The answer to this million dollar question is a billion dollar answer. However, a new perspective could shed some light and help provide a clear path for investigation. Instead of asking what does bariatric surgery do to change the pathophysiology, we can ask what pathophysiology and risk factors confer a greater success with remission and improved disease state after surgery. Work from our laboratory and others can help to offer a physiologic basis for which mechanisms may be put into play when the anatomy is altered during surgery. Here, we do not offer an explanation of the mechanism of action of bariatric surgery, but rather provide a background on the regulation of blood glucose and how it is altered during both the diseased state and, as available, the remission state.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^116Q5Ha7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The management of pre‐diabetes is more controversial than that of diabetes, both because the huge number of people labelled as having this condition (two‐thirds of which being FPG and HbA1c elevations, as shown by this study) and because of the uncertainty around the causal relation between FPG and HbA1c and diabetic complications. Like the case of diabetes, a large body of evidence shows that the three glycaemic measures, when used individually, were each associated with increased cardiovascular disease and mortality, but few studies examined their 'independent effects' on the outcomes after controlling for the confounding caused by the other two glycaemic measures. One of the few studies that did so was Lind et al. which found that the 2hPG level in people with IGT was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease after adjusting for FPG, 1‐h post‐load glucose, HbA1c and other major risk factors, whereas FPG and HbA1c were not associated with the outcome when analysed in the same model. However, a limitation of that study was its relatively small sample size (n = 504) and number of outcome events (n = 34). Other studies conducted in people with pre‐diabetes were mostly focused on one or two glycaemic measures only and thus were not able to clarify whether the observed association with outcomes (if any) resulted from confounding caused by other glycaemic measures. Because of this, whether it is justifiable to intervene with or 'manage' pre‐diabetes defined by FPG and HbA1c is open to question. Indeed, several randomised controlled trials have shown that lifestyle interventions and even some pharmacological treatment in people with pre‐diabetes did not lead to reductions in cardiovascular disease or mortality, although the progression to diabetes was slowed down to some extent. Thus, further prospective studies evaluating the independent effects of FPG and HbA1c levels on future diabetic complications among the pre‐diabetes population are warranted.

### Diurnal variation in fasting plasma glucose: implications for diagnosis of diabetes in patients examined in the afternoon [^112Z6VhF]. JAMA (2000). Excellent credibility.

Context

Current diagnostic criteria for diabetes are based on plasma glucose levels in blood samples obtained in the morning after an overnight fast, with a value of 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or more indicating diabetes. However, many patients are seen by their physicians in the afternoon. Because plasma glucose levels are higher in the morning, it is unclear whether these diagnostic criteria can be applied to patients who are tested for diabetes in the afternoon.

Objectives

To document diurnal variation in fasting plasma glucose levels in adults not known to have diabetes, and to examine the applicability to afternoon-examined patients of the current diagnostic criteria for diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Analysis of data from the US population-based Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988–1994) on participants aged 20 years or older who had no previously diagnosed diabetes, who were randomly assigned to morning (n = 6483) or afternoon (n = 6399) examinations, and who fasted prior to blood sampling.

Main Outcome Measures

Fasting plasma glucose levels in morning vs afternoon-examined participants; diabetes diagnostic value for afternoon-examined participants.

Results

The morning and afternoon groups did not differ in age, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, physical activity index, glycosylated hemoglobin level, and other factors. Mean (SD) fasting plasma glucose levels were higher in the morning group (5.41 [0.01] mmol/L [97.4 ¿0.3¿ mg/dL]) than in the afternoon group (5.12 [0.02] mmol/L [92.4 ¿0.4¿ mg/dL]; P < .001). Consequently, prevalence of afternoon-examined participants with fasting plasma glucose levels of 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or greater was half that of participants examined in the morning. The diagnostic fasting plasma glucose value for afternoon-examined participants that resulted in the same prevalence of diabetes found in morning-examined participants was 6.33 mmol/L (114 mg/dL) or greater.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that if current diabetes diagnostic criteria are applied to patients seen in the afternoon, approximately half of all cases of undiagnosed diabetes in these patients will be missed.

### Incidence and risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus in individuals with different fasting plasma glucose levels [^114BBh2z]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The strength of this study is that individuals without diabetes were divided into three groups according to FPG levels and the incidence and risk factors of T2DM were studied in each group to provide a basis for accurate prevention of diabetes. The limitation of this study is that there are few questionnaires, and T2DM is closely related to living and eating habits. Therefore, more information on living and eating habits should be included to investigate the risk factors of T2DM more widely.

In conclusion, this study showed that the higher the FPG level, the greater the risk of developing T2DM; it also revealed that T2DM risk factors for individuals vary with different FPG levels. Considering that diabetes is a chronic disease that can be controlled by the patient's daily habits and self-management ability, individuals with different FPG levels should consider their own risk factors and control their body weight, blood pressure, and lipid status to reduce the risk of developing T2DM and improve their overall health.

### Does elevated plasma triglyceride level independently predict impaired fasting glucose? the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) [^113LxHUD]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Elevated TGs (> 150 mg/dL) are considered a marker of insulin resistance, a strong predisposing condition of type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance is not only linked to other metabolic risk factors, such as abdominal obesity, hypertension, and high fasting glucose, but also hypothesized as the underlying pathophysiology of the clustered metabolic risk factors. Very few epidemiological studies, however, have reported that elevated TGs predict risk for prediabetes. Our study found that elevated TGs moderately predict risk for IFG. However, our study also demonstrated the poor discriminative utility of elevated TGs for identifying people at high risk for prediabetes. No interactions were seen by race/ethnicity.

Given the increased risk of IFG with other cardiometabolic risk factors, a better screening tool for prediabetes risk may need to measure a range of risk factors and weigh each accordingly. As the underlying cause for the progression to IFG has not been well understood, people with fasting glucose lower than the current criteria for IFG can benefit from the management of clustered risk factors through lifestyle change and medications when necessary. This study found that abdominal obesity was significantly associated with the increased risk for IFG even among those with normal glycemia. The presence of both abdominal obesity and elevated TGs, sometimes also called hypertriglyceridemic waist, has been recommended as a screening tool to identify coronary artery disease risk in people with prediabetes or diabetes. However, more research is needed to understand the underlying structure of the clustered cardiometabolic risk factors and identify key risk factors that can be targeted for the optimal outcomes in diabetes prevention programs.

### Should prediabetes be treated pharmacologically? [^114s1n2M]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Summary Points

Prediabetes is a dysglycemia with glycemic values between normal and those that define diabetes. People with prediabetes are characterized by decreased insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance) and impaired insulin secretion that cannot meet the extra demands on the pancreatic beta cells imposed by the insulin resistance. Prediabetes increases the risk for the subsequent development of diabetes. This risk begins with a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration of 4.6–4.8 mmol/L and increases in a curvilinear manner, with the chances of developing diabetes progressively rising the closer the dysglycemia is to the diagnostic criteria for diabetes.

The criteria for the diagnosis of prediabetes differs between the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the international community (Table 1). Moreover, in contrast to the recommendation that the diagnosis of diabetes be confirmed, there is no such recommendation for the diagnosis of prediabetes. This is unfortunate because on a repeat oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) within 2–6 weeks, approximately half of individuals with Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) have a normal result. If the international Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) criterion were used to diagnose prediabetes, 32% were normal on repeat testing. OGTTs are rarely used in clinical practice (except in pregnancy) so the diagnosis of prediabetes rests on FPG and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) testing. Depending on where one lives and the test used for the diagnosis, there is a marked difference in whether an individual will be diagnosed with prediabetes or not. To illustrate using the largest possible difference, the prevalence of prediabetes in the USA diagnosed by a FPG concentration of 5.6–6.9 mmol/L is 37.5% compared with the international prevalence diagnosed by an HbA1c level of 42–46 mmol/mol of 5.8%.

### Normal fasting plasma glucose and risk of type 2 diabetes diagnosis [^113oz1h4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The study compares the risk of incident diabetes associated with fasting plasma glucose levels in the normal range, controlling for other risk factors.

Methods

We identified 46,578 members of Kaiser Permanente Northwest who had fasting plasma glucose levels less than 100 mg/dL between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2000, and who did not previously have diabetes or impaired fasting glucose. After assigning subjects to 1 of 4 categories (< 85, 85–89, 90–94, or 95–99 mg/dL), we followed them until they developed diabetes, died, or left the health plan, or until April 30, 2007. We used Cox regression analysis to estimate the risk of incident diabetes, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, lipids, smoking, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension.

Results

Subjects developed diabetes at a rate of less than 1% per year during a mean follow-up of 81.0 months. Each milligram per deciliter of fasting plasma glucose increased diabetes risk by 6% (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.07, P < .0001) after controlling for other risk factors. Compared with those with fasting plasma glucose levels less than 85 mg/dL, subjects with glucose levels of 95 to 99 mg/dL were 2.33 times more likely to develop diabetes (HR 2.33; 95% CI, 1.95–2.79; P < .0001). Subjects in the 90 to 94 mg/dL group were 49% more likely to progress to diabetes (HR 1.49; 95% CI, 1.23–1.79; P < .0001). All other risk factors except sex were significantly associated with a diabetes diagnosis.

Conclusions

The strong independent association between the level of normal fasting plasma glucose and the incidence of diabetes after controlling for other risk factors suggests that diabetes risk increases as fasting plasma glucose levels increase, even within the currently accepted normal range.

Prediabetes — recommendation 11.6 and diagnostic thresholds: Diabetes medications including metformin, acarbose, pioglitazone, or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) can be considered in persons with prediabetes or in those with adiposity-based chronic disease (ABCD) who remain glucose-intolerant after weight loss using lifestyle and/or weight-loss medications (Grade A; BEL 1). Prediabetes can be identified by impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 100 to 125 mg/dL), impaired glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test result 140 to 199 mg/dL, 2 hours after ingesting 75 g of glucose), or A1C 5.7% to 6.4%, and progression risk is greatest with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus, strong family history of type 2 diabetes, progressive glycemia within the prediabetes range, or meeting a combination of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or metabolic syndrome criteria (any 2 out of 3).

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^116iG6eb]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Prediabetes — individuals whose blood glucose levels do not meet the criteria for diabetes but are higher than normal are classified as having prediabetes, and they have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke; age, race, and co-morbid hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia are significant risk factors associated with progression. Persons with prediabetes have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), or abnormal glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) levels, with IGT diagnosed only by the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and defined by a 2-hour plasma glucose in the 75-g OGTT of 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) to 199 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L), IFG defined as fasting glucose 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L), and an A1C test level between 5.7 percent and 6.4 percent considered prediabetes.

### Impaired fasting glucose concentrations in nondiabetic patients with ischemic heart disease: a marker for a worse prognosis [^116acWr7]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The issue of whether glucose concentrations below the diabetic threshold may be predictive of increased cardiovascular risk has not yet been fully elucidated. The current study evaluates the prognosis of nondiabetic patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) over a 7.7-year follow-up period.

Methods

A total of 11,853 patients with documented coronary artery disease aged between 45 and 74 years were examined. Patients were divided into 3 groups on the basis of their fasting blood glucose levels at screening: nondiabetic individuals, patients with IFG, and undiagnosed diabetic patients. Patients who were on any type of pharmacologic antidiabetic treatment were excluded from the study. Mortality rates were assessed separately for each group.

Results

The population comprised 9773 nondiabetic patients (82.4%, glucose up to 109 mg/dL), 1258 patients with IFG levels (10.6%, glucose 110–125 mg/dL), and 822 diabetic subjects (7%, glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL). Patients were followed up from 6.2 to 9.0 years (mean follow-up period 7.7 ± 1.5 years). Crude mortality was lower in the nondiabetic subjects than in the 2 other groups. All-cause mortality in the nondiabetic group was 14.3% compared to 20.1% in patients with IFG and 24.3% in the undiagnosed (P < .001). Multivariate adjustment showed the lowest mortality in nondiabetic subjects, who exhibited a survival rate of 0.86 at the end of the follow-up, whereas the lowest survival-0.75-was seen among undiagnosed diabetic patients (P = 0.0001). An intermediate value of 0.78 was documented for patients with IFG (P < .01). After multivariate analysis, with nondiabetic patients as the reference group, IFG was identified as a consistent predictor of increased all-cause and IHD mortality with hazard ratios of 1.39 (95% confidence interval 1.21–1.59) and 1.29 (95% confidence interval 1.01–1.64), respectively.

Conclusions

The main finding of this study is the substantially increased mortality rate among nondiabetic coronary patients with IFG, who had fasting glucose levels markedly lower than hitherto acknowledged as defining overt diabetes.

### Relative contribution of fasting and postprandial blood glucose in overall glycemic control: post hoc analysis of a phase IV randomized trial [^1155rN5Z]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In this post hoc analysis, patients in the LM50 treatment group showed an improvement in overall glycemic control, which may be due to greater improvements in PPG levels compared with FBG. The role of PPG in achieving better glycemic control needs to be confirmed in a prospective, large-scale, randomized clinical trial.

Commentary

Prediabetes is defined as a condition of abnormal glucose metabolism: plasma glucose (PG) is above the normal range but not as high as required for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM). According to current American Diabetes Association guidelines, diagnosis of prediabetes is based on the measurements of fasting PG (FPG), 2-h PG during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c). Prediabetes represents a heterogeneous entity of intermediate glucose metabolism abnormalities, including impaired fasting glucose (FPG ≥ 5.6 mmol/l and < 7.0 mmol/l), impaired glucose tolerance (2-h PG ≥ 7.8 mmol/l and < 11.1 mmol/l), and as borderline HbA 1c (≥ 5.7% and < 6.5%).

Prediabetes is increasingly being recognised as an important metabolic state predisposing to type 2 DM (T2DM), chronic diabetic complications, and cardiovascular diseases. The main mechanisms underlying the transition from normal glucose tolerance (NGT) to prediabetes include increased insulin resistance (IR) and reduced pancreatic β-cell function. Other perturbations are now known to include lipolysis, glucagon secretion, and decreased incretin effect.

The prevalence of prediabetes varies according to the diagnostic criteria and the populations studied. However, there is agreement that this prevalence is on the rise, suggesting that effective screening and timely interventions will be required. In general, only 10% of subjects with prediabetes progress to T2DM each year. Others remain in the same intermediate hyperglycaemic state during lifespan, or even reverse to NGT. Accordingly, we need an adequate tool to identify subjects at high risk of future T2DM and/or vascular complications.

### Causes and evaluation of mildly elevated liver transaminase levels [^113Yditq]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in levels of the liver enzymes alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase are commonly discovered in asymptomatic patients in primary care. Evidence to guide the diagnostic workup is limited. If the history and physical examination do not suggest a cause, a stepwise evaluation should be initiated based on the prevalence of diseases that cause mild elevations in transaminase levels. The most common cause is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which can affect up to 30 percent of the population. Other common causes include alcoholic liver disease, medication-associated liver injury, viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), and hemochromatosis. Less common causes include α(1)-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic conditions (e.g., thyroid disorders, celiac disease, hemolysis, muscle disorders) can also cause elevated liver transaminase levels. Initial testing should include a fasting lipid profile; measurement of glucose, serum iron, and ferritin; total iron-binding capacity; and hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody testing. If test results are normal, a trial of lifestyle modification with observation or further testing for less common causes is appropriate. Additional testing may include ultrasonography; measurement of α(1)-antitrypsin and ceruloplasmin; serum protein electrophoresis; and antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody, and liver/kidney microsomal antibody type 1 testing. Referral for further evaluation and possible liver biopsy is recommended if transaminase levels remain elevated for six months or more.
