## Question

What is the dosage of Diamox for altitude sickness?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the dosage of Diamox (acetazolamide) for altitude sickness, including prophylaxis and treatment, with attention to evidence quality and any nuances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the question refers to prevention or treatment of acute mountain sickness. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for prophylactic dosing and reconcile any discrepancies between meta-analyses and guidelines. Next, I will examine treatment dosing and its evidence base. After that, I need to consider special populations, timing, and duration. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation and note alternatives and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: "altitude sickness" in this context typically means acute mountain sickness, and dosing differs for prophylaxis versus treatment, so I need to keep those distinct to avoid confusion and errors in counseling and prescribing.

> For prophylaxis, I initially thought the lowest effective dose supported by high-quality evidence was 250 mg daily based on the 2012 BMJ meta-analysis, which showed that 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg daily all reduced AMS versus placebo, with an NNT around 6 for 250 mg daily, and concluded 250 mg was the lowest effective dose studied [^114FiurT] [^112FehG6] [^1122hQ9P].

> Wait, let me verify guideline evolution because practice has shifted since 2012. Contemporary guidelines from the Wilderness Medical Society and CDC favor 125 mg twice daily (total 250 mg/day) to balance efficacy and side effects, and they explicitly note that while 62.5 mg twice daily looked promising in a small study, a larger randomized trial found 62.5 mg twice daily was inferior to 125 mg twice daily, so 125 mg twice daily remains the standard prophylactic dose [^11252jEr] [^117C2cXC] [^115uiEqW].

> I should double-check the FDA labeling to ensure alignment. The FDA provides a range of 125–250 mg daily in divided doses for prevention, which accommodates both 125 mg twice daily and 250 mg once daily, though many clinicians prefer divided dosing to mitigate side effects and maintain steady effect, and the label also advises starting 24–48 hours before ascent and continuing for 48 hours at altitude or longer as needed [^112gRkDx].

> For treatment of established AMS, I need to check the exact regimen. The only studied dose is 250 mg every 12 hours, and this is reflected in WMS guidelines and supported by limited but consistent evidence; some clinicians anecdotally use lower doses, but the evidence base supports 250 mg twice daily for treatment when acetazolamide is used therapeutically [^113QQzig] [^116jtXGc] [^115gqH7P].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric dosing because it differs. For children, prophylaxis is 1.25–2.5 mg/kg per dose every 12 hours up to 125 mg per dose, and treatment is 2.5 mg/kg per dose every 12 hours up to 250 mg per dose; importantly, acetazolamide is not FDA-approved for children under 12 for altitude illness, though expert guidance allows off-label use when ascent cannot be slowed, with careful weight-based dosing and counseling [^1129o5y8] [^112yrk56].

> Next, I should review timing and duration to ensure practical accuracy. Start 24–48 hours before ascent when feasible, continue for at least 2 days at the target altitude if following recommended ascent rates, and extend to 2–4 days if ascent is faster than recommended; stop when descent begins, and if used for treatment, continue until symptoms resolve plus an additional day or two to consolidate acclimatization [^11252jEr] [^1129o5y8] [^117C2cXC].

> I need to ensure I address alternatives and special scenarios. Dexamethasone is an alternative for prophylaxis in adults who cannot take acetazolamide, but it does not aid acclimatization and should be tapered if used beyond about a week; ibuprofen has modest preventive benefit and can be considered when standard agents are not acceptable, though it is generally less effective than acetazolamide; for very rapid ascents or rescue contexts, higher acetazolamide doses up to 1000 mg/day have been described, but this is off-label and should be reserved for exceptional circumstances with caution about side effects [^114wJRin] [^116UEfNE].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to avoid overgeneralization. For prevention, the most evidence-aligned, guideline-supported dose is 125 mg orally twice daily, started 24–48 hours before ascent and continued for 2–4 days at altitude depending on ascent rate, with 250 mg once daily as an acceptable alternative per FDA labeling. For treatment, use 250 mg every 12 hours. Pediatric dosing is weight-based with clear maximums per dose, and acetazolamide should not be used for HAPE treatment or prevention in those with prior HAPE susceptibility, where nifedipine is preferred for prophylaxis [^11252jEr] [^1129o5y8] [^111Hxgsa] [^113eotCz].

---

The recommended dose of Diamox (acetazolamide) for altitude sickness is **125 mg twice daily** (250 mg total per day) [^1129o5y8], started 24–48 hours before ascent and continued for 2–4 days at altitude or until descent [^117C2cXC]. For treatment of acute mountain sickness, use **250 mg twice daily** [^113QQzig] until symptoms resolve. Lower doses (62.5–125 mg twice daily) may be considered to reduce side effects, but 125 mg twice daily is the standard prophylactic dose with the best balance of efficacy and tolerability [^1122hQ9P] [^11252jEr]. Pediatric dosing is 2.5 mg/kg per dose every 12 hours, up to 125 mg per dose [^1129o5y8].

---

## Recommended dosing regimens

### Prophylaxis (prevention)

- **Standard adult dose**: 125 mg orally every 12 hours (total 250 mg/day) [^1129o5y8], starting 24–48 hours before ascent and continuing for 2–4 days at altitude or until descent [^117C2cXC].

- **Alternative dosing**: 250 mg orally once daily [^111Hxgsa] is effective but may cause more side effects than divided dosing [^notfound].

- **Pediatric dose**: 2.5 mg/kg per dose every 12 hours, up to a maximum of 125 mg per dose [^1129o5y8].

---

### Treatment of acute mountain sickness (AMS)

For treatment of AMS, the **standard adult dose** is 250 mg orally every 12 hours [^113QQzig] until symptoms resolve [^116jtXGc]. The **pediatric dose** is 2.5 mg/kg per dose every 12 hours, up to a maximum of 250 mg per dose [^1129o5y8].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing recommendations

- **Prophylaxis**: Multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses show acetazolamide 125–250 mg/day reduces AMS incidence by about 50% compared with placebo, with 125 mg twice daily offering the best balance of efficacy and tolerability [^114FiurT] [^114LXRRZ].

- **Treatment**: Limited evidence supports 250 mg twice daily for AMS; acetazolamide is less effective than dexamethasone for moderate-to-severe AMS but can be used when dexamethasone is unavailable or contraindicated [^113QQzig] [^115z2xnM].

---

## Factors influencing dosing decisions

Several factors influence **dosing decisions**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on dosing** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older adults may require lower doses due to reduced renal clearance and higher risk of side effects [^11753Gb1] |
| Weight | Pediatric dosing is weight-based; adults > 100 kg may benefit from 250 mg twice daily in high-risk ascents [^113oeZiZ] |
| Ascent profile | Rapid ascent or high-risk profiles may warrant higher doses (up to 250 mg twice daily) [^11252jEr] |
| Medical history | Renal impairment, hepatic disease, or sulfonamide allergy may necessitate dose adjustments or alternative medications [^1129aMjs] |

---

## Side effects and tolerability

Common side effects include **paresthesia, dysgeusia, polyuria, nausea, and headache** [^115uiEqW]; these are dose-related and more frequent at higher doses [^1168jdRS]. Serious adverse effects (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome, aplastic anemia) are rare but require vigilance [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Acetazolamide is generally avoided unless benefits outweigh risks; consult obstetrics.

- **Breastfeeding**: Compatible with caution; monitor infant for sedation or poor feeding.

- **Drug interactions**: May interact with salicylates, digoxin, and antiepileptics; review medications before prescribing [^notfound].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Indication** | **Standard adult dose** | **Pediatric dose** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Prophylaxis | 125 mg every 12 hours | 2.5 mg/kg every 12 hours (max 125 mg) | Start 24–48 hours before ascent; continue 2–4 days at altitude |
| Treatment | 250 mg every 12 hours | 2.5 mg/kg every 12 hours (max 250 mg) | Until symptoms resolve |

---

The standard prophylactic dose of Diamox for altitude sickness is **125 mg twice daily**, with treatment at 250 mg twice daily; dosing should be individualized based on age, weight, ascent profile, and medical history, with attention to side effects and interactions.

### Identifying the lowest effective dose of acetazolamide for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114FiurT]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of three different daily doses of acetazolamide in the prevention of acute mountain sickness and to determine the lowest effective dose.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline and Embase along with a hand search of selected bibliographies. No language restrictions were applied.

Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials assessing the use of acetazolamide at 250 mg, 500 mg, or 750 mg daily versus placebo in adults as a drug intervention for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness. Included studies were required to state the administered dose of acetazolamide and to randomise participants before ascent to either acetazolamide or placebo. Two reviewers independently carried out the selection process.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers extracted data concerning study methods, pharmacological intervention with acetazolamide, method of assessment of acute mountain sickness, and event rates in both control and intervention groups, which were verified and analysed by the review team collaboratively.

Data Synthesis

11 studies (with 12 interventions arms) were included in the review. Acetazolamide at doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg were all effective in preventing acute mountain sickness above 3000 m, with a combined odds ratio of 0.36 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.46). At a dose of 250 mg daily the number needed to treat for acetazolamide to prevent acute mountain sickness was 6 (95% confidence interval 5 to 11). Heterogeneity ranged from I² = 0% (500 mg subgroup) to I² = 44% (750 mg subgroup).

Conclusions

Acetazolamide in doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg daily are all more effective than placebo for preventing acute mountain sickness. Acetazolamide 250 mg daily is the lowest effective dose to prevent acute mountain sickness for which evidence is available.

### Acute altitude illness: updated prevention and treatment… [^1128cXq3]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The most important treatment for altitude illness is descent of 1, 000 to 3, 300 ft, with supplemental oxygen if available. From the AFP Editors. PHARMACOLOGIC PROPHYLAXIS Acetazolamide aids in acclimatization and should be strongly considered for high-altitude travelers at moderate to high risk of AMS. The recommended prophylactic dosage for adults is 125 mg every 12 hours; the dosage for children is 2. 5 mg per kg every 12 hours. Dexamethasone can prevent AMS and HACE in adults at moderate to high risk, although it does not help with acclimatization. The recommended adult prophylactic dosage is 2 mg every six hours or 4 mg every 12 hours. Dosages of 4 mg every six hours can be considered in very high-risk situations. Dexamethasone prophylaxis is not recommended in children.

As with acetazolamide, dexamethasone should be started one day before ascent and continued for two to four days after reaching the target altitude. If dexamethasone is used for longer than 10 days, it should be tapered over one week instead of being stopped abruptly. PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT Although acetazolamide facilitates acclimatization and can treat mild AMS, it is not recommended for treatment of moderate to severe AMS or HACE. Dexamethasone is a more reliable treatment for moderate to severe AMS or HACE. The recommended dosage of dexamethasone for AMS treatment is 4 mg every six hours in adults, or 0. 15 mg per kg every six hours in children. The recommended regimen for adults with HACE is an initial 8-mg dose given orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly, then 4 mg every six hours until symptoms resolve. Acetazolamide can be used as an adjunct to dexamethasone for AMS or HACE treatment. The recommended dosage is 250 mg every 12 hours in adults or 2.

5 mg per kg every 12 hours in children. Further ascent should not be attempted after dexamethasone is given.

### A randomized controlled trial of the lowest effective dose of acetazolamide for acute mountain sickness prevention [^1122hQ9P]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acetazolamide is the most common medication used for acute mountain sickness prevention, with speculation that a reduced dose may be as efficacious as standard dosing with fewer side effects.

Methods

This double-blind, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial compared acetazolamide 62.5 mg twice daily to the standard dose acetazolamide 125 mg twice daily starting the evening prior to ascent from 1240 m (4100 ft) to 3810 m (12,570 ft) over 4 hours. The primary outcome was acute mountain sickness incidence (ie, headache, Lake Louise Questionnaire ≥ 3, and another symptom).

Results

A total of 106 participants were analyzed, with 51 (48%) randomized to 125 mg and 55 (52%) to 62.5 mg, with a combined acute mountain sickness incidence of 53 (50%) and mean severity of 3 (± 2.1). The 62.5-mg group failed to fall within the prespecified 26% noninferiority margin for acute mountain sickness incidence (62.5 mg = 30 [55%] vs 125 mg = 23 [45%], 95% confidence interval [CI] -11% to 30%). Participants in the 62.5-mg group had a higher risk of acute mountain sickness (odds ratio = 1.5, 95% CI 0.7–3.2) and moderate acute mountain sickness (odds ratio = 1.8, 95% CI 0.6–5.9), with a number needed to harm (NNH) of 9, with a number needed to treat (NNT) in the 125-mg group of 4.8. Increased acute mountain sickness incidence and symptom severity corresponded to lower weight-based and body mass index dosing, with similar side effects between groups.

Conclusion

Acetazolamide 62.5 mg twice daily failed to demonstrate equal effectiveness to 125 mg twice daily for prevention of acute mountain sickness. With increased risk and no demonstrable symptomatic or physiologic benefits, acetazolamide 62.5 mg twice daily should not be recommended for acute mountain sickness prevention.

### Identifying the lowest effective dose of acetazolamide for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113inCzm]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Five of the 11 studies enrolled participants at altitudes above 4000 m. At these altitudes participants will have been partially acclimatised at the time of enrolment. It would have been more useful if the trials had recruited participants at lower altitudes (ideally < 2500 m), to ensure that none were acclimatised before receiving the intervention.

The mean final altitude of the included studies was 4619 m (range 3800–5000 m). Symptoms of acute mountain sickness can occur at altitudes of 3000 m and below. The rigorous approach of this review meant that no studies with final altitudes below 3800 m were found to be eligible for inclusion. Owing to a lack of data among the included trials, no firm conclusion can be made about the efficacy of acetazolamide at altitudes below 3800 m. However, a small study with assessment at 3650 m using the acute mountain sickness-cerebral and acute mountain sickness-respiratory scores, found evidence to suggest that acetazolamide 500 mg is effective in reducing the incidence of acute mountain sickness compared with placebo. It is likely that acetazolamide does have some beneficial effect in reducing symptoms of acute mountain sickness at moderate altitudes, as suggested by that study, and possible prophylactic benefit must be weighed against the risk of adverse effects.

Event rate in control groups

The proportion of participants who developed acute mountain sickness in the 12 control groups combined (the mean control event rate) represent the underlying risk of acute mountain sickness in the study population. The combined mean control event rate was 33% in all trials (227 out of 680 controls), ranging from 20% (13/64) to 83% (5/6). Trials using 750 mg daily, the highest dose of acetazolamide, had a higher underlying risk of acute mountain sickness (56%, 34/60) compared with trials using 500 mg (30%, 125/423) and 250 mg (35%, 68/197). The control event rates for the two studies included in the 750 mg subgroup were 47%and 67%.

The proportion of participants who developed acute mountain sickness in the intervention groups (the mean experimental event rate) was 22%, ranging from 10% (18/174) to 50% (3/6). Table 3provides the data for efficacy of acetazolamide by dose.

Table 3
Efficacy of acetazolamide by dose

*According to grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation.

Among the four studies that reported the incidence of high altitude pulmonary oedema and high altitude cerebral oedema as an outcome measure, only one case of high altitude cerebral oedema was identified in the placebo arm of a study (1 per 20 participants). No deaths were reported among study participants in control or intervention groups.

Quantitative analysis of intervention effect

Overall treatment effect

The direction of intervention effect for the primary outcome was consistent for all studies; intervention with acetazolamide was consistently more effective than placebo for prevention of acute mountain sickness. The overall effect estimate for all subgroups combined indicated a statistically significant treatment effect of acetazolamide versus placebo, with a combined odds ratio of 0.36 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.46).

### Identifying the lowest effective dose of acetazolamide for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116aU79V]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis summarises the current evidence on the efficacy of acetazolamide 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg daily in the prevention of acute mountain sickness. A systematic search of relevant published and unpublished literature identified 11 trials for inclusion in the review. The results showed that at all three doses acetazolamide was efficacious in preventing acute mountain sickness above 3000 m. Acetazolamide 250 mg was the lowest effective dose for which there was evidence for this indication.

Comparisons with other studies

Results from this review do not support those of the original review on the topic published in 2000, which concluded that doses of acetazolamide lower than 750 mg were not effective in preventing acute mountain sickness. The results of the current review show the effectiveness of lower doses of acetazolamide (250 mg and 500 mg daily) in preventing acute mountain sickness and confirm the efficacy of acetazolamide 750 mg as previously reported.

An important difference between this review and the original review lies in the number of participants. In this review we analysed 1512 participants in three dose specific subgroup analyses, whereas in the original review 295 participants were analysed in the acetazolamide arm of the meta-analysis and the reviewers did not carry out a subgroup analysis for acetazolamide 250 mg daily. Also, we included randomised placebo controlled trials only, whereas the original review included trials that were not placebo controlled.

### Identifying the lowest effective dose of acetazolamide for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113xfESN]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Our findings are in line with two recently published reviews. The first, a systematic shortcut review, analysed data relevant to several drug interventions for prevention of acute mountain sickness. Acetazolamide 250 mg was shown to be effective in preventing the condition. The review and analysis of data from three trials gave a number needed to treat ranging from 3 to 8 for doses of acetazolamide ranging from 250 mg to 750 mg.

The second published review, a systematic review and meta-analysis, analysed the efficacy of acetazolamide by testing the association between baseline risk and the efficacy of prophylaxis. The results support our findings that acetazolamide 250 mg and 500 mg daily are effective in preventing acute mountain sickness contrary to previous suggestions that doses of acetazolamide below 750 mg do not work. This review concluded that efficacy of acetazolamide was lower with slow mode of ascent. Those who ascended to altitude by climbing were assessed as having a lower baseline risk for developing acute mountain sickness resulting in higher numbers needed to treat (5.3 to 6.5 in doses ranging from 250 mg to 750 mg) compared with those who ascended by a combination of transport and climbing (3.0 to 3.5 in doses ranging from 250 mg to 750 mg). These values are based on the risk ratio derived from the main analysis that was applied to the average control event rate calculated for each subgroup.

Risk of bias

Two reviewers (EVL, AS) independently evaluated the quality of the included trials by using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. Each study was assessed for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias.

Statistical analysis

We tested dichotomous data for heterogeneity and applied fixed or random effects models in the statistical analysis. The results are reported in a forest plot with 95% confidence intervals. The odds ratio represents the measure of relative effect of the intervention and is calculated for each subgroup. An odds ratio of less than 1 favours the intervention for preventing an acute mountain sickness event among participants. For the purpose of the meta-analysis where studies compared two drug intervention arms with a shared control group, we divided the control group in to two. This allowed direct analysis of the event rate in each intervention arm with a control group, avoiding replication of the control group and subsequent unit of analysis error. We used the Cochrane calculator to determine the number needed to treat to prevent one event of acute mountain sickness.

Statistical heterogeneity was assessed both visually and by using the χ² test. Heterogeneity of the intervention effect was quantified between studies using the I 2 statistic. When interpreting heterogeneity, I 2 values less than 30% are considered as low heterogeneity, less than 60% as moderate, and greater than 60% as high. We carried out subgroup analysis to investigate possible causes of clinical heterogeneity, looking at variability between the interventions, participants, and outcomes across the studies. To identify methodological heterogeneity we also assessed study design and risk of bias.

Future research and unanswered questions

This review provides a definitive answer to a much discussed and disputed subject of the lowest effective dose of acetazolamide for prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness. Future research should seek to report relevant outcomes thoroughly and consistently. To produce comparable data the starting and final altitudes should be clearly stated and should be the same for all study participants. The rate and duration of ascent and total length of journey should be reported to allow further analysis of the relation between ascent rate and dose specific efficacy of acetazolamide. Future research that assesses participants for acute mountain sickness or seeks to diagnose acute mountain sickness among participants should use a validated and widely implemented diagnostic tool. We recommend that studies use the Lake Louise scoring system to ensure consistency and improve the future comparison of study data.

A high proportion of trials in the current literature enrol participants at altitudes above 3000 m, which has the risk of partial acclimatisation of participants at the time of enrolment. A large trial, assessing the efficacy of acetazolamide and recruiting participants from low altitudes would be valuable to tackle the lack of data currently available in this area.

Previous trials assessing the efficacy of acetazolamide for prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness primarily recruited mountaineering enthusiasts. With increasing numbers of the general population now ascending to high altitudes, a study recruiting participants from this population may provide more relevant information for prescribing acetazolamide in primary care settings.

It is unclear from the literature whether acetazolamide is effective in preventing acute mountain sickness during rapid ascent to altitude such as flying to high altitudes from sea level, or during emergency rescue at high altitudes. Two small studies have indicated that acetazolamide 500 mg and 750 mg have some efficacy for preventing or reducing acute mountain sickness during rapid ascent to altitude. One study assessed acetazolamide 750 mg daily during rapid ascent (sea level to 4394 m) in 33.5 hours on average, and anotherassessed acetazolamide 500 mg daily during rapid ascent to altitude (sea level to 3630 m) in just over 24 hours. A study assessing the efficacy of different doses of acetazolamide during rapid ascent to altitude would be useful.

Conclusions

Our systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence that acetazolamide at doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg daily are all effective in preventing acute mountain sickness at high altitudes. Acetazolamide 250 mg daily was the lowest effective dose for which evidence exists.

Implications for future practice

This systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence that lower daily doses of acetazolamide (250 mg and 500 mg) are effective for prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness at high altitude. When choosing the appropriate dose of acetazolamide in clinical practice, clinicians should consult patients on the benefits and harms of higher (750 mg) compared with lower (250 mg and 500 mg) doses of the drug.

Lower doses of acetazolamide have been shown to be effective in preventing acute mountain sickness, and data extracted from the included studies indicate that acetazolamide 750 mg is associated with a higher risk of adverse effects (paraesthesia, polyuria, rash, and dysgeusia). People who are particularly eager to avoid acute mountain sickness might still prefer the higher dose of acetazolamide (750 mg) as the number needed to treat for this subgroup was 3 compared with 6 for the 250 mg dose and 7 for the 500 mg dose. Nevertheless, when prescribing this drug clinicians should consider the association between higher doses of acetazolamide and the increased risk of adverse effects, particularly paraesthesia.

### Identifying the lowest effective dose of acetazolamide for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Kozg7]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

We carried out a systematic review to assess the efficacy of three different doses of acetazolamide — 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg — in the prevention of acute mountain sickness at high altitude and to determine the lowest effective dose. Acetazolamide 250 mg daily is the lowest dose assessed by this review because of the lack of data on lower doses.

Introduction

Treks at high altitude are becoming increasingly accessible to and popular with the general population. Between 1990 and 2009, 26 273 people attempted to climb the highest peaks in the Nepalese Himalayas, at altitudes of 6000–8850 m, and each year over 20 000 people attempt to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. With the ever increasing number of people ascending to high altitudes, medicines to deal with potential problems are becoming increasingly relevant to non-specialists, including general practitioners. A clinical review published in 2011highlighted the need for clinicians to provide well informed advice to climbers on the prevention and management of high altitude illness. For clinicians to remain well informed, relevant and up to date information must be clear and easily accessible.

Acute mountain sickness and high altitude headache are commonly encountered at altitude. Acute mountain sickness can lead to high altitude pulmonary oedema and high altitude cerebral oedema; potentially life threatening illnesses. A spectrum of symptoms related to acute mountain sickness may develop at altitudes below 3000 m: commonly reported symptoms are nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Although slow ascent to altitude remains the most important measure to prevent acute mountain sickness, evidence from the literature on high altitude suggests that drugs can complement gradual ascent in preventing acute mountain sickness. Treatment typically occurs on the mountainside, but seeking to prevent acute mountain sickness begins before the ascent to high altitude (generally > 3000 m).

The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide is now widely accepted as the standard drug for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness, despite not being licensed for this purpose. Alternative interventions for this indication include gingko biloba, dexamethasone, and antioxidant vitamin supplements, although these agents are beyond the scope of this review. Acetazolamide promotes acclimatisation to altitude; it acts to increase bicarbonate secretion by the kidneys, induce metabolic acidosis, and stimulate ventilation. Much debate surrounds the effective dose for prevention of acute mountain sickness. A systematic review published in 2000found that 750 mg was the lowest effective dose for preventing acute mountain sickness. This suggestion has been disputed by mountaineering specialists in both the general medical literatureand the literature on high altitude. This has left clinicians, especially those without a thorough knowledge of the current literature, with the clinical dilemma of what dose of acetazolamide to prescribe to prevent acute mountain sickness in people ascending to high altitude.

Literature search

We searched Medline (inception to 22 January 2012) and Embase (inception to 22 January 2012) using a sensitive search strategy to identify eligible randomised controlled trials. Search terms were "Randomi* controlled trial.pt". OR "Randomi*.ab". OR "Controlled clinical trial.pt". OR "Placebo.ab". OR "Drug therapy.fs". OR "Randomly.ab". OR "Trial.ab". OR "Groups.ab". AND "Altitude" OR "Mountain sickness". We also hand searched journals on high altitude medicine (January 1975 to 2 August 2011): Aviation, Space and Environmental Medicine; High Altitude Medicine and Biology; and Wilderness and Environmental Medicine.

Bibliographies belonging to included papers, known reviews, and relevant articles were searched for additional trials. To identify additional unpublished studies we corresponded with the primary author from each of the included studies and several of the excluded studies.

Study selection and evaluation

Two investigators (EVL, VG) identified suitable trials from the database search and independently reviewed the title and abstracts of articles. Studies were excluded if they concerned non-humans, children, or focused on participant populations with underlying medical conditions (for example, diabetes mellitus) or with a history of acute mountain sickness or altitude related illness (for example, high altitude cerebral oedema or high altitude pulmonary oedema). Studies were excluded if they were non-randomised controlled trials, or were non-controlled clinical trials. We excluded trials where the content was unrelated to the current research topic, that did not primarily assess prevention of acute mountain sickness, where the final altitude specified was below 3000 m, or where ascent to altitude was simulated in a hypobaric chamber. Finally we excluded studies with indigenous or local populations as trial participants. No language restrictions were applied to the selection process. We used a hierarchical template to classify the excluded studies. The remaining papers were reviewed in full and assessed using a predetermined set of inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by discussion among the review team.

Data extraction

The lead reviewer designed and used a template for extraction of relevant data from the included studies. A second reviewer verified the extracted data. Discrepancies were discussed and resolved after consultation with the review team. Where necessary, study authors were contacted for unpublished data.

### Identifying the lowest effective dose of acetazolamide for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Jyu11]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Included studies

Publication dates of the 11 studies included in the meta-analysis ranged from 1976 to 2011. Eight of the included studies were published after the original review by Dumont. Trials were carried out worldwide, with seven of the 11 trials taking place on Mount Everest, three in the United States, and one in Pakistan. All the trials included both men and women. The mean number of participants per trial was 137 (range 12–339). The mean number of participants in the control groups was 61 (range 6–165) and in the intervention groups was 76 (6–174). The median altitude at which study participants were enrolled was 3440 m (range sea level to 4358 m). The mean final altitude was 4619 m (range 3800–5000 m).

All the studies compared the effectiveness of acetazolamide with placebo in preventing acute mountain sickness. In 10 of the 11 trialsthe intervention group received a specific dose of acetazolamide and was compared directly with a placebo group. In one trial two intervention groups (acetazolamide 250 mg and acetazolamide 750 mg) were compared with a shared placebo group. For the meta-analysis, the control group was split in to two to allow direct calculation of the odds ratio, avoiding a unit of analysis error. The control group originally made up of 59 participants was split to give 29 participants in the 250 mg control group and 30 in the 750 mg control group. This avoided replication of the control group in the overall analysis. The total daily dose of acetazolamide in the intervention groups varied between the trials; four used 250 mg of acetazolamide for the intervention group, six used 500 mg, and two used 750 mg.

The first dose was administered on the day of ascent in five trialsand a day or more before ascent in six.

Eight of the 11 studies used the Lake Louise scoring system and Lake Louise questionnaire for diagnosis. The remaining studies used the general high altitude questionnaire, acute mountain sickness-cerebral scores, and individual symptom scoring systems.

Acetazolamide 250 mg versus placebo

The point estimates of the four studies (448 participants) that compared acetazolamide 250 mg with placeboindicated a beneficial effect of acetazolamide (fig 2). Of these studies, only one showed a significant reduction in the risk of acute mountain sickness associated with acetazolamide 250 mg (odds ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.52). The results of the remaining studies were not significant at the 5% significance level. The combined estimate indicated a statistically significant treatment effect of acetazolamide 250 mg daily, with a combined odds ratio of 0.41 (0.26 to 0.64).

Fig 2 Forest plot for efficacy of acetazolamide by dose

Acetazolamide 500 mg versus placebo

Six studies (907 participants) compared acetazolamide 500 mg with placebo. Two studies showed a significant reduction in the risk of acute mountain sickness associated with acetazolamide 500 mg, with odds ratios of 0.41 (0.22 to 0.76), and 0.27 (0.14 to 0.52). The four remaining studies indicated reductions in the risk of acute mountain sickness, with odds ratios of 0.46 (0.19 to 1.13),0.20 (0.01 to 2.91),0.29 (0.08 to 1.06), and 0.50 (0.23 to 1.10),(see fig 2), but the 95% confidence intervals for these studies crossed the line of no effect. The overall effect estimate showed a significant reduction of risk associated with acetazolamide 500 mg, with a combined odds ratio of 0.37 (0.26 to 0.52).

Acetazolamide 750 mg versus placebo

Two studies (157 participants) compared acetazolamide 750 mg with placebo. Both indicated a statistically significant reduction in the risk of acute mountain sickness associated with acetazolamide 750 mg, with odds ratios of 0.30 (0.12 to 0.75)and 0.10 (0.03 to 0.36). The overall effect estimate in this group showed a significant reduction in risk of acute mountain sickness associated with acetazolamide 750 mg, with a combined odds ratio of 0.20 (0.10 to 0.41).

Strengths and limitations of this review

The strength of this study is based on a thorough and systematic literature review. Relevant studies were identified by using a sensitive search strategy through electronic databases. We tried to identify additional published and unpublished studies in all languages. The review analysed a large sample of data and most of the studies included for analysis had adequate study sample sizes. This is a particular strength of the current review compared with some stand alone studies on high altitude. Trial coordinators are often unable to recruit adequate numbers of participants, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions from smaller studies. Heterogeneity among studies was low for the acetazolamide 250 mg and 500 mg subgroups.

The review does have some limitations. We acknowledge that acute mountain sickness constitutes a spectrum of symptoms of varying severity. Owing to the scope of the literature analysed, the studies included in the meta-analysis did not share a standard definition of acute mountain sickness to enable the incidence to be determined among participants. However, the sensitivity analysis of eight trials using the Lake Louise scoring system to diagnose acute mountain sickness showed a similar combined outcome when compared with the original analysis of all 11 trials. Furthermore, heterogeneity was similar for the acetazolamide 250 mg and 500 mg subgroups between the original and sensitivity analysis.

Results

The literature search yielded 3133 articles from Medline and Embase (fig 1). Hand searches of the bibliographies identified two additional studies. After removing duplicates, 3048 studies were reviewed against the prespecified exclusion criteria of which 3005 were excluded on the basis of the titles and abstracts. Of 43 full text articles retrieved and reviewed 32 did not meet the predefined inclusion criteria and were excluded (see supplementary table). The two studies identified from a hand search of bibliographies were excluded because one was not a randomised controlled trial and the outcome criteria were not clearly reported, and the other did not clearly report the incidence of acute mountain sickness among the study participants. Eleven papers (with 12 intervention arms) were included for meta-analysis. Table 1shows the characteristics of the included studies.

### Identifying the lowest effective dose of acetazolamide for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158FXaW]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We considered studies for inclusion if they assessed the use of acetazolamide versus placebo as a drug intervention for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness. Studies were required to state the administered dose of acetazolamide and to randomise participants before ascent to either acetazolamide or placebo.

We included randomised controlled trials, of healthy participants aged more than 16 years. Participants had to have ascended to high altitude, which for the purpose of this review we defined as more than 3000 m. We excluded studies that recruited participants from indigenous or local populations because of the possibility of inherited or acquired physiological adaptation to altitude.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was absence of acute mountain sickness. The Lake Louise scoring system can be used to diagnose acute mountain sickness and to assess the severity of symptoms. This scoring system was developed by a panel of experts at the 1991 International Hypoxia Symposium and is widely accepted as the standard tool for diagnosing acute mountain sickness. According to the Lake Louise consensus criteria, acute mountain sickness is defined as the presence of headache with at least one other symptom after recent ascent to altitude: gastrointestinal disturbance (anorexia, nausea, vomiting), dizziness, light headedness, insomnia, or fatigue. A score of more than 3 is consistent with a diagnosis of acute mountain sickness. Where studies did not use the Lake Louise scoring system, we chose the primary end point to be the absence of acute mountain sickness, defined using a validated symptom scoring system such as the general high altitude questionnaire, the acute mountain sickness-cerebral score, or a clear definition of acute mountain sickness predetermined by the original study authors.

After we had accessed the full text and reviewed the data, we excluded studies if a clear definition of acute mountain sickness was not stated or if the incidence of acute mountain sickness was unclear among the study population.

Acetazolamide — prevention of acute mountain sickness (AMS) with dosing, pediatric use, and safety is summarized as follows: The recommended adult dose for prophylaxis is 125 mg every 12 h, and higher doses up to 750 mg daily are effective compared to placebo but are not recommended for prevention. A small study found 62.5 mg every 12 h was noninferior to 125 mg every 12 h, but further research is needed before changing dose. The pediatric dose is 2.5 mg·kg−1·dose−1 (maximum 125 mg·dose−1) every 12 h. Guideline statements specify: "Acetazolamide should be strongly considered in travelers at moderate or high risk of AMS with ascent to high altitude" (Recommendation Grade: 1A) and "Acetazolamide can be used in children for prevention of AMS" (Recommendation Grade: 1C). Regarding sulfonamide allergy, acetazolamide carries an extremely low risk of allergic reaction; persons with known sulfonamide allergy can consider a supervised trial before travel, but prior anaphylaxis to a sulfonamide medication or a history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome should be considered a contraindication to acetazolamide.

### Reduced acetazolamide dosing in countering altitude illness: a comparison of 62.5 vs 125 mg (the RADICAL trial) [^112mkehX]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

North American guidelines propose 125 mg acetazolamide twice daily as the recommended prophylactic dose to prevent acute mountain sickness (AMS). To our knowledge, a dose lower than 125 mg twice daily has not been studied.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized, noninferiority trial of trekkers to Everest Base Camp in Nepal. Participants received the reduced dose of 62.5 mg twice daily or the standard dose of 125 mg twice daily. Primary outcome was incidence of AMS, and secondary outcomes were severity of AMS and side effects in each group.

Results

Seventy-three participants had sufficient data to be included in the analysis. Overall incidence of AMS was 21 of 38 (55.3%) in reduced-dose and 21 of 35 (60.0%) in standard-dose recipients. The daily incidence rate of AMS was 6.7% (95% CI 2.5–10.9) for each individual in the reduced-dose group and 8.9% (95% CI 4.5–13.3) in the standard-dose group. Overall severity of participants' Lake Louise Score was 1.014 in the reduced-dose group and 0.966 in the standard-dose group (95% CI 0.885–1.144). Side effects were similar between the groups.

Conclusions

The reduced dose of acetazolamide at 62.5 mg twice daily was noninferior to the currently recommended dose of 125 mg twice daily for the prevention of AMS. Low incidence of AMS in the study population may have limited the ability to differentiate the treatment effects. Further research with more participants with greater rates of AMS would further elucidate this reduced dosage for preventing altitude illness.

### Identifying the lowest effective dose of acetazolamide for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113qZnuf]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Reporting of blinding of outcome assessment was inconsistently reported among included studies. Eight studies provided inadequate information to make a judgment on blinding of outcome assessment. Three studies clearly stated that outcome assessment was blinded.

Five of the 11 studieswere assessed as having a high risk of attrition bias owing to incomplete outcome data. These studies reported a high proportion of participants who were lost to follow-up. Participants who encountered adverse events may have descended before outcome assessment. It is possible that the intervention effect was overestimated in these studies. The remaining six studies discussed withdrawals and exclusions and were judged as having a low risk of attrition bias.

Two studies were judged as having a low risk of reporting bias. Eight of the 11 trials provided inadequate information to make a judgment about selective reporting. Often the study protocol was unavailable for review to determine whether prespecified outcomes were reported in the trial analysis. One study was deemed as being at high risk of selective reporting. Unpublished data were obtained from the original author (N K Burki, personal communication, 2011) of this trial to determine from the raw data the incidence of acute mountain sickness among participants. The criteria used by study authors to diagnose acute mountain sickness were not published in the original study.

Ascent profiles and timing of the delivery of acetazolamide were not consistently reported among the trials. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot (see supplementary fig 4).

### Identifying the lowest effective dose of acetazolamide for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112gcL5u]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

After two study authors independently assessed the full text articles we excluded from the review 10 of the studiesincluded in the second of the published reviews(see supplementary table 1 for reasons for exclusion). Our inclusion criteria specified that trials were required to randomise participants to either acetazolamide or placebo. This was not, however, a specific requirement of the second review, and one studywas included where all participants were given acetazolamide for three days before being randomised to intervention or placebo groups. We excluded trials that were not blinded, used hypobaric chambers to simulate ascent to altitude, or included the indigenous population (owing to the likelihood of acclimatisation). One study included in the systematic review and meta-analysis by Kayser et alwas excluded from our review because the same participants took part in both the intervention and placebo groups during two different ascents, and these were then compared with each other. The risk of acclimatisation on the second ascent was significant and some participants will have received acetazolamide on the first ascent and placebo on the second. We excluded three studies included in a previous reviewon the basis of the titles and abstracts not fitting our inclusion criteria. One of the studies was excluded as the primary outcome was assessment of the efficacy of acetazolamide 500 mg daily in improving sleep disturbance. Furthermore, all participants received acetazolamide 500 mg for three days before being allocated to either the intervention or the placebo groups. Another study was excluded because the primary outcome was measurement of plasma erythropoietin by radioimmunoassay to assess the association between acetazolamide and erythropoietin levels at altitude. A third study was excluded as the incidence of acute mountain sickness was not clearly reported among participants, instead altitude induced mood changes was the primary outcome reported. The rigorous approach to study selection and inclusion criteria of this review did not provide sufficient data for subgroup analysis based on mode of ascent.

Qualitative analysis of intervention effects

Heterogeneity

Heterogeneity between the four studies administering acetazolamide 250 mg daily was low (I² = 15%, P = 0.32). No measurable heterogeneity was identified between the six studies forming the acetazolamide 500 mg group (I² = 0%, P = 0.83). Heterogeneity of effects between the two trials administering 750 mg acetazolamide daily was moderate (I² = 44%, P = 0.18). Comparison of fixed and random effects estimation of the intervention effect as recommended in the Cochrane handbookdid not yield a difference in effect estimation within the 250 mg and 500 mg treatment groups. Only a minor difference was identified within the 750 mg group: fixed effects odds ratio (0.20, 95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.41) compared with random effects (0.19, 0.07 to 0.52). There was no evidence of funnel plot asymmetry (see supplementary fig 4), indicating the absence of publication bias. Assuming homogeneity, a fixed effects model was applied to estimate the intervention effect in the meta-analysis.

Sensitivity analysis

In a sensitivity analysis including only studies that used the Lake Louise scoring system to diagnose acute mountain sickness (fig 3), the estimate of intervention effects was similar between the original analysis and the sensitivity analyses, which included eight of the 11 original studies. In the 250 mg treatment group the four included studies all applied the Lake Louise scoring system, therefore sensitivity analysis was not needed. In the 500 mg subgroup, four of the original six studies were analysedgiving a combined odds ratio of 0.35 (95% confidence interval 0.24 to 0.52) compared with the original odds ratio of 0.37 (0.26 to 0.52). Only one of the two studies applied the Lake Louise scoring system in the 750 mg groupresulting in a reduced treatment effect compared with the original analysis: odds ratio 0.30 (0.12 to 0.75) compared with 0.20 (0.10 to 0.41).

Acute mountain sickness (AMS) prophylaxis — acetazolamide role, dosing, timing, and precautions: Multiple trials have established a role for acetazolamide in the prevention of AMS. The recommended adult dose for prophylaxis is 125 mg every 12 h; a small study suggested that 62.5 mg every 12 h was noninferior to 125 mg every 12 h, but a larger randomized, controlled trial demonstrated that 62.5 mg was less effective than 125 mg in preventing AMS. Higher doses (eg, 250 mg every 12 h) can be considered for high-risk ascent profiles up to elevations of 5000 m, and the appropriate dose for ascent to elevations above 5000 m has not been studied. The pediatric dose is 1.25 mg·kg−1·dose−1 (maximum, 125 mg·dose−1) every 12 h, and the medication should be started the night before ascent, though day-of-ascent dosing still yields benefit if needed. Acetazolamide contains a sulfa moiety but carries an extremely low risk of inciting an allergic reaction in persons with sulfonamide allergy; persons with known allergy to sulfonamide medications can consider a supervised trial prior to travel, particularly if planning to be remote from medical resources, while prior anaphylaxis to a sulfonamide medication or a history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a contraindication. Regarding exercise effects, some studies using higher-than-recommended doses have suggested adverse effects on maximum exercise capacity, perceived dyspnea, leg endurance, and respiratory muscle function, although a more recent controlled study showed no effect on 2-mile exercise performance after 2- or 24-h exposure to 3500 m, and the text notes that any detrimental effects are small and unlikely to affect overall performance or summit success.

We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 17 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acetazolamide, descent versus resting, dexamethasone, gingko biloba, and slow ascent.

### Effects of acetazolamide combined with remote ischemic preconditioning on risk of acute mountain sickness: a randomized clinical trial [^1168jdRS]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is the most common type of high-altitude illness, affecting over a quarter of individuals traveling to above 3500 m. Symptoms of AMS typically arise within 4–12 h after reaching high altitude and can range from mild to severe. Hypoxia is the main contributing factor to the pathophysiological processes of AMS, causing hypoxemia, inflammation, raised pulmonary artery pressure and intracranial pressure, etc.

For those who need to ascend rapidly to high altitudes, acetazolamide is traditionally the most recommended. This carbonic anhydrase inhibitor functions in several ways to prevent altitude sickness, including inducing diuresis and mild metabolic acidosis, modulating the central and peripheral chemoreceptors, and immunoregulating. Typically, acetazolamide can decrease the incidence of AMS by 47% (3000–4000 m, 500 mg/day, 3–5 days prior to ascent), but its use is limited due to the 35–50% incidence of side effects, including paresthesia, taste disturbance, polyuria, electrolyte imbalance, and crystalluria. Moreover, the risk of side effects increases significantly with dosage, while the improvement in efficacy is limited. The risk ratio for the incidence of paresthesia and taste disturbance increased 2.1–3.5 times when the dosage of acetazolamide was augmented from 250 to 500 mg/day.

In this context, newly developed non-pharmacological approaches, such as remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), have emerged to prevent AMS while avoiding the side effects of the drug. RIPC involves applying brief periods of ischemia and reperfusion to the upper arm, and it has been shown to reduce the incidence of AMS, improve oxygen saturation, attenuate the increase in pulmonary artery pressures, and ameliorate attentional function in individuals exposed to high altitude. Since acetazolamide and RIPC are both effective in preventing AMS, whether the combination of the two can intensify the effectiveness of AMS prevention deserves further investigation.

We conducted a randomized clinical trial to investigate whether the combination of the lowest effective dose of acetazolamide (250 mg/day for 2 days) and a rapid training course of RIPC (four times daily for 3 days) was an effective regimen for minimizing the occurrence and severity of AMS. The study protocol is presented in Fig. 1. We hypothesized that the two methods could act synergistically and their combination could improve clinical outcomes during acute exposure to hypoxia.

Acute altitude illness prophylaxis — indications and agents: "Prophylactic medications are not necessary in low-risk situations but should be considered in addition to gradual ascent for use in moderate- to high-risk situations (Table 2)". "Acetazolamide is the preferred medication; dexamethasone may be used as an alternative in individuals with a history of intolerance of or allergic reaction to acetazolamide". In rare rapid-ascent operations "at > 3500 m", "consideration can be given to concurrent use of acetazolamide and dexamethasone", but "This strategy should be avoided except in these particular or other emergency circumstances that mandate very rapid ascent". Timing guidance states "Acetazolamide and dexamethasone should be started the day before ascent but will still have beneficial effects if started on the day of ascent". For prolonged stays, "prophylaxis may be stopped after 2 d at the highest altitude", whereas faster-than-recommended ascents "may consider continuing preventive medication for 2 to 4 d after arrival at the target altitude, but there are no data to support this approach". When beginning descent without symptoms, "preventive medications should be stopped when descent is initiated".

Acute mountain sickness (AMS) management — patients with AMS can remain at their current altitude and use nonopioid analgesics and antiemetics, should be closely observed, and descent should be initiated if symptoms worsen or fail to improve after 1 to 2 d of appropriate interventions. Dexamethasone is considered to be a more reliable treatment for moderate to severe AMS, whereas acetazolamide is likely better for prevention than treatment. Individuals with AMS may resume ascending once symptoms resolve, but further ascent or reascent should never be undertaken if there are ongoing symptoms; after resolution of AMS, taking acetazolamide at preventive doses during reascent is prudent.

Acute mountain sickness prophylaxis — dexamethasone has evidence for AMS prevention, with recommended adult doses of 2 mg every 6 h or 4 mg every 12 h; high doses (4 mg every 6 h) may be considered only in very high-risk situations such as personnel airlifted to altitudes > 3500 m with immediate physical activity; tapering is not required if use is limited to 5 to 7 d, prolonged use carries a risk of adrenal suppression, and dexamethasone is not recommended for AMS prevention in children; We recommend that dexamethasone be used as an alternative to acetazolamide for adult travelers at moderate or high risk of AMS. Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence.

Acetazolamide and HAPE prophylaxis: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 13 healthy unacclimatized lowlanders with a history of HAPE found no significant reduction in HAPE or pulmonary artery pressure after rapid ascent to 4559 m with acetazolamide compared with placebo. Clinical observations suggest that acetazolamide may prevent re-entry HAPE. We recommend that acetazolamide not be used for HAPE prevention in those with a history of the disease during prior trips to high altitude; Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. We suggest that acetazolamide be considered for prevention of re-entry HAPE in people with a history of the disorder; Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### Medication and dosage considerations in the prophylaxis and treatment of high-altitude illness [^1129aMjs]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

With increasing numbers of people traveling to high altitude for work or pleasure, there is a reasonable chance that many of these travelers have preexisting medical conditions or are receiving various medications at the time of their sojourn. As with all travelers to high altitude, they are at risk for altitude illnesses such as acute mountain sickness, high-altitude cerebral edema, and high-altitude pulmonary edema. While there are clear recommendations for pharmacologic measures to prevent or treat these illnesses, these recommendations are oriented toward healthy individuals and do not take into account the presence of preexisting medical conditions. In this review, we consider how the choice and dose of the medications used in the management of altitude illness-acetazolamide, dexamethasone, nifedipine, tadalafil, sildenafil, and salmeterol-are affected by a patient's underlying medical conditions. We discuss the indications and current dosing recommendations for individuals without underlying disease, and then consider how drug selection or dosing regimens will be affected by the presence of renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, other important medical conditions, and the potential for serious drug interactions. We include comments about interactions with antimalarial medications and antibiotics used in the treatment of traveler's diarrhea, as well as the safety of use during pregnancy. By giving these issues adequate consideration, clinicians can increase the chances that properly evaluated patients with underlying medical conditions will enjoy a safe trip to high altitude.

Acute altitude illness prophylaxis — indications and agent selection: Prophylactic medications are not necessary in low-risk situations but should be considered in addition to gradual ascent for use in moderate- to high-risk situations; acetazolamide is the preferred medication, and dexamethasone may be used as an alternative in adults with prior intolerance or allergic reaction to acetazolamide. Concurrent use of acetazolamide and dexamethasone has only been studied in a single small, randomized trial and should not be used outside of very limited, high-risk circumstances such as climbers or rescue teams that must ascend rapidly to and perform physical work at > 3500 m.

Acetazolamide — Although acetazolamide hastens acclimatization and has been shown to blunt hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in animal models and in a single study in humans, there are no data specifically supporting a role in HAPE prevention; clinical observations suggest acetazolamide may prevent reentry HAPE. Because of lack of data, no recommendation can be made regarding use of acetazolamide for HAPE prevention, but acetazolamide can be considered for prevention of reentry HAPE in people with a history of the disorder (Recommendation Grade: 1C).

### Identifying the lowest effective dose of acetazolamide for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115uiEqW]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Numbers needed to treat

The number needed to treat the number needed to treat was 6 (95% confidence interval 5 to 11) in the acetazolamide 250 mg subgroup, 7 (6 to 9) in the 500 mg subgroup, and 3 (3 to 5) in the 750 mg subgroup.

Adverse effects

Side effects reported in some of the trials suggested a substantial increase in the incidence of paraesthesia among participants taking acetazolamide compared with placebo in all three dose specific groups (see supplementary table 2). The incidence of paraesthesia increased from 3.7% (placebo) to 49% (intervention)and from 31% (placebo) to 76% (intervention)in the 250 mg subgroup, from 0% (placebo) to 35% (intervention)and from 10% (placebo) to 72% (intervention)in the 500 mg subgroup, and from 31% (placebo) to 91% (intervention)in the 750 mg subgroup. Other side effects reported were polyuria, rash, and dysgeusia. The frequency of micturition increased with use of acetazolamide. The biggest increase was in the 750 mg subgroup, where incidence increased from 53% (placebo) to 60% (intervention)and from 0% (placebo) to 15% (intervention). Dysgeusia increased from 2% (placebo) to 11% (intervention)in one trial using 500 mg daily and from 4% (placebo) to 14% (intervention)in one trial using 750 mg daily. Different levels of dysgeusia were not evident in the two other trials comprising 250 mg and 500 mg treatment groups.

Five of the 11 studiesreported non-adherence to drug schedules (see supplementary table 3). No dose-response increase in non-adherence was obvious.

### Acetazolamide to prevent adverse altitude effects in COPD and healthy adults [^114Bicwv]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: We evaluated the efficacy of acetazolamide in preventing adverse altitude effects in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in healthy lowlanders 40 years of age or older. METHODS: Trial 1 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-design trial in which 176 patients with COPD were treated with acetazolamide capsules (375 mg/day) or placebo, starting 24 hours before staying for 2 days at 3100 m. The mean (± SD) age of participants was 57 ± 9 years, and 34% were women. At 760 m, COPD patients had oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry of 92% or greater, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide less than 45 mm Hg, and mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 63 ± 11% of predicted. The primary outcome in trial 1 was the incidence of the composite end point of altitude-related adverse health effects (ARAHE) at 3100 m. Criteria for ARAHE included acute mountain sickness (AMS) and symptoms or findings relevant to well-being and safety, such as severe hypoxemia, requiring intervention. Trial 2 comprised 345 healthy lowlanders. Their mean age was 53 ± 7 years, and 69% were women. The participants in trial 2 underwent the same protocol as did the patients with COPD in trial 1. The primary outcome in trial 2 was the incidence of AMS assessed at 3100 m by the Lake Louise questionnaire score (the scale of self-assessed symptoms ranges from 0 to 15 points, indicating absent to severe, with 3 or more points including headache, indicating AMS). RESULTS: In trial 1 of patients with COPD, 68 of 90 (76%) receiving placebo and 42 of 86 (49%) receiving acetazolamide experienced ARAHE (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37 to 0.79; P < 0.001). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one case of ARAHE was 4 (95% CI, 3 to 8). In trial 2 of healthy individuals, 54 of 170 (32%) receiving placebo and 38 of 175 (22%) receiving acetazolamide experienced AMS (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.80; chi-square statistic P = 0.035). The NNT to prevent one case of AMS was 10 (95% CI, 5 to 141). No serious adverse events occurred in these trials. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive treatment with acetazolamide reduced the incidence of adverse altitude effects requiring an intervention in patients with COPD and the incidence of AMS in healthy lowlanders 40 years of age or older during a high-altitude sojourn.

### Acetazolamide reduces exercise capacity following a 5-day ascent to 4559 M in a randomised study [^115yyBSk]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acetazolamide (Az) is an important medication for the prevention of acute mountain sickness (AMS). This was demonstrated initially by Forwand et al, followed by a large study on Everest trekkers, with an accompanying editorial. In controlled studies, Az has been shown to increase arterial oxygen saturations at all altitudes and to assist in ascents to Everest Base Camp, the summit of Kilimanjaro and elsewhere. A meta-analysis of 24 placebo-controlled trials comparing 1011 Az-treated with 854 placebo-treated individuals showed convincing evidence of its value for the prevention of AMS. Escalating doses of Az from 250 mg to 500 mg and 750 mg per day reduced AMS relative risk by 45%, 50%, and 55% respectively, although current recommendations suggest 125 mg twice daily.

An important but controversial aspect of Az use is its effect on exercise at altitude. Five chamber studies examining the impact of Az during short-term exposure to hypoxia, three of these showed reduced VO₂max and/or time to exhaustion, one a slight increase in VO₂max, and one no effect. Similar inconsistent findings have been reported in natural high-altitude environments. Hackett et al gave Az acutely to well-acclimatised individuals and observed a reduction in exercise performance (time at maximum workload), whereas Faoro et al observed no effect. Results are again inconsistent when Az is used prophylactically. Specifically, after a 14-day trek to 4846 m, VO₂max and exercise endurance were greater on Az compared with placebo. Conversely, when used during early acclimatisation (18–24 hours), Az reduced exercise performance, but only in individuals over 50 years of age.

Risk of bias

Table 2presents the results of the risk of bias assessment for the included studies. Random sequence generation was assessed as adequate in eight of the 11 trials and for these studies selection bias was judged as being a low risk. Three studies used a computer generated randomisation code for allocation of intervention. Other methods of random sequence generation included non-computer generated randomisation codes, random numbers tables, and on-site methods of randomised distribution. Ten of the 11 trials were assessed as adequate for allocation concealment. One study did not provide adequate information to make a judgment about allocation concealment.

Table 2
Risk of bias of included studies

Blinding of participants and staff was adequately reported in six of the 11 studies. Four studiesdid not provide adequate information to formulate a judgment on performance bias (unclear risk). One study was judged to be at high risk of performance bias.

The different methods used to diagnose acute mountain sickness are a threat to consistency of outcomes between studies and are likely to introduce detection bias. The application of a standardised system of diagnosing acute mountain sickness was therefore an important criterion for the inclusion of studies, with most studiesapplying the Lake Louise scoring system, based on assessment of symptoms such as gastrointestinal disturbance (anorexia, nausea, vomiting), dizziness, light headedness, insomnia, or fatigue. The scoring systems used by three other studies were all based on assessment of similar symptoms, deemed to result in a comparable level of outcome reporting. One study used a combination of assessment criteria (Lake Louise scoring system and acute mountain sickness-cerebral score) and showed a reduction in the incidence of acute mountain sickness and severity regardless of the method of outcome assessment applied, suggesting a positive correlation between the different methods.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of acute altitude illness: 2024 update [^115z2xnM]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute mountain sickness (AMS) and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) — management emphasizes differential diagnosis, avoidance of ascent with symptoms, timely descent, and selective medication use. Care should exclude mimics "such as carbon monoxide poisoning, dehydration, exhaustion, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and hyponatremia". People with AMS "should avoid moving to higher sleeping elevations", and those with mild–moderate illness may stay at current altitude with symptomatic therapy, but "descent should be initiated for AMS if symptoms worsen or fail to improve after 1 to 3 d", while "persons with severe AMS should cease ascending and descend to lower elevation". Acetazolamide and dexamethasone are "generally not necessary" for mild AMS but may be used in moderate–severe cases; dexamethasone "should be strongly considered along with descent", and acetazolamide is "likely better for the prevention rather than the treatment of AMS", though may be considered when dexamethasone is unavailable. After symptom resolution, individuals "may resume ascending", but "further ascent or reascent… is contraindicated if there are ongoing symptoms", and "prophylactic doses of acetazolamide should be used during reascent". For suspected or confirmed HACE, those with access to care "should receive supplemental oxygen sufficient to achieve an SpO₂ > 90%", and in remote settings "descent should be initiated", with "supplemental oxygen or a portable hyperbaric chamber" if descent is not feasible, and "all persons with HACE should also be started on dexamethasone". Data on reascent after HACE are lacking; "the prudent course is to avoid reascent in this situation".

### Acetazolamide extended-release [^113kKbox]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

Glaucoma

The recommended dosage is 1 capsule (500 mg) two times a day. Usually 1 capsule is administered in the morning and 1 capsule in the evening. It may be necessary to adjust the dose, but it has usually been found that dosage in excess of 2 capsules (1 g) does not produce an increased effect. The dosage should be adjusted with careful individual attention both to symptomatology and intraocular tension. In all cases, continuous supervision by a physician is advisable.

In those unusual instances where adequate control is not obtained by the twice-a-day administration of acetazolamide extended-release capsules, the desired control may be established by means of acetazolamide (tablets or parenteral). Use tablets or parenteral in accordance with the more frequent dosage schedules recommended for these dosage forms, such as 250 mg every four hours, or an initial dose of 500 mg followed by 250 mg or 125 mg every four hours, depending on the case in question.

Acute Mountain Sickness

Dosage is 500 mg to 1000 mg daily, in divided doses using tablets or extended-release capsules as appropriate. In circumstances of rapid ascent, such as in rescue or military operations, the higher dose level of 1000 mg is recommended. It is preferable to initiate dosing 24 to 48 hours before ascent and to continue for 48 hours while at high altitude, or longer as necessary to control symptoms.

### Acetazolamide extended-release [^115Mpd3K]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Acetazolamide extended-release capsules provide prolonged action to inhibit aqueous humor secretion for 18 to 24 hours after each dose, whereas tablets act for only eight to 12 hours. The prolonged continuous effect of acetazolamide extended-release capsules permits a reduction in dosage frequency.

Plasma concentrations of acetazolamide peak from three to six hours after administration of acetazolamide extended-release capsules, compared to one to four hours with tablets. Food does not affect bioavailability of acetazolamide extended-release capsules.

Placebo-controlled clinical trials have shown that prophylactic administration of acetazolamide at a dose of 250 mg every eight to 12 hours (or a 500 mg controlled release capsule once daily) before and during rapid ascent to altitude results in fewer and/or less severe symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) such as headache, nausea, shortness of breath, dizziness, drowsiness, and fatigue. Pulmonary function (e.g., minute ventilation, expired vital capacity, and peak flow) is greater in the acetazolamide treated group, both in subjects with AMS and asymptomatic subjects. The acetazolamide treated climbers also had less difficulty in sleeping.

### Altitude sickness prevention with ibuprofen relative to acetazolamide [^115hkA79]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute mountain sickness is a common occurrence for travel to high altitudes. Although previous studies of ibuprofen have shown efficacy for the prevention of acute mountain sickness, recommendations have been limited, as ibuprofen has not been compared directly with acetazolamide until this study.

Methods

Before their ascent to 3810 m on White Mountain in California, adult volunteers were randomized to ibuprofen (600 mg, 3 times daily, started 4 hours before the ascent), or to acetazolamide (125 mg, twice daily, started the night before the ascent). The main outcome measure was acute mountain sickness incidence, using the Lake Louise Questionnaire (LLQ), with a score of > 3 with headache. Sleep quality and headache severity were measured with the Groningen Sleep Quality Survey (GSQS). This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03154645 RESULTS: Ninety-two participants completed the study: 45 (49%) on ibuprofen and 47 (51%) on acetazolamide. The total incidence of acute mountain sickness was 56.5%, with the incidence for the ibuprofen group being 11% greater than that for acetazolamide, surpassing the predetermined 26% noninferiority margin (62.2% vs 51.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -11.1 to 33.5). No difference was found in the total LLQ scores or subgroup symptoms between drugs (P = 0.8). The GSQS correlated with LLQ sleep (r = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67–0.84) = %. The acetazolamide group had higher peripheral capillary oxygen saturation than the ibuprofen group (88.5% vs 85.6%; P = 0.001).

Conclusion

Ibuprofen was slightly inferior to acetazolamide for acute mountain sickness prevention and should not be recommended over acetazolamide for rapid ascent. Average symptoms and severity were similar between drugs, suggesting prevention of disease.

Medication dosing for altitude illness — recommended dosages (Table 1): Acetazolamide for AMS and HACE prevention is oral at 125 mg every 12 h, with pediatric prophylaxis 1.25 mg·kg−1 every 12 h (maximum 125 mg per dose); AMS treatment is 250 mg every 12 h, with pediatric treatment 2.5 mg·kg−1 every 12 h (maximum: 250 mg per dose). Dexamethasone for AMS/HACE prevention and treatment (oral, IV, IM) includes prophylaxis 2 mg every 6 h or 4 mg every 12 h; AMS treatment 4 mg every 6 h; HACE treatment 8 mg once then 4 mg every 6 h; pediatric dosing 0.15 mg·kg−1·dose−1 every 6 h (maximum: 4 mg per dose), and pediatrics should not be used for prophylaxis. Ibuprofen for high altitude headache (HAH) treatment is 600 mg every 8 h. Nifedipine for HAPE prevention or treatment is 30 mg ER version every 12 h or 20 mg ER version every 8 h. Tadalafil for HAPE prevention is 10 mg every 12 h, and sildenafil for HAPE prevention is 50 mg every 8 h. For individuals ascending to and remaining at a given elevation after arrival, acetazolamide prophylaxis should be continued for 2 d when adhering to the recommended ascent rate and 2 to 4 d when ascending faster than recommended rates, with discontinuation once descent is initiated; for HAPE prophylaxis with phosphodiesterase inhibitors, continue for 4 d when adhering to the recommended ascent rate and 4 to 7 d when ascending faster, with discontinuation once descent is initiated.

Older people

The greater effect of Az on exercise performance in older people raises important questions regarding dosage, especially given the increasing numbers of older people trekking at altitude. Since Az is largely excreted unchanged in urine (90% of an oral dose is excreted within 24 hours) and GFR decreases with age, tissue concentrations may be higher in older people. For example, toxicity is frequently observed when Az is used for treating glaucoma, a disease of older people. In particular, patients with reduced GFR or who are on dialysis are prescribed doses of 125 mg per day or less. In such patients, fatigue and lethargy are well-known side effects, but there are no studies of exercise performance in this group. Conventionally, Az usage at altitude is perceived as having few consequential side effects, which are limited to taste disturbance and paraesthesia. However, there are concerns about the optimal dosage, which is currently recommended as 125 mg twice daily. Our data provide evidence that this may not be appropriate under all circumstances. The optimum therapeutic dose of Az may have to be individualised for the prophylaxis of AMS. Higher dosing schedules may provide additional benefits by reducing the risk of AMS, but this could be offset by reduced exercise performance. Studies of doses as low as 125 mg per day in older people are required with assessments of AMS scores, peripheral oxygen saturations, exercise performance and accompanied by measurement of blood concentrations of Az to fully address this question. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the current recommendations on the dose of Az used for prophylaxis of AMS and indicate that Az would not enhance exercise performance if taken by healthy individuals at altitude and, indeed, might have the opposite effect at maximum effort.

### Budesonide versus acetazolamide for prevention of acute mountain sickness [^117Coke4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled budesonide has been suggested as a novel prevention for acute mountain sickness. However, efficacy has not been compared with the standard acute mountain sickness prevention medication acetazolamide.

Methods

This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial compared inhaled budesonide versus oral acetazolamide versus placebo, starting the morning of ascent from 1240 m (4100 ft) to 3810 m (12,570 ft) over 4 hours. The primary outcome was acute mountain sickness incidence (headache and Lake Louise Questionnaire ≥ 3 and another symptom).

Results

A total of 103 participants were enrolled and completed the study; 33 (32%) received budesonide, 35 (34%) acetazolamide, and 35 (34%) placebo. Demographics were not different between the groups (P > .09). Acute mountain sickness prevalence was 73%, with severe acute mountain sickness of 47%. Fewer participants in the acetazolamide group (n = 15, 43%) developed acute mountain sickness compared with both budesonide (n = 24, 73%) (odds ratio [OR] 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–10.1) and placebo (n = 22, 63%) (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.2–1.2). Severe acute mountain sickness was reduced with acetazolamide (n = 11, 31%) compared with both budesonide (n = 18, 55%) (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1–7.2) and placebo (n = 19, 54%) (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1–1), with a number needed to treat of 4.

Conclusion

Budesonide was ineffective for the prevention of acute mountain sickness, and acetazolamide was preventive of severe acute mountain sickness taken just before rapid ascent.

High-altitude travel and altitude illness — acetazolamide dosing for prophylaxis and treatment is specified as follows: An effective dose for prophylaxis that minimizes paresthesia is 125 mg every 12 hours beginning the day before ascent and continuing the first 2 days at altitude, and longer if ascent continues. Acetazolamide can also be taken episodically for symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS), as needed. For treatment, the only dose studied is 250 mg (2 doses taken 8 hours apart), although the lower prophylaxis dosage has anecdotally been successful. The pediatric dose is 2.5 to 5 mg/kg/day in divided doses, up to 125 mg, twice a day.

### Altitude illness: risk factors, prevention, presentation, and treatment [^112DcPgG]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Altitude illness affects 25 to 85 percent of travelers to high altitudes, depending on their rate of ascent, home altitude, individual susceptibility, and other risk factors. Acute mountain sickness is the most common presentation of altitude illness and typically causes headache and malaise within six to 12 hours of gaining altitude. It may progress to high-altitude cerebral edema in some persons. Onset is heralded by worsening symptoms of acute mountain sickness, progressing to ataxia and eventually to coma and death if not treated. High-altitude pulmonary edema is uncommon, but is the leading cause of altitude illness-related death. It may appear in otherwise healthy persons and may progress rapidly with cough, dyspnea, and frothy sputum. Slow ascent is the most important measure to prevent the onset of altitude illness. If this is not possible, or if symptoms occur despite slow ascent, acetazolamide or dexamethasone may be used for prophylaxis or treatment of acute mountain sickness. Descent is mandatory for all persons with high-altitude cerebral or pulmonary edema. Patients with stable coronary and pulmonary disease may travel to high altitudes but are at risk of exacerbation of these illnesses. Medical management is prudent in these patients.

### Prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled comparison of acetazolamide versus ibuprofen for prophylaxis against high altitude headache: the headache evaluation at altitude trial (HEAT) [^111MdUD8]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

High altitude headache (HAH) is the most common neurological complaint at altitude and the defining component of acute mountain sickness (AMS). However, there is a paucity of literature concerning its prevention. Toward this end, we initiated a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in the Nepal Himalaya designed to compare the effectiveness of ibuprofen and acetazolamide for the prevention of HAH.

Methods

Three hundred forty-three healthy western trekkers were recruited at altitudes of 4280 m and 4358 m and assigned to receive ibuprofen 600 mg, acetazolamide 85 mg, or placebo 3 times daily before continued ascent to 4928 m. Outcome measures included headache incidence and severity, AMS incidence and severity on the Lake Louise AMS Questionnaire (LLQ), and visual analog scale (VAS).

Results

Two hundred sixty-five of 343 subjects completed the trial. HAH incidence was similar when treated with acetazolamide (27.1%) or ibuprofen (27.5%; P = 0.95), and both agents were significantly more effective than placebo (45.3%; P = 0.01). AMS incidence was similar when treated with acetazolamide (18.8%) or ibuprofen (13.7%; P = 0.34), and both agents were significantly more effective than placebo (28.6%; P = 0.03). In fully compliant participants, moderate or severe headache incidence was similar when treated with acetazolamide (3.8%) or ibuprofen (4.7%; P = 0.79), and both agents were significantly more effective than placebo (13.5%; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Ibuprofen and acetazolamide were similarly effective in preventing HAH. Ibuprofen was similar to acetazolamide in preventing symptoms of AMS, an interesting finding that implies a potentially new approach to prevention of cerebral forms of acute altitude illness.

### Interventions for preventing high altitude illness: part 1. commonly-used classes of drugs [^114LXRRZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

High altitude illness (HAI) is a term used to describe a group of cerebral and pulmonary syndromes that can occur during travel to elevations above 2500 metres (8202 feet). Acute hypoxia, acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) and high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) are reported as potential medical problems associated with high altitude. In this review, the first in a series of three about preventive strategies for HAI, we assess the effectiveness of six of the most recommended classes of pharmacological interventions.

Objectives

To assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of commonly-used pharmacological interventions for preventing acute HAI.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), LILACS and trial registries in January 2017. We adapted the MEDLINE strategy for searching the other databases. We used a combination of thesaurus-based and free-text terms to search.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized-controlled and cross-over trials conducted in any setting where commonly-used classes of drugs were used to prevent acute HAI.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 64 studies (78 references) and 4547 participants in this review, and classified 12 additional studies as ongoing. A further 12 studies await classification, as we were unable to obtain the full texts. Most of the studies were conducted in high altitude mountain areas, while the rest used low pressure (hypobaric) chambers to simulate altitude exposure. Twenty-four trials provided the intervention between three and five days prior to the ascent, and 23 trials, between one and two days beforehand. Most of the included studies reached a final altitude of between 4001 and 5000 metres above sea level. Risks of bias were unclear for several domains, and a considerable number of studies did not report adverse events of the evaluated interventions. We found 26 comparisons, 15 of them comparing commonly-used drugs versus placebo. We report results for the three most important comparisons: Acetazolamide versus placebo (28 parallel studies; 2345 participants)The risk of AMS was reduced with acetazolamide (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.56; I² = 0%; 16 studies; 2301 participants; moderate quality of evidence). No events of HAPE were reported and only one event of HACE (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.48; 6 parallel studies; 1126 participants; moderate quality of evidence). Few studies reported side effects for this comparison, and they showed an increase in the risk of paraesthesia with the intake of acetazolamide (RR 5.53, 95% CI 2.81 to 10.88, I² = 60%; 5 studies, 789 participants; low quality of evidence). Budenoside versus placebo (2 parallel studies; 132 participants)Data on budenoside showed a reduction in the incidence of AMS compared with placebo (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.61; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 132 participants; low quality of evidence). Studies included did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and they did not find side effects (low quality of evidence). Dexamethasone versus placebo (7 parallel studies; 205 participants)For dexamethasone, the data did not show benefits at any dosage (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.00; I2 = 39%; 4 trials, 176 participants; low quality of evidence). Included studies did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and we rated the evidence about adverse events as of very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

Our assessment of the most commonly-used pharmacological interventions suggests that acetazolamide is an effective pharmacological agent to prevent acute HAI in dosages of 250 to 750 mg/day. This information is based on evidence of moderate quality. Acetazolamide is associated with an increased risk of paraesthesia, although there are few reports about other adverse events from the available evidence. The clinical benefits and harms of other pharmacological interventions such as ibuprofen, budenoside and dexamethasone are unclear. Large multicentre studies are needed for most of the pharmacological agents evaluated in this review, to evaluate their effectiveness and safety.

### Clinical implications for exercise at altitude among individuals with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1134MRsU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Knowledge of the effects of different antihypertensive medications on BP at altitude is derived primarily from studies performed on healthy volunteers. Treatment with the angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan reduced daytime and nighttime BP. However, the benefits were observed up to an altitude of 3400 m and disappeared at higher altitudes (5400 m), likely resulting from concomitant suppression of the renin–angiotensin system that occurs with high‐altitude exposure. Among hypertensive individuals, 24‐hour ABPM found that at an altitude of 3400 m, the combination of telmisartan and the calcium channel blocker nifedipine attenuated altitude‐associated increases in BP. Use of the nonselective β‐blocker/combined α‐blocker carvedilol in healthy subjects resulted in a significant attenuation of the hypertensive response at altitude, but was associated with reduced arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation and impaired exercise tolerance, perhaps by inhibiting hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and worsening V A /Q mismatch. In contrast, the highly selective β 1 adrenergic receptor blocker nebivolol, which also has nitric oxide donating properties, preserved the normal nocturnal BP reduction that occurs at sea level and was associated with a smaller reduction in exercise tolerance at altitude than nonselective β‐blockers. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, antagonizes the BP rise induced by altitude exposure while also reducing the occurrence of central sleep apneaand preventing acute mountain sickness.

Before travel, clinicians should ensure that BP is controlled at sea level. Medications and dosages should be reviewed, along with travel plans, including duration of travel and ascent profiles. For patients with stable BP and on short excursions (eg, several days), BP monitoring is probably unnecessary. For patients whose BP is difficult to control and who are planning prolonged trips, BP monitoring may be required, and plans developed for BP cutoffs that should trigger patients to rest and avoid strenuous activity, take additional antihypertensive medications, or descend in the event that BP remains uncontrolled. For the most part, the adverse cardiovascular consequences of hypertension occur over much longer time courses than a typical altitude sojourn for a sea‐level native. Acute elevations in BP to high levels are common during resistance exerciseand are well tolerated except in patients with severe cardiovascular disease. Although there are no hard data to guide specific cut points, sustained BPs of > 180/110 mm Hg should be considered for augmented therapy, especially for those patients with significant underlying cardiovascular disease.

Altitude illness and acute mountain sickness (AMS) — children are as susceptible to the deleterious effects of high elevation travel as adults, and slow ascent is the preferable approach for avoiding AMS; young children unable to talk can show non-specific symptoms (loss of appetite or irritability, unexplained fussiness, changes in sleep and activity), older children might complain of headache or shortness of breath, and if children demonstrate unexplained symptoms after an ascent, descent could be necessary. Acetazolamide is not approved for use in children aged < 12 years for altitude illness, although some providers prescribe acetazolamide to prevent AMS in pediatric travelers < 12 years of age when a slow ascent is not feasible; the dose is 2.5 mg/kg every 12 hours, up to a maximum of 125 mg per dose, twice a day, and no liquid formulation is available, but tablets can be crushed or packaged by a compounding pharmacy for a correct dose.

### Effect of acetazolamide on pulmonary hemodynamics and right heart function in healthy adults going to altitude: a randomized controlled trial [^115XmJzP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Interventions

After recruitment, patients were randomized to acetazolamide or placebo. Participants received either acetazolamide (125 mg in the morning, 250 mg in the evening) or identical looking placebo capsules under supervision of investigators. The dosage was selected within the range of current recommendations for the prevention and treatment of acute mountain sickness. The rationale for the administration of a higher evening dose of acetazolamide was to mitigate altitude‐related sleep disordered while avoiding drug‐related side effects during daytime. Baseline measurements were performed at the National Center for Cardiology and Internal Medicine in Bishkek (760 m). Participants were then transported by a minibus to the high‐altitude clinic in Too Ashu (3100 m) for the high‐altitude assessments during a 48‐hour stay. Study medication was started 24 hours before ascent after baseline measurements and continued for 48 hours at 3100 m until descent of the participants.

Assessments

In addition to the physical examination, weight, height, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation by pulse oxymetry were measured at each altitude. Echocardiography (CX 50, Philips, Philips Respironics, Zofingen, Switzerland) and arterial blood gas analyses (Rapidpoint 500, Siemens AG, Zurich, Switzerland) were performed at 760 m before the medication initiation in both groups and at 3100 m after the first night under study medication (placebo or acetazolamide). Acute mountain sickness was assessed by the Lake Louise questionnaireand the environmental symptoms questionnaire.

Suggested approach to HAPE prevention: A gradual ascent profile is the primary method for preventing HAPE. Pharmacologic prophylaxis should only be considered for individuals with a history of HAPE, especially multiple episodes, and nifedipine is the preferred drug in such situations. It should be started the day prior to ascent and continue either until descent is initiated or the individual has spent 4 d at the highest elevation, perhaps up to 7 d if the individual ascended faster than recommended ascent rates, and for out-and-back ascents prophylactic medications should be stopped when descent is initiated. Further research is needed before tadalafil or dexamethasone can be recommended over nifedipine for prevention, and acetazolamide facilitates acclimatization and prevents acute mountain sickness (AMS) but should not be relied upon for HAPE prophylaxis in known HAPE-susceptible individuals.

### Acetazolamide [^116ht9PP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The change from other medications to acetazolamide should be gradual and in accordance with usual practice in epilepsy therapy.

Congestive Heart Failure

For diuresis in congestive heart failure, the starting dose is usually 250 mg to 375 mg once daily in the morning (5 mg/kg). If, after an initial response, the patient fails to continue to lose edema fluid, do not increase the dose but allow for kidney recovery by skipping medication for a day. Acetazolamide tablets yield best diuretic results when given on alternate days, or for two days alternating with a day of rest.

Failures in therapy may be due to overdosage or too frequent dosage. The use of acetazolamide does not eliminate the need for other therapy such as digitalis, bed rest, and salt restriction.

Drug-Induced Edema

Recommended dosage is 250 mg to 375 mg of acetazolamide once a day for one or two days, alternating with a day of rest.

Acute Mountain Sickness

Dosage is 500 mg to 1000 mg daily, in divided doses using tablets or sustained-release capsules as appropriate. In circumstances of rapid ascent, such as in rescue or military operations, the higher dose level of 1000 mg is recommended. It is preferable to initiate dosing 24 to 48 hours before ascent and to continue for 48 hours while at high altitude, or longer as necessary to control symptoms.

Note: The dosage recommendations for glaucoma and epilepsy differ considerably from those for congestive heart failure, since the first two conditions are not dependent upon carbonic anhydrase inhibition in the kidney which requires intermittent dosage if it is to recover from the inhibitory effect of the therapeutic agent.

Interference with Laboratory Tests

Sulfonamides may give false negative or decreased values for urinary phenolsulfonphthalein and phenol red elimination values for urinary protein, serum non-protein and for serum uric acid. Acetazolamide may produce an increased level of crystals in the urine.

Acetazolamide interferes with the HPLC method of assay for theophylline. Interference with the theophylline assay by acetazolamide depends on the solvent used in the extraction; acetazolamide may not interfere with other assay methods for theophylline.

### Acetazolamide reduces exercise capacity following a 5-day ascent to 4559 M in a randomised study [^116BcmTj]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess whether acetazolamide (Az), used prophylactically for acute mountain sickness (AMS), alters exercise capacity at high altitude.

Methods

Az (500mg daily) or placebo was administered to 20 healthy adults (aged 36 ± 20 years, range 21–77), who were paired for age, sex, AMS susceptibility and weight, in a double-blind, randomised manner. Participants ascended over 5days to 4559m, then exercised to exhaustion on a bicycle ergometer, while recording breath-by-breath gas measurements. Comparisons between groups and matched pairs were done via Mann-Whitney U and Pearson's χ² tests, respectively.

Results

Comparing paired individuals at altitude, those on Az had greater reductions in maximum power output (P max) as a percentage of sea-level values (65 ± 14.1 vs 76.6 ± 7.4 (placebo); P = 0.007), lower VO₂max (20.7 ± 5.2 vs 24.6 ± 5.1mL/kg/min; P < 0.01), smaller changes from rest to P max for VO₂ (9.8 ± 6.2 vs 13.8 ± 4.9mL/kg/min; P = 0.04) and lower heart rate at P max (154 ± 25 vs 167 ± 16, P < 0.01) compared with their placebo-treated partners. Correlational analysis (Pearson's) indicated that with increasing age P max (r = −0.83: P < 0.005) and heart rate at P max (r = −0.71, P = 0.01) reduced more in those taking Az.

Conclusion

Maximum exercise performance at altitude was reduced more in subjects taking Az compared with placebo, particularly in older individuals. The age-related effect may reflect higher tissue concentrations of Az due to reduced renal excretion. Future studies should explore the effectiveness of smaller Az doses (eg, 250mg daily or less) in older individuals to optimise the altitude-Az-exercise relationships.

### Spironolactone does not prevent acute mountain sickness: a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial by SPACE trial group (spironolactone and acetazolamide trial in the prevention of acute mountain sickness group) [^116AgFsr]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Over the last 20 years a number of small trials have reported that spironolactone effectively prevents acute mountain sickness (AMS), but to date there have been no large randomized trials investigating the efficacy of spironolactone in prevention of AMS. Hence, a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of spironolactone in the prevention of AMS.

Methods

Participants were sampled from a diverse population of western trekkers recruited at 4300 m on the Mount Everest base camp approach (Nepal side) en route to the study endpoint at 5000 m. Three hundred and eleven healthy trekkers were enrolled, and 251 completed the trial from October to November 2007. Participants were randomly assigned to receive at least 3 doses of spironolactone 50 mg BID, acetazolamide 250 mg BID, or visually matched placebo. A Lake Louise AMS Score of 3 or more, together with the presence of headache and 1 other symptom, was used to evaluate the incidence and severity of AMS. Secondary outcome measures were blood oxygen content and the incidence and severity of high altitude headache (HAH).

Results

Acetazolamide was more effective than spironolactone in preventing AMS (OR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.12–0.60, p < 0.01). Spironolactone was not significantly different from placebo in the prevention of AMS. AMS incidence for placebo was 20.3%, acetazolamide 10.5%, and spironolactone 29.4%. Oxygen saturation was also significantly increased in the acetazolamide group (83% ± 0.04) vs spironolactone group (80% ± 0.05, p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Spironolactone (50 mg BID) was ineffective in comparison to acetazolamide (250 mg BID) in the prevention of AMS in partially acclimatized western trekkers ascending to 5000 m in the Nepali Himalaya.

Acetazolamide — mechanism of action for altitude illness notes that when taken preventively, acetazolamide hastens acclimatization to high-altitude hypoxia, thereby reducing the occurrence and severity of acute mountain sickness (AMS), and it also enhances recovery if taken after symptoms have developed; the drug works primarily by inducing bicarbonate diuresis and metabolic acidosis, which counteracts the respiratory alkalosis, thereby stimulating ventilation and increasing alveolar and arterial oxygenation, especially during sleep; by using acetazolamide, high-altitude ventilatory acclimatization that normally takes 3–5 days takes only 1 day.

### Acetazolamide: a treatment for chronic mountain sickness [^115ANAi4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Rationale

Chronic mountain sickness or Monge's disease is characterized by an excessive polycythemia in high-altitude dwellers, with a prevalence of 5 to 18% above 3,200 m. To date, no pharmacologic treatment is available.

Objectives

We evaluated the efficacy of acetazolamide in the treatment of chronic mountain sickness and the importance of nocturnal hypoxemia in its pathophysiology.

Methods

A double-blind placebo-controlled study was performed in three groups of patients from Cerro de Pasco, Peru (4,300 m), treated orally for 3 weeks with placebo (n = 10), 250 mg of acetazolamide (n = 10), or 500 mg of acetazolamide (n = 10), daily.

Results

Acetazolamide decreased hematocrit by 7.1% (p < 0.001) and 6.7% (p < 0.001), serum erythropoietin by 67% (p < 0.01) and 50% (p < 0.001), and serum soluble transferrin receptors by 11.1% (p < 0.05) and 3.4% (p < 0.001), and increased serum ferritin by 540% (p < 0.001) and 134% (p < 0.001), for groups treated with 250 and 500 mg of acetazolamide, respectively. Acetazolamide (250 mg) increased nocturnal arterial O₂ saturation by 5% (p < 0.01) and decreased mean nocturnal heart rate by 11% (p < 0.05) and the number of apnea-hypopnea episodes during sleep by 74% (p < 0.05). The decrease in erythropoietin was attributed mainly to the acetazolamide-induced increase in ventilation and arterial O₂ saturation.

Conclusions

Acetazolamide, the first efficient pharmacologic treatment of chronic mountain sickness without adverse effects, reduces hypoventilation, which may be accentuated during sleep, and blunts erythropoiesis. Its low cost may allow wide development with a considerable positive impact on public health in high-altitude regions.

### Effects of acetazolamide combined with remote ischemic preconditioning on risk of acute mountain sickness: a randomized clinical trial [^1129Mp7i]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study provides several novel insights. Firstly, we evaluated a novel and promising strategy for preventing AMS by combining acetazolamide and RIPC. Secondly, we explored the underlying mechanisms of their synergistic action, revealing the co-regulation of PDGF-AB by acetazolamide and RIPC. This discovery provides valuable insights into the physiological mechanisms and preventive strategies of AMS. Furthermore, we identified three genetic polymorphisms of PDGFA strongly associated with both AMS occurrence and intervention responsiveness, enhancing our understanding of AMS-related genes and providing a new framework for assessing risk in rapid-ascent populations.

Our study has several limitations that should be recognized. Firstly, due to inherent differences between the instrument and pharmacological intervention, we were unable to blind the subjects, which may introduce a potential placebo effect. Additionally, the 6-h duration of hypoxic exposure limited the long-term clinical and laboratory assessments. Finally, human trials are inevitably heterogeneous, emphasizing the need to confirm and explore detailed mechanisms using animal models and to conduct clinical trials in real altitude settings.

### Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled comparison of ginkgo biloba and acetazolamide for prevention of acute mountain sickness among himalayan trekkers: the prevention of high altitude illness trial (PHAIT) [^113nj4Lv]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of ginkgo biloba, acetazolamide, and their combination as prophylaxis against acute mountain sickness.

Design

Prospective, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial.

Setting

Approach to Mount Everest base camp in the Nepal Himalayas at 4280 m or 4358 m and study end point at 4928 m during October and November 2002.

Participants

614 healthy western trekkers (487 completed the trial) assigned to receive ginkgo, acetazolamide, combined acetazolamide and ginkgo, or placebo, initially taking at least three or four doses before continued ascent.

Main Outcome Measures

Incidence measured by Lake Louise acute mountain sickness score ≥ 3 with headache and one other symptom. Secondary outcome measures included blood oxygen content, severity of syndrome (Lake Louise scores ≥ 5), incidence of headache, and severity of headache.

Results

Ginkgo was not significantly different from placebo for any outcome; however participants in the acetazolamide group showed significant levels of protection. The incidence of acute mountain sickness was 34% for placebo, 12% for acetazolamide (odds ratio 3.76, 95% confidence interval 1.91 to 7.39, number needed to treat 4), 35% for ginkgo (0.95, 0.56 to 1.62), and 14% for combined ginkgo and acetazolamide (3.04, 1.62 to 5.69). The proportion of patients with increased severity of acute mountain sickness was 18% for placebo, 3% for acetazoalmide (6.46, 2.15 to 19.40, number needed to treat 7), 18% for ginkgo (1, 0.52 to 1.90), and 7% for combined ginkgo and acetazolamide (2.95, 1.30 to 6.70).

Conclusions

When compared with placebo, ginkgo is not effective at preventing acute mountain sickness. Acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily afforded robust protection against symptoms of acute mountain sickness.

High-altitude travel and altitude illness — dexamethasone role and dosing states that dexamethasone is effective for preventing and treating acute mountain sickness (AMS) and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and might prevent high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) as well. Unlike acetazolamide, if discontinued at altitude before acclimatization, mild rebound can occur. Acetazolamide is preferable to prevent AMS while ascending, and dexamethasone generally should be reserved for treatment, usually as an adjunct to descent. The adult dose is 4 mg every 6 hours; rarely is it needed for more than 1–2 days, and there is an increasing trend to use dexamethasone for "summit day" on high peaks to prevent abrupt altitude illness.

High-altitude illness is the collective term for acute mountain sickness (AMS), high-altitude cerebral oedema (HACE), and high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE). The pathophysiology of these syndromes is not completely understood, although studies have substantially contributed to the current understanding of several areas. These areas include the role and potential mechanisms of brain swelling in AMS and HACE, mechanisms accounting for exaggerated pulmonary hypertension in HAPE, and the role of inflammation and alveolar-fluid clearance in HAPE. Only limited information is available about the genetic basis of high-altitude illness, and no clear associations between gene polymorphisms and susceptibility have been discovered. Gradual ascent will always be the best strategy for preventing high-altitude illness, although chemoprophylaxis may be useful in some situations. Despite investigation of other agents, acetazolamide remains the preferred drug for preventing AMS. The next few years are likely to see many advances in the understanding of the causes and management of high-altitude illness.

High altitude cerebral edema (HACE) management — start dexamethasone and supplemental oxygen sufficient to achieve an SpO₂ > 90% when resources allow. In remote areas, initiate descent in any suspected HACE or if AMS symptoms are worsening despite acetazolamide or dexamethasone; if descent is not feasible, use supplemental oxygen or a portable hyperbaric chamber, and persons with HACE should also be started on dexamethasone. Reascent is prudently avoided; if attempted, the individual should be asymptomatic and no longer taking dexamethasone for at least 2 to 3 d before reascent.

Sample size

Sample size was calculated based on previous data. The incidence of AMS at 4000 m altitude without any intervention was about 40%. A study on RIPC for the prevention of AMS showed that a 1-week course of RIPC reduced the incidence of AMS at 3650 m by 25%, from 40 to 30%. In addition, systematic reviews showed that acetazolamide could decrease the incidence of AMS by 47%, which corresponded to an incidence of 21% at 4000 m altitude. Therefore, theoretically, the incidence of AMS after using the combination of the two methods was about 16%. With a 5% significance level and 80% power, the sample size of this study included 50 participants in each group, a total of 250 participants.

Randomization and allocation

Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio via simple random sampling. Each participant drew a small ball from a box that contained identically shaped, sized, and colored balls, which were evenly mixed. Each ball was labeled with a number ranging from 001 to 250. Participants with end number zero or five were assigned to Control group, one or six to Combined group, two or seven to Ripc group, three or eight to Rapid-Ripc group, and four or nine to Acetazolamide group.
