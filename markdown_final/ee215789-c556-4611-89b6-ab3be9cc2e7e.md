## Question

Lyomyosarcoma

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about leiomyosarcoma management, with a focus on explicit stepwise thinking and verification. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and pathologic grading. Then, I should stage the disease and localize it by anatomic site because site dictates prognosis and therapy. Next, I will stratify treatment by stage and resectability, followed by selecting evidence-based systemic options for advanced disease. After that, I should consider special populations such as retroperitoneal, IVC, and superficial LMS. I will also review emerging molecular insights and clinical trials. Finally, I will outline follow-up and synthesize key takeaways with supporting citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and pathologic features because management hinges on accurate histology and grade. Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant smooth muscle tumor defined by cytologic atypia, elevated mitotic activity, and tumor cell necrosis, and immunohistochemistry showing smooth muscle markers such as desmin, SMA, and caldesmon supports the diagnosis while ER/PR should be assessed in uterine cases for prognostic and therapeutic implications, so I need to ensure a percutaneous core needle biopsy from an experienced sarcoma center and central pathology review to avoid misclassification [^1147zjjM] [^111GKQKY] [^1173FrDD].

> Wait, let me verify staging systems because I initially thought FIGO alone suffices, but hold on, both FIGO and AJCC soft tissue sarcoma staging are used and yield different stage distributions. The AJCC system often upstages uterine LMS relative to FIGO, and neither perfectly stratifies risk, so I should explicitly document both and integrate them with tumor size, grade, mitotic index, necrosis, and margins to guide adjuvant discussions and clinical trial eligibility [^117S3Vct].

> I need to check the prognostic impact of site because metastatic risk and long-term outcomes vary. Uterine and retroperitoneal LMS have higher metastatic propensity than extremity LMS, with 10-year metastasis rates around 53–71% for uterine, 58% for abdominal/retroperitoneal, and 31% for extremity disease, so I should incorporate site into counseling and follow-up intensity [^1141TsQr].

> For localized, resectable disease, I should confirm that surgery with negative margins is the cornerstone. In uterine LMS, total hysterectomy without routine lymphadenectomy is standard, with ovarian preservation reasonable in premenopausal patients, and in retroperitoneal/IVC LMS, compartmental or en bloc resection with vascular reconstruction as needed is essential, with a strict margin-negative goal given the primacy of systemic dissemination in LMS [^1173FrDD] [^1147zjjM] [^114VjaMx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adjuvant radiotherapy. I should double-check guideline positions because evidence is mixed, and the highest-quality data do not show overall survival benefit in early-stage uterine LMS, so routine postoperative pelvic RT is not recommended, though it may be considered selectively for high-risk local scenarios such as positive margins, cervical/parametrial involvement, or in retroperitoneal disease when preoperative RT could aid resectability, balancing STRASS-era findings that show no overall benefit in RPS and emphasizing individualized decision-making [^114XAFyR] [^11378vnN] [^112Gt7DN] [^1151i3Lw].

> Let me consider adjuvant chemotherapy carefully because controversy persists. Multiple retrospective series and a meta-analysis fail to show consistent survival benefit in early-stage uterine LMS, and a large NCDB propensity-weighted analysis found no survival advantage and possible harm in low-grade tumors, so I should frame postoperative chemotherapy as investigational and discuss enrollment in trials, reserving consideration for high-risk features via shared decision-making rather than routine use [^113Ssd6t] [^113fDQLr] [^1159SpEU] [^111f4shZ].

> Next, I should review advanced or metastatic disease where systemic therapy is indicated. Single-agent doxorubicin has long been a standard backbone, but wait, I should verify first-line combinations, as the phase 3 LMS-04 trial demonstrated that doxorubicin plus trabectedin followed by trabectedin maintenance significantly improved progression-free and overall survival compared with doxorubicin alone, making this combination a preferred option despite higher hematologic toxicity, while gemcitabine/docetaxel remains an active alternative when anthracyclines are unsuitable [^112Y5Wrg] [^111S4K8r] [^1172owYz] [^111xtA1S].

> I should confirm second-line choices and their relative activity. Eribulin showed a modest OS advantage over dacarbazine in a phase 3 trial across sarcomas, but the LMS subgroup did not demonstrate a significant OS difference, so while it remains an option, expectations should be tempered, whereas trabectedin monotherapy and pazopanib have reproducible activity and are endorsed in guidelines as subsequent-line therapies based on disease control and symptom benefit rather than cure [^112t9udZ] [^116FeknL] [^115djnX3].

> Let me think about immunotherapy because I do not want to overpromise. Unlike carcinomas, uterine LMS has low prevalence of dMMR/MSI-H and has shown poor response to PD-1 blockade in small cohorts, so checkpoint inhibitors should not be offered routinely outside of biomarker-selected trials, reinforcing the need to test for MMR/MSI and TMB when considering ICI exposure [^114DNzNP] [^1115s59L].

> But wait, what if there are isolated lung metastases? I should verify the role of metastasectomy because selected patients with resectable isolated pulmonary disease and good performance status can experience prolonged survival and even cure after complete resection, so pulmonary metastasectomy should be integrated into the treatment plan when feasible alongside systemic therapy and clinical trial options [^113Afd4R] [^115w88y8].

> For retroperitoneal LMS, I should confirm that the surgical goal is complete macroscopic resection with organ preservation when possible, that routine preoperative radiotherapy does not improve abdominal recurrence-free survival in unselected RPS cohorts per STRASS, and that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be considered for high-risk, borderline resectable LMS in ongoing and evolving protocols, all within high-volume sarcoma centers [^1151i3Lw] [^115kY6gn].

> For IVC LMS, let me verify that surgical resection with negative margins, with vascular reconstruction or ligation as indicated, yields the best outcomes in small series, with some centers reporting excellent disease-specific survival after R0 resections, underscoring early referral to experienced vascular surgical teams and the limited role of routine neoadjuvant therapy in the absence of protocolized regimens [^114VjaMx] [^1172vNHP].

> For superficial LMS, I should confirm that Mohs micrographic surgery achieves superior local control compared with conventional wide excision in aggregated series, with markedly lower recurrence rates and no documented distant metastases in pooled reports, making MMS a compelling approach where available [^1156eXfa] [^11356bbA].

> Next, I should review molecular subtyping because it is reshaping prognostication. Lineage-defined LMS subtypes emerge years before diagnosis, dedifferentiated and gynecologic-origin tumors with dystrophin loss carry higher mutation burden and worse survival, and homologous recombination defects are enriched, providing a mechanistic rationale for DNA damage response inhibitors such as PARP inhibitors and PLK4 inhibitors, so I should discuss clinical trial opportunities for HRD-high tumors and advocate comprehensive profiling [^111gnEKz] [^114WxXd7] [^113TVoVG].

> I will now examine follow-up and surveillance because recurrence risk is substantial even in early-stage disease. For FIGO stage I uterine LMS, guideline-concordant surveillance with history, exam, and cross-sectional imaging of chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 3–6 months for 2–3 years, then every 6–12 months for an additional 2 years, with annual imaging thereafter, is appropriate, and in retroperitoneal disease I should maintain a low threshold for imaging given the high systemic failure rate and consider functional assessment of the lower extremities when IVC surgery is performed [^111DBFFn] [^116HVn2m] [^1141TsQr].

> To synthesize, I need to ensure that the treatment paradigm remains site-specific and stage-driven: complete surgical resection with negative margins is foundational. Routine adjuvant radiotherapy is not indicated for early uterine LMS. Adjuvant chemotherapy lacks consistent survival benefit and should be individualized with shared decision-making. First-line systemic therapy for advanced disease should prioritize doxorubicin plus trabectedin with maintenance when feasible based on LMS-04. Enrollment in clinical trials, including those exploring HRD-targeted strategies, should be encouraged given persistent unmet needs and emerging biomarkers [^112Y5Wrg] [^111S4K8r] [^113Ssd6t] [^111gnEKz].

Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a **malignant smooth muscle tumor** [^113S8jt7] that most often arises in the uterus, retroperitoneum, or extremities, and carries a poor prognosis due to aggressive behavior and frequent metastases [^116GbJMz] [^11181mC2]. Diagnosis relies on **histopathology and immunohistochemistry** [^114ffLpi], with molecular subtyping informing prognosis and therapy [^111gnEKz]. Surgery with negative margins is the mainstay for localized disease; adjuvant radiotherapy is not routine for uterine LMS [^11378vnN] [^114XAFyR] [^112Gt7DN], and adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial with no proven survival benefit [^113Ssd6t] [^111GKQKY] [^113fDQLr]. For metastatic disease, **doxorubicin plus trabectedin** is a preferred first-line regimen that improves progression-free and overall survival [^111S4K8r] [^112Y5Wrg] [^117Xwr46]. Immunotherapy has limited activity, and enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged for novel therapies [^114DNzNP] [^1115s59L] [^114KtXrp].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

- **Incidence**: LMS accounts for 10–20% of soft tissue sarcomas, with an annual incidence of approximately 0.4–0.9 per 100,000 women for uterine LMS [^114MYZV2] [^111hZpA2].
- **Demographics**: Most common in adults aged 50–60 years, with a female predominance for uterine LMS [^1173FrDD].
- **Risk factors**: Prior pelvic irradiation, genetic syndromes (e.g. Li-Fraumeni, hereditary retinoblastoma), and possibly tamoxifen exposure [^112Q1aVd].

---

## Clinical presentation

LMS presents with **nonspecific symptoms** that vary by site:

| **Site** | **Common symptoms** |
|-|-|
| Uterine | - Abnormal uterine bleeding <br/> - Pelvic pain <br/> - Rapidly enlarging uterine mass [^1173FrDD] [^116PeuKQ] |
| Retroperitoneal | - Abdominal pain <br/> - Mass <br/> - Early satiety [^notfound] |
| Extremity | - Painless mass <br/> - Occasionally pain or functional impairment [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Imaging

Imaging studies are essential for staging and surgical planning [^1147zjjM]. MRI provides **superior soft-tissue contrast** for local staging, while CT delineates local extent and detects distant metastases, particularly to the lungs and liver [^notfound]. PET-CT is used selectively for equivocal cases or to detect occult metastases [^notfound].

---

### Histopathology and immunohistochemistry

Definitive diagnosis requires **histopathologic confirmation** [^1147zjjM]. Key histologic features include cytologic atypia, a high mitotic index, and tumor cell necrosis [^111GKQKY]. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates smooth muscle differentiation with positivity for desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and h-caldesmon, while ER/PR may be positive in uterine LMS [^1137aUeQ].

---

### Molecular profiling

Molecular subtyping informs prognosis and potential therapeutic targets. LMS exhibits **complex genomes** with frequent alterations in TP53, RB1, PTEN, and ATRX [^111hZpA2]. Three molecular subtypes have been identified — dedifferentiated, conventional, and myxoid — with distinct prognoses [^notfound]. Homologous recombination defects and a "BRCAness" signature are present in a subset, suggesting potential sensitivity to DNA damage response inhibitors [^1141TsQr].

---

## Prognostic factors

Several factors influence **prognosis**:

- **Tumor size**: Larger tumors (> 5 cm) are associated with worse outcomes [^notfound].
- **Grade**: High-grade tumors have higher metastatic potential and poorer survival [^115w88y8].
- **Stage**: Advanced stage (III/IV) significantly reduces survival [^112aBc1Y].
- **Margins**: Positive surgical margins increase recurrence risk [^notfound].
- **Molecular subtype**: Dedifferentiated LMS has worse survival [^114WxXd7].

## Treatment strategies

### Localized disease

#### Surgery

Complete surgical resection with negative margins is the **cornerstone of curative therapy** [^112aBc1Y]. Lymphadenectomy is generally not indicated unless clinically suspicious [^111GKQKY] [^1173FrDD].

---

#### Radiotherapy

Adjuvant radiotherapy is **not routinely recommended** for uterine LMS [^11378vnN] [^114XAFyR] because randomized trials have not demonstrated an overall survival benefit, though it may be considered in select high-risk cases (e.g. positive margins, high-grade tumors) [^112Gt7DN] [^114Y6XWj].

---

#### Chemotherapy

Adjuvant chemotherapy remains **controversial**; randomized trials have not demonstrated a consistent survival benefit, though some retrospective studies suggest potential utility in high-risk patients [^113Ssd6t] [^111f4shZ] [^113fDQLr]. It may be considered in clinical trials or selected high-risk cases through shared decision-making [^117Nm3xu].

---

### Metastatic disease

#### Systemic chemotherapy

Systemic therapy is indicated for metastatic or unresectable LMS. The preferred first-line regimen is **doxorubicin plus trabectedin**, which significantly improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to doxorubicin alone [^111S4K8r] [^112Y5Wrg]. Alternative regimens include gemcitabine/docetaxel, doxorubicin/dacarbazine, and single-agent doxorubicin or trabectedin [^1172owYz] [^115djnX3] [^117Xwr46].

---

#### Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy has **limited activity** in LMS; low prevalence of dMMR/MSI-H and low tumor mutational burden limit efficacy. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab have shown minimal activity in clinical trials [^114DNzNP] [^1115s59L].

---

#### Targeted therapy

Targeted agents such as pazopanib and olaratumab have shown modest activity, but **evidence is limited** and they are not standard first-line options [^114MYZV2] [^115FcsTo].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Regular follow-up is essential due to **high recurrence rates** (50–70%) [^116HVn2m]. Typical surveillance includes clinical examination and cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) every 3–6 months for the first 2–3 years, then annually thereafter [^notfound].

---

## Recent advances and future directions

Recent advances include the identification of **molecular subtypes** and potential therapeutic targets, such as DNA damage response inhibitors for HR-deficient tumors [^111gnEKz] [^114WxXd7]. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating novel agents, including immunotherapies, targeted therapies, and combination regimens [^116GbJMz]. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is being explored as a biomarker for response and prognosis [^114gPjp1].

---

Leiomyosarcoma is an aggressive smooth muscle malignancy with a poor prognosis. Management is **multidisciplinary**, with surgery as the primary treatment for localized disease and systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Recent advances in molecular profiling and targeted therapies offer hope for improved outcomes, but further research and clinical trials are needed [^116GbJMz].

Retroperitoneal leiomyosarcomas have more clearly defined borders, with a low risk for local recurrence after complete resection but have a higher risk for systemic metastasis. Extended resections will not improve oncological outcomes which is dictated by metastatic disease. Surgical strategy should aim for complete resection of the tumour with involved organs and preservation of adjacent uninvolved organs.

Retroperitoneal solitary fibrous tumours (SFT) exhibit a low risk for local recurrence. Although malignant SFTs exist and can be classified post-operatively, the aim of resection should be complete resection with negative margins while preserving uninvolved organs. The activity of radiotherapy in SFT should be considered in the preoperative planning.

Retroperitoneal UPSs of the psoas muscle are usually separated from the retroperitoneum by the psoas fascia and surgery involves removal of the whole psoas muscle and intact tumour with preservation of uninvolved nerves and vessels. Retroperitoneal malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours should be resected with negative margins, and usually involve sacrifice of the nerve of origin.

In a randomised prospective trial of preoperative radiotherapy plus surgery versus surgery alone, preoperative radiotherapy did not improve abdominal recurrence-free survival and overall survival for the whole population of patients. Preoperative radiotherapy was well tolerated, and the additional morbidity associated with preoperative radiotherapy was acceptable. Abdominal recurrence free survival was significant improved in the low-intermediate grade liposarcoma subgroup and preoperative radiotherapy should be discussed with this group. There was no benefit in preoperative radiotherapy for patients with leiomyosarcomas and high-grade tumours.

Postoperative radiotherapy following complete resection is of limited value and associated with significant toxicities and should only be considered in selected cases with a well-defined area at risk for local recurrence. Preoperative chemotherapy for high-grade dedifferentiated liposarcoma and leiomyosarcomas is currently under investigation in a multi-centre prospective randomised study. Preoperative chemotherapy can be considered for chemo-sensitive subtypes such as synovial sarcomas and borderline resectable leiomyosarcoma. The value of adjuvant chemotherapy is not established and cases at high risk for metastatic disease should be individually discussed. The Sarculator nomogram can be used for prognostication.

Systemic therapy for advanced, metastatic/recurrent or inoperable disease — first-line options and LMS-04 findings: If systemic therapy is used for treating high-grade uterine sarcoma, preferred first-line therapy options include single-agent doxorubicin, gemcitabine/docetaxel, doxorubicin/trabectedin for leiomyosarcoma (LMS), doxorubicin/ifosfamide, and doxorubicin/dacarbazine for LMS or ifosfamide-ineligible patients. Doxorubicin is an active single agent for uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) and is less toxic than combination regimens. In the LMS-04 phase 3 randomized trial, median PFS for doxorubicin/trabectedin was longer than doxorubicin alone (12.2 months vs. 6.2 months; HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.29–0.58; P < .0001), and based on these findings, the Panel recommends doxorubicin/trabectedin for patients with LMS.

### Uterine sarcomas – recent progress and future challenges [^117K2aCt]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Uterine sarcomas are a group of rare tumours that provide considerable challenges in their treatment. Radiological diagnosis prior to hysterectomy is difficult, with the diagnosis frequently made post-operatively. Current staging systems have been unsatisfactory, although a new FIGO staging system specifically for uterine sarcomas has now been introduced, and may allow better grouping of patients according to expected prognosis. While the mainstay of treatment of early disease is a total abdominal hysterectomy, it is less clear whether routine oophorectomy or lymphadenectomy is necessary. Adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy may improve local tumour control in high risk patients, but is not associated with an overall survival benefit. Similarly there is no good evidence for the routine use of adjuvant chemotherapy. For advanced leiomyosarcoma, newer chemotherapy agents including gemcitabine and docetaxel, and trabectedin, offer some promise, while hormonal therapies appear to be more useful in endometrial stromal sarcoma. Novel targeted agents are now being introduced for sarcomas, and uterine sarcomas, and show some indications of activity. Non-pharmacological treatments, including surgical metastatectomy, radiofrequency ablation, and CyberKnife(®) radiotherapy, are important additions to systemic therapy for advanced metastatic disease.

### Clinical management of uterine sarcomas [^1137aUeQ]. The Lancet: Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

Malignant pure mesenchymal uterine tumours encompass endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS), uterine leiomyosarcoma, and undifferentiated sarcomas. This Review discusses pathology, preoperative diagnosis, and standard treatment of uterine leiomyosarcoma and low-grade ESS (distinct from undifferentiated uterine sarcomas), with an emphasis on targeted treatment. We show that several features on ultrasonography and MRI can raise suspicion of a uterine sarcoma; however, there are no pathognomonic features on any imaging technique. For both ESS and uterine leiomyosarcoma, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, but without lymphadenectomy, is the standard surgical treatment for early stage disease. The clinical benefit of chemotherapy is limited, which underscores the importance of targeted therapy. ESS and uterine leiomyosarcoma are driven by different pathways, resulting in a different clinical behaviour. ESS typically is a hormone-sensitive tumour with indolent growth. Uterine leiomyosarcoma is notorious for its aggressive growth and poor outcome. Individualisation of treatment is mandatory, because randomised trials are almost non-existent. The progesterone and oestrogen receptors are clinically important targets for most primarily advanced or recurrent ESS and a subset of recurrent uterine leiomyosarcomas. Potential future targets and targeted treatments that are under investigation are presented for both entities.

### Treatment of recurrent metastatic uterine leiomyosarcoma of the spine: a multimodality approach using resection, radiosurgery, and chemotherapy [^1129DfKy]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2015). Low credibility.

The authors describe the case of a patient who initially presented with uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS) that later metastasized to the spine. The patient was treated at another institution for her primary uterine LMS, undergoing resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. After several years of disease remission, the patient presented in January 2011 to the authors' institution with recurrent uterine LMS metastatic to the spine, which has been treated with multiple therapeutic modalities in a combination of surgery, radiosurgery, and chemotherapy. As a result of this approach, the patient has been progression free for 35 months since her presentation (April 2011 to March 2014). We herein describe our experience treating this patient with recurrent uterine LMS of the spine and suggest that patients with recurrent uterine LMSs should be considered for treatment using a multimodality approach with emphasis on enrollment into clinical trials.

### ESGO / EURACAN / GCIG guidelines for the management of patients with uterine sarcomas [^114XAFyR]. International Journal of Gynecological Cancer (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for uterine sarcoma, more specifically with respect to management of leiomyosarcoma, localized disease, adjuvant radiotherapy, ESGO/EURACAN/GCIG 2024 guidelines recommend to do not offer postoperative radiotherapy as the standard of care after hysterectomy in patients with localized leiomyosarcoma.

### Anti-cancer therapy and clinical trial considerations for gynecologic oncology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis [^116EcxUg]. Gynecologic Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Uterine leiomyosarcoma treatment during COVID-19 — There is no proven benefit to adjuvant therapy in early-stage disease, and the combination gemcitabine/docetaxel doublet requires administration on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle with significant hematologic toxicity necessitating granulocyte colony stimulating factors; thus, single agent doxorubicin requires less frequent visits and may represent the best choice to limit visits, and pazopanib is an approved oral option for sarcoma.

### Surgical outcomes of patients with inferior vena cava leiomyosarcoma [^1172vNHP]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding neoadjuvant chemotherapy, doxorubicin-based chemotherapies are the preferred first-line options. They have been shown to improve the time to local and distant recurrence and overall recurrence-free survival for patients with localized, resectable soft tissue sarcoma. The efficacy of radiotherapy, although commonly used as neoadjuvant therapy, is not well-defined in the literature. Currently, no data-driven protocol is available for the treatment of primary IVC leiomyosarcoma. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyze the IVC leiomyosarcoma resections performed at Duke University Hospital to delineate an institutional operative algorithm.

### Uterine leiomyosarcoma: a review of the literature and update on management options [^111GKQKY]. Gynecologic Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Uterine leiomyosarcoma is the most common type of uterine sarcoma. It is an extremely aggressive malignancy associated with a poor overall prognosis. Women affected may vary in age, but are most often diagnosed in their perimenopausal years. Presenting symptoms may be vague and mimic other benign uterine conditions. Preoperative diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma is difficult and often only made at time of surgical resection. These rare mesenchymal tumors are characterized by cytologic atypia, a high mitotic index, and tumor necrosis on histologic inspection. Management of early stage disease entails hysterectomy and complete surgical resection of gross tumor, though routine oophorectomy or lymph node dissection do not appear to confer much clinical benefit. Adjuvant therapy for early stage disease remains controversial as multiple clinical trials have failed to demonstrate benefit on overall survival. Recently, progress has been made in regards to therapy for advanced and recurrent disease. Novel chemotherapeutics, targeted therapies such as olaratumab and pazopanib, and new immunotherapies such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab have demonstrated promise in these previously difficult drug-resistant patients. In this article, we provide a detailed review of uterine leiomyosarcoma including epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and pathologic characteristics. We then go on detail management strategies, including options for adjuvant therapy, and highlight new and developing regimens in the field.

### Inhibition of aberrantly overexpressed polo-like kinase 4 is a potential effective treatment for DNA damage repair-deficient uterine leiomyosarcoma [^113TVoVG]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uterine sarcoma is rare, and uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is the most common subtype. Recurrence after surgical treatment is frequent, even in patients with stage I disease, and conventional adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy are generally ineffective. Recent studies have shown that uterine LMS frequently exhibits genetic alterations in TP53, RB1, ATRX, and PTEN. Although knowledge of these may assist pathologic diagnosis, their contribution to therapy is currently limited to clinical trials or preclinical experiments. Others have reported that a subset of uterine LMS harbors genetic alterations involving the key homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway genes BRCA2, ATR, ATM, CHEK2, and BRCA1 (.), and patients with such tumors have a worse clinical outcome. Therefore, the discovery of new treatment strategies would be valuable.

Uterine sarcomas, particularly uterine LMS, are genomically unstable tumors. Genomic instability may be measured by a HR deficiency (HRD) score. In a study by The Cancer Genome Atlas on DNA damage repair pathway alterations among different malignancies, it was revealed that sarcomas had relatively high HRD scores. Thus, genomically unstable tumors may be more sensitive to DNA damage inducers.

Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) regulates centriole duplication and mitotic progression, and its transcription is tightly coupled to the cell cycle. Dysregulation of PLK4 function causes genomic instability (,–). PLK4 also phosphorylates CDC25C, CHK1, and CHK2, which are signal transducers of DNA repair pathways. The loss of PLK4 in the fibroblasts of patients with Seckel syndrome causes a reduction in phosphorylated CHK1 and CHK2. Thus, PLK4 is closely associated with DNA damage repair.

### Impact of adjuvant treatment and prognostic factors in stage I uterine leiomyosarcoma patients treated in Commission on Cancer ®-accredited facilities [^1159SpEU]. Gynecologic Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Determine the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) and prognostic factors in surgically managed patients with stage I uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULMS).

Methods

Women who underwent hysterectomy and were diagnosed with stage I ULMS between 2010 and 2014 in the National Cancer Database were eligible for this observation study. Inverse probability of treatment weighting based on propensity score was used to balance clinical characteristics between ACT and no ACT patients. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated from Cox modeling.

Results

There were 1059 eligible patients with stage I ULMS including 514 treated with ACT and 545 with no ACT. Patient characteristics and tumor features varied in patients treated with ACT vs. no ACT (P < .0001). Multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that patient age, comorbidity score, tumor size, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) and grade were independent prognostic factors. After propensity score weighting to control for imbalance of prognostic clinical factors, adjusted five-year survival was 61.7% vs. 61.3% and restricted mean survival time was 39.7 vs. 40.6 months for ACT vs. no ACT, respectively. Risk of death in a weighted Cox analysis of overall survival was similar (HR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.85–1.37, P = 0.054) for ACT vs. no ACT patients. Subset analysis demonstrated that survival was similar in ACT vs. no ACT patients categorized by age, tumor size and LVSI or with high grade or ungraded tumors. In contrast, patients with low grade tumors had worse 5-year survival (82.3% vs. 91.5%) and an increased risk of death (HR = 3.79, 95% CI = 1.15–12.40, P = 0.028) following ACT vs. no ACT.

Conclusions

ACT did not improve survival over no ACT in patients with stage I ULMS and was inferior in patients with low grade tumors.

### Eribulin versus dacarbazine in patients with leiomyosarcoma: subgroup analysis from a phase 3, open-label, randomised study [^111SFmRk]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We present the results from a histology-driven subgroup analysis of patients with LMS from a large-scale, prospective, randomised, controlled, phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of eribulin to dacarbazine in previously treated patients with advanced STS of two histologically distinct types: LMS and LPS. The study design was randomised and stratified based on these histological subtypes; however, the study was neither designed nor powered to draw definitive conclusions on the activity of eribulin in histologic subgroups. The phase 3 study was also not designed to be a noninferiority trial.

In this subgroup analysis of patients with LMS, median OS was comparable between patients treated with eribulin versus dacarbazine (HR = 0.93; 95% CI [0.71–1.20]). Secondary outcomes of PFS (HR = 1.07; 95% CI [0.84–1.38]) and ORR (5% vs 7%, respectively) were also comparable between eribulin and dacarbazine treatment groups. Historical data suggest that dacarbazine is more active in LMS than in other sarcomas. In a randomised trial of doxorubicin every 3 weeks versus weekly doxorubicin versus doxorubicin plus dacarbazine for metastatic STS, the combination demonstrated a significant improvement in response rates in patients with LMS compared with doxorubicin alone (44% vs 17% [weekly] vs 20% [every 3 weeks], respectively). That trial included 99 (36%) of 275 evaluable patients with LMS. By comparison, this phase 3 trial enrolled > 300 (309/452; 68%) patients with LMS.

### Leiomiosarcoma-national cancer institute… [^116Lmy54]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

¿Qué es el leiomiosarcoma. El leiomiosarcoma es un tipo de cáncer raro que crece en los músculos lisos. Los músculos lisos se encuentran en los órganos huecos del cuerpo, como los intestinos, el estómago, la vejiga y los vasos sanguíneos. En las mujeres, también hay músculo liso en el útero. Estos músculos funcionan sin que la persona se dé cuenta y participan en la circulación de la sangre, así como en el movimiento de los alimentos y otros materiales por el cuerpo. ¿Es frecuente el leiomiosarcoma. El leiomiosarcoma es un tipo de sarcoma de tejido blando que constituye entre el 10% y el 20% de los casos de sarcoma de tejido blando. Es más común en adultos que en niños. Se calcula que en los Estados Unidos cada año se diagnostican en total solo 20 a 30 casos de leiomiosarcoma en niños, y se presentan unos 6 casos de leiomiosarcoma de útero por cada millón de personas.

Cirugía: Una operación es la mejor opción de tratamiento para el leiomiosarcoma, si se extirpa todo el tumor, es muy posible que se cure. Si quedan algunas células cancerosas, es más probable que el cáncer vuelva en el mismo lugar o en una parte diferente del cuerpo. Radioterapia: Este tratamiento se utiliza con la cirugía. La radiación se dirige al área del tumor para prevenir que reaparezca después de la cirugía. Quimioterapia: Si los tumores del leiomiosarcoma son grandes o las células cancerosas se han diseminado a otras partes del cuerpo, se utiliza quimioterapia con cirugía. ¿Es hereditario el leiomiosarcoma. No. El leiomiosarcoma que se presenta en pacientes que no tienen una afección genética preexistente no parece transmitirse de forma hereditaria. Si se detecta el leiomiosarcoma de manera rápida y se hace una operación para extirpar el tumor, el pronóstico es bueno y es posible recuperarse por completo.

Si el tumor es grande o se ha diseminado a otras partes del cuerpo, el tratamiento es más difícil y el pronóstico no es tan bueno.

### Leiomyosarcoma therapeutic approaches and future directions [^116GbJMz]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Leiomyosarcomas (LMS) are mesenchymal malignancies with smooth muscle differentiation that most commonly arise in the uterus, retroperitoneum, and extremity. Clinical course is variable, and management differs by site of origin. Recently completed and ongoing clinical trials are optimizing LMS management, and multidisciplinary care by an expert team is essential to navigate the nuances and provide optimal care. Advances in molecular characterization have improved diagnosis and identification of novel prognostic factors and systemic therapies. This article provides an overview of LMS presentation, diagnosis, molecular features, and clinical management, and highlights advancements in LMS biology and treatment.

### Leiomyosarcoma of somatic soft tissues [^116sXKLq]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Leiomyosarcoma is a rare, aggressively malignant connective tissue tumor of mature adults, which arises from smooth muscle. It occurs most frequently in the uterus, bowel, vascular tissues, and less commonly in somatic soft tissue or bone. The tumor when it arises in soft tissue has distinctive histologic features which somewhat resemble malignant fibrous histiocytoma (otherwise known as myxofibrosarcoma). The Orthopaedic Oncology Service at our institution has treated 66 patients with these lesions and thus far, 1/2 of the patients have died of disease at a mean of 3 years after discovery. Factors that increase the death rate include size of the tumor, Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Stage of disease, and to a lesser extent particularly in the lower extremities, anatomic site. Radiation and chemotherapy had little direct effect on the outcome but patients treated with surgery and adjunctive agents seemed to live longer than their cohorts treated with surgery alone. The purpose of this study is a general review of the clinical and prognostic features of this cancer.

### Eribulin versus dacarbazine in previously treated patients with advanced liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma: a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial [^112t9udZ]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

A non-randomised, phase 2 study showed activity and tolerability of eribulin in advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma. In this phase 3 study, we aimed to compare overall survival in patients with advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma who received eribulin with that in patients who received dacarbazine (an active control).

Methods

We did this randomised, open-label, phase 3 study across 110 study sites in 22 countries. We enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with intermediate-grade or high-grade advanced liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma who had received at least two previous systemic regimens for advanced disease (including an anthracycline). Using an interactive voice and web response system, an independent statistician randomly assigned (1:1) patients to receive eribulin mesilate (1·4 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8) or dacarbazine (850 mg/m(2), 1000 mg/m(2), or 1200 mg/m(2) [dose dependent on centre and clinician] intravenously on day 1) every 21 days until disease progression. Randomisation was stratified by disease type, geographical region, and number of previous regimens for advanced soft-tissue sarcoma and in blocks of six. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01327885, and is closed to recruitment, but treatment and follow-up continue.

Findings

Between March 10, 2011 and May 22, 2013, we randomly assigned patients to eribulin (n = 228) or dacarbazine (n = 224). Overall survival was significantly improved in patients assigned to eribulin compared with those assigned to dacarbazine (median 13·5 months [95% CI 10·9–15·6] vs 11·5 months [9·6–13·0]; hazard ratio 0·77 [95% CI 0·62–0·95]; p = 0·0169). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 224 (99%) of 226 patients who received eribulin and 218 (97%) of 224 who received dacarbazine. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were more common in patients who received eribulin (152 [67%]) than in those who received dacarbazine (126 [56%]), as were deaths (10 [4%] vs 3 [1%]); one death (in the eribulin group) was considered treatment-related by the investigators.

Interpretation

Overall survival was improved in patients assigned to eribulin compared with those assigned to an active control, suggesting that eribulin could be a treatment option for advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.

In a phase II trial of nivolumab monotherapy for advanced uterine leiomyosarcoma, a cohort of 12 patients had no responses, while the Alliance A091401 trial of nivolumab with or without ipilimumab reported one response in a patient with uterine leiomyosarcoma on combination therapy. Given limited and small-scale data, the role of ICIs "should only be considered based on immune biomarkers (i.e. TMB and/or MMR/MSI)".

### Secondary cytoreduction in the management of recurrent uterine leiomyosarcoma [^1132jSbD]. Gynecologic Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify effective treatment options for patients with recurrent uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS).

Methods

Patients with uterine LMS treated between 1976 and 1999 were identified. Charts were retrospectively reviewed and relevant clinical and pathologic data extracted. Survival curves were generated using the methods of Kaplan and Meier. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional model.

Results

Chart review identified 128 patients with recurrent uterine LMS. The median time to recurrence was 1.3 years. The median disease-specific survival from the time of first recurrence was 1.8 years. Multivariate analysis demonstrated secondary cytoreductive surgery, prolonged time to recurrence and localized recurrence were significantly and independently associated with improved disease-specific survival from time of first recurrence. Neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy was associated with improvement in outcome in patients with recurrent uterine LMS.

Conclusions

These data suggest that secondary cytoreductive surgery is associated with prolonged survival in a select group of patients with recurrent uterine LMS. Patients presenting after a prolonged progression-free interval with an isolated site of recurrence amenable to complete resection are the best candidates for attempted surgical resection. These findings require confirmation from a larger and preferably prospectively gathered database.

### Lineage-defined leiomyosarcoma subtypes emerge years before diagnosis and determine patient survival [^1141TsQr]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a malignant neoplasm of smooth muscle differentiation, which accounts for 10–20% of sarcoma diagnoses. The heterogeneity of its site of origin and clinical course, including the development of metastasis and response to therapy, makes the treatment of LMS particularly challenging. Common sites of presentation include the extremities, the uterus, and the abdomen, the latter of which predominately arises from the retroperitoneum, but also from the viscera. While all LMS, regardless of anatomical origin, differentiate along the smooth muscle lineage, the disease site continues to be used to stratify care pathways. Rates of metastasis at 10 years vary by disease site (31% in extremity, 58% in the abdomen, 53–71% in the uterus). However, it is unknown whether the molecular factors leading to these site-specific survival differences are inherent to the lineage, differentiation status or mutational processes operative in the cells of origin from which the disease develops, or are acquired, involving unique driver gene mutations.

As the primary pattern of failure is the development of metastasis, outcomes for LMS patients have not improved as the overall effectiveness of current systemic treatment remains poor. Recent studies using targeted sequencing and/or RNA-seq have confirmed frequent alterations of TP53, RB1, PTEN, and ATRX, as well as recurrent amplifications of 17p11.2-p12 (MYOCD). One of these studies also suggested that LMS may be sensitive to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition (PARPi) due to acquired mutations in BRCA1 / BRCA2. The " BRCAness " mutational signature was reported in 48/49 (98%) patients in this study. If validated, this would support the use of PARPi in LMS. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) typically yields ~100X more mutations than exome sequencing and therefore, is the preferred approach for validating and refining mutational signature analyses, especially for separating related signatures from each other.

### Contemporary management of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas [^1141hMyf]. Current Oncology Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Management of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas (RP STS) can be very challenging. In contrast to the more common extremity STS, the two predominant histologic subtypes encountered in the retroperitoneum are well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for RP STS. Preoperative planning and anticipation of the need for resection of adjacent organs/structures are critical. The extent of surgery, including the role of compartmental resection, is still controversial. Radiation therapy may be an important adjunct to surgery to provide locoregional disease control; this is currently being evaluated in the preoperative setting in the EORTC STRASS trial. Systemic therapy, tailored to the specific histologic subtype, may also be of benefit for the management of RP STS. Further investigation of novel therapies (e.g., targeted therapies, immunotherapy) is needed. Overall, multi-institutional collaboration is important moving forward, to continue to better understand and optimize management of this disease.

### Comprehensive review of uterine fibroids: developmental origin, pathogenesis, and treatment [^116PeuKQ]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Malignant Transformation of Uterine Fibroids

Uterine leiomyosarcoma is a rare, aggressive, malignant tumor, which originates from the smooth muscle layer in the uterus and shares many common clinical grounds with uterine fibroids. Approximately 6 out of every 1 000 000 women are diagnosed with uterine leiomyosarcoma yearly. Unfortunately, its prognosis is poor, with the lowest survival rates among soft-tissue sarcomas. Uterine leiomyosarcoma represents ~1% of all uterine malignancies, and the average age of patients ranges from 40 to 50 years. Uterine leiomyosarcoma mainly metastasizes to the lungs, liver, brain, kidney, and bones.

Characteristics Common Between Uterine Fibroids and Leiomyosarcoma

Notably, uterine leiomyosarcomas and uterine fibroids share several common clinicopathological features that complicate their differential diagnosis. First, both tumors arise from the myometrium as focal masses within the uterine wall. Second, abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain/pressure, and a pelvic mass are the primary presenting signs and symptoms for both uterine leiomyosarcoma and uterine fibroids, making it difficult to differentiate between them. Third, uterine leiomyosarcoma and fibroids share morphological and molecular characteristics that cannot be differentiated through current clinical diagnostic tests. Finally, it is said that the Black women are at higher risk for both uterine fibroids and leiomyosarcoma. Because suspected uterine fibroids are often conservatively managed or with minimally invasive treatments, the misdiagnosis of leiomyosarcoma for a benign uterine fibroid could potentially result in significant treatment delays, increasing patient morbidity and mortality.

Recurrent or metastatic uterine sarcoma — management by resectability and prior radiation therapy (RT) exposure: The recurrence rate is high in uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) (50%–70%). Local recurrences are classified as recurrence in the vagina/pelvis with imaging negative for distant metastatic disease. In patients without prior RT exposure, the surgical pathway includes the option of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) (category 3 for IORT); preoperative EBRT with (or without) systemic therapy are also options to consider; for residual disease after surgery, EBRT with (or without) brachytherapy with (or without) systemic therapy can be considered; primary RT is an alternative and EBRT should be given along with the option of brachytherapy and systemic therapy, and for both surgical and RT pathways further adjuvant systemic therapy should be considered after initial treatment. In patients with prior RT exposure, options include 1) surgery with the option of IORT with (or without) systemic therapy (category 3 for IORT), 2) systemic therapy, or 3) selected reirradiation with EBRT and/or brachytherapy; a retrospective analysis in ESS suggested cytoreductive resection improved OS in recurrent lesions.

### Eribulin versus dacarbazine in patients with leiomyosarcoma: subgroup analysis from a phase 3, open-label, randomised study [^116FeknL]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This subgroup analysis of a phase 3 study compares outcomes for eribulin versus dacarbazine in patients with leiomyosarcoma.

Methods

Patients ≥ 18 years old with advanced liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma, ECOG PS ≤ 2, and ≥ 2 prior treatment regimens were randomly assigned (1:1) to eribulin mesylate (1.4 mg/m² intravenously on day 1 and day 8) or dacarbazine (either 850, 1000, or 1200 mg/m² intravenously) every 21 days until disease progression. The primary end point was OS; additional end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR).

Results

309 Patients with leiomyosarcoma were included (eribulin, n = 157; dacarbazine, n = 152). Median age was 57 years; 42% of patients had uterine disease and 57% had nonuterine disease. Median OS was 12.7 versus 13.0 months for eribulin versus dacarbazine, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.93 [95% CI 0.71–1.20]; P = 0.57). Median PFS (2.2 vs 2.6 months, HR = 1.07 [95% CI 0.84–1.38]; P = 0.58) and ORR (5% vs 7%) were similar between eribulin- and dacarbazine-treated patients. Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs occurred in 69% of patients receiving eribulin and 59% of patients receiving dacarbazine.

Conclusions

Efficacy of eribulin in patients with leiomyosarcoma was comparable to that of dacarbazine. Both agents had manageable safety profiles.

### Leiomyosarcoma-NCI… [^112Q1aVd]. NCI (2020). Medium credibility.

What is leiomyosarcoma. Leiomyosarcoma, or LMS, is a type of rare cancer that grows in the smooth muscles. The smooth muscles are in the hollow organs of the body, including the intestines, stomach, bladder, and blood vessels. In females, there is also smooth muscle in the uterus. These smooth muscle tissues help move blood, food, and other material through the body and work without you being aware. LMS is an aggressive cancer, which means it can grow quickly. LMS is found most often in the abdomen or in the uterus. Sometimes, LMS may be mistaken for a different type of tumor or condition using imaging scans. A biopsy will confirm the tumor is LMS. Getting the correct diagnosis is very important in order to get the right treatment. How is LMS treated. Treatment for each patient will be unique and depends on the size and location of the tumor. You should go to an expert in LMS treatment to decide the best approach for treating your tumor.

Surgery: The best option for LMS treatment is surgery. If all of the tumor is removed, there is a good chance of LMS being cured. If some cancer cells are left behind, there is a greater chance of the cancer coming back in the same spot, or a different part of the body. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy can be used around the time of surgery. The radiation is aimed at the tumor area to prevent it from growing back after it is removed. Chemotherapy: When the LMS tumors are large, or the cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body, then chemotherapy is used in combination with surgery. Does LMS run in families. No. LMS without an underlying genetic condition is not known to run in families. How does LMS form. It is not known what causes LMS to form. Scientists are always working to understand how cancer forms, but it can be hard to prove. We do know that some genetic conditions are associated with LMS.

These genetic conditions include hereditary retinoblastoma, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, tuberous sclerosis, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, Gardner syndrome, and Werner syndrome. When LMS is identified early and is removed by surgery, prognosis is good and full recovery is likely. When LMS is already large or has spread to other parts of the body, treatment is more difficult and the prognosis is not as good.

### Avoiding treatment of leiomyosarcomas: the role of magnetic resonance in focused ultrasound surgery [^115HGXxh]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report early diagnosis of a uterine leiomyosarcoma during screening for magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) for leiomyomas.

Design

Case report.

Setting

University hospital conducting an institutional review board-approved clinical trial.

Patient(S)

A 47-year-old premenopausal woman with presumed symptomatic leiomyomas for 5 years and minimal interval growth.

Intervention(S)

Magnetic resonance imaging screening protocol used as a routine part of MRgFUS treatment protocol.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Surgical pathology report.

Result(S)

The diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma was suspected at the time of screening, and inadvertent treatment of a leiomyosarcoma was avoided. The patient underwent hysterectomy performed by her referring physician and confirmed the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma.

Conclusion(S)

The possibility of inadvertent treatment of malignant disease and thus delayed diagnosis exists with all non-excisional therapies for uterine leiomyomas. The pretreatment imaging before MRgFUS in this case led to an expedited diagnosis of malignancy. Although this did not lead to a change in prognosis for this patient, careful review of magnetic resonance imaging before MRgFUS may allow early diagnosis for uterine malignancies.

### Uterine sarcoma 2008 [^114KtXrp]. Current Oncology Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Uterine sarcomas are a group of rare and usually aggressive soft tissue cancers. They have a wide range of histologic appearances, from myomatous to osteous to stromal. The three major subtypes of uterine sarcomas (listed in decreasing order of incidence) are carcinosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and endometrial stromal sarcoma. Most patients with uterine sarcomas are middle- to older-aged women who present with abnormal uterine bleeding or pelvic mass, which may be confused with leiomyoma. Surgery — including hysterectomy and resection of disease — serves as the main treatment modality. Adjuvant therapies, including radiation, chemotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy, have limited benefit on overall survival; however, this may be due to the lack of good randomized controlled trials of sufficient size because of uterine sarcomas' rare and aggressive nature. For patients with metastatic recurrent disease, aggressive therapy is limited by low response rates and limited duration of response. For patients with uterine sarcomas, enrollment in clinical trials is strongly encouraged.

### Leiomyosarcoma: current clinical management and future horizons [^1147zjjM]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Leiomyosarcomas are soft tissue tumors that are derived from smooth muscle mainly in the pelvis and retroperitoneum. Percutaneous biopsy is paramount to confirm diagnosis. Imaging is necessary to complete clinical staging. Multimodal treatment should be directed by expert sarcoma multidisciplinary teams that see a critical volume of these rare tumors. Surgery is the mainstay of curative intent treatment; however due to its high metastatic progression, there may be a benefit for neoadjuvant systemic treatment. Adjuvant systemic treatment has no proven disease-free survival, and its main role is in the palliative setting to potentially prolong overall survival.

### A systematic review of the treatment of superficial leiomyosarcoma with mohs micrographic surgery [^1156eXfa]. Dermatologic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Wide local excision (WLE) with 2 to 5 cm margins has been conventionally used for the treatment of superficial leiomyosarcoma (LMS). Because margin control is the strongest predictor of clinical recurrence, many dermatologic surgeons have recently recommended Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) over wide local excision (WLE) as the primary treatment modality.

Objective

To determine the aggregate rate of local recurrence after treatment of superficial LMS with MMS among the few reports in the literature.

Methods

A systematic literature search using the PubMed/MEDLINE database and the Cochrane Library was performed from inception to June 2017. One case report from our institution was included.

Results

A meta-analysis of 14 reports of 48 cases of superficial LMS treated with MMS showed a mean recurrence rate of 2.08% to 6.25% with a mean follow-up period of 1570.9 days, compared to reported recurrence rates of 30% to 50% for WLE. Among these cases there were no reports of distant metastases.

Conclusion

Treatment of superficial leiomyosarcoma with MMS shows markedly lower rates of recurrence compared to reported rates of recurrence after WLE. Further prospective trials with larger sample sizes are needed to compare both modalities.

To determine overall survival and factors associated with survival of women with uterine leiomyosarcoma.

Methods

We performed an observational cohort study of women with uterine leiomyosarcoma (n = 7455) from the 1998–2013 National Cancer Database. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable accelerated failure time survival analyses were performed to investigate predictors of survival. Sensitivity and matched cohort analyses were performed to evaluate the roles of oophorectomy, lymphadenectomy, and chemotherapy in early leiomyosarcoma and chemotherapy in metastatic leiomyosarcoma.

Results

Median (interquartile range) age at diagnosis was 54 (48–63) years. Older age, higher comorbidity, black race, higher stage or grade, larger tumor size, lymph node involvement, metastasis at diagnosis, positive surgical margin, adjuvant chemotherapy, and brachytherapy were independently associated with decreased survival by unmatched cohort analyses. Private insurance was associated with increased survival. By matched cohort analyses, omitting oophorectomy was not associated with survival among women ≤ 51years old at diagnosis (event time ratio (ETR) (95% CI) 1.06 (0.90–1.25), P = 0.48). Omitting lymphadenectomy was not associated with survival (ETR (95% CI) 1.02 (0.94–1.10), P = 0.60). Among women with stage I leiomyosarcoma, adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with increased survival (ETR (95% CI) 0.91 (0.78–1.05), P = 0.18). Chemotherapy was associated with increased survival of women with metastatic leiomyosarcoma (median survival (95% CI) 19.4 (16.4–23.0) versus 10.9 (7.7–14.3) months, ETR (95% CI) 1.66 (1.46–1.90), P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Early and complete resection is the best-evidenced treatment for uterine leiomyosarcoma. Oophorectomy and lymphadenectomy may be safely omitted for clinically uterus-confined leiomyosarcoma. Chemotherapy increases survival of women with metastatic leiomyosarcoma.

### Trabectedin in combination with doxorubicin for first-line treatment of advanced uterine or soft-tissue leiomyosarcoma (LMS-02): a non-randomised, multicentre, phase 2 trial [^111WCbZV]. The Lancet: Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Metastatic leiomyosarcomas of uterine or soft-tissue origin have poor prognosis and moderate chemosensitivity. Trabectedin has shown activity in pretreated leiomyosarcoma. We did a single-group, multicentre, phase 2 trial (LMS-02) to assess the effect of first-line doxorubicin and trabectedin combination on disease control and survival.

Methods

Adults (18 years to physiological age ≤ 70 years) with measurable metastatic or unresectable uterine leiomyosarcoma or soft-tissue leiomyosarcoma who had not received any previous chemotherapy were enrolled at 19 centres in France. Treatment consisted of 60 mg/m(2) intravenous doxorubicin followed by 1·1 mg/m(2) trabectedin in a 3 h intravenous infusion on day 1, both by the central venous route, and 6 mg subcutaneous pegfilgrastim on day 2, repeated every 3 weeks for up to six cycles. Surgery for residual disease was permitted. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving disease control, defined as complete or partial response or stable disease. Stratification was done by anatomical site and analyses were per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02131480.

Findings

Between July 28, 2010, and May 10, 2013, 109 patients were enrolled and treated, of whom 108 were assessable for response: 47 in the uterine leiomyosarcoma group and 61 in the soft-tissue leiomyosarcoma group. 32 (68%) patients in the uterine leiomyosarcoma group and 45 (74%) in the soft-tissue leiomyosarcoma group received all six cycles of treatment. Of 47 patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma, 28 (59·6%, 95% CI 44·3–73·6) achieved a partial response and 13 (27·7%, 15·6–42·6) stable disease; 41 (87·2%, 74·3–95·2) patients achieved disease control. Of 61 patients with soft-tissue leiomyosarcoma, two (3·3%, 95% CI 0·4–11·7) achieved a complete response, 22 (36·1%, 25·0–50·8) had a partial response, and 32 (52·5%, 40·8–67·3) had stable disease; 56 (91·8%, 81·9–97·3) of patients achieved disease control. The most common grade 3–4 treatment-associated adverse events were neutropenia (84 [78%] of 108 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase concentration (42 [39%]), thrombocytopenia (40 [37%]), anaemia (29 [27%]), febrile neutropenia (26 [24%]), and fatigue (21 [19%]).

Interpretation

Despite expected but manageable toxic effects, these results support the activity of doxorubicin plus trabectedin as first-line treatment for uterine leiomyosarcoma and soft-tissue leiomyosarcoma. This combination should be developed further in a phase 3 trial against the present standard of care.

### Does adjuvant chemotherapy improve survival for women with early-stage uterine leiomyosarcoma? [^114bGUwu]. Gynecologic Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine whether adjuvant therapy after primary surgery for treatment of early-stage uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS) improves recurrence and survival rates.

Methods

A multisite, retrospective study of women diagnosed with stage I-II high grade LMS from 1990–2010 was performed. All patients (pts) underwent primary surgery followed by observation (OBS), radiotherapy (RT), or chemotherapy (CT) postoperatively.

Results

One hundred eight patients were identified with long-term follow-up; 94 pts (87.0%) had stage I and 14 (13.0%) had stage II disease. The mean patient age was 55.4 years and mean BMI was 28.0. Thirty-four (31.5%) patients underwent OBS, 35 (32.4%) received RT, and 39 (36.1%) received chemotherapy. After a median follow-up of 41.8 months, a recurrence was diagnosed in 70.8%. Recurrence was evident in 25/34 (73.5%) OBS, 23/35 (65.7%) RT, and 28/39 (71.8%) of CT cohorts and was not different based on treatment (p = 0.413). However, extra-pelvic recurrences were significantly higher in the RT (95.2%) than in the OBS (60%) or CT (64.3%) cohorts (p = 0.012). Additionally, recurrences were more likely to be successfully treated or palliated in those who initially received CT (p = 0.031). On multivariate analysis, stage (p < 0.001) and chemotherapy (p = 0.045) were associated with overall survival.

Conclusions

Women with early-stage, high grade uterine LMS experience high recurrence rates and poor survival outcomes, irrespective of adjuvant therapy. These rates are higher than previously reported in the literature. Although women treated with CT had similar recurrence rates as those treated with OBS or RT, treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy may decrease the risk of extra-pelvic recurrence and improve survival.

### Trabectedin and doxorubicin effective for leiomyosarcoma-NCI… [^1122iMbi]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

But that may soon change, based on the results of a clinical trial conducted in France. The trial showed that adding trabectedin to doxorubicin as an initial treatment for people with a type of sarcoma called leiomyosarcoma helped them live longer than people initially treated with doxorubicin alone: a median of 33 months versus 24 months. But people in the trabectedin plus doxorubicin group lived almost a year longer, she continued, "which argues that the initial response to combination treatment and maintenance was helpful in a way that sequential therapy is not" she said. The combination treatment did come with a spike in side effects, including serious issues that can substantially impact quality of life. But many patients may accept that risk if it can potentially help them live longer, said Robert Benjamin, M. D., of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, another sarcoma expert who was not involved with the study.

But research has indicated that different subtypes of sarcoma may be sensitive to different drugs, suggesting that treatment strategies need to be tailored to each subtype. The combination of doxorubicin and trabectedin had shown promise in small studies of leiomyosarcoma, a tumor that develops in smooth muscle cells. Although it can arise almost anywhere in the body, it's most common in the uterus, abdomen, and pelvis. It took the French Sarcoma Group several years to enroll 150 people into their trial. Participants had been diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma that couldn't be removed surgically or had spread and hadn't yet received any treatment. The researchers randomly assigned about half of the participants to receive up to six cycles of doxorubicin given once every 3 weeks, and the other half to six cycles of doxorubicin plus trabectedin given over the same time frame.

Participants in both groups received medications to prevent the number of blood cells in the body from dropping dangerously low. Of the people who initially got doxorubicin alone, about 38% eventually received trabectedin after their cancer had come back, or relapsed, and 23% received it after a third or later relapse. The six cycles of planned chemotherapy shrank the original or metastatic tumors enough to allow for complete surgical removal in 20% of people who received both doxorubicin and trabectedin, compared with only 8% of those who initially received only doxorubicin.

### Gemcitabine and docetaxel versus doxorubicin as first-line treatment in previously untreated advanced unresectable or metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas (GeDDiS): a randomised controlled phase 3 trial [^111xtA1S]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Gemcitabine and docetaxel was first reported as a treatment for locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma in 2002. Hensley and colleaguesdid a phase 2 study in patients with leiomyosarcoma and reported that 53% of patients achieved an objective response. This study also compared plasma levels of gemcitabine achieved with a 90-min infusion versus a 30-min infusion, and showed that the 90-min infusion was associated with a longer duration of plasma gemcitabine concentrations above 10 μmol/L, which is the threshold for saturation of intracellular accumulation of the active form of the drug, gemcitabine triphosphate. A further retrospective review of gemcitabine and docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease included an in-vitro study to investigate the dosing sequence of gemcitabine and docetaxel, finding that gemcitabine followed by docetaxel was synergistic, whereas docetaxel followed by gemcitabine was antagonistic. Hence, the currently used schedule of gemcitabine and docetaxel in locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma was established. Subsequently, several retrospective studies and phase 2 studies, in both leiomyosarcoma, and unselected soft-tissue sarcoma, have all showed activity of the combination. The observed responsiveness of leiomyosarcoma in particular has led to some clinicians adopting gemcitabine and docetaxel as a first-line treatment option for locally advanced or metastatic leiomyosarcoma, in the absence of evidence from phase 3 trials. With increasing use of the combination in both leiomyosarcoma and locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma, robust evidence is needed to establish the roles of gemcitabine and docetaxel and doxorubicin as first-line treatments for this disease.

The GeDDiS trial aimed to compare the efficacy of gemcitabine and docetaxel versus doxorubicin in the first-line setting for locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma. We also compared toxicity and quality of life for the two regimens to aid clinical decision-making in treatment selection for individual patients. A pharmacogenomics study was also done to investigate the influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on treatment efficacy and toxicity.

### Lineage-defined leiomyosarcoma subtypes emerge years before diagnosis and determine patient survival [^114WxXd7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Leiomyosarcomas (LMS) are genetically heterogeneous tumors differentiating along smooth muscle lines. Currently, LMS treatment is not informed by molecular subtyping and is associated with highly variable survival. While disease site continues to dictate clinical management, the contribution of genetic factors to LMS subtype, origins, and timing are unknown. Here we analyze 70 genomes and 130 transcriptomes of LMS, including multiple tumor regions and paired metastases. Molecular profiling highlight the very early origins of LMS. We uncover three specific subtypes of LMS that likely develop from distinct lineages of smooth muscle cells. Of these, dedifferentiated LMS with high immune infiltration and tumors primarily of gynecological origin harbor genomic dystrophin deletions and/or loss of dystrophin expression, acquire the highest burden of genomic mutation, and are associated with worse survival. Homologous recombination defects lead to genome-wide mutational signatures, and a corresponding sensitivity to PARP trappers and other DNA damage response inhibitors, suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy for LMS. Finally, by phylogenetic reconstruction, we present evidence that clones seeding lethal metastases arise decades prior to LMS diagnosis.

### Prognostic factors and impact of adjuvant chemotherapy for uterine leiomyosarcoma [^117PvskQ]. Gynecologic Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate prognostic factors and impact of adjuvant therapy for uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS).

Methods

All cases with uterine LMS were retrieved from medical registry (1984 through 2003) of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. After excluding cases with initial surgery at outside the hospital, missing chart, and wrong pathologic diagnosis, 51 patients (41 for stage I, 7 for stage III, and 3 for stage IV) met the study criteria. Approximate stratified analysis and Cox proportional hazards model were used to adjust confounding factors.

Results

The median follow-up for survivors was 47 months. Five-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 67.4% and 59.2% for the whole series. Multivariate Cox regression analyses selected age (> 50 versus ≤ 50 years: relative risk [RR], 11.07 [95% CI 1.53–80.34]), tumor size (> 11 versus ≤ 11 cm: RR, 11.63 [95% CI 2.14–63.12]), stage (III and IV versus I: RR, 21.24 [95% CI 2.20–204.98]), and adjuvant chemotherapy (yes versus no: RR, 0.08 [95% CI 0.01–0.81]) as significant predictors of death. Besides, surgical stage (P = 0.021), tumor size (P = 0.005), and adjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.011) were significantly correlated with RFS. After approximate stratification, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy also significantly decreased RR of death.

Conclusions

This is the first report to demonstrate benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for LMS despite the limitation of sample size and its retrospective nature. Prospective multicenter trials are necessary to clarify the role of chemotherapy, selecting criteria, and optimal chemotherapy regimen for uterine LMS.

### Systemic treatment of metastatic / recurrent uterine leiomyosarcoma: a changing paradigm [^115FcsTo]. The Oncologist (2018). Low credibility.

The treatment of metastatic and recurrent uterine leoimyosarcoma (uLMS) has evolved rapidly in the past several years. Leoimyosarcoma is extremely aggressive and responds poorly to traditional chemotherapeutics. Recent regulatory approval of novel treatment options has significantly expanded the therapeutic armamentarium, and the addition of these therapies has challenged clinicians to select and optimally sequence these new compounds. Additionally, the potential role of immunotherapy is being assessed in current uLMS clinical trials. Given the increasing number of agents available both in the U.S. and globally, a treatment template that addresses optimal sequencing based upon expert consensus would be useful. Current guidelines, although listing various options, lack granularity by line of therapy. Most patients with leiomyosarcoma, even in early stage, are treated with surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy despite uLMS being relatively chemoresistant. Adjuvant chemotherapy often includes the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel with or without doxorubicin in first-line systemic therapy, but these cytotoxic agents only provide patients with advanced disease a 5-year survival < 30%. This review will focus on examination of current guidelines and consensus building for optimal sequencing of systemic therapies for advanced or recurrent uLMS. Critical ongoing studies investigating novel approaches including immunotherapeutics and genetic alterations also will be discussed. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Recent regulatory approval of novel treatment options has significantly expanded the therapeutic armamentarium, and the addition of these therapies has challenged clinicians to select and optimally sequence these compounds. This review will focus on examination of current guidelines and consensus building for optimal sequencing of systemic therapies for advanced or recurrent uterine leoimyosarcoma.

### Transcriptome profiling of uterine leiomyosarcomas identifies a leiomyoma-like expression pattern that indicates better survival [^111hZpA2]. BJC Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uterine leiomyosarcomas are rare and highly aggressive cancers with an estimated annual incidence of 0.4–0.9 per 100,000 women. They are associated with poor prognosis due to high recurrence rates and a tendency to metastasize. Stage is the most widely used prognostic factor, but outcomes vary considerably even within stage. Symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain, along with morphological and imaging features, often overlap with those of non-cancerous uterine leiomyomas, complicating early diagnosis. Challenges in preoperative diagnostics in distinguishing leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas may result in hidden malignancy being inadvertently disseminated during surgery. The primary treatment for leiomyosarcoma is hysterectomy, which is usually performed through laparotomy and often accompanied by bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Chemotherapy is utilized for advanced or recurrent leiomyosarcoma, though a complete response is rare. Molecular studies have shown that leiomyosarcomas typically display highly complex genomes and frequent alterations affecting TP53, RB1, PTEN, ATRX, and MED12.

Non-cancerous counterparts of leiomyosarcomas, uterine leiomyomas, are very common tumors affecting 70% of women during reproductive years. One in four women with leiomyomas experience symptoms that significantly impair quality of life. Typical treatment options include myomectomy or hysterectomy. Three well-established driver alterations in leiomyomas are MED12 mutations, chromosomal rearrangements leading to HMGA2 overexpression, and biallelic mutations resulting in FH-deficiency, which together account for 80–90% of the tumors. Recently, two additional rare leiomyoma subtypes have been identified: one characterized by mutations in SRCAP complex genes and another involving mutations in genes related to neddylation. Neddylation is a post-translational modification, where a ubiquitin-like protein, NEDD8, is attached to target proteins, affecting protein stability, activity, or localization. Other recurrent alterations, such as COL4A5 - COL4A6 deletions, 7q deletions, and DEPDC5 mutations, occasionally co-occur with the aforementioned driver alterations. Recent studies have shown that MED12 mutations, the most common leiomyoma alterations, are associated with tumor characteristics such as tumor size and number of tumors, as well as with treatment response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and ulipristal acetate.

### Circulating tumor DNA is associated with response and survival in patients with advanced leiomyosarcoma [^11643NVf]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Over 50% of patients diagnosed with LMS will develop progressive metastatic disease and the prognosis for these patients is poor. Front-line treatment for these patients utilizes one of a small number of accepted chemotherapy regimens designed to improve outcomes. However, the expected objective response rate of treatment with either a doxorubicin- or gemcitabine-based regimen is only 15% to 20% and prolonged disease control is achieved in only 5% to 10% of patients. Furthermore, these agents may have significant toxicities, some associated with cumulative dose and others that are less predictable. Because of an absence of reliable biomarkers that predict which patients are most likely to respond to specific therapies, treatment, typically with either an anthracycline or gemcitabine-based chemotherapy is often offered to patients who recur after primary resection or who present with metastatic disease. Once initiated, therapy often continues until patients experience further progression or after side effects become intolerable. Evaluation of response to therapy is currently measured by radiologic imaging but objective responses typically manifest after four to six cycles of treatment. The absence of prognostic biomarkers and early indicators of treatment response make it challenging for oncologists and patients to decide whether to undergo cytotoxic chemotherapy and to decide how long they should continue therapy before moving on to other regimens or experimental agents. We believe that biomarkers that identify patients who are more likely to respond to chemotherapy or robust measures of treatment response early in therapy would greatly enhance clinical decision making in patients with advanced LMS.

### Comprehensive review of uterine fibroids: developmental origin, pathogenesis, and treatment [^1155xUxc]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Malignant Transformation of Uterine Fibroids to Leiomyosarcomas

It has been debated whether uterine fibroids and uterine leiomyosarcoma are part of a disease continuum. Genetic studies have demonstrated that uterine leiomyosarcomas arise de novo and may be unrelated to benign fibroids. Uterine leiomyosarcoma typically has complex karyotypes and aneuploids, while uterine fibroids have characteristic rearrangements, many of which are shared by other benign neoplasms. Intermediate forms between these 2 patterns had not been described. However, recent microarray data identified a rare subset of uterine fibroids with deletions of chromosome 1 that have transcriptional profiles that cluster with those of uterine leiomyosarcoma, suggesting that some rare leiomyosarcomas may arise from a specific subset of uterine fibroids. Moreover, the observation that up to 4% to 30% of uterine leiomyosarcomas harbor exon 2 mutations in the established fibroids driver gene MED12 suggests that a subset of malignant leiomyosarcomas may derive from benign uterine fibroids. The discrepancy in the frequency of uterine fibroids and uterine leiomyosarcoma lies in the fact that only rare histological and karyotypic variants of fibroids may be responsive to malignant progression. Notably, a large number of random chromosomal aberrations in uterine leiomyosarcoma suggests that genomic instability is involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors, and such instability hinders efforts to identify the primary change(s) that may now be discovered through studies of variant uterine fibroids.

Novel therapeutic advances for the aggressive type of uterine cancer leiomyosarcoma are hindered by the overall lack of knowledge about the functional consequences of the complex genomic and pathway alterations found in patients and limited characterization of tumor biology. The employment of new models together with advanced technologies such as single-cell sequencing, mass cytometry, and other high-throughput approaches will ultimately help to characterize the mechanisms of its pathogenesis, resistance to conventional treatments and develop novel options for treating the patients with this aggressive disease.

### Superficial leiomyosarcoma of the head and neck: case report and review of the literature [^114ffLpi]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Superficial leiomyosarcomas are rare in the head and neck region. Because of the infrequent nature of soft tissue sarcomas in general, superficial leiomyosarcomas are often misdiagnosed on clinical grounds. Immunohistochemistry is essential for an accurate histologic diagnosis, and it should include a broad panel of antibody studies. With respect to differences in clinical appearance and biologic behavior, superficial leiomyosarcomas can be broadly classified as either cutaneous or subcutaneous; local control and overall survival are significantly more favorable in patients with the former. The primary treatment of a leiomyosarcoma is a wide surgical excision with an emphasis on negative margins. Treatment failures are usually attributable to a local recurrence. Systemic metastasis occurs in about one-third of patients with subcutaneous involvement. Although cutaneous leiomyosarcoma is considered a relatively more benign process with minimal metastatic potential, systemic metastasis is still possible. This was demonstrated in our case, as a recurrent cutaneous leiomyosarcoma metastasized to the lung. Proper management requires inclusion of this entity in the differential diagnosis, as well as familiarity with its clinical behavior. In this article, we review the literature on superficial leiomyosarcoma and discuss its epidemiology, presentation, clinical behavior, evaluation, tissue diagnosis, staging, and treatment.

### Primary bronchial leiomyosarcoma: a diagnostic challenge [^112EHi6M]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Bronchial leiomyosarcoma is extremely rare and progresses rapidly. Surgical resection is the preferred first-line treatment and has a significant effect on relieving symptoms and prolonging survival time. Patients who do not undergo surgical treatment exhibit a short survival time. Local radiotherapy can be considered wherever resection is not possible or incomplete. On the contrary, the efficacy of chemotherapy is poor. The cytological examination of this disease is mostly negative. Enhancing the sensitivity of cytological diagnosis helps strengthen the understanding of the disease, which can facilitate earlier pathological biopsy or surgical resection. Collectively, these would enable the patients to receive accurate diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible and help improve the outcomes of patients.

### Surgical outcomes of patients with inferior vena cava leiomyosarcoma [^111wA1Jj]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig 3

Although we favor complete surgical resection for all patients without metastatic disease, there is further potential to consider additional therapies as an additive measure. Many trials aimed at assessing adjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcomas encompass various histologic subtypes, which complicates subtype-specific recommendations. Likewise, the efficacy of radiotherapy for retroperitoneal sarcoma remains elusive. The STRASS (surgery with or without radiation therapy in untreated nonmetastatic retroperitoneal sarcoma) trial, conducted by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, assessed how preoperative radiotherapy combined with surgery compares with surgery alone for patients with primary retroperitoneal sarcoma and found no significant differences in outcomes. Historically, neoadjuvant radiotherapy was given frequently at our institution; however, following the STRASS trial, upfront resection is now our standard practice. In the current series, patients underwent a variety of case-specific neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy regimens. Going forward, some of these patients might be eligible for STRASS II (randomized phase III study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery versus surgery alone for patients with high risk retroperitoneal sarcoma), a trial aimed at investigating the effect of preoperative chemotherapy for patients with high-risk retroperitoneal sarcoma, and, thus, will receive preoperative chemotherapy. As adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies are discovered, combining novel oncologic technologies in tandem with intentional surgical management could potentially improve survival.

Study limitations

The findings of our case series must be considered in the context of several key limitations. First, the present study was descriptive and retrospective. Additionally, the number of patients reported in the case series was small, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. There were no control groups for comparison in terms of outcomes. A promising future area of study would be a multicenter collaboration to gain additional data to inform the best oncologic care for these patients.

### A phase II randomised (calibrated design) study on the activity of the single-agent trabectedin in metastatic or locally relapsed uterine leiomyosarcoma [^112BBrTf]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Uterine leiomyosarcoma [U-LMS] accounts for 1.3% of all uterine malignancies, with an estimated annual incidence of 0.55 per 100,000 women. Literature data report survival rates of ~50% for early-stage disease, – but U-LMS has a great tendency to local and distant recurrence. Although distant relapses involve lungs and upper abdomen, the metastatic potential is very wide and distant lesions can be found everywhere.

Patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis, or with early recurrence after initial treatment, except for a subset of patients with completely resectable disease, have a dismal prognosis and usually their median survival is < 1 year. Chemotherapy is the standard treatment in this clinical setting, wherein there are no curative therapeutic options with the noteworthy exception of surgery for metastases isolated to the lung. – The medical treatment is similar to that used for adult-type soft-tissue sarcoma [STS]s and includes anthracyclines, ifosfamide and dacarbazine both as single agent and in combination regimens.

Single-agent gemcitabine in a phase II Gynecologic Oncology Group trial obtained an objective response [OR] rate of 20.5% among 42 patients with recurrent or persistent U-LMS, most of whom had received prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

In the last decade, the combination of fixed-dose rate infusion of gemcitabine + docetaxel has emerged as a promising option both as first- and second-line treatment of locally unresectable or metastatic U-LMS.

The addition of the human antiplatelet-derived growth factor receptor-α monoclonal antibody olaratumab to doxorubicin achieved a significant improvement of 11.8 months in median overall survival (OS) in a recent phase Ib/II trial including 133 patients with locally advanced or metastatic STSs not previously treated with anthracyclines. Both the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have granted accelerated approval of olaratumab, combined with doxorubicin, as first-line therapy for doxorubicin-naive patients with inoperable STS.

### Expression and role of TYRO3 and AXL as potential therapeutical targets in leiomyosarcoma [^116HeHwo]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a malignant tumour of the smooth muscle cells arising from soft tissues or viscera, including the uterine corpus, more rarely the bone. Leiomyosarcoma represent 15% of adult sarcomas, and gather a heterogeneous group of tumours with different grades and presentation. Most LMS are high-grade sarcomas and exhibit a clinically aggressive behaviour. The metastatic relapse rate following local treatment is ∼40% at 5 years, and cure rate in advanced phase remains very low (< 5%) with current treatment options, including cytotoxics and targeted agents. Cytogenetic analysis and CGH arrays reveal multiple chromosomal rearrangements, with molecular subclassifications emerging. However, no strong driver genetic alteration has been identified so far in these diseases. Cytotoxic and targeted therapies, including pazopanib and trabectedin, prolong progression-free survival, and eribulin improved overall survival. However, the median PFS is close 4 months with these different agents in LMS, with few long-term responders, and no key biomarker has been identified to guide the treatment.

### Novel approaches to treatment of leiomyosarcomas [^116WadAC]. Current Oncology Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas are rare tumors and include subtypes with variable clinical, pathological, and genetic characteristics, including leiomyosarcoma. Current chemotherapy options include the use of doxorubicin, ifosfamide, gemcitabine and docetaxel, and trabectedin, but these have poor response rates in the metastatic setting. While some targeted therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown promise, there is a clear need for novel, targeted strategies for this enigmatic form of soft-tissue sarcoma. The genomic instability and multiple, complex karyotypic abnormalities of leiomyosarcomas is a potential for therapy with agents with proven activity in other cancers with genomic instability, such as BRCA-related breast or ovarian cancer. There are few pathways affected in leiomyosarcoma that suggest obvious opportunities, but poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors hold promise. This article outlines current therapeutic options available and undergoing study, as well as explores the rationale for the study of PARP inhibitors in leiomyosarcomas, with or without chemotherapy.

### Prognostic factors for leiomyosarcoma with isolated metastases to the lungs: impact of metastasectomy [^115w88y8]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Soft tissue sarcomas constitute a heterogeneous group of rare tumors including more than 50 different histologic subtypes. Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is one of the most common histologies, accounting for 5–10% of soft tissue sarcomas. Patients most frequently encounter LMS in the fourth to sixth decades of life. The most frequent sites of primary LMS are the uterus, retroperitoneum, and extremities, but LMS can occur in all body parts.

Despite optimal local therapy, including surgery and radiation in selected cases, metastatic progression is frequent. Metastatic progression is encountered in about 40% of patients during the first 5 years after diagnosis. Typically, LMS spreads hematogenously, and the lung is the most common organ for metastases.

Pulmonary metastases develop in 25% of patients with LMS. In a competing risk analysis including 353 patients with LMS from different organs, predictors for distant recurrence were primary tumor size (> 10 vs. ≤ 10 cm: hazard ratio [HR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–4.6; p = 0.001) and grade (high vs. low: HR 3.9; 95% CI 1.9–7.8; p < 0.001).

In most cases, metastatic LMS is an incurable disease, which usually is treated with first-line doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. Despite the lack of evidence based on randomized clinical trials, pulmonary metastasectomy (PM) usually is offered to selected patients with resectable isolated lung metastases and good performance status. Indeed, PM is the only potentially curative method for patients with lung metastatic sarcoma.

This study examined our isolated lung metastatic LMS cohort and investigated potential prognostic factors.

### Radiation therapy for treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in adults: executive summary of an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^1151i3Lw]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS) randomized evidence — The EORTC STRASS trial randomized patients (N = 266) to preoperative radiotherapy (RT) 5040 cGy followed by surgery versus surgery alone, with the primary outcome abdominal recurrence-free survival and a median follow-up time of 43.1 months; for the entire study population, the trial did not show a statistically significant abdominal recurrence-free survival benefit for the addition of RT, and surgical morbidity was not statistically different between the 2 arms. Three-quarters of STRASS patients had liposarcoma, and exploratory post-hoc analyses suggest preoperative RT might improve the outcome in liposarcoma whereas there did not appear to be a RT benefit for leiomyosarcoma and high-grade RPS; there are sufficient data now available to argue that the routine use of RT in addition to surgery is not warranted.

### A review of treatment of uterine leiomyosarcomas [^114Tzd2c]. Current Oncology Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Uterine leiomyosarcomas are rare but challenging tumours. They occur most commonly around or shortly after the menopause. Their clinical behaviour is very variable, from highly aggressive to very indolent. Most are diagnosed unexpectedly and thus initially operated on by general gynaecologists. This article discusses the important surgical issues and the role of adjuvant treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Important new international trials are opening to address these issues. Relapsed disease is usually incurable, but a subgroup of patients may benefit from repeated surgical procedures, hormones and ablative therapies. The choice of drugs for chemotherapy is discussed. New approaches with targeted agents have yet to establish themselves in treatment of leiomyosarcomas.

### Integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of leiomyosarcoma [^11181mC2]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Leiomyosarcomas (LMS) are malignant tumors of smooth-muscle origin that occur across age groups, accounting for 10% of all soft-tissue sarcomas, and most commonly involve the uterus, retroperitoneum, and large blood vessels. Long-term survival in LMS patients may be achieved through surgical excision and adjuvant radiotherapy. However, local recurrence and/or metastasis develop in approximately 40% of cases. Patients with disseminated LMS are usually incurable, as reflected by a median survival after development of distant metastases of 12 months, and cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally administered with palliative intent.

Cytogenetic studies have shown that LMS are genetically complex, often exhibiting chaotic karyotypes, and no pathognomonic chromosomal rearrangements have been detected. More recent investigations employing microarray technologies and targeted sequencing approaches have provided insight into recurrent genetic features of LMS and associated histopathologic characteristics and clinical outcomes –. However, systematic genome- and transcriptome-wide investigations of LMS using next-generation sequencing technology are lacking, and clinically actionable genetic vulnerabilities remain unknown.

In this study, we have used whole-exome and RNA sequencing to characterize the molecular landscape of LMS. We identify a perturbed tumor suppressor network, widespread genomic instability, and alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) as hallmarks of this disease. Furthermore, our findings uncover genomic imprints of defective homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA double-strand breaks as potential liability of LMS tumors that could be exploited for therapeutic benefit, and provide a map for future studies of additional genetic alterations or deregulated cellular processes as entry points for molecularly targeted interventions.

### Prognostic factors for leiomyosarcoma with isolated metastases to the lungs: impact of metastasectomy [^113Afd4R]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Pulmonary metastasectomy is a safe procedure that can be performed without perioperative mortality for selected patients. Patient selection for PM is at least partially responsible for the improved survival of patients after PM, but our data suggest that the PM procedure itself also might contribute to a survival benefit. Although metastatic LMS is generally considered an incurable disease and most patients with metastatic LMS will experience recurrence despite aggressive treatment including PM, some selected patients could be potentially cured after PM.

### Surgical outcomes of patients with inferior vena cava leiomyosarcoma [^114VjaMx]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: A single-center, retrospective cohort study
- **Key Findings**: A total of 13 patients were analyzed in this study, all of whom were found to have primary inferior vena cava (IVC) leiomyosarcoma and underwent surgical resection. All 13 patients underwent grossly negative tumor resection, with 9 (69%) having microscopically negative margins (R0). The IVCs were managed with ligation in four patients for tumors already occluding the IVC and bovine pericardial patch angioplasty in seven patients or primary repair in two patients for patent IVCs. The 30-day mortality rate was zero. Using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method, disease-specific survival was estimated to be 93%.
- **Take Home Message**: Surgical resection is a feasible and effective oncologic treatment option for patients with IVC leiomyosarcoma with excellent long-term outcomes.

Vascular leiomyosarcomas are rare tumors, primarily arising from the inferior vena cava (IVC) and constituting < 0.001% of adult malignancies. Primary leiomyosarcoma arising from the IVC is a rare, medial, smooth muscle cell-derived malignancy. It appears to affect middle-age women more than other populations. In comparison to other retroperitoneal sarcomas, primary IVC leiomyosarcomas are more aggressive. Primary IVC leiomyosarcomas are also challenging to manage due to their size and location.

Surgical resection with clear margins is the mainstay of treatment of this rare malignancy. Reported case series favor aggressive operative management, informed by the reasonable long-term survival of patients. Dzsinich et alwere one of the first groups to suggest that excision with venous reconstruction could prolong survival for those with this rare malignancy. Hollenbeck et alreported the largest case series to date with 25 patients and showed that surgical resection is feasible and associated with improved survival. A series by Mingoli et alindicated that extended venous resection, including either retroperitoneal tissue or vena cava to achieve grossly negative margins, of IVC leiomyosarcoma does not affect the local recurrence rate or long-term outcomes. However, it remains that most individuals diagnosed with unresectable metastatic leiomyosarcoma are usually deemed incurable, with the predominant management being palliative with the aim of reducing the tumor burden, alleviating symptoms, and enhancing quality of life.

### Retrospective review of 208 patients with leiomyosarcoma of the uterus: prognostic indicators, surgical management, and adjuvant therapy [^113tFjvQ]. Gynecologic Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

We evaluated the predictive value of several proposed prognostic indicators and the effect of surgical management and adjuvant therapy on clinical outcome associated with leiomyosarcoma (LMS) of the uterus.

Methods

A medical record search of patients treated at Mayo Clinic from 1976 through 1999 was performed using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for LMS and malignant neoplasm of the uterus. Study inclusion criteria included confirmation of the diagnosis of LMS of the uterus by a pathologist at our institution. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. A case-control investigation was also performed.

Results

A total of 208 patients met study requirements. The median follow-up for survivors was 7.7 years. Multivariate analysis showed that high grade, advanced stage, and oophorectomy were associated with significantly worse disease-specific survival. Case-control investigations suggested that ovarian preservation does not adversely affect survival and that adjuvant pelvic radiation therapy does not significantly improve survival. An LMS risk-assessment index that was generated is highly predictive of survival.

Conclusion

Tumor grade and stage (using modified criteria for endometrial cancer) appear to be valid prognostic indicators for LMS of the uterus. Ovarian preservation may be considered in premenopausal patients with early-stage leiomyosarcoma of the uterus. Additionally, adjuvant therapy does not appear to significantly affect survival. Finally, our highly predictive LMS risk-assessment index may be useful for counseling patients.

### Doxorubicin-trabectedin with trabectedin maintenance in leiomyosarcoma [^112Y5Wrg]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

The addition of trabectedin to doxorubicin, followed by trabectedin maintenance, may have superior efficacy to doxorubicin alone as first-line treatment in patients with advanced leiomyosarcoma.

Methods

We conducted a phase 3 trial involving patients with metastatic or unresectable leiomyosarcoma who had not received chemotherapy previously. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either single-agent doxorubicin (six cycles) or doxorubicin plus trabectedin (six cycles), with continued trabectedin as maintenance therapy in patients in the doxorubicin-trabectedin group who did not have disease progression. Surgery to resect residual disease was allowed in each group after six cycles of therapy. Analyses of progression-free survival (primary end point) and overall survival (secondary end point) were adjusted for two stratification factors: tumor origin site (uterine vs. soft tissue) and disease stage (locally advanced vs. metastatic). The primary end-point results were reported previously.

Results

A total of 150 patients underwent randomization. At a median follow-up of 55 months (interquartile range, 49 to 63), a total of 107 patients had died (47 in the doxorubicin-trabectedin group and 60 in the doxorubicin group). The median overall survival was longer in the doxorubicin-trabectedin group (33 months; 95% confidence interval [CI] 26 to 48) than in the doxorubicin group (24 months; 95% CI, 19 to 31); the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.44 to 0.95). In a finding consistent with earlier reports, progression-free survival was longer in the doxorubicin-trabectedin group (12 months; 95% CI, 10 to 16) than in the doxorubicin group (6 months; 95% CI, 4 to 7); the adjusted hazard ratio for progression or death was 0.37 (95% CI, 0.26 to 0.53). The incidence of adverse events and the percentage of patients with dose reductions were higher with doxorubicin plus trabectedin than with doxorubicin alone.

Conclusions

Combination therapy with doxorubicin and trabectedin induction, followed by trabectedin maintenance, was associated with improved overall survival and progression-free survival, as compared with doxorubicin alone, among patients with metastatic or surgically unresectable uterine or soft-tissue leiomyosarcoma.

High-grade uterine sarcomas — adjuvant radiotherapy (RT): The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in nonmetastatic disease is controversial, and most retrospective studies suggest local pelvic control benefit without consistent overall survival (OS) improvement; a phase III trial in stage I–II uterine sarcomas reported no OS improvement for uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) with postoperative pelvic RT versus observation. Therefore, routine postoperative RT is not recommended for stage I uLMS and undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (UUS), and if used in more advanced stages adjuvant RT needs to be individualized based on surgical pathologic findings.

### Gemcitabine and docetaxel versus doxorubicin as first-line treatment in previously untreated advanced unresectable or metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas (GeDDiS): a randomised controlled phase 3 trial [^114VL7BK]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Since the first published studyof gemcitabine and docetaxel, which was confined to patients with leiomyosarcoma, some clinicians have assumed that the combination is more active in leiomyosarcoma and uterine leiomyosarcoma than in other histological subtypes. Indeed, several studies, have restricted the use of gemcitabine and docetaxel to leiomyosarcoma and uterine leiomyosarcoma. However, the results of the GeDDiS trial refute these claims of superior activity in particular histological subtypes of locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma versus others, since our results show no evidence that treatment effect was influenced by histological subtype. We did planned subgroup analyses to investigate whether patients with either leiomyosarcoma or uterine leiomyosarcoma responded better to gemcitabine and docetaxel than other soft-tissue sarcoma histological subtypes, but found no indication of a superior response to gemcitabine and docetaxel in either of these subgroups.

### Patterns of care and outcomes of patients with METAstatic soft tissue SARComa in a real-life setting: the METASARC observational study [^111XZ8Pa]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Well-designed observational studies of individuals with rare tumors are needed to improve patient care, clinical investigations, and the education of healthcare professionals.

Methods

The patterns of care, outcomes, and prognostic factors of a cohort of 2225 patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcomas who were diagnosed between 1990 and 2013 and documented in the prospectively maintained database of the French Sarcoma Group were analyzed.

Results

The median number of systemic treatments was 3 (range, 1–6); 27% of the patients did not receive any systemic treatment and 1054 (49%) patients underwent locoregional treatment of the metastasis. Half of the patients who underwent chemotherapy (n = 810) received an off-label drug. Leiomyosarcoma was associated with a significantly better outcome than the other histological subtypes. With the exception of leiomyosarcomas, the benefit of a greater than third-line regimen was very limited, with a median time to next treatment (TNT) and overall survival (OS) ranging between 2.3 and 3.7 months and 5.4 and 8.5 months, respectively. The TNT was highly correlated with OS. Female sex, leiomyosarcoma histology, locoregional treatment of metastases, inclusion in a clinical trial, and treatment with first-line polychemotherapy were significantly associated with improved OS in the multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

The combination of doxorubicin with a second drug, such as ifosfamide, represents a valid option, particularly when tumor shrinkage is expected to provide clinical benefits. After failure of the second-line therapy, best supportive care should be considered, particularly in patients with non-leiomyosarcoma histology who are not eligible to participate in a clinical trial. Locoregional treatment of metastasis should always be included in the therapeutic strategy when feasible. TNT may represent a useful surrogate endpoint for OS in clinical studies.

### The treatment of uterine leiomyosarcoma. results from a 10-year experience (1990–1999) at the Massachusetts general hospital [^115S7tAJ]. Gynecologic Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Uterine leiomyosarcomas (LMS) are rare tumors with a poor prognosis. The purpose of this study is to review the presentation, therapy and outcome of patients with leiomyosarcoma originating from the uterus treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital from 1990 to 1999.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was done to patients treated for uterine leiomyosarcoma during the study period. One author reviewed all available histologic specimens. Statistical analysis was done to determine whether there is an association between histologic criteria or therapy used and overall survival.

Results

Forty-seven charts were reviewed to identify 27 patients with leiomyosarcoma arising from the uterus treated in the decade from 1990 to 1999. Most patients received multimodality therapy with surgery followed by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Patients who had no visible disease at the conclusion of primary surgery had a better overall survival than patients who did not achieve surgical remission (P < 0.0003). There is a trend toward improved survival in patients with lower number of mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields (P = 0. 062). Current chemotherapy drugs were minimally effective with 80% of treated patients having progression of disease. Adjuvant therapy after optimal cytoreduction does not decrease the rate of recurrence.

Conclusion

Uterine leiomyosarcoma continues to be a deadly disease. Aggressive surgical cytoreduction at the time of initial diagnosis offers the possibility of prolonged survival or cure.

### Doxorubicin alone versus doxorubicin with trabectedin followed by trabectedin alone as first-line therapy for metastatic or unresectable leiomyosarcoma (LMS-04): a randomised, multicentre, open-label phase 3 trial [^111S4K8r]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Metastatic leiomyosarcomas have a poor prognosis, and currently doxorubicin alone is used as the standard first-line treatment. Doxorubicin combined with trabectedin has shown promising results in phase 1 and 2 studies. We aimed to identify and compare the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic or unresectable uterine or soft tissue leiomyosarcoma treated with doxorubicin and trabectedin combined as first-line therapy versus doxorubicin alone in a phase 3 trial.

Methods

LMS-04 was a randomised, multicentre, open-label, superiority phase 3 trial, which included patients from 20 centres of the French Sarcoma Group (anticancer centers or hospitals with an oncological unit) in France. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–1, and had metastatic or relapsed unresectable leiomyosarcomas that had not previously been treated with chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), by means of an interactive web response system (permuted blocks of different sizes from two to six), to receive either intravenous doxorubicin alone (75 mg/m 2) once every 3 weeks for up to six cycles or of intravenous doxorubicin (60 mg/m 2) plus intravenous trabectedin (1·1 mg/m 2) once every 3 weeks up to six cycles followed by maintenance with trabectedin alone. Surgery for residual disease was allowed in both groups after six cycles of treatment. Randomisation was stratified by tumour location (uterine vs soft tissue) and disease (locally advanced vs metastatic). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by blinded independent central review and according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 1.1 criteria. Efficacy analyses were performed on all randomly assigned patients, based on the intention-to-treat principle. The safety population included all randomly assigned patients who received at least one cycle of treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02997358, and is closed to enrolment.

Findings

Between Jan 18, 2017, and March 21, 2019, 150 patients were enrolled (67 with uterine leiomyosarcomas and 83 with soft tissue leiomyosarcomas) and included in the intention-to-treat population: 76 in the doxorubicin alone group and 74 in the doxorubicin plus trabectedin group. The median duration of follow-up was 36·9 months (IQR 30·0–43·2) in the doxorubicine group and 38·8 months (32·7–44·2) in the doxorubicin plus trabectedin group. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer with doxorubicin plus trabectedin versus doxorubicin alone (12·2 months [95% CI 10·1–15·6] vs 6·2 months [4·1–7·1]; adjusted hazard ratio 0·41 [95% CI 0·29–0·58]; p < 0·0001). The most common grade 3–4 adverse events were neutropenia (ten [13%] of 75 patients in the doxorubicin alone group vs 59 [80%] in the doxorubicin plus trabectedin group), anaemia (four [5%] vs 23 [31%]), thrombocytopenia (0 vs 35 [47%]), and febrile neutropenia (seven [9%] vs 21 [28%]). Nine (12%) patients in the doxorubicin alone group and 15 (201%) patients in the doxorubicin plus trabectedin group has serious adverse events. There was only one treatment-related death, reported in the doxorubicin alone group (cardiac failure).

Interpretation

Doxorubicin plus trabectedin in first-line therapy was found to significantly increase progression-free survival in patients with metastatic or unresectable leiomyosarcomas compared with doxorubicin alone, despite a higher but manageable toxicity, and could be considered an option for the first-line treatment of metastatic leiomyosarcomas.

### Stage-specific outcomes of patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma: a comparison of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics and American joint committee on cancer staging systems [^117S3Vct]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is staged by the modified International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system for uterine cancer. We aimed to determine whether the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) soft tissue sarcoma (STS) staging system is more accurate in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

Patients and Methods

Patients with uterine LMS who presented at our institution from 1982 to 2005 were staged retrospectively according to a modified FIGO staging system and the AJCC STS staging system. The predictive accuracy of the two staging systems was compared using concordance estimation.

Results

Two hundred nineteen patients had sufficient clinical and pathologic information to be staged under both systems; 132 patients were upstaged using the AJCC staging system, whereas only four were downstaged. Stage-specific PFS and OS rates for stages I, II, and III differed substantially between the two staging systems. In both systems, there was prognostic overlap between stages II and III. Thus, despite the marked stage-specific differences in 5-year PFS and OS rates for stages I, II, and III, both systems had similar concordance indices.

Conclusion

Estimates of stage-specific PFS and OS for uterine LMS were altered substantially when using the AJCC versus FIGO staging system. Adjuvant treatment strategies should be tested in patients at substantial risk for disease progression and death. Neither the FIGO nor AJCC staging system is ideal for identifying such patients, suggesting a need for a uterine LMS-specific staging system to better target patients for trials of adjuvant therapies.

### Eribulin versus dacarbazine in patients with leiomyosarcoma: subgroup analysis from a phase 3, open-label, randomised study [^116cwN82]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Efficacy

In patients with LMS, the median OS was 12.7 vs 13.0 months for eribulin and dacarbazine, respectively (HR = 0.93 [95% CI 0.71–1.20]; P = 0.57) (Fig. 1a, b). HRs for OS favoured eribulin treatment, but were not statistically different from dacarbazine treatment, in patients with LMS who had > 2 prior chemotherapy treatments for advanced disease, had nonuterine disease, had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, were enrolled in geographic region 1 (North America) or geographic region 3 (Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia), or were male (Fig. 1b). Median OS for patients with uterine LMS was 9.4 versus 12.3 months for eribulin and dacarbazine, respectively, which was not statistically significantly different (HR = 1.25 [95% CI 0.83–1.87]) (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 2a). For patients with nonuterine disease, median OS was 14.4 versus 13.2 months for eribulin and dacarbazine, respectively, again not statistically significantly different (HR = 0.77 [95% CI 0.54–1.09]) (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 2a). Male patients treated with eribulin had numerically longer OS compared with male patients taking dacarbazine (14.2 vs 9.7 months, respectively) (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 3a), but this difference was not statistically significant.

### Leiomyosarcoma of the skin: clinical, histopathologic, and prognostic factors that influence outcomes [^11356bbA]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Superficial leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a rare tumor with important clinical, pathologic, and treatment features. Previous LMS studies have included few patients, included minimal follow-up, and typically combined the superficial and subfascial (deep) forms.

Objective

We sought to characterize clinical features, effectiveness of treatment approaches, and long-term outcomes for LMS stratified by depth of invasion.

Methods

In all, 71 cases of primary superficial LMS, 48 dermal and 23 subcutaneous (mean follow-up of 8 years), were examined and clinical, histopathologic, and treatment factors reported.

Results

Tumor size and subcutaneous classification correlated with greater likelihood of metastasis and death at 5 years. When superficial LMS metastasizes, other skin sites are the most common distant location. Treatment with wide local excision with minimum 1-cm margins showed statistically lower rates of recurrences and metastasis compared with excision with narrow surgical margins. Fourteen cases of Mohs micrographic surgery had no recurrences or metastases. Five cases of dermal LMS metastasized, 2 of which resulted in death.

Limitations

This study is a retrospective review of a relatively small number of patients.

Conclusion

LMS can metastasize and warrants surgical intervention and long-term follow-up. Wide local excision, and Mohs micrographic surgery in particular, appear to provide the best management approach for definitive treatment.

Histology may indicate response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, as patients with advanced uterine leiomyosarcoma do not respond to nivolumab, with a median PFS of only 1.8 months. It is hypothesized that the tumor microenvironment contributes a significant role in this response. Despite pembrolizumab's efficacy in trials, a phase II trial demonstrated minimal efficacy of pembrolizumab with metronomic cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced STS: LMS, UPS, and GIST. There was an increased presence of M2 macrophages that expressed the inhibitory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which can play a role in resistance to immunotherapy.

On July 2016, literature was searched in order to identify trials comparing different postoperative adjuvant strategies for patients diagnosed with early stage uterine leiomyosarcoma.

Results

Our analysis included 360 patients: 145 (40%), 53 (15%), and 155 (43%) had chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy), radiotherapy, and observation, respectively. Seven (2%) patients who had radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy were excluded from further analysis in order to reduce risk of biases. Administration of chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy) did not improve outcomes in comparison to observation (OR: 0.79 (95%CI: 0.48, 1.29)), or radiotherapy (OR: 0.90 (95%CI: 0.42, 1.94)). Loco-regional recurrence rate was similar comparing patients undergoing chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy) with having observation alone (OR: 0.84 (95%CI: 0.44, 1.60)). Similarly, pooled results suggested that chemotherapy administration did not affect distant recurrence rate in comparison to no chemotherapy (OR: 0.80 (95%CI: 0.50, 1.28)), and observation alone (OR: 0.99 (95%CI: 0.60, 1.64)). However, patients undergoing chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy) experienced a trend towards lower risk of developing distant recurrences (OR: 0.49 (95%CI: 0.24, 1.03)) and a higher risk of developing loco-regional recurrences (OR: 3.45 (95%CI: 1.02, 11.73)) than patients undergoing radiotherapy.

Conclusions

In early stage uterine leiomyosarcoma, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy remains unclear. Owing to the high recurrence rate, even in the early stage of disease, further innovative therapeutic strategies have to be tested.

There was an improvement in PFS and PFS rates observed with the combination arm in the 21-patient leiomyosarcoma cohort; all patients in this cohort had 1 or 2 prior treatments. In a European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer analysis of phase 2 trials for advanced sarcomas, the 3- and 6- month PFS rates for pretreated STS patients receiving an active agent were 39% and 14%, respectively. For second-line therapy, a 3-month PFS of ⩾40% was suggested as a benchmark for drug activity. In the leiomyosarcoma cohort of the current study, a 3-month PFS of 50% (95% CI 19–81) was observed, which suggests clinically meaningful activity in this group. In the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer phase 2 study of pazopanib, the 3-month PFS rate was 44% for the 41 patients in the leiomyosarcoma cohort, for which 76% received prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. Although our results compare favourably with these outcomes, this is only based on a 21-patient subgroup analysis.

In leiomyosarcomas, the Akt/mTOR pathway has been shown to be activated and associated with worse prognosis.reported over 70% of primary leiomyosarcoma tumours demonstrated phosphorylated forms of Akt, mTOR, ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1). Interestingly, PTEN expression was lost in only 20% of the tumours, and mutational analysis failed to reveal any PIK3CA or AKT1 mutations. Also consistent with those findings, absence of genetic alterations in the AKT1, PI3K, PTEN, and EGFR genes in leiomyosarcoma stem-like cells was reported, whereas proteins downstream of the PI3/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways were strongly activated. The PTEN gene is located on chromosome 10q, and partial loss of 10q is also a frequent event in leiomyosarcomas. Mice with smooth muscle lineage-specific knockout of PTEN also develop widespread smooth muscle cell hyperplasia and abdominal leiomyosarcomas, significantly implicating PTEN downregulation in leiomyosarcomagenesis. KRAS mutations can also activate the Akt/mTOR pathway, and KRAS mutations have been reported in a subset (7–33%) of leiomyosarcoma patients; MEK inhibitors act downstream of RAS in the MAPK pathway. These results may explain the relative sensitivity of leiomyosarcoma to the combination of temsirolimus and selumetinib as compared with selumetinib alone in this study.

Background

Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) consist of a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tumours and comprise numerous histologically distinct subtypes that affect various primary sites. As a group, STS types are rare, with an incidence rate of 3–5 cases per 100,000 persons per year. Liposarcoma (LPS) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS) are two of the more frequently observed sarcoma subtypes, both of which are further categorised based on distinctive clinical and pathologic features. – LMS represents ~20% of STS cases and forms in smooth muscle, most often in the branches of large veins such as the inferior vena cava, or in the uterus.

Patients with metastatic STS have a poor prognosis, with disease-specific survival rates at 5 years of ~15%. For unresectable or metastatic disease, anthracycline-based chemotherapy is the recommended first-line treatment, with variations in practice between use of doxorubicin as a single agent or in combination with other agents (typically with olaratumab, ifosfamide, or dacarbazine). – Dacarbazine has shown single-agent activity and improved efficacy in combination with doxorubicin in patients with LMS. In a randomised phase 1b/2 trial in anthracycline-naive patients with advanced STS, the combination of doxorubicin and olaratumab significantly improved overall survival (OS) compared with doxorubicin alone. Results of the confirmatory phase 3 trial are pending.

Several treatment options, including ifosfamide, trabectedin, and pazopanib, are available for second- or later-line therapy for STS (excluding LPS). – Although not approved for sarcoma, gemcitabine, alone or in combination with either docetaxel or dacarbazine, has demonstrated activity as second-line therapy in STS and is frequently used in clinical practice. In recent years, subtype-specific sensitivity to drugs has become more apparent and several trials have focused on patient populations with specific STS subtypes. Differing sensitivity between sarcoma subtypes has been observed with other agents, for example, myxoid round cell LPS is particularly sensitive to treatment with trabectedin. Recent data suggest that there are different molecular subtypes in LMS and that these subtypes are associated with distinct clinical outcomes. This finding suggests potential treatment of LMS using a more targeted approach.

### Circulating tumor DNA is associated with response and survival in patients with advanced leiomyosarcoma [^114gPjp1]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Translational Relevance

In this study, we found that patients with advanced leiomyosarcoma (LMS) who had high levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) prior to the start of treatment and after receiving two cycles of chemotherapy had a significantly worse overall survival than patients with low ctDNA. Furthermore, patients with low ctDNA were significantly more likely to experience an objective response with additional cycles of chemotherapy. These studies demonstrate that ctDNA can be used for risk stratification in future clinical trials for patients with LMS and by providers and their patients to decide on the utility of treatment, with chemotherapy known to bear a significant risk of toxicity.

Calibration arm — gemcitabine + docetaxel

Overall, 42 patients were randomised in the calibration arm. Three patients were excluded from all the analysis populations due to protocol major violations. All patients started the treatment, but one patient underwent only one cycle of chemotherapy, therefore 39 and 38 patients were included in the safety and in the PP population, respectively. Finally, 5 patients were excluded from primary end-point analysis because they had the 6-month tumour assessment outside the correct time frame, as described in the statistical analysis paragraph.

Median age of patients was 55 (range: 33–72) and 52 (range: 32–72) years at study entry and at first diagnosis, respectively. As for the trabectedin group, the disease had already spread to distant sites in about the 90% of patients, with lung as the most frequent localisation (52.6%). Further details of tumour characteristics at first diagnosis and baseline are shown in supplementary Tables 1 and 2. In patients who interrupted the treatment because of disease progression a median number of 3 doses of gemcitabine + docetaxel (IQR: 2.5–6; range: 2–13) was administered. When disease progression was not the cause of treatment interruption, the median number of cycles in the calibration arm was 7 (IQR: 6–8; range: 1–16).

In the PP population, a CR or PR was observed in 5 (13.2%) and 6 (15.8%) patients, respectively. Fifteen (39.5%) patients reached a SD and 12 (31.6%) progressed. Out of 33 patients evaluable for primary analysis, 16 (48.5%) progressed, no one died and 17 were alive and progression-free after 6 months from the study entry, therefore the PFS-6 was 51.5% (95% CI: 33.5–69.2). After a median follow-up of 29 months, 34 (89.5%) patients had progressed or died and 16 (42.1%) patients died. Median PFS was 6.9 months (IQR: 2.4–15.4) and median OS was 36.7 months (first quartile equal to 13.7, third quartile not reached).

Uterine leiomyosarcoma

Uterine LMS, a cancer of the smooth muscle, accounts for 35–40% of all uterine sarcomas; LMS predominantly affects patients aged 50–60 years. Pre-operatively it is difficult to differentiate benign leiomyomas from malignant LM. However, there are a number of red flags which increase the risk of inadvertent dissemination of a LMS during surgery, especially if morcellation is used, such as post-menopausal bleeding, rapid enlargement, failure to respond to oestrogen deprivation in a pre-menopausal woman and certain imaging features, such as increased vascularity. These are detailed and referenced in consent advice from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologist. Laparoscopic morcellation is contraindicated for uterine sarcoma due to higher risk of recurrence and metastasis. Standard surgical management for non-metastatic disease is total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). Retention of the ovaries can be considered in pre-menopausal women. Routine lymphadenectomy is not required, as lymph node involvement is less than 5%. Adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy for FIGO stage I and II disease is not recommended. Adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy may be considered for selected high-risk cases, for example with serosal breach, parametrial involvement, where local relapse may be reduced, although a survival benefit has not been demonstrated. Adjuvant chemotherapy is not routinely recommended due to lack of supportive evidence. Chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease is as for STS at other sites, noted above, with doxorubicin or doxorubicin/dacarbazine, as first line treatment. Second-line options include gemcitabine as single agent or in combination with docetaxel, or dacarbazine, or else trabectedin as a single agent. Trial evidence suggests that combining doxorubicin with trabectedin first line, improves progression-free survival, although this combination is not yet supported by NICE. There is retrospective evidence that ifosfamide may be less effective in leiomyosarcoma.

Oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor expression is seen in ~50% of patients with uterine LMS. Some low and intermediate-grade tumours may be sensitive to oestrogen deprivation, (e.g. using aromatase inhibitors), although data are sparse. It can also be an option for patients not considered fit enough for chemotherapy. It is reasonable to evaluate receptor expression in those with relatively indolent tumours.

The management of uterine adenosarcoma is largely as for leiomyosarcoma.
