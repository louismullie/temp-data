## Question

Duloxetine premedication in herpes zoster

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether duloxetine premedication in acute herpes zoster prevents postherpetic neuralgia and how to interpret the PROCESS trial and related evidence for clinical decision-making. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the strength of evidence for preventing PHN. Then, I should verify the PROCESS trial design, outcomes, and statistical interpretation. Next, I will examine safety and tolerability. After that, I need to check how this fits with current guidelines and what alternatives are recommended. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and note any caveats or uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. PHN is the most common chronic complication of herpes zoster, with risk rising sharply with age and severe acute pain, and it can persist for months to years, so any intervention that meaningfully reduces PHN incidence would be clinically important [^092d24e8] [^00cc3800].

> Now, I should verify the pivotal evidence. The PROCESS trial is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint study of 750 adults aged 50 years or older with HZ presenting within 72 hours, comparing duloxetine added to standard care versus standard care alone, with the primary outcome of PHN at 12 weeks defined as any VAS pain greater than 0 mm, and secondary outcomes including VAS greater than 0 and VAS 3 or higher at 8 and 12 weeks, as well as patient global impression of change [^e16466c5] [^cd92b9d4].

> Wait, let me verify the primary outcome result before drawing conclusions. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, PHN at 12 weeks occurred in 22.9% with duloxetine versus 28.8% with control, which is a 5.9% absolute reduction but did not reach statistical significance, with P equals 0.067, so the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint for PHN prevention [^e16466c5] [^cd92b9d4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical relevance without checking the secondary outcomes. The trial showed significant reductions in the proportion with VAS greater than 0 at week 8 and VAS 3 or higher at week 12, and a higher responder rate on the Patient Global Impression of Change, indicating meaningful improvements in pain burden and patient-reported outcomes even though PHN incidence was not significantly reduced [^e16466c5] [^cd92b9d4].

> I need to check safety and tolerability carefully. Duloxetine was associated with higher rates of loss of appetite, somnolence, fatigue, insomnia, and dry mouth compared with control, which are consistent with SNRI adverse effects and matter for older adults who may already have comorbidities and polypharmacy [^cd92b9d4].

> Next, I should review how this fits with guidelines and the broader evidence base. Current guidelines emphasize early antiviral therapy within 72 hours as the cornerstone to reduce acute pain and complications, and for established PHN they recommend gabapentin, pregabalin, or tricyclic antidepressants, with duloxetine increasingly included as a reasonable option for PHN treatment, but there is no guideline endorsement of duloxetine to prevent PHN in the acute phase, reflecting the absence of definitive efficacy data [^f7954ece] [^5ccd6c33] [^bf1b2d6f] [^ad8f90bc].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility and why the trial might have missed a prevention signal. PHN pathophysiology involves peripheral and central sensitization, and while SNRIs can modulate descending inhibitory pathways, the timing, dose, and heterogeneity of acute pain mechanisms may blunt preventive effects, and the PROCESS trial's open-label design and modest sample size could have limited power to detect a small but real difference in PHN incidence [^b3c7596c] [^e16466c5].

> I should double-check the magnitude of benefit and how to frame it clinically. The absolute reduction in PHN of about 6% is not statistically significant, so we cannot claim prevention of PHN, yet the consistent improvements in pain metrics and patient global ratings suggest symptomatic benefit during the acute and subacute phases, which may still be meaningful for patients experiencing severe zoster pain [^e16466c5] [^cd92b9d4].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on duloxetine for another indication or cannot tolerate gabapentinoids or TCAs. In that scenario, continuing or initiating duloxetine for pain control during acute zoster is reasonable, provided we counsel on adverse effects and monitor tolerability, while still prioritizing timely antivirals and standard analgesia, and recognizing that PHN prevention remains unproven with this strategy [^e16466c5] [^f7954ece].

> I will now examine practical prescribing details if duloxetine is used off-label for acute zoster pain. The PROCESS regimen started at 20 mg daily and titrated to 60 mg as tolerated until pain resolution, which aligns with duloxetine's usual titration for neuropathic pain, and clinicians should screen for hepatic disease, blood pressure effects, and drug–drug interactions, especially with CYP2D6 substrates, before prescribing [^cd92b9d4] [^d5ca0c0e].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and ensure I am not overstating. Duloxetine premedication in acute herpes zoster does not significantly reduce the incidence of PHN at 12 weeks and therefore cannot be recommended solely to prevent PHN, but it can reduce pain severity and improve patient-reported outcomes during the acute and subacute phases, so it may be considered for symptomatic relief in selected patients after discussing modest benefits and nontrivial adverse effects, while ensuring antivirals and guideline-concordant care are in place [^e16466c5] [^cd92b9d4] [^f7954ece].

---

Duloxetine premedication in herpes zoster does not **significantly reduce PHN incidence** at 12 weeks (22.9% vs 28.8%; P = 0.067) [^e16466c5], but it **does reduce acute pain severity** and improves patient-reported outcomes [^cd92b9d4]. Given the lack of PHN prevention, duloxetine is not recommended as a primary prophylactic therapy; standard care remains early antivirals and analgesia, with duloxetine considered only for moderate-to-severe acute pain or when first-line options are contraindicated [^f7954ece] [^5ccd6c33].

---

## Clinical evidence from the PROCESS trial

The PROCESS trial is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint study of 750 adults aged ≥ 50 years with HZ within 72 hours, comparing duloxetine (20–60 mg/day) plus standard care versus standard care alone [^e16466c5] [^cd92b9d4].

- **Primary outcome**: PHN incidence at 12 weeks (VAS > 0) was 22.9% with duloxetine vs 28.8% with control (P = 0.067) — not statistically significant [^e16466c5].
- **Secondary outcomes**: Significant reductions in pain severity (VAS > 0 at week 8; VAS ≥ 3 at week 12) and improved patient global impression of change (97.9% vs 88% responders) [^cd92b9d4].
- **Safety**: Higher rates of nausea, somnolence, fatigue, insomnia, and dry mouth with duloxetine; most adverse events were mild to moderate [^cd92b9d4].

---

## Comparison with standard care and other interventions

Standard care for HZ includes **early antivirals** (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) within 72 hours to reduce acute pain and complications, though their effect on PHN prevention is modest and inconsistent [^f7954ece] [^1ec410f1]. Corticosteroids do not prevent PHN and are not routinely recommended [^1178db9b] [^613cc551]. Gabapentin and pregabalin are effective for PHN but have limited evidence for PHN prevention when started acutely [^e71a1fac] [^0b3acbc1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines do not recommend duloxetine for PHN prevention; it is considered for **established PHN** or refractory acute pain [^bf1b2d6f] [^5ccd6c33]. The AAFP 2025 guideline includes duloxetine among options for PHN, but not for acute HZ or PHN prevention [^bf1b2d6f].

---

## Safety profile and tolerability

Duloxetine is generally well tolerated; common adverse effects include nausea, somnolence, fatigue, insomnia, and dry mouth [^cd92b9d4]. Caution is warranted in patients with hepatic impairment, as duloxetine is hepatically metabolized [^d5ca0c0e].

---

## Practical clinical implications

- **PHN prevention**: Duloxetine should not be used solely to prevent PHN given the lack of significant benefit [^e16466c5].
- **Acute pain management**: Consider duloxetine for moderate-to-severe acute HZ pain, especially when first-line options are contraindicated or ineffective [^cd92b9d4].
- **Patient selection**: Use duloxetine selectively, balancing potential benefits in pain reduction against adverse effects and patient comorbidities [^cd92b9d4].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Duloxetine premedication in acute HZ **does not significantly reduce PHN incidence** but can reduce acute pain severity and improve patient-reported outcomes [^e16466c5] [^cd92b9d4]. It should not be used as a primary prophylactic therapy; standard care remains early antivirals and analgesia, with duloxetine considered for moderate-to-severe acute pain or when first-line options are unsuitable [^f7954ece] [^5ccd6c33].

### PROCESS trial: effect of duloxetine premedication for postherpetic neuralgia within 72 hours of herpes zoster reactivation – A randomized controlled trial [^e16466c5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common chronic complication of herpes zoster (HZ) and results in severe refractory neuropathic pain. This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of premedication with duloxetine in the prevention of PHN.

Methods

The PROCESS trial is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial used a 1:1 duloxetine:control ratio. Adults 50 years or older with HZ who presented with vesicles within 72 hours were recruited. The primary outcome was the incidence of PHN at 12 weeks. PHN was defined as any pain intensity score other than 0mm on the visual analog scale (VAS) at week 12 after the onset of the rash. The secondary outcomes were the number of participants with VAS > 0 and VAS ≥ 3. The modified intention-to-treat (mITT) principle and per-protocol (PP) principle were used for the primary outcome analysis.

Results

A total of 375 participants were randomly assigned to the duloxetine group and 375 were assigned to the control group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of PHN in the duloxetine group compared with the control group in the mITT analysis (86 [22.9%] of 375 vs 108 [28.8%] of 375; P = 0.067). PP analysis produced similar results. However, there were significant differences between the 2 groups in the number of participants with VAS > 0 and VAS ≥ 3 (P < .05 for all comparisons).

Conclusions

Although absolute prevention of PHN does not occur, this trial found that premedication with duloxetine can reduce pain associated with HZ, and therefore can have clinically relevant benefits. Clinical Trials Registration. Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04313335. Registered on 18 March 2020.

The study PROCESS (herpes zoster) was published by Chunmei Zhao and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Clin Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Herpes zoster and Postherpetic neuralgia. In the PROCESS (herpes zoster) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of duloxetine premedication in patients with herpes zoster reactivation? In the PROCESS (herpes zoster) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PROCESS (herpes zoster) study, the population was: 750 patients (382 female, 368 male). The inclusion criteria were adults, aged ≥ 50 years, with herpes zoster who presented with vesicles within 72 hours. The key exclusion criteria were no informed consent; a raw score of > 50 points on the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale; herpes zoster with head, neck, ocular, mucus membrane, cranial nerve, or CNS involvement or generalized herpes zoster; hepatic, renal, or immune dysfunction. In the PROCESS (herpes zoster) study, the interventions were: n = 375 duloxetine (initiated at a dose of 20 mg/day, adjusted to a maximum dose of 60 mg/day until Visual Analog Scale score of 0) n = 375 standard therapy (standard treatment). In the PROCESS (herpes zoster) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in incidence of postherpetic neuralgia at 12 weeks (22.9% vs. 28.8%; RR 5.9, 95% CI -0.42 to 12.22). In the PROCESS (herpes zoster) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in proportion of patients with Visual Analog Scale score > 0 at week 8 (25.1% vs. 40.5%; RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8) Significant decrease in proportion of patients with Visual Analog Scale score ≥ 3 at week 12 (17.6% vs. 28.3%; RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8) Significant increase in Patient Global Impression of Change scale responders at week 12 (97.9% vs. 88%; RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.2). In the PROCESS (herpes zoster) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in nausea. significant differences in loss of appetite (2.4% vs. 0.5%), somnolence (4.0% vs. 0.8%), fatigue (5.3% vs. 1.1%), insomnia (4.8% vs. 0.8%), dry mouth (3.0% vs. 0%). In the PROCESS (herpes zoster) study, the conclusion was: in adults, aged ≥ 50 years, with herpes zoster who presented with vesicles within 72 hours, duloxetine was not superior to standard therapy with respect to incidence of postherpetic neuralgia at 12 weeks.

### Postherpetic neuralgia [^092d24e8]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The main risk factor for postherpetic neuralgia is increasing age; it is uncommon in people under 50 years, but develops in 20% of people aged 60–65 years who have had acute herpes zoster, and in more than 30% of those people aged over 80 years. Up to 2% of people with acute herpes zoster may continue to have postherpetic pain for 5 years or more.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions, during an acute attack of herpes zoster, aimed at preventing postherpetic neuralgia? What are the effects of interventions to relieve established postherpetic neuralgia after the rash has healed? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to December 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 28 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: corticosteroids, dextromethorphan, dressings, gabapentin, oral antiviral agents, oral opioid analgesics, topical anaesthesia (lidocaine), topical antiviral agents (idoxuridine), topical counterirritants (capsaicin), tricyclic antidepressants.

### Postherpetic neuralgia [^00cc3800]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although there is some variability (depending on the definition of postherpetic neuralgia), about 10% of those with zoster will have persisting pain 1 month after the rash. The main risk factor for postherpetic neuralgia is increasing age; it is uncommon in people aged < 50 years, but develops in 20% of people aged 60 to 65 years who have had acute herpes zoster, and in > 30% of those people aged > 80 years. Up to 2% of people with acute herpes zoster may continue to have postherpetic pain for 5 years or more.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions aimed at preventing herpes zoster and subsequent postherpetic neuralgia? What are the effects of interventions during an acute attack of herpes zoster aimed at preventing postherpetic neuralgia? What are the effects of interventions to relieve established postherpetic neuralgia after the rash has healed? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 41 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: corticosteroids, capsaicin, dextromethorphan, dressings, gabapentin, herpes zoster vaccine, oral antiviral agents, oral opioid analgesics, lidocaine, topical antiviral agents (idoxuridine), and tricyclic antidepressants.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^0a471881]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The recognizable appearance and the dermatomal distribution of herpes zoster lesions usually enable a clinical diagnosis to be made easily. Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia occur mainly in older patients. The role of the varicella vaccine in preventing herpes zoster is uncertain, but is being studied. There is evidence to support using antiviral therapy and possibly low-dose tricyclic antidepressants to prevent postherpetic neuralgia. There is good evidence that treating herpes zoster with antiviral medication is beneficial, particularly in patients older than 50 years with severe outbreaks. The use of steroids has an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio. In patients who develop postherpetic neuralgia, there is good evidence to support treatment with gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants. More evidence for treatment with capsaicin cream, lidocaine patch, and opioids is needed. Intrathecal methylprednisolone is an option for patients with persistent pain.

### Management of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia [^a2560f8f]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with herpes zoster experience severe pain and potential lasting complications such as postherpetic neuralgia, ophthalmic disease/damage, and, rarely, skin complications (eg, infection of rash area). Treatment for acute zoster aims to accelerate healing, control pain, and, when possible, reduce the risk of complications. Early intervention with antivirals can accelerate rash healing, reduce rash severity, and reduce the risk of some complications. The addition of corticosteroids to antiviral medication may further alleviate short-term zoster pain, but is associated with an increased risk of serious adverse effects, especially among older adults. If a patient does develop postherpetic neuralgia, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine patch 5%, and capsaicin may all be considered as palliative treatments. For individuals with treatment-refractory postherpetic neuralgia, nonpharmacologic approaches may be considered and a pain-management specialist should be consulted. There is a need for more effective agents to treat herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia.

### Management of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia now and in the future [^57e3d7af]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) — a reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) — can cause significant morbidity. Its major complication is pain, particularly post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). We will review the current management strategies available for the treatment of both acute HZ and PHN, including antiviral drugs, analgesic agents, anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants and topical therapies. New molecules in development that show improved activity against VZV are also covered, and new drug targets are outlined. The role of translational neuroscience in moving towards a goal of finding disease-modifying treatments will be examined.

1 INTRODUCTION

Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common viral disease caused by reactivation of the varicella‐zoster virus, which lies latent in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal and cranial nerves subsequent to primary varicella‐zoster virus infection. The clinical course of HZ consists of acute (up to 1 month), subacute, and chronic phases. The acute phase is characterized by a dermatomal skin rash with vesicles, the duration of which is related to the age of the patient and to the dermatomes involved. Contagion is highest during the phase when the rash is vesicular. Pain in the acute phase is described as pulsating, shooting, burning, or piercing. Early attenuation of acute pain may prevent the initiation of central mechanisms of chronic pain, thus, potentially reducing the risk of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Greater acute pain is a risk factor for PHN.

Acute herpetic pain is predominantly nociceptive, whereas PHN — the chronic pain phase of HZ — is neuropathic. These two categories of pain, the pathogenic mechanisms of which are considered to differ, are difficult to strictly distinguish from each other and may coexist in some clinical settings. In recent years, this series of pain became collectively termed "zoster‐associated pain" (ZAP). Nonopioid analgesics (e.g. nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and acetaminophen) are prescribed as first‐line therapeutic drugs for acute ZAP. However, some patients with severe pain have difficulty achieving pain relief with NSAIDs alone. Therefore, off‐label administration of therapeutic drugs for neuropathic pain, opioid analgesics, and analgesic adjuncts (e.g. antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, and antiepileptics) may be attempted.

### Price of pain: population-based cohort burden of disease analysis of medication cost of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia [^9924eed2]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

PHN is a challenging condition to treat, and the effectiveness of pharmacological therapy is limited. The Canadian Pain Society consensus statement on the treatment of neuropathic pain recommends as first-line therapy for PHN one of the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), gabapentin, or pregabalin. Opioids and topical lidocaine are listed as second-line alternatives. The European Federation of Neurological Societies 2010 treatment guidelines for neuropathic pain largely echo these recommendations. Opioids, while effective, are not recommended as first-line therapy due to side effects, development of tolerance, and risk of dependency. A variety of other drugs are also discussed in the literature, including those used for other forms of neuropathy, although their efficacy for PHN is disputed. These include valproic acid/divalproex sodium, duloxetine, venlafaxine, carbamazepine, tramadol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.–

While treatment of PHN remains difficult, it is possible to reduce the risk of HZ, and with it PHN, with the HZ vaccine (Zostavax II ®, Merck & Co. Inc. Kenilworth, NJ, USA). This vaccine has been shown to reduce the relative risk of HZ by 51% and of PHN by almost 67%. Vaccines may decrease the chance of developing HZ, but HZ and the associated PHN are expected to continue to result in a significant burden to society in the near future.

To determine the incidence of HZ and rates of PHN, a retrospective cohort study was conducted in Manitoba, Canada, over a period of 17 years. The objectives were to determine the burden of disease of zoster-related pain and to understand the major cost drivers in the changing cost of treating HZ.

Treatment and nonspecific management of zoster and PHN — pain control and patient advice: Approaches used for control of acute zoster pain include acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, tricyclic antidepressants, opiates, anticonvulsants, capsaicin, and topical anesthetics, and many of these same modalities are used for control of chronic PHN pain; in more severe instances of pain, referral to a pain specialist, or even hospitalization and administration of epidural analgesics, is often considered. Elderly persons might be unable to tolerate psychotropic and other medications for management of their acute zoster or chronic PHN pain. Patients with uncomplicated zoster should be advised to keep the rash clean and dry, to avoid topical antibiotics, and, if possible, to keep the rash covered, and they should alert their physician if the rash worsens or they have fever, which could indicate bacterial superinfection.

### Management of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia [^afaa06e9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster and its sequela post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) are conditions with significant morbidity. PHN is a chronic, debilitating neuropathic pain that can persist long beyond resolution of visible cutaneous manifestations. This paper provides practical guidelines for management of herpes zoster and PHN. For herpes zoster, antivirals should be started, preferably within 72 h of onset, to reduce the severity and duration of the eruptive phase and to reduce the intensity of acute pain. PHN can be treated with either topical or systemic agents. Topical lidocaine and capsaicin are effective. For patients with more severe pain, the following systemic agents can be considered (in decreasing order of recommendation): the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin, the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine, and, lastly, the opioid analgesics tramadol, morphine, oxycodone, and methadone. For patients at high risk of developing PHN, early initiation of gabapentin or amitriptyline after the onset of herpes zoster is suggested. The new zoster vaccine has been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of herpes zoster and PHN.

Impairment of varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific cell-mediated immunity, including impairment due to immunosenescence, is associated with an increased risk of developing herpes zoster (HZ), whereas levels of anti-VZV antibodies do not correlate with HZ risk. This crucial role of VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity suggests that boosting these responses by vaccination will be an effective strategy for reducing the burden of HZ. Other strategies focus on preventing the major complication of HZ — post-herpetic neuralgia. These strategies include pre-emptive treatment with drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants and analgesics.

### Recommendations for the management of herpes zoster [^bb0af722]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of patients with herpes zoster (HZ) that take into account clinical efficacy, adverse effects, impact on quality of life, and costs of treatment. Systematic literature reviews, published randomized clinical trials, existing guidelines, and the authors' clinical and research experience relevant to the management of patients with HZ were reviewed at a consensus meeting. The results of controlled trials and the clinical experience of the authors support the use of acyclovir, brivudin (where available), famciclovir, and valacyclovir as first-line antiviral therapy for the treatment of patients with HZ. Specific recommendations for the use of these medications are provided. In addition, suggestions are made for treatments that, when used in combination with antiviral therapy, may further reduce pain and other complications of HZ.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^b876ed7d]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (shingles) is diagnosed clinically by recognition of the distinctive, painful vesicular rash appearing in a unilateral, dermatomal distribution. An estimated 1 million cases occur in the United States each year, and increasing age is the primary risk factor. Laboratory testing, including polymerase chain reaction, can confirm atypical cases. Treatment with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir decreases the duration of the rash. Adjunct medications, including opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, or corticosteroids, may relieve the pain associated with acute herpes zoster. There is conflicting evidence that antiviral therapy during the acute phase prevents postherpetic neuralgia. Postherpetic neuralgia in the cutaneous nerve distribution may last from 30 days to more than six months after the lesions have healed. Evidence supports treating postherpetic neuralgia with tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, long-acting opioids, or tramadol; moderate evidence supports the use of capsaicin cream or a lidocaine patch as a second-line agent. Immunization to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia is recommended for most adults 60 years and older.

Introduction

An estimated 1 million individuals in the United States are diagnosed with herpes zoster (shingles) each year following reactivation of a childhood infection with varicella-zoster virus. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and health authorities in other countries, the incidence of herpes zoster has been gradually increasing in adults for several years, for reasons that are not well understood, although rates among older adults have plateaued since 2008. Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common long-term complication of herpes zoster and is generally diagnosed in individuals who have recovered from the herpes zoster skin rash but continue to experience pain for at least 3 months. Depending on their age and the PHN definition used, 20% to 50% of individuals with herpes zoster will experience PHN. Advanced age and immunocompromised states are significant risk factors for developing both herpes zoster and PHN, as approximately half of all PHN cases occur in individuals aged > 60 years.

PHN is characterized by neuropathic pain isolated to the dermatome(s) affected by the virus and can be debilitating. It is a chronic condition that can persist for years in some patients and is often challenging to treat. It is a major driver in herpes zoster–related disease burden and cost. Currently, there is no available cure for PHN; thus, medical management focuses on palliative treatments and strategies to shorten the duration or lessen the symptom burden. Due to the persistent and often refractory nature of the neuropathic pain associated with PHN, combination therapy with systemic and topical analgesics is often utilized in an attempt to optimize patient outcomes. Systemic therapies may include antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioids; opioids have remained the most frequently used first-line therapy, despite lack of support by the current body of evidence and potential for abuse or diversion.

Neuropathic Pain within the Distribution of Up to Two Nerves

Neuropathic pain is defined as pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. It is a "clinical description (and not a diagnosis) which requires a demonstrable lesion or a disease that satisfies established neurological diagnostic criteria". Notably, recognized painful neuropathic conditions include post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), and post-amputation pain.

PHN develops after the reactivation of the herpes zoster virus from its latent state. The virus is kept in a latent state in the dorsal root ganglion by the body's cell-mediated immunity. Commonly affected regions include ophthalmic (32%), thoracic (16.5%), and facial (16%) distributions. Two primary pathophysiologic mechanisms of PHN pain include sensitization and deafferentation. Both gabapentinand pulsed radiofrequency of the dorsal root ganglionhave demonstrated benefit in patients with PHN. When these are ineffective, PNS may be considered. Likewise, PDN affects millions of patients in the United States, and medications have shown mixed benefits. Amitriptyline, gabapentin, duloxetine, and pregabalin have all shown some benefit in studies, as has topical capsaicin.

When neuropathic pain persists despite pharmacologic interventions, psychological support, and physical and other interventional therapies, neuromodulation may be considered. SCS and PNS are valuable options for patients with persistent neuropathic pain. These therapies reduce pain perception and improve functional outcomes by modulating the electrical signals within nerve pathways. SCS has been particularly effective in treating complex regional pain syndrome and post-surgical pain, while PNS offers targeted relief for specific nerve injuries.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^597c8854]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster, or shingles, is caused by reactivation of varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox. There are an estimated 1 million cases in the Unites States annually, with an individual lifetime risk of 30%. Patients with conditions that decrease cell-mediated immunity are 20 to 100 times more likely to develop herpes zoster. Patients may present with malaise, headache, low-grade fever, and abnormal skin sensations for two to three days before the classic maculopapular rash appears. The rash is usually unilateral, confined to a single dermatome, and typically progresses to clear vesicles that become cloudy and crust over in seven to 10 days. Herpes zoster can be treated with acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir, ideally within 72 hours of the development of the rash. Postherpetic neuralgia is the most common complication, occurring in about one in five patients. It is defined as pain in a dermatomal distribution sustained for at least 90 days after acute herpes zoster. Treatment is focused on symptom control and includes topical lidocaine or capsaicin and oral gabapentin, pregabalin, or tricyclic antidepressants. The varicella zoster virus vaccine decreases the incidence of herpes zoster and is approved for adults 50 years and older. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends this vaccine for adults 60 years and older, except for certain immunosuppressed patients.

### Treatment and prevention of postherpetic neuralgia [^db8c508a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

There have been 4 recent major advances in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) that are based on the results of randomized, controlled trials. These advances are the demonstrations that gabapentin, the lidocaine patch 5%, and opioid analgesics are efficacious in patients with PHN, and the report that nortriptyline and amitriptyline provide equivalent analgesic benefits for patients with PHN but that nortriptyline is better tolerated. The results of these clinical trials are briefly reviewed, and their implications for the treatment of patients with PHN are discussed. Despite these treatment advances, many patients remain refractory to current therapy, and the prevention of PHN has therefore become an important focus of current research. Research on administration of the varicella-zoster vaccine to prevent herpes zoster and on treatment of patients who have herpes zoster with combined antiviral and analgesic therapy to prevent PHN is discussed.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^c7d6a242]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain has a significant impact on patients' quality of life, as well as social, economic, and psychological well-being. Notably, it has an even larger economic burden on society as a whole when one considers the financial cost of managing it in the chronic setting. Estimates of its prevalence in the general population vary from as little as 1% to as much as 7–8%; however, when taking into account conditions such as diabetes (26%), herpes zoster/shingles (19%), and postsurgical pain (10%), the incidence is much higher. There are a number of national and international guidelines/recommendations for the assessment and treatment of neuropathic pain, yet there remains to be a consensus or agreement on the positioning of pharmacologic management (specifically opioids), neurostimulation, or targeted drug delivery. The purpose of this publication is to create a comprehensive algorithm for the treatment and management of chronic, noncancer neuropathic pain by merging the aforementioned guidelines/recommendations and integrating the currently available data from systemic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and published case reports/series (Figure 1).

### Postherpetic neuralgia: what do we know and where are we heading? [^2690af9c]. Pain Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) remains a difficult pain problem for patients and physicians alike. This review describes the epidemiology and pathophysiology of PHN and discusses proposed mechanisms of pain generation and the various treatments currently available. Evidence is scant for the value of surgical and procedural interventions in general, although there are numerous small studies supporting the use of specific interventions such as nerve blocks, neurosurgical procedures and neuroaugmentation. Medical interventions, particularly the use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants remain the best-documented therapies for treating pain associated with PHN. There is good evidence that amitriptyline and gabapentin reduce pain with PHN. Topical local anesthetics, such a lidocaine, may also be helpful. The decision to use a particular agent or intervention may depend on whether there is spontaneous pain, burning or lancinating pain or numbness. Interventions with low risk, such as TENS are appropriate. Although prevention of postherpetic neuralgia appears to be an appropriate strategy, there is little evidence to support the position that medical or interventional approaches (nerve blocks) will prevent PHN after a patient develops acute herpes zoster (HZ). Although antivirals are appropriate for acute HZ, and the use of neural blockade and sympathetic blockade may be helpful in reducing pain in selected patients with HZ, there is little evidence that these interventions will reduce the likelihood of developing PHN.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^f1446488]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Low credibility.

These recommendations represent the first statement by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on the use of a live attenuated vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster (zoster) (i.e., shingles) and its sequelae, which was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 25, 2006. This report summarizes the epidemiology of zoster and its sequelae, describes the zoster vaccine, and provides recommendations for its use among adults aged ≥ 60 years in the United States. Zoster is a localized, generally painful cutaneous eruption that occurs most frequently among older adults and immunocompromised persons. It is caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) decades after initial VZV infection is established. Approximately one in three persons will develop zoster during their lifetime, resulting in an estimated 1 million episodes in the United States annually. A common complication of zoster is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a chronic, often debilitating pain condition that can last months or even years. The risk for PHN in patients with zoster is 10%-18%. Another complication of zoster is eye involvement, which occurs in 10%-25% of zoster episodes and can result in prolonged or permanent pain, facial scarring, and loss of vision. Approximately 3% of patients with zoster are hospitalized; many of these episodes involved persons with one or more immunocompromising conditions. Deaths attributable to zoster are uncommon among persons who are not immunocompromised. Prompt treatment with the oral antiviral agents acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir decreases the severity and duration of acute pain from zoster. Additional pain control can be achieved in certain patients by supplementing antiviral agents with corticosteroids and with analgesics. Established PHN can be managed in certain patients with analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, and other agents. Licensed zoster vaccine is a lyophilized preparation of a live, attenuated strain of VZV, the same strain used in the varicella vaccines. However, its minimum potency is at least 14-times the potency of single-antigen varicella vaccine. In a large clinical trial, zoster vaccine was partially efficacious at preventing zoster. It also was partially efficacious at reducing the severity and duration of pain and at preventing PHN among those developing zoster. Zoster vaccine is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 60 years who have no contraindications, including persons who report a previous episode of zoster or who have chronic medical conditions. The vaccine should be offered at the patient's first clinical encounter with his or her health-care provider. It is administered as a single 0.65 mL dose subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm. A booster dose is not licensed for the vaccine. Zoster vaccination is not indicated to treat acute zoster, to prevent persons with acute zoster from developing PHN, or to treat ongoing PHN. Before administration of zoster vaccine, patients do not need to be asked about their history of varicella (chickenpox) or to have serologic testing conducted to determine varicella immunity.

### Gabapentin (Gralise) [^bd8211f3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of GRALISE for the management of postherpetic neuralgia was established in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. This study enrolled patients between the age of 21 to 89 with postherpetic neuralgia persisting for at least 6 months following healing of herpes zoster rash and a minimum baseline pain intensity score of at least 4 on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).

This 11-week study compared GRALISE 1,800 mg once daily with placebo. A total of 221 and 231 patients were treated with GRALISE or placebo, respectively. The study treatment including titration for all patients comprised a 10-week treatment period followed by 1-week of dose tapering. Double-blind treatment began with titration starting at 300 mg/day and titrated up to a total daily dose of 1,800 mg over 2 weeks, followed by 8 weeks fixed dosing at 1,800 mg once daily, and then 1 week of dose tapering. During the 8-week stable dosing period, patients took 3 active or placebo tablets each night with the evening meal. During baseline and treatment, patients recorded their pain in a daily diary using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale. The mean baseline pain score was 6.6 and 6.5 for GRALISE and placebo-treated patients, respectively.

Treatment with GRALISE statistically significantly improved the endpoint mean pain score from baseline. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 1 shows the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement. The figure is cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the study were assigned 0% improvement.

### Consequences and management of pain in herpes zoster [^f799b151]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common complication of herpes zoster, particularly in the elderly and in persons with severe symptoms at presentation. Unless varicella vaccination reduces the incidence of herpes zoster and attenuates the risk and/or severity of complications, PHN will continue to result in significant suffering and remain a consumer of health care and related social support resources. Although there have been useful advances in the management of PHN (e.g., the use of the anticonvulsant gabapentin), some cases remain intractable. Prevention remains the preferred strategy, and antiviral drugs are the most well established means of preventing the development of pain. Other interventions require further evaluation (nerve blocks, acute-phase tricyclic antidepressant or anticonvulsant use). Because prevention of PHN requires early recognition and prompt management of patients presenting with herpes zoster, public education and dissemination of information to all health care personnel involved with the disease are essential.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^b1256590]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of vaccination, a communication gap between primary medical providers and patients hinders satisfactory prevention of VZV and HZ. PHN incidence is on the rise, the effective management of PHN remains an ongoing challenge, and no single best therapy has yet been identified. Current guidelines for management of PHN pain recommend gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), opioids, topical agents, and combination therapies with different mechanisms of action (Figure 2).–However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has only approved four oral systemic medications, all of which are gabapentinoids, and two topical analgesics specifically for the management of pain associated with PHN (Figure 2).

A carefully devised, individually based treatment plan is critical to ensure optimal outcomes in the management of PHN. Pain and its interference with daily activities are subjective symptoms and difficult to manage effectively, even more so in older patients, who are predominantly afflicted with PHN, and who are more likely to have multiple chronic health issues and declining function and frailty. A significant number of patients who develop chronic pain associated with PHN do not receive evidence-based, recommended treatment modalities, leaving many patients undertreated and dissatisfied with the treatment. To ensure optimal results, the initial choice of PHN pain therapy should be guided not only by drug efficacy but also by the patient's comorbidities, severity of PHN pain, the drugs' adverse-event and drug-interaction profiles, titration regimen, and patient preference, especially since no single therapy has demonstrated superior effectiveness. Because PHN is a complex condition and should not be simplified to a localized area of pain, the most practical therapeutic approach may involve a systemic medication or combination therapy rather than topical analgesics alone. Finally, clear communication with the patient and frequent monitoring of adverse reactions and patient satisfaction with the treatment should be established.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^20f02a7c]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

An estimated one million individuals in the US are diagnosed with herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) each year. Approximately 20% of these patients will develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a complex HZ complication characterized by neuropathic pain isolated to the dermatome that was affected by the HZ virus. PHN is debilitating, altering physical function and quality of life, and commonly affects vulnerable populations, including the elderly and the immunocompromised. Despite the availability of an immunization for HZ prevention and several approved HZ treatments, the incidence of PHN is increasing. Furthermore, management of the neuropathic pain associated with PHN is often suboptimal, and the use of available therapeutics may be complicated by adverse effects and complex, burdensome treatment regimens, as well as by patients' comorbidities and polypharmacy, which may lead to drug–drug interactions. Informed and comprehensive assessments of currently available pharmacological treatment options to achieve effective pain control in the primary care setting are needed. In this article, we discuss the situation in clinical practice, review currently recommended prevention and treatment options for PHN, and outline practical considerations for the management of this neuropathic pain syndrome, with a focus on optimal, individual-based treatment plans for use in the primary care setting.

Postherpetic neuralgia

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a neuropathic pain syndrome resulting from damage to nerve fibers, is the most common complication of herpes zoster (HZ; shingles), and the cause of the greatest HZ-related burden of illness.–HZ is a viral disease caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) that had remained latent in sensory ganglia since the primary infection (chicken pox), and is characterized by a painful skin rash, usually limited to the area innervated by a single sensory ganglion (Figure 1).PHN is usually diagnosed in individuals who have recovered from the HZ skin rash but who have continued to experience pain for at least 3 months, although for some patients pain can persist for years.

PHN pain occurs in the same dermatomes as the HZ rash, and is likely the result of damage to the nervous system (which may include deafferentation, peripheral and/or central sensitization, myelin destruction, inflammation, and signaling errors in the brain) that occurred during the proliferation and spread of the virus during the acute HZ infection. The syndrome has consequences permeating multiple aspects of patients' lives, affecting their sleep, concentration, and mood, as well as impacting their physical functionality by interfering with activities of daily living.

As many as 20% of patients with HZ develop PHN. Major risk factors include advanced age and decreased immunity.–Approximately half of all PHN cases occur in persons older than 60 years. Therefore, the incidence of HZ and risk of PHN is likely to increase as the population ages. The declining cell-mediated VZV immunity from immune senescence also contributes to the observed increased prevalence of PHN in the elderly. Finally, the severity of the acute HZ infection and the presence of a notable prodrome have also been associated with increased likelihood of experiencing PHN.–

Figure 4
Number needed to treat with common pain therapies to obtain 50% pain relief in one patient. Data highlight the limited relief from pain obtained in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). For some treatments, approximately four patients with PHN need to be treated to achieve 50% pain relief in one patient.

As patients with PHN may find it difficult to tolerate pain therapies, drug doses are often titrated. This may result in several weeks of suboptimal treatment, during which it is unclear if (or when) the drugs will become effective. Therapeutic compliance is also difficult to achieve. Almost 50% of patients with PHN do not discuss their symptoms regularly with physicians. One in 10 is troubled substantially by the side-effects of PHN treatments.

Treatment dissatisfaction is high in patients with PHN. In one study, only 14% of patients aged > 65 years were satisfied with pain medication for PHN. In the survey by Weinke et al. patient-reported satisfaction with HZ treatments was significantly lower in patients with PHN versus those with HZ (6.8 versus 8.3; scale from 0, 'not satisfied' to 10, 'very satisfied').

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a randomized-controlled trial [^5bf6ce3f]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a human alpha herpes virus, which causes varicella (chicken pox) and herpes zoster (HZ). Approximately one out of three people in the United States aged 60 years or older will develop shingles. 1

Herpes zoster results from the reactivation of latent VZV and its spread from the ganglion to the corresponding cutaneous dermatome. 2, 3 The characteristic vesicular rash (shingles) of HZ pustulates and crusts within 7‐10 days but may take up to a month to heal; however, pain is an important feature of the disease that is often the most debilitating for patients.

Zoster‐associated pain is experienced by approximately 90% of patients. The chronic neuropathic pain phase of the disease, known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), is defined as pain that persists 90 days or more after rash onset. 4, 5

Postherpetic neuralgia causes the largest HZ‐related burden of illness. 6, 7, 8, 9 Risk factors for PHN include greater acute pain severity, presence of a prodrome, greater rash severity, and older patient age at onset. 10 Current interventions for PHN, such as lidocaine patches, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti‐epileptics, are palliative and fail to treat the underlying disease. A substantial proportion of patients fail to obtain satisfactory pain relief using the available medications. 8 This pain burden is associated with negative effects on their quality of life such as impaired physical functioning, higher levels of emotional stress, and decreases in social functioning. 11

Although the widespread use of the herpes zoster vaccine has reduced the incidence of HZ and PHN, 12 a large percentage (∼90% in the US) of the at‐risk population does not receive the vaccine. 13 About half of people, 60 years of age or older who have had the shingles vaccine, fail to respond (eg, primary failure meaning they failed to seroconvert after vaccination) and may go on to develop HZ. 12, 14 In addition, the efficacy of the vaccine has been shown to decline over time (eg, secondary vaccine failure). 15, 16

### Treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: a review of therapeutic options [^05d8a213]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a disabling consequence of the reactivation of the varicella zoster infection. The observation that patients with PHN experience various types of pain suggests that multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms are involved, which may include the peripheral and central nervous systems. A reasonable initial strategy would involve selecting from among multiple agents that have complementary mechanisms of action and that have been proven effective in controlled clinical trials, such as the lidocaine patch 5%, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, and opioids. Based on initial assessment and ongoing reassessment, sequential trials should be undertaken until adequate pain relief is achieved. This may ultimately lead to therapy with more than one medication. Safety and tolerability are important considerations in choosing initial therapy, particularly in older patients. Physicians can either add another agent to the current regimen or switch to a new type of monotherapy if there is inadequate response to initial therapy. Alternative therapies, (i.e., ketamine, intrathecal corticosteroid injections) have not been adequately studied. Well-designed, multicenter, controlled clinical trials are needed to develop a treatment algorithm that provides an evidence-based, rational approach to treating PHN.

### Herpes zoster in older adults [^9253c453]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) strikes millions of older adults annually worldwide and disables a substantial number of them via postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Key age-related clinical, epidemiological, and treatment features of zoster and PHN are reviewed. HZ is caused by renewed replication and spread of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in sensory ganglia and afferent peripheral nerves in the setting of age-related, disease-related, and drug-related decline in cellular immunity to VZV. VZV-induced neuronal destruction and inflammation causes the principal problems of pain, interference with activities of daily living, and reduced quality of life in elderly patients. Recently, attempts to reduce or eliminate HZ pain have been bolstered by the findings of clinical trials that antiviral agents and corticosteroids are effective treatment for HZ and that tricyclic antidepressants, topical lidocaine, gabapentin, and opiates are effective treatment for PHN. Although these advances have helped, PHN remains a difficult condition to prevent and treat in many elderly patients.

### Herpes zoster antivirals and pain management [^fc4449d1]. Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Topic

Evaluation of evidence-based strategies for managing herpes zoster (HZ) and the pain of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).

Clinical Relevance

Approximately 20% of the world's population suffers from herpes zoster at least once in a lifetime, with 10% to 20% having ophthalmic involvement. Treatment of the acute disease with oral antivirals may reduce the incidence and severity of complications but does not reliably prevent PHN or postherpetic itch (PHI). The acute pain abates as the acute phase resolves; the long-term pain of PHN or PHI may be severe and difficult to manage. Although many therapeutic agents have efficacy in the management of these complications, relief is frequently partial for months to the remainder of the lifetime.

Methods

Literature review was performed using the resources of the Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Ophthalmic library as well as the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health PubMed service searching by pertinent topics, authors, and journals.

Results

If started within 72 hours of the onset of the acute HZ rash, the oral antiviral agents acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir significantly shorten the periods of acute pain, virus shedding, rash, acute and late-onset anterior segment complications, and, in the case of valacyclovir and famciclovir, the incidence and severity of PHN. However, these medications do not prevent PHN, which remains a common and debilitating complication of HZ in older patients, requiring assiduous pain management. Tricyclic antidepressants, antiseizure drugs, opioids, and topical analgesics all offer some pain relief, and may be combined.

Conclusion

Options are available to manage HZ and reduce the pain of PHN. However, prevention, now possible with the HZ vaccine, is preferable to treatment.

### Predictors of placebo response in peripheral neuropathic pain: insights from pregabalin clinical trials [^f9d1d5cf]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Key entry criteria included the following: at least 18 years of age; primary diagnosis of either DPN (type 1 or 2 diabetes with painful, distal, symmetrical, or sensorimotor polyneuropathy) or PHN (pain present for ≥ 3 months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash); and mean baseline pain score at least 4, as measured on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS; where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain), for 4 or more days during the week prior to randomization or pain score of at least 40 mm on the 100 mm visual analog scale of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaireat screening and randomization.

Patients were excluded if they suffered from any neurological disorders or had severe pain unrelated to DPN or PHN that could confound assessment of pain. Patients with DPN were required to discontinue all analgesic medications. Medications that could affect painful symptoms of DPN were prohibited, with the exception of acetaminophen (≤ 3–4 g/day), aspirin (≤ 325 mg/day for myocardial infarction or transient ischemic attack prophylaxis), and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (no dose changes 30 days prior to or during the study). Patients with PHN were permitted to continue treatment if they were on a stable regimen of analgesics, anti-inflammatories, or antidepressants. The primary endpoint in all studies was change in endpoint mean pain score, defined as the last seven daily pain score entries (scored on an 11-point NRS) for pregabalin versus placebo.

### Post-herpetic neuralgia: a review of advances in treatment and prevention [^7895988f]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is primarily a disease of the elderly and often refractory to treatment. Randomized and controlled trials have yielded several significant advances in the treatment and prevention of this disease. Treatment advances include the lidocaine patch, opioid analgesics, nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and gabapentin. However, no treatment regimen fully eliminates the pain. Improvements in prevention include prompt recognition and treatment of high-risk herpes zoster (HZ) patients with antiviral and analgesic therapies. Even with these advances, PHN remains a debilitating and painful disease. Vaccines offer the greatest promise of relief. The childhood vaccine against varicella zoster virus offers long-lasting immunity, largely preventing HZ and PHN. But most adults have already had varicella and are at risk for HZ and PHN as they age. Therefore, a more potent vaccine against varicella has been developed for use in adults. This vaccine offers a new and significant advance in the prevention of HZ and its most noteworthy complication, PHN.

Treatment of HZ

Although still controversial, early treatment of HZ with antiviral agents may decrease the risk of developing or duration of PHN. Three antiviral agents are approved in the US for the treatment of HZ: acyclovir (Zovirax®; GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK), famciclovir (Famvir®; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA), and valacyclovir (Valtrex®; GlaxoSmithKline).–To limit the amount of viral replication and reduce the duration of the HZ rash, antivirals should be administered within 72 hours of rash onset. They may be beneficial as long as new lesions are actively being formed, which is important to note, since in clinical practice the diagnosis of HZ is rarely made within 72 hours. However, the safety and efficacy of antivirals in treating HZ or preventing PHN more than 72 hours after rash onset have not been established.–

Antivirals alone are not sufficient to relieve the acute pain associated with HZ. Mild-to-moderate pain can be controlled with a short-acting opioid with acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, and gabapentinoids, followed by a TCA, can be added for more severe acute pain. Furthermore, the combination of gabapentin and valacyclovir administered acutely in patients with HZ may reduce the incidence of PHN. Although not recommended routinely for treatment of HZ and most likely ineffective in preventing PHN, corticosteroids are often considered in clinical practice for HZ patients with limited contraindications.

2.7 Procedures

The investigational drugs were prepared in a blinded manner in the pharmacy department at each medical institution. The investigational drug allocated to each study group was diluted three‐ to four‐fold with physiological saline for injection and was then set to the infusion pump. The patient received the allocated investigational drug at the bedside for the following durations of time: ≥ 18 min for patients in the high‐dose fosphenytoin group and the corresponding placebo group, and ≥ 12 min for patients in the low‐dose fosphenytoin group and the corresponding placebo group. From 2 weeks prior to the start date of dosing to 24 h after dosing, the administration of drugs (e.g. phenytoin, fosphenytoin, ethotoin, and combinations thereof; antiepileptics; calcium channel α₂δ ligands; antidepressants; antiarrhythmics; N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor antagonists; central muscle relaxants; local anesthetics; steroids; and opioid analgesics) was prohibited.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^1ec410f1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Treatment and nonspecific management of zoster and PHN — antivirals and corticosteroids: Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are approved by the FDA for zoster in immunocompetent patients, and trials indicate that when taken orally they reduce viral shedding and lesion formation, shorten time to rash healing, and decrease acute zoster pain and the risk for progression to postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Many experts recommend that treatment should be considered for all eligible patients with zoster and specifically recommend treatment for persons aged ≥ 50 years who have moderate or severe pain, moderate or severe rash, or involvement of noncranial dermatomes. In clinical trials, treatment has been initiated within 72 hours of rash onset and the benefits of later treatment have not been studied; if treatment cannot be initiated within 72 hours, experts recommend that it should be initiated as soon as possible, particularly in the presence of new vesicle formation or of complications. Two clinical trials assessed corticosteroids with acyclovir; a 3-week tapering course diminished acute zoster pain and decreased time to cutaneous healing, cessation of analgesic therapy, and return of uninterrupted sleep and normal daily activities, but no evidence indicated that use of corticosteroids prevented development of PHN; combinations with valacyclovir or famciclovir have not been studied in clinical trials. No evidence indicates that topical antiviral therapy or corticosteroids without systemic antiviral therapy have a role in treatment of zoster.

14.1 Management of Postherpetic Neuralgia (Study PHN CR)

Support for efficacy of LYRICA CR for the management of PHN and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) was based on the efficacy of LYRICA for these indications along with an adequate and well‑controlled study in adults with PHN. This 19‑week randomized withdrawal study compared daily doses of LYRICA CR 82.5 mg, 165 mg, 247.5 mg, 330 mg, 495 mg, or 660 mg with placebo. Those enrolled were required to have pain present for more than 3 months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash and a baseline pain score of greater than or equal to 4 on the numeric rating scale (NRS)‑Pain (assessed over a 1 week recall period). The baseline mean pain scores were 6.83 for LYRICA CR‑treated patients vs. 6.85 for placebo‑treated patients. A total of 82.4% of patients completed the single‑blind phase of the study. Patients were considered responders if they had at least a 50% reduction in pain in the single‑blind phase. Those who responded to treatment were then randomized in the double‑blind phase to treatment with either the LYRICA CR dose achieved in the single‑blind phase or placebo. Patients were treated for up to 3 months following randomization. A total of 87.5% of LYRICA CR‑treated patients and 78% of placebo‑treated patients completed the double-blind phase of the study.

LYRICA CR treatment demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the endpoint change in mean pain score from baseline compared to placebo. For a range of levels of improvement in pain intensity from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 1 shows the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement. The figure is cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the study were assigned 0% improvement. In the LYRICA CR group, 79.8% of subjects achieved at least a 30% improvement and 73.6% at least 50% improvement in pain intensity. In the placebo group, 64.9% of subjects achieved at least a 30% improvement and 54.6% at least a 50% improvement in pain intensity.

### Mirogabalin for the management of postherpetic neuralgia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study in Asian patients [^193f78ad]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Neuropathic pain has many causes, including neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus or to herpes zoster and spinal cord injury. Symptoms of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) include spontaneous pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia.

Multiple factors play a role in neuropathic pain, including the involvement of voltage-dependent sodium and calcium channels. Animal studies support the role of voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels (VDCCs) in neuropathic pain signaling. In animal studies, the α₂δ subunit of VDCCs enhances the activity of VDCCs by enabling increased trafficking to the membrane, leading to increased peripheral and central neuron excitability that is believed to contribute to neuropathic pain. Although the mechanism of action is not fully understood, it is believed that α₂δ ligands alleviate neuropathic pain by reducing the enhanced Ca²⁺ influx and neuronal excitability mediated by the α₂δ subunit.

Current options for managing neuropathic pain include anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. No single class of medication has shown efficacy for all neuropathic pain patients, and studies estimate the effect size reported in meta-analyses of pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain may have been overestimated. Many patients take multiple medications for neuropathic pain, which increases the risk of adverse events (AEs). Current guidelines issued by the Japanese Society of Pain Clinicians for the management of neuropathic pain recommend the use of pharmacologic therapies as the best treatment strategy for neuropathic pain that focuses on the improvement of pain and quality of life (QoL). Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for a management option with less AEs and high efficacy.

Mirogabalin monobenzenesulfonate (herein referred to as mirogabalin, Daiichi Sankyo Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) is a novel, selective oral α₂δ ligand being developed for the treatment of PHN and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP). In contrast to pregabalin, a standard α₂δ ligand, mirogabalin showed higher binding affinities in human and rat α₂δ subunits; furthermore, it had a slower dissociation rate for the α₂δ-1 subunit than the α₂δ-2 subunit. When studied in experimental neuropathic pain models, partial sciatic nerve ligation rats, and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, mirogabalin showed more potent and longer-lasting analgesic effects. A phase 2 trial of mirogabalin has proven the drug's effectiveness in reducing sleep disturbances and improving pain scores associated with DPNP.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^7ad9c1ec]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Optimal management of pain in PHN patients is complex and difficult. Although there are several therapeutic options, PHN treatment is often inadequate, leaving patients undertreated. Better utilization of available options and multimechanistic approaches to PHN management based on the patient's individual characteristics may be the most beneficial. Primary care plays a crucial role in the development and implementation of the PHN treatment plan, and establishing effective communication with patients. Well-devised and well-executed PHN therapy will not only ensure sufficient pain relief but will also facilitate improvements in patients' physical and psychosocial functions.

We conducted a comprehensive literature search for peer-reviewed articles about HZ and PHN using the PubMed search engine and relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords. Identified studies included those that evaluated the treatment of HZ and/or PHN in terms of efficacy and safety. The same search was repeated for review articles, including meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Additional searches included bibliographies of the retrieved articles, and Medline searches using the names of authors who had published several articles on HZ or PHN. We first reviewed titles and abstracts for relevance, and selected articles were then reviewed on their entirety. Included articles were English-language studies, addressed epidemiology and burden of HZ, were prospective or retrospective studies that provided clinical information on treated patients, provided detailed methodology and clear outcome measures, demonstrated treatment/prevention of HZ or PHN as a primary purpose, and described treatments feasible for an outpatient setting approved by the FDA or adhering to current guidelines on the care of PHN patients.–Studies and reviews that included other conditions were only included if results were reported separately for each condition. Studies that described case reports or case series were excluded.

### Corticosteroids for herpes zoster: what do they accomplish? [^925a2ac7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

For some patients, herpes zoster infections not only result in acute pain but serious consequences, including postherpetic neuralgia and damage to ocular tissues. Some authors have recommended corticosteroids for the treatment of these acute symptoms and complications. The literature concerning the use of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, however, either provides conflicting results or includes recommendations based on clinical experience rather than clinical trials. The author performed a search of the literature to address the question of whether corticosteroids are well tolerated and effective for the treatment/prevention of the acute pain of herpes zoster, postherpetic neuralgia, and/or the ocular complications resulting from herpes zoster. While smaller trials found oral corticosteroids beneficial for preventing postherpetic neuralgia, larger, better designed trials have not found oral corticosteroids to be more efficacious than placebo in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. Trials investigating the effect of oral corticosteroids for the acute pain of herpes zoster have found that corticosteroids provide a statistically significant improvement. Whether these improvements are clinically significant is uncertain. Thus, oral corticosteroids may confer a slight benefit for initial symptoms as long as the patient is not at risk for complications resulting from corticosteroid therapy. Most trials of topical and injectable corticosteroids are limited by several shortcomings. Therefore, topical and most forms of parenteral corticosteroids have yet to be proven effective for the treatment of acute pain or prevention of complications. Two controlled, blinded trials investigating the use of intrathecal corticosteroid administration for intractable postherpetic neuralgia suggest that corticosteroid administration results in a significant improvement in pain. Despite this, several authors have voiced concern over possible serious adverse events with the intrathecal administration of corticosteroids. Intrathecal corticosteroids may provide a benefit for intractable postherpetic neuralgia, but because of risks of serious complications, this is a last-line option and should only be administered by experienced personnel.

### Understanding pain in herpes zoster: an essential for optimizing treatment [^b3c7596c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

After herpes zoster, immunocompetent persons frequently experience chronic pain and considerable suffering. Zoster-associated pain has a complex pathophysiology that begins with viral damage and increased sensitization of peripheral sensory neurons. The enhanced afferent barrage from these neurons sensitizes spinal neurons and leads to loss of synapses from descending inhibitory fibers, resulting in central neuropathic pain and allodynia. Antiviral therapy of acute zoster limits this sequence of pathophysiologic mechanisms. There is no clear consensus regarding the optimal means of determining the benefits of antiviral therapy in the management of pain of herpes zoster. A novel statistical approach utilizing rates of disappearance of pain of differing pathophysiologic mechanisms is proposed.

### Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^1178db9b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common, serious, painful complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory properties, and might be beneficial. This is an update of a review first published in 2008, and previously updated in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Methods

We updated the searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trials registers (June 2022). We also reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials, contacted authors, and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs involving corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes for people of all ages, with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset, compared with no treatment or placebo, but not with other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified potential articles, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of each trial, and the certainty of the evidence. Disagreement was resolved by discussion among the co-authors. We followed standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We identified five trials with a total of 787 participants that met our inclusion criteria. No new studies were identified for this update. All were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group studies. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of corticosteroids given orally during an acute herpes zoster infection in preventing postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of herpes (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.99; 2 trials, 114 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision)). The three other trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria were not included in the meta-analysis because they did not provide separate information on the number of participants with PHN at six months. Adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment were reported in all five included trials. There were no observed differences in serious (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.29; 5 trials, 755 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision)), or non-serious adverse events (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.87; 5 trials, 755 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and serious imprecision)) between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. One of these trials was at high risk of bias because of incomplete outcome data, two were at unclear risk of bias, and the other was at low risk of bias. The review was first published in 2008; no new RCTs were identified for inclusion in subsequent updates in 2010, 2013, and 2023.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the current available evidence, we are uncertain about the effects of corticosteroids given orally during an acute herpes zoster infection on preventing postherpetic neuralgia. Corticosteroids given orally or intramuscularly may result in little to no difference in the risk of adverse events in people with acute herpes zoster. Some researchers have recommended using corticosteroids to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of the disease. If further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life, as well as updated measures of pain.

### Capsaicin (Qutenza) [^490f4a74]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.1 Postherpetic Neuralgia

The efficacy of QUTENZA was established in two 12-week, double-blind, randomized, dose-controlled, multicenter clinical trials. These studies enrolled patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) persisting for at least 6 months following healing of herpes zoster rash and a baseline score of 3–9 on an 11-point Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). QUTENZA and a control topical system were each applied as a single, 60-minute application. The control used in these studies looked similar to QUTENZA but contained a low concentration of the active ingredient, capsaicin (3.2 mcg/cm², 0.04% w/w), to retain blinding regarding the known application site reactions of capsaicin (such as burning and erythema). The baseline mean pain score across the 2 studies was approximately 6.0. Patients who entered the study on stable doses of pain-control medications were required to keep dosing stable throughout the duration of the study. Approximately half of the patients were taking concomitant medications, including anticonvulsants, non-SSRI antidepressants, or opioids for their PHN at study entry. Prior to application, a topical anesthetic was applied to the treatment area for 60 minutes. Patients were permitted to use local cooling and additional analgesic medications for treatment-related discomfort as needed through Day 5. Patients recorded their pain daily in a diary.

### Predictors of placebo response in peripheral neuropathic pain: insights from pregabalin clinical trials [^e9e67a0c]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Remission may underlie a response in the placebo group, particularly in PHN, a disorder that remits spontaneously, particularly in the first 6 months of the disease. The present data, in which a shorter duration of PHN was associated with a greater placebo response, lend some support to this notion. In these studies, patients with pain present for at least 3 months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash were allowed to enter the trial. These data suggest that extending the duration of pain after the healing of the rash as an entry criterion may help attenuate the placebo response.

This analysis shows that, over time, there has been a trend towards an increased placebo response in pregabalin trials in DPN and PHN, whereas there has been no corresponding change in the response to pregabalin. Pooled analyses of trials in other patient populations have also noted an increase in placebo response over time. A meta-analysis of 75 trials in major depressive disorder noted a significant positive association between the proportion of patients responding to placebo and the year of publication (increase in the proportion of patients responding to placebo of approximately 7% per decade between 1981 and 2000). However, a more recent analysis of 96 trials between 1980 and 2005 confirmed the relationship between study year and placebo response with clinician rating but not with patient self-rating scales. It is not clear why there has been this increase in placebo response over time, but more recent trials tend to be of longer duration and, with clinical trials now being more common, more likely to include younger patients with shorter disease duration. These factors were associated with a greater placebo response in this analysis.

14.1	Management of Postherpetic Neuralgia (Study PHN CR)

Support for efficacy of pregabalin extended-release tablets for the management of PHN and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) was based on the efficacy of LYRICA for these indications along with an adequate and well-controlled study in adults with PHN. This 19-week randomized withdrawal study compared daily doses of pregabalin extended-release tablets 82.5 mg, 165 mg, 247.5 mg, 330 mg, 495 mg, or 660 mg with placebo. Those enrolled were required to have pain present for more than 3 months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash and a baseline pain score of greater than or equal to 4 on the numeric rating scale (NRS)-Pain (assessed over a 1 week recall period). The baseline mean pain scores were 6.83 for pregabalin extended-release tablets-treated patients vs. 6.85 for placebo-treated patients. A total of 82.4% of patients completed the single-blind phase of the study. Patients were considered responders if they had at least a 50% reduction in pain in the single-blind phase. Those who responded to treatment were then randomized in the double-blind phase to treatment with either the pregabalin extended-release tablets dose achieved in the single-blind phase or placebo. Patients were treated for up to 3 months following randomization. A total of 87.5% of pregabalin extended-release tablets-treated patients and 78% of placebo-treated patients completed the double-blind phase of the study.

### Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^613cc551]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia is a common serious complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and might be beneficial.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Strategy

We updated the searches for randomised controlled trials of corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2010), LILACS (January 1982 to February 2010), the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (1978 to 2010) and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2010). We also reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials, contacted authors and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials involving corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular or intravenous routes for people of all ages with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset, compared with no treatment or placebo, but not with other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors identified potential articles, extracted data and assessed quality of each trial independently. Disagreement was resolved by discussion with other co-authors.

Main Results

Five trials were included with 787 participants in total. All were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group studies. No new trials were identified in the 2010 update. In the updated version we conducted a meta-analysis of two trials, and the results showed that oral corticosteroids did not prevent postherpetic neuralgia six months after the herpes onset (RR, 0.95; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.99). The three other included trials also had similar results although their data could not be included in the meta-analysis. Adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment were reported in all five included trials. There were no significant differences in serious or non-serious adverse events between the corticosteroids and placebo groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroids given acutely during zoster infection are ineffective in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. In people with acute herpes zoster the risks of administration do not appear to be great. Corticosteroids have been recommended to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of disease; if further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life.

### Use of gabapentin for postherpetic neuralgia: results of two randomized, placebo-controlled studies [^fc890026]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which affects up to 70% of elderly persons with herpes zoster, can have debilitating effects, including physical and social disability and significant psychological distress. A variety of agents have been used, either singly or in combination, to control PHN, including topical and oral analgesics, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). However, PHN often proves refractory to these therapies.

Objective

This article reviews available data on the use of the newer AED gabapentin for the control of PHN.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was undertaken to identify all randomized, placebo-controlled trials on the use of gabapentin in PHN. The search terms were gabapentin and postherpetic neuralgia.

Results

The literature search identified 2 published studies of the efficacy of gabapentin in a total of 563 patients with PHN that had persisted for at least 3 months after the healing of herpes zoster rash. The studies employed multiple outcome measures, including visual analog and Likert scales for pain intensity, and quality-of-life and functional measures that included the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Profile of Mood States. At maximum target dosages of 1800 to 3600 mg/d, gabapentin produced significant reductions in mean daily pain scores compared with placebo on both visual analog(P < 0.001) and Likert scales (P < 0.01). Improvements were also seen on the SF-36 subscales for physical functioning, bodily pain, vitality, and mental health(P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Gabapentin may provide benefits in terms of alleviation of pain and overall quality of life in patients with chronic PHN.

### Improvement in pain severity category in clinical trials of pregabalin [^f00d1b17]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

All patients were ≥ 18 years of age and had an average pain score ≥ 4 on the 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS), where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain, during the study screening period, with four or more pain diaries completed. Patients in the FM trials had a primary diagnosis of FM according to the 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria for FM(widespread pain present for ≥ 3 months and pain in ≥ 11 of 18 tender points). Patients in the DPN trials had a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus with painful, symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy for ≥ 6 months (or, in one trial, ≥ 3 months). Patients in the PHN trials had experienced neuropathic pain for ≥ 3 months following healing of the herpes zoster viral rash (or, in one trial, ≥ 6 months). Patients in the SCI trials had a complete or incomplete SCI of ≥ 12-months' duration, with chronic pain experienced continuously for ≥ 3 months or with remissions and relapses for ≥ 6 months.

The protocols for all trials adhered to the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and the Helsinki Declaration. All trials were approved by the appropriate institutional review board and all patients provided written informed consent prior to participation.

### Current management of herpes zoster: the European view [^cf528417]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The overall incidence of herpes zoster in Europe is approximately 3 per 1000 people per year and more than 10 per 1000 people per year in those aged > 80 years. Post herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common debilitating complication of herpes zoster, particularly in patients aged > 50 years, in persons with severe pain or rash at presentation, and in those with significant prodromal symptoms. Antiviral drugs can effectively control acute symptoms and, if used early enough in the course of the illness, can help prevent the development of PHN and other complications. However, despite this, many patients do not receive such treatment. The economic impact of zoster and PHN is largely underestimated in Europe. Furthermore, there is considerable variation throughout Europe in the management of herpes zoster. Use of antiviral therapy including the newer potent antiviral agents such as brivudin, which requires less frequent administration than acyclovir, is improving patient outcomes in some European countries. However, in many countries, patient awareness of herpes zoster and, as a result, overall antiviral use is low. Guidelines recommending the use of antiviral agents, particularly in patients at risk of developing PHN, are available but are not widely used. More needs to be done to educate the general public and increase awareness among primary healthcare providers of the benefits of timely and appropriate pharmacological therapy in patients with herpes zoster.

### Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^7fb7808b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia is a common, serious painful complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and might be beneficial. This is an update of a review first published in 2008 and previously updated in 2010.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Methods

We updated the searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (16 April 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2012), LILACS (January 1982 to April 2012), and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (1978 to 2012). We also reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials, contacted authors and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs involving corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes for people of all ages with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset, compared with no treatment or placebo but not with other treatments. We did not include quasi-RCTs (trials in which a systematic method of randomisation such as alternation or hospital number was used).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors identified potential articles, extracted data, and independently assessed the risk of bias of each trial. Disagreement was resolved by discussion among the co-authors.

Main Results

Five trials were included with 787 participants in total. All were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of two trials (114 participants) and the results gave moderate quality evidence that oral corticosteroids did not prevent postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of herpes (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.99). One of these trials was at high risk of bias because of incomplete outcome data, the other was at low risk of bias overall. The three other trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria were not included in the meta-analysis because the outcomes were reported at less than one month or not in sufficient detail to add to the meta-analysis. These three trials were generally at low risk of bias. Adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment were reported in all five included trials. There were no significant differences in serious or non-serious adverse events between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. There was also no significant difference between the treatment groups and placebo groups in other secondary outcome analyses and subgroup analyses. The review was first published in 2008 and no new RCTs were identified for inclusion in subsequent updates in 2010 and 2012.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate quality evidence that corticosteroids given acutely during zoster infection are ineffective in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. In people with acute herpes zoster the risks of administration of corticosteroids do not appear to be greater than with placebo, based on moderate quality evidence. Corticosteroids have been recommended to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of disease. If further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in an elderly patient with critical COVID-19: a case report [^7de25f7c]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Although herpes zoster is mostly self-limiting, antiviral therapy needs to be considered in patients with severe diseases such as COVID-19. Among antivirals for treatment of herpes zoster licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), acyclovir is most commonly used. In the previous studies, acyclovir has been shown to reduce virus shedding, stop new lesion formation and hasten resolution of lesions. In the current report, the administration of acyclovir was started within 24 hours of rash onset and lasted for 21 days. It is recommended that antiviral treatment initiate within 72 hours of onset of the rash, and is usually given for 7 days. The principle of antiviral treatment in COVID-19 patients with herpes zoster might be the same as in other patients with the condition. In patients with complications of herpes zoster, which might be more common in COVID-19 patients, the course of treatment needs to be extended. Considering the side effects of acyclovir such as hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, liver and kidney function should be monitored regularly. Under certain circumstances such as contraindications of acyclovir, vitamin C and quercetin might be considered as alternative treatments, which have been proved to display immunomodulatory function and anti-viral effect. In addition, the patients with herpes zoster should be placed on contact precautions to avoid varicella zoster virus transmission to susceptible persons such as other COVID-19 patients.

Pain management is one of the cornerstones of treatment of both acute herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia. For mild to moderate pain, analgesics such as paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are appropriate. For severe pain, opioid analgesics such as oxycodone or morphine are options. In the first line treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, tricyclic antidepressants (like nortriptyline or amitriptyline), anticonvulsant (like gabapentin or pregabalin) and topically administered lidocaine may be used. Because the patient in the current report has a history of myasthenia gravis, drugs affecting the neuromuscular junction like anticonvulsants need to be used with caution. Although one anticonvulsant gabapentin has been widely reported to induce an exacerbation of myasthenic symptoms,–another anticonvulsant pregabalin is well tolerant in the current case. Thus, in patients with COVID-19, the comorbidity and the side effects of analgesics should worth further attention to and be treated case by case. Where a single treatment alone is ineffective, combined modalities are recommended.

### Pregabalin in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy: a narrative review [^ee5ade6e]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

The complex nature of pDPN may require more than one therapy for adequate pain relief, but there are limited studies of combination therapies. The COMBO-DN study is the largest trial to date comparing monotherapy with a combination duloxetine and pregabalin in 339 participants. There was no difference between combination standard-dose and high-dose monotherapy of either treatment. In a secondary analysis, duloxetine 60 mg was found to be superior to pregabalin 300 mg/day in the initial 8-week run-in phase. A further exploratory post hoc analysis of COMBO-DN showed that high-dose monotherapy was more favourable in patients with severe pain, whereas combination therapy was more beneficial in patients with moderate and mild pain. Also, patients who received duloxetine (60 mg/day) as initial therapy had a better response to combined duloxetine and pregabalin for evoked or severe tightness and a greater benefit with high-dose duloxetine (120 mg/day) for paraesthesia-dysaesthesia. In another double-blind RCT with a parallel-group design comparing amitriptyline, duloxetine and pregabalin there was no significant difference in analgesic efficacy. However, when determining polysomnographic parameters, pregabalin improved sleep continuity, whereas duloxetine increased wake and reduced total sleep time. Despite the putative negative effects on sleep, duloxetine enhanced central nervous system arousal and performance on sensory motor tasks; however, there were significantly more adverse events in the pregabalin group.

A study of pregabalin and 5% lidocaine medicated plaster (n = 229) in post-herpetic neuralgia or painful DPN showed that patients who failed to respond to monotherapy of pregabalin gained additional benefit from the 5% lidocaine patch. This was in contrast to an RCT of the addition of low-dose 10 mg oxycodone or placebo in patients treated with pregabalin where there was no enhancement of the pain-relieving effects of pregabalin.

### Up-date on clinical management of postherpetic neuralgia and mechanism-based treatment: new options in therapy [^fa512243]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with postherpetic neuralgia may experience various sensory signs and symptoms of pain. Despite this, the recommendations for medicinal treatment do not differ accordingly. In order to find the appropriate treatment options for postherpetic neuralgia, several attempts have been made in the past. The crucial obstacle to these attempts was insufficient or no subgrouping of patients according to their sensory phenotype, mostly resulting in an unsatisfactory treatment response. Recently, a new concept of retrospective stratification according to the patients' sensory phenotype has been made in a large cohort of pain patients. This new stratification tool allows a predictive validity for treatment response in subgroups of patients and might be of potential value in determining the optimal treatment in postherpetic neuralgia patients.

### Herpes zoster [^498cf026]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Primary care providers and hospitalists frequently encounter older or immunocompromised patients with herpes zoster accompanied by debilitating pain. Atypical presentations and zosteriform herpes simplex may present diagnostic challenges to clinicians. This article summarizes the background, evidence, and guidelines for the diagnosis, complications, treatment, and prevention of herpes zoster. Diagnosis of challenging cases relies on polymerase chain reaction as the preferred test. Treatment focuses on optimal use of antiviral therapy and analgesics. Prevention emphasizes utilization of a new recombinant zoster vaccine, which reduces the incidence of herpes zoster by more than 90% and is preferred to the live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oxycodone and of gabapentin for acute pain in herpes zoster [^bba66d2b]. Pain (2009). Low credibility.

Although acute pain in patients with herpes zoster can be severe and has a substantial impact on health-related quality of life, there have been no randomized clinical trials of oral medications specifically for its ongoing treatment. A randomized clinical trial was conducted in which 87 subjects ≥ 50 years of age with herpes zoster within 6 calendar days of rash onset and with worst pain in the past 24h ≥ 3 on a 0–10 rating scale initiated 7 days of treatment with famciclovir in combination with 28 days of treatment with either controlled-release (CR) oxycodone, gabapentin, or placebo. Subjects were evaluated for adverse effects of treatment, acute pain, and health-related quality of life. The results showed that CR-oxycodone and gabapentin were generally safe and were associated with adverse events that reflect well-known effects of these medications. Discontinuing participation in the trial, primarily associated with constipation, occurred more frequently in subjects randomized to CR-oxycodone (27.6%) compared with placebo (6.9%). Treatment with CR-oxycodone reduced the mean worst pain over days 1–8 (p = 0.01) and days 1–14 (p = 0.02) relative to placebo but not throughout the entire 28-day treatment period as pain resolved in most subjects. Gabapentin did not provide significantly greater pain relief than placebo, although the data for the first week were consistent with a modest benefit. By demonstrating that CR-oxycodone is safe, generally adequately tolerated, and appears to have efficacy for relieving acute pain, the results of this clinical trial provide a foundation for evidence-based treatment for acute pain in herpes zoster.

### Pregabalin for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^0b3acbc1]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).

Methods

The authors conducted a multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week, randomized clinical trial in PHN, defined as pain for 3 or more months following herpes zoster rash healing. Patients (n = 173) were randomized to treatment with pregabalin or placebo. Patients randomized to pregabalin received either 600 mg/day (creatinine clearance > 60 mL/min) or 300 mg/day (creatinine clearance 30 to 60 mL/min). The primary efficacy measure was the mean of the last seven daily pain ratings. Secondary endpoints included additional pain ratings, sleep interference, quality of life, mood, and patient and clinician ratings of global improvement.

Results

Pregabalin-treated patients had greater decreases in pain than patients treated with placebo (endpoint mean scores 3.60 vs 5.29, p = 0.0001). Pain was significantly reduced in the pregabalin-treated patients after the first full day of treatment and throughout the study, and significant improvement on the McGill Pain Questionnaire total, sensory, and affective pain scores was also found. The proportions of patients with ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% decreases in mean pain scores were greater in the pregabalin than in the placebo group (63% vs 25% and 50% vs 20%, p = 0.001). Sleep also improved in patients treated with pregabalin compared to placebo (p = 0.0001). Both patients and clinicians were more likely to report global improvement with pregabalin than placebo (p = 0.001). Given the maximal dosage studied, pregabalin had acceptable tolerability compared to placebo despite a greater incidence of side effects, which were generally mild to moderate in intensity.

Conclusions

Treatment of PHN with pregabalin is safe, efficacious in relieving pain and sleep interference, and associated with greater global improvement than treatment with placebo.

### Varicella-zoster virus meningitis with hypoglycorrhachia, presenting with painless occipital herpes zoster mimicking atopic dermatitis [^1b271acb]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The clinical diagnosis of VZV meningitis can be challenging. In this case, the diagnosis of aseptic meningitis caused by VZV was confirmed only after the patient's discharge from the hospital. Several factors contributed to this delayed diagnosis.

First, the patient was a young, immunocompetent individual. Herpes zoster typically results from the reactivation of latent VZV in the ganglia and is more commonly seen in older individuals or those with immunosuppressed conditions due to weakened cellular immunity. The incidence of herpes zoster is relatively low among individuals in their 20s. A large cohort study reported that meningitis complicates only 0.14% of herpes zoster cases. Conversely, VZV is a notable cause of aseptic meningitis (8.0–10.3%), and encephalitis has been reported in 12.0–27.0% of cases. In addition, VZV meningitis is reported to occur at a younger age than VZV encephalitis, with a prevalence of 80% (130 of 162) in immunocompetent patients, and generally exhibits a favourable prognosis. A single-centre study on aseptic meningitis conducted in Japan identified VZV as the second most common causative virus, after the mumps virus. Therefore, in younger immunocompetent patients with viral meningitis, VZV should be considered a likely causative agent.

Second, the national medical insurance in Japan did not cover PCR testing for VZV using CSF until 2022, resulting in frequent underdiagnoses. This patient was admitted prior to 2022. For suspected cases of VZV meningitis, a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is recommended, even in young immunocompromised patients, and prompt administration of acyclovir is necessary.

Third, the patient's condition was complicated by atopic dermatitis, which led to a misdiagnosis. The patient did not report headaches associated with the right occipital zoster and was on regular oral pregabalin and duloxetine for lumbar disk hernia, which obscured the symptoms of zoster neuralgia. This atypical presentation combined with the underlying atopic dermatitis, led to herpes zoster being misinterpreted as an exacerbation of dermatitis.

Notably, individuals with atopic dermatitis have an 18–33% higher risk of herpes zoster, with Asian populations experiencing a higher incidence. Furthermore, when VSV-related meningitis can present atypically in adults, herpes zoster can be atypical and painless, delayedor even absent. Regardless of the presence or absence of skin rash, if VZV infection cannot be ruled out as a cause of aseptic meningitis, NAAT for VZV should be conducted.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^6ec7c794]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Practical considerations for management of PHN

For primary care providers, PHN may not present as a distinct entity but rather an extension of the original HZ infection, and monitoring for a global condition affecting multiple aspects of patients' lives rather than for a localized post-HZ pain is paramount. Thus, practical management of PHN can be divided into prevention and treatment of HZ, and the more challenging task of managing the neuropathic pain syndrome and its consequences once PHN has developed (Figure 2).

To date, no cure for PHN exists, only treatments that are palliative and that may shorten the duration and severity of the pain. Therefore, vaccinations to prevent initial chicken pox and thus VZV from ever gaining a foothold in the body in the first place, or vaccinations to prevent reactivation of VZV already present in the body remain a priority; however, there are uncertainties about the vaccines' duration of protection and/or how frequently booster can be given.–For patients who were exposed to VZV and who contracted acute HZ, the primary care provider may use antivirals, analgesics, or corticosteroids to decrease acute pain and possibly decrease the risk of developing PHN.

### Oral antivirals revisited in the treatment of herpes zoster: what do they accomplish? [^5db8907d]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Oral antiviral agents currently represent the most important therapeutic keystone in the treatment of herpes zoster. Three oral antiviral agents are available for the treatment of herpes zoster: acyclovir, its derivative valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Meta-analysis of published data has shown that oral acyclovir significantly reduces various herpes zoster-related symptoms as well as the duration, intensity and prevalence of zoster-associated pain (ZAP). However, this drug does not influence postherpetic neuralgia. The newer agents famciclovir and valacyclovir exhibit a better oral bioavailability than acyclovir. These agents have demonstrated similar efficacy to acyclovir with ZAP and they require less frequent administration. When initiated within 72 hours, oral antiviral therapy of herpes zoster is beneficial in selected, elderly immunocompetent patients, reducing the duration and intensity of ZAP and providing more rapid skin lesion healing. Oral antivirals are also of benefit in immunocompromised patients with uncomplicated herpes zoster. However, signs of cutaneous and visceral dissemination should be monitored; if signs occur, intravenous antiviral therapy is indicated.

### Varicella-zoster virus meningitis with hypoglycorrhachia, presenting with painless occipital herpes zoster mimicking atopic dermatitis [^54c7b2e9]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Case presentation

The patient was a young man in his 20s who presented with fever and back pain as his chief complaints. He had developed chills 4 days prior to visiting our clinic. The next day, he experienced a headache and a fever of 38.7℃, prompting a visit to a local clinic, where he was prescribed antipyretic analgesics. Despite this treatment, his fever persisted, and he began experiencing vomiting. A nasopharyngeal swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was performed, with negative results. He was then prescribed cefditoren pivoxil, but his symptoms did not improve.

The patient's atopic dermatitis and pre-existing back pain worsened, making it difficult for him to sleep while lying down. His mother reported a significant worsening of his atopic dermatitis, with a severe occipital rash — the worst she had ever seen. He was subsequently referred to our clinic for further evaluation.

The patient's medical history included atopic dermatitis and lumbar disk hernia. He had been on a daily regimen of 600 mg pregabalin and 60 mg duloxetine for back pain, as well as topical steroids for his dermatitis. There was no reported contact with individuals or animals displaying similar symptoms, nor had he engaged in sexual activity in the preceding weeks. He had no family history of tuberculosis. The patient had received a varicella vaccine during childhood and had no history of varicella or shingles.

On arrival, his vital signs were:

Blood pressure: 117/83 mm Hg.
Heart rate: 88 beats per min.
Respiratory rate: < 20 breaths per min.
Body temperature: 37.5℃.
SpO₂: 97% on ambient air.

Although his general appearance was sickly, he had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15/15, and his cognition was clear.

Physical examination

The patient had a painless rash on the right side of the occipital region (figure 1). Atopic dermatitis was also present on his back and lower legs. He exhibited no nuchal rigidity or jolt accentuation of the neck. Spontaneous back pain consistent with lumbar herniation was noted, but there was no spinal tapping pain. He was oriented to date, location and memory, and no unusual neurological abnormalities were observed.
