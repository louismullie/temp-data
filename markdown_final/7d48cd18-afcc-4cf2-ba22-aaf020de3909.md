## Question

What are the treatment options for CKD patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment options available for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify CKD stage and risk to anchor decisions. Then, I should verify foundational lifestyle and risk-factor management. Next, I will review core pharmacotherapies that slow progression and reduce cardiovascular events, including the "four pillars". After that, I need to check complication-specific therapies and medication stewardship. Then, I will examine renal replacement therapy options and conservative care, ensuring shared decision-making is embedded. Finally, I should consider special populations, implementation gaps, and a practical decision framework, while continuously verifying each claim against guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the classification and risk stratification framework, because treatment intensity hinges on it. CKD is staged by eGFR and albuminuria, and KDIGO 2024 emphasizes using cystatin C when creatinine-based eGFR is uncertain and adopting a risk-based approach to predict kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and mortality, which guides therapy selection and timing [^114YYuwL] [^115dGtHR] [^1172uUXK]. I should double-check that this risk-directed strategy is operationalized with validated tools and that clinicians reassess risk over time as kidney function and comorbidities evolve [^1172uUXK].

> Next, I should review foundational lifestyle and risk-factor management, since these underpin all subsequent therapies. Lifestyle measures include dietary sodium restriction, weight management, smoking cessation, and individualized physical activity even if below general population targets, with blood pressure targets individualized by age, albuminuria, and comorbidity, often aiming for ≤ 130/80 mmHg when albuminuria is present and tolerated, and ≤ 140/90 mmHg otherwise [^114KV17y] [^1139xS8B]. Wait, let me verify the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in blood pressure control; they have modest BP-lowering effects and are recommended in CKD with hypertension when eGFR thresholds are met, which complements lifestyle and RAAS blockade rather than replacing them [^112qgKSX].

> I will now examine the core pharmacotherapies that slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events, often termed the "four pillars". SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended across risk strata in CKD with or without diabetes, with stronger recommendations at higher risk and consistent benefits on kidney endpoints and heart failure hospitalization; absolute benefits scale with baseline risk, and eGFR thresholds vary by agent, so I need to check labeling for dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and canagliflozin before initiating [^116Y6FA9] [^114zgPXV] [^1113Xymz]. Hold on, I should verify the diabetes-specific guidance; ADA 2025 and KDIGO endorse SGLT2 inhibitors for T2DM with CKD to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events, aligning with cardiorenal protection beyond glycemic effects [^1113Xymz] [^115VJfVK].

> Let me consider RAAS blockade next, because it remains foundational when albuminuria is present. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are recommended for CKD with albuminuria, with close monitoring of potassium and creatinine after initiation and uptitration; dual blockade is discouraged due to harm, and hyperkalemia should be managed proactively rather than reflexively discontinuing RAAS inhibitors when feasible [^114KV17y] [^116EmwEr]. I should confirm that this applies across diabetic and non-diabetic CKD, which KDIGO supports, with the caveat of individualized BP targets and monitoring cadence [^114KV17y].

> Now, I need to check the role of nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism, specifically finerenone. In T2DM with CKD and persistent albuminuria despite RAAS blockade, finerenone reduces CKD progression and heart failure hospitalization, and should be considered as an add-on with potassium monitoring, representing a key fourth pillar in selected patients [^116EmwEr] [^115VJfVK]. Wait, I should verify that the benefit signal is consistent across eGFR ranges; the pivotal trials enrolled patients with reduced eGFR and albuminuria, and guideline endorsements reflect that population [^116EmwEr].

> I should also review GLP-1 receptor agonists, particularly for patients with T2DM and CKD. GLP-1 RAs reduce cardiovascular events and may slow CKD progression, with low hypoglycemia risk and favorable effects on weight and albuminuria; they are reasonable add-on therapy when additional glycemic or cardiorenal risk reduction is needed, and VA/DoD suggests offering liraglutide or dulaglutide for this purpose in CKD [^112VEpub] [^116SvKiN]. Hold on, I should verify renal dosing considerations; most GLP-1 RAs do not require dose adjustment in CKD, though gastrointestinal adverse effects and cost may limit use in some patients [^notfound].

> Next, I should review complication-specific management, starting with CKD-mineral and bone disorder. Phosphate restriction and binders, vitamin D analogs, and calcimimetics are used based on trends in labs and clinical context, with KDIGO advising against decisions based on a single value and emphasizing individualized targets and monitoring frequency [^115ARtVm] [^111uxfQP]. Let me double-check that this approach avoids overtreatment and aligns with patient-centered goals in advanced CKD [^115ARtVm].

> For anemia of CKD, I need to ensure iron repletion is prioritized before ESAs, with IV iron favored when indicated and ESA therapy reserved for patients likely to benefit in quality of life and transfusion avoidance, targeting hemoglobin roughly 100–120 g/L in adults while avoiding high targets due to harm [^113cf2UM] [^115WRST1]. I should confirm that treatment is individualized by transplant candidacy, inflammation, and life expectancy, and that ongoing reassessment of benefit is built into the plan [^113cf2UM].

> Regarding dyslipidemia, statins are recommended for most adults with CKD older than 50 years, with atorvastatin or pravastatin preferred when renal dosing is a concern, and rosuvastatin dose-limited in severe CKD. Statins reduce cardiovascular events, the leading cause of death in CKD, and should be integrated with BP and glycemic control strategies [^115dGtHR] [^116EmwEr]. Wait, I should verify exceptions; in dialysis patients without specific cardiovascular indications, statins may not improve outcomes, so decisions should be individualized [^115U3Shf].

> I will now examine medication stewardship, because polypharmacy and nephrotoxic exposures are common. KDIGO advises periodic medication reconciliation, deprescribing when indicated, and counseling to avoid NSAIDs, harmful supplements, and other nephrotoxins, with explicit review at transitions of care to prevent adverse events and interactions [^112dY1B2] [^115qbrvZ]. Hold on, I should verify that this extends to OTC and herbal agents, which are frequent sources of harm in CKD [^115qbrvZ].

> Next, I should review renal replacement therapy (RRT) options and ensure shared decision-making is embedded from the outset. Patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² should receive education about transplantation, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and comprehensive conservative care, with early discussions to align modality choice with goals, logistics, and comorbidity burden [^111PSEse] [^113zvyNg]. I need to ensure timing allows for access planning if dialysis is chosen and for advance care planning if conservative care is preferred, recognizing that decisions are dynamic and may change with health status and preferences [^111PSEse] [^111ewG13].

> Conservative kidney management is an active, multidisciplinary approach for patients who prioritize quality of life, symptom control, and avoidance of dialysis burdens, particularly older or frail adults with limited life expectancy or high comorbidity burden. It includes aggressive symptom management, advance care planning, and psychosocial support, and should be presented as a legitimate, evidence-informed option rather than "doing nothing" [^111qpKJ1] [^113ELHdb]. But wait, what if prognosis is uncertain? Shared decision-making tools and honest conversations about trade-offs can mitigate decisional conflict and align care with patient values over time [^113ELHdb].

> I should double-check the evidence on dialysis timing and modality, because early initiation may not improve outcomes and can increase burden. Observational data suggest many older adults start dialysis at eGFR above 10 without clear symptomatic indications, and survival remains modest, reinforcing the need to individualize start decisions and consider conservative care when benefits are unlikely to outweigh burdens [^113dTXV6] [^111Z19vM]. Home dialysis modalities may better preserve autonomy and are underutilized, so I need to ensure patients are informed about PD and home HD early in the decision process [^115uwdX2].

> For special populations, let me consider older adults, those with diabetes, and transplant candidates. In older adults, competing risks of death from comorbidities, slow eGFR decline, and high early mortality on dialysis argue for early, repeated shared decision-making conversations and a low threshold to choose conservative care when goals center on comfort and function [^113dTXV6] [^112WFxJA]. In diabetes, layering SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs, RAAS blockade, and finerenone when indicated addresses cardiorenal risk, with individualized glycemic targets and monitoring strategies to balance hypoglycemia risk [^115VJfVK] [^1113Xymz]. For transplant candidates, timely referral, vaccination, and optimization of cardiovascular risk are essential, and transplant remains the preferred modality for suitable candidates when available [^111PSEse].

> I need to ensure implementation gaps are addressed, because underuse of evidence-based therapies and suboptimal education are common. Multidisciplinary CKD clinics, structured education with decision aids, and proactive medication management improve uptake of SGLT2 inhibitors, home dialysis, and conservative care, and reduce unplanned starts and decisional conflict [^111KnRHF]. Hold on, I should verify that guideline panels explicitly call for these system-level changes; KDIGO and VA/DoD both emphasize coordinated, patient-centered care and early education to close these gaps [^112gNvW4] [^113GEmpB].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical decision framework and sanity-check it against the evidence. First, stage CKD and risk-stratify using eGFR and albuminuria, incorporating validated risk tools. Second, implement lifestyle and risk-factor control, and initiate the four pillars where indicated, tailoring to risk and tolerability. Third, at eGFR below 30, begin structured education on RRT and conservative care with shared decision-making, documenting goals and preferences. Fourth, for eGFR below 15–20 or symptomatic uremia, finalize modality selection, plan access if dialysis is chosen, or activate comprehensive conservative care if aligned with goals. Fifth, reassess continuously as health status, preferences, and evidence evolve, maintaining medication stewardship and symptom control throughout [^114YYuwL] [^111PSEse] [^1172uUXK]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought SGLT2 inhibitors were contraindicated below eGFR 30, but I should correct that; while glycemic efficacy wanes, kidney and cardiovascular benefits persist to lower eGFR thresholds depending on the agent, so labeling and clinical judgment should guide initiation rather than a blanket contraindication [^116Y6FA9] [^1113Xymz].

CKD management centers on **slowing progression** and **preventing complications** through risk-based, multidisciplinary care [^115hbXMR] [^112gNvW4]. Core therapies include RAAS blockade (ACEi/ARB) [^115VJfVK], SGLT2 inhibitors [^116Y6FA9], and MRAs (finerenone) [^115VJfVK] for patients with albuminuria or diabetes, with blood pressure control [^117NcuD9], glycemic management [^115VJfVK], and lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, smoking cessation) [^111yptto] as foundational measures. For advanced CKD, offer shared decision-making on dialysis modalities (in-center/home HD, PD) [^111PSEse], kidney transplantation [^112v7e2X], or comprehensive conservative care [^111qpKJ1], tailored to patient goals and comorbidities [^113ELHdb]. Regular monitoring of kidney function, electrolytes, anemia, bone-mineral parameters, and cardiovascular risk is essential, with medication review and dose adjustments to avoid nephrotoxins [^112dY1B2] [^115qbrvZ].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle interventions are foundational and should begin early [^113VGjzg]:

- **Dietary management**: Sodium restriction (< 2 g/day), protein intake tailored to CKD stage, and limitation of phosphorus and potassium as needed [^111yptto] [^111uxfQP].
- **Physical activity**: Regular, individualized exercise to improve cardiovascular health and physical function [^114KV17y].
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended to reduce cardiovascular risk and slow CKD progression [^111yptto].
- **Weight management**: Target BMI 20–25 kg/m² to reduce metabolic burden and cardiovascular risk [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological management

Pharmacotherapy is tailored to CKD stage, albuminuria, and comorbidities:

| **Medication class** | **Indication** | **Key agents** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| RAAS inhibitors | - Albuminuria <br/> - Hypertension | - ACE inhibitors <br/> - ARBs | - First-line for CKD with albuminuria [^1139xS8B] <br/> - Monitor for hyperkalemia and renal function changes [^112enros] |
| SGLT2 inhibitors | - CKD with albuminuria <br/> - Diabetes | - Dapagliflozin <br/> - Empagliflozin | - Reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events [^116Y6FA9] <br/> - Use cautiously with eGFR thresholds [^1113Xymz] |
| MRAs | - CKD with diabetes <br/> - Residual albuminuria | Finerenone | - Reduces CKD progression and cardiovascular events [^116EmwEr] <br/> - Monitor potassium [^notfound] |
| Antihypertensives | Hypertension | - Calcium channel blockers <br/> - Beta-blockers | - Use if RAAS inhibitors insufficient [^1139xS8B] <br/> - Individualize targets [^1139xS8B] |
| Antidiabetics | Diabetes with CKD | - Metformin (eGFR ≥ 30) <br/> - GLP-1 receptor agonists | - Metformin first-line [^115vfy31] <br/> - GLP-1 RAs for additional cardiorenal benefit [^112VEpub] |
| Statins | - CKD with ASCVD risk | - Atorvastatin <br/> - Rosuvastatin | Recommended for cardiovascular risk reduction [^115dGtHR] [^116EmwEr] |

## Management of complications

CKD complications require proactive management:

- **Anemia**: Iron supplementation and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) as indicated, with hemoglobin targets individualized [^111nsaSA] [^115WRST1].
- **Mineral and bone disorder**: Phosphate binders, vitamin D analogs, and calcimimetics to control calcium, phosphate, and PTH [^notfound].
- **Acid-base and electrolyte disturbances**: Sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis, dietary potassium restriction, and potassium binders as needed [^116EmwEr].
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Aggressive management of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes [^117Mdo55] [^115dGtHR] [^115VJfVK].

---

## Renal replacement therapy (RRT)

When CKD progresses to ESRD, **RRT options** include:

- **Hemodialysis (HD)**: In-center or home HD, with vascular access planning (AVF/AVG or catheter) [^113zvyNg] [^112gNvW4].
- **Peritoneal dialysis (PD)**: Home-based, suitable for patients preferring flexibility [^1179PNZq].
- **Kidney transplantation**: Preferred modality for eligible patients, offering improved survival and quality of life [^112v7e2X].
- **Conservative management**: Comprehensive non-dialytic care focusing on symptom control and quality of life, appropriate for elderly or comorbid patients [^111qpKJ1] [^113ELHdb].

---

## Patient education and shared decision-making

Patient education and shared decision-making are critical: provide **early education** on CKD progression, treatment options, and self-management [^113GEmpB], and use shared decision-making to align treatment choices with patient values, preferences, and goals [^115yxx4m] [^113GEmpB]. Advance care planning should include discussions about end-of-life care, dialysis withdrawal, and conservative management [^111ewG13].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential: track **kidney function** with periodic eGFR and albumin-to-creatinine ratio measurements [^notfound], and monitor complications — including anemia, bone-mineral parameters, electrolytes, and cardiovascular risk — at regular intervals [^notfound]. Conduct **medication reviews** periodically to assess adherence, interactions, and dose adjustments [^112dY1B2].

---

CKD care is **multidisciplinary and individualized**, combining lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, complication management, and RRT or conservative care, with shared decision-making and regular monitoring to optimize outcomes [^112gNvW4].

VA/DoD chronic kidney disease — recommendation status and strength for SDM and referral are described as follows: "Recommendation 8 is Not reviewed, Not changed, while Recommendations 9 and 10 are Not reviewed, Amended; hence, the Work Group did not conduct an updated evidence review but reviewed the evidence identified in the 2019 VA/DOD CKD CPG". The Work Group states that "the benefits of SDM in the care of patients with progressive kidney disease outweigh the harms/burdens", that "Timely education for patients with progressive CKD is essential so that they can articulate their goals of care and make an informed decision about the direction of their treatment", and that "Early referral facilitates adequate preparation for whichever treatment option the patient chooses (i.e., vascular access placement or palliative care referral)". It further reports that "The Work Group decided to carry forward three Weak for recommendations, two of which were combined into 2025 Recommendation 9, and one Neither for nor against recommendation, suggesting the utilization of SDM involving the patient, caregivers, the PCP, and the nephrology team to achieve patient-centered treatment goals".

### Updates to management of adults with chronic kidney disease… [^116EmwEr]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM INHIBITORS Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, which include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, have a well-established history of reducing all-cause mortality and providing renal and cardioprotective benefits in adults who have CKD with or without diabetes. For patients with nonemergent hyperkalemia, the KDIGO guideline has shifted away from recommending reflexive discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Instead, management suggestions include reviewing modifiable factors such as dietary potassium intake, eliminating medications that increase serum potassium, and prescribing potassium-lowering medications such as diuretics when appropriate. The National Kidney Foundation provides a patient-friendly overview of high- and low-potassium foods in English and Spanish. Referral to a nephrologist may also be appropriate.

Clinicians can initiate newer potassium-binding agents such as patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These are well-tolerated and safe for long-term use compared with earlier agents. SODIUM-GLUCOSE COTRANSPORTER-2 INHIBITORS Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors reduce risk of acute kidney injury and progression to kidney failure and provide cardioprotective benefits for adults with CKD and type 2 diabetes. 1 Such tools include the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation CKD patch and the Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events calculator. The KDIGO guideline emphasizes use of statins in most patients with CKD. 1 Statins that do not require renal dosing adjustments include the high-intensity statin atorvastatin and moderate-intensity statins pravastatin and simvastatin.

Rosuvastatin is a high-intensity statin requiring dosing adjustment, with a maximum recommended dose of 10 mg/day if the creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min/1. 73 m
2. NONSTEROIDAL MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS Finerenone is the only nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist available in the United States. It slows CKD progression and reduces cardiovascular risk, specifically hospitalizations for heart failure, in adults with CKD and type 2 diabetes.

### The burden of kidney disease: improving global outcomes [^112KbZzp]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem. There is an increasing incidence and prevalence of patients with kidney failure requiring replacement therapy, with poor outcomes and high cost. There is an even higher prevalence of patients in earlier stages of CKD, with adverse outcomes such as kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and premature death. Patients at earlier stages of CKD can be detected through laboratory testing and their treatment is effective in slowing the progression to kidney failure and reducing cardiovascular events. The science and evidence-based care of these patients are universal and independent of their geographic location. There is a clear need to develop a uniform and global public health approach to the worldwide epidemic of CKD. It is to this end that a new initiative "Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes" has been established. Its stated mission is "Improve the care and outcomes of kidney disease patients worldwide through promoting coordination, collaboration and integration of initiatives to develop and implement clinical practice guidelines".

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension, lifestyle modifications, KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend to modify the form and intensity of physical activity as necessary in individual patients, recognizing that there may still be important health benefits even if the physical activity falls below the targets proposed for the general population.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1113Xymz]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, SGLT-2 inhibitors, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate an SGLT-2 inhibitor with demonstrated benefit in patients with T2DM and CKD (eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m²) to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events.

---

### An integrated approach to care for patients with chronic kidney disease [^112VbdpB]. Seminars in Dialysis (2003). Low credibility.

Although the Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines serve to integrate the multiple stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), in practice, the treatment of kidney disease over its progressive course may be somewhat fragmented. Because the provision of integrated care across the stages of kidney disease, is likely to be advantageous for both patients and care providers, a conceptual framework which graphically depicts the complex and chronic nature of kidney disease may prove useful. The Life Options Rehabilitation Advisory Council (LORAC) proposes a cycle diagram to reflect the chronicity and complexity of kidney disease and to emphasize a holistic perception of kidney disease from its inception to the worst-case scenario outcome of kidney failure. The kidney disease cycle conceptualization can serve as a patient teaching aid and as a reminder of the communication, collaboration, and cooperation that are required among primary care physicians and practitioners in each of the specialty areas that address the spectrum of kidney disease.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors for adults with chronic kidney disease: a clinical practice guideline [^116Y6FA9]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors on survival and on cardiovascular and kidneyoutcomes for adults living with chronic kidney disease (CKD)?

Current Practice

Few therapies slow kidney disease progression and improve long term prognosis for adults living with CKD. SGLT-2 inhibitors have demonstrated cardiovascular and kidney benefits in adults with CKD with and without type 2 diabetes. Existing guidance for SGLT-2 inhibitors does not account for the totality of current best evidence for adults with CKD and does not provide fully stratified treatment effects and recommendations across all risk groups based on risk of CKD progression and complications.

Recommendations

The guideline panel considered evidence regarding benefits and harms of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy for adults with CKD over a five year period, along with contextual factors, and provided the following recommendations:1. For adults at low risk of CKD progression and complications, we suggest administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (weak recommendation in favour)2. For adults at moderate risk of CKD progression and complications, we suggest administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (weak recommendation in favour)3. For adults at high risk of CKD progression and complications, we recommend administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (strong recommendation in favour)4. For adults at very high risk of CKD progression and complications, we recommend administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (strong recommendation in favour). Recommendations are applicable to all adults with CKD, irrespective of type 2 diabetes status.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel identified typical risk strata of adults with CKD (from low to very high risk of CKD progression and related complications) using the classification system developed by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and applied an individual patient perspective in moving from evidence to recommendations. Effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors were interpreted in absolute terms applicable to different risk strata with varying baseline risks for outcomes of benefit over a five year period. The panel explicitly considered the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens of starting an SGLT-2 inhibitor, incorporating the values and preferences of adults with different risk profiles. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids accompany multilayered recommendations, developed in an online authoring and publication platform (www.magicapp.org) that allows reuse and adaptation.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and pairwise meta-analysis (13 trials including 29614 participants) of benefits and harms associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors in adults with CKD with or without type 2 diabetes informed guidance. Among individuals at very high risk of CKD progression and complications, moderate to high certainty evidence shows SGLT-2 inhibitors (relative to placebo or standard care without SGLT-2 inhibitors) decrease all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure, kidney failure, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. Among individuals at high risk, moderate to high certainty evidence shows SGLT-2 inhibitors result in similar benefits across outcomes except demonstrating little or no effect on hospitalisation for heart failure and kidney failure. Among individuals at moderate and low risk, moderate to high certainty evidence shows SGLT-2 inhibitors probably reduce all-cause mortality and non-fatal stroke, with little or no effect for other outcomes of benefit. Risk-stratified estimates were unavailable for outcomes of harm; the panel therefore considered absolute effects summarised across risk strata. SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with little or no effect on acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, bone fractures, lower limb amputations, ketoacidosis, genital infections, or symptomatic hypovolaemia, although a residual possibility of harms at the individual patient level remains.

Understanding The Recommendation

In order to apply recommendations, clinicians must appropriately identify adults with CKD, consider the underlying aetiology, and risk stratify them based on glomerular filtration rate (estimated or measured) and degree of albuminuria. In addition to classifying individuals into risk strata, further estimation of a given patient's risk based on the extent of their kidney disease and other comorbidities may be warranted to inform individual-level decisions and shared decision making. Available risk calculators may help estimate a given patient's risk of CKD progression and complications.

### Endothelin antagonism for patients with chronic kidney disease: still a hope for the future [^113V3B2Q]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Endothelin is tightly involved in the regulation of vascular and renal function in health and in disease. In a variety of animal models of kidney disease, endothelin promotes renal injury through effects on inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, experimental data strongly suggest that blocking the actions of endothelin should be beneficial in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, despite encouraging pre-clinical and clinical evidence, endothelin antagonists are not yet an established treatment option in patients with chronic kidney disease. This article reviews key physiological and pathophysiological aspects of the endothelin system in the vasculature and the kidney, as well as results of pre-clinical and clinical studies on the use of endothelin antagonists in chronic kidney disease. We will also provide an outlook on the future of endothelin antagonism in this area, and issues to be resolved before endothelin antagonists are to become a reality for patients with chronic kidney disease.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease: 2007 update of hemoglobin target [^115WRST1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI anemia in chronic kidney disease — Selection of the hemoglobin (Hb) target and the Hb level for initiating erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy is stated for "the individual patient with CKD and anemia" and "should include consideration of potential benefits (including improvement in quality of life and avoidance of transfusion) and potential harms (including the risk of life-threatening adverse events)", with the Work Group concluding that "improvement in quality of life and avoidance of transfusion are the most likely treatment benefits and that there is potential for harm when aiming for high Hb targets". In randomized controlled trials, initiation "has generally been initiated when the baseline Hb decreases within, at, or less than the assigned Hb target". The evidence base "does not allow precise recommendations for each individual patient", and these limitations "argue for engaging the patient and for maintaining flexibility when setting Hb targets for ESA therapy". Regarding health-related quality of life (HRQoL), "Most studies show some improvement in HRQoL in patients assigned to higher Hb targets compared with those assigned to lower Hb targets", although "there is heterogeneity in the HRQoL domains showing benefit in the higher Hb treatment group by instrument and by report". Reported benefits span multiple domains using validated instruments, including the "36-Item Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey" and the "Kidney Disease Questionnaire", and "The improvement in HRQoL with higher Hb targets has been seen in the earliest assessment performed, even in studies in which treatment assignment was masked to participating patients". Over time, "HRQoL scores deteriorate over time in dialysis patients", and "HRQoL benefits of higher Hb targets diminish over time", though effects "have been seen in some domains to persist for at least 2 years".

### Recommendations for the care of patients receiving conservative kidney management: focus on management of CKD and symptoms [^111qpKJ1]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conservative kidney management is increasingly accepted as an appropriate treatment option for patients with eGFR category 5 CKD who are unlikely to benefit from dialysis and/or who choose a nondialysis care option. However, there remains great variation in the delivery of their care. As part of the development of a conservative kidney management pathway that is undergoing evaluation, a set of recommendations specific to conservative kidney management for managing the complications of CKD and common symptoms was developed. These recommendations focus on the patient's values and preferences and aim to optimize comfort and quality of life. Explanations for the interventions are provided to support the shared decision-making process between health care professionals, patients, and family members. The recommendations generally emphasize the preservation of function (cognitive, physical, and kidney) and address symptom burden, acknowledging that management priorities can change over time. The recommendations should be used in conjunction with other key elements of conservative kidney management, including clear communication and shared decision making for choosing conservative kidney management, advance care planning, and psychosocial support. Although there are limitations to the existing evidence specific to conservative kidney management, these recommendations are intended as a starting point toward reaching consensus and generating further evidence.

### 2022 Canadian Cardiovascular Society guideline for use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiorenal risk reduction in adults [^114zgPXV]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to SGLT-2 inhibitors, CCS 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate SGLT-2 inhibitors to reduce the composite of significant decline in eGFR, progression to end-stage kidney disease, or kidney death, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for HF in adult patients with CKD (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 20 mg/mmol and eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m²).

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^113dTXV6]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, older adults with advanced CKD are likely to die from non-renal failure related conditions before they are faced with a decision concerning dialysis. Exceptions to this scenario are patients who lose renal function rapidly and have limited comorbidities. In the US, older adults initiate dialysis early (at eGFR > 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2) and have a high comorbidity burden. Other countries, including Canada and New Zealand, have much lower rates of renal replacement therapy for older adults compared to the US. Although dialysis initiation guidelines emphasize the presence of renal failure symptoms as justification to start dialysis, many older adults start dialysis preemptively, in the face of non-specific, often comorbidity related symptoms. These new dialysis patients are generally not informed about non-dialysis, conservative management options. To remedy this situation, an interdisciplinary team effort by health care providers, should consist of early and repeated discussions with patients and their families regarding a patient's preferences and goals in the context of the potential benefits and harms of dialysis initiation. Conservative management may be a reasonable choice for patients whose primary goal is to maintain their independence and to avoid the time, pain, and discomfort related to dialysis, as well as for patients with poor functional status and a predicted post dialysis initiation projected survival of less than three months. Future studies should examine knowledge, attitudes and decision support interventions that could benefit older adults and their providers when making decisions regarding management of advanced CKD. As well, more data is needed on outcomes of conservative and dialytic management and characteristics of older adults who would benefit from each of these approaches.

### Chronic kidney disease and arrhythmias: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^114Jthto]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are predisposed to heart rhythm disorders, including atrial fibrillation (AF)/atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardias, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). While treatment options, including drug, device, and procedural therapies, are available, their use in the setting of CKD is complex and limited. Patients with CKD and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) have historically been under-represented or excluded from randomized trials of arrhythmia treatment strategies, although this situation is changing. Cardiovascular society consensus documents have recently identified evidence gaps for treating patients with CKD and heart rhythm disorders.

To identify key issues relevant to the optimal prevention, management, and treatment of arrhythmias and their complications in patients with kidney disease, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) convened an international, multidisciplinary Controversies Conference in Berlin, Germany, titled CKD and Arrhythmias in October 2016. The conference agenda and discussion questions are available on the KDIGO website (13 February 2018).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^116xcDSF]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Appendix E — patient focus group findings report patient priorities for chronic kidney disease (CKD) care, noting that participants emphasized the importance of CKD screening and follow-up to ensure an accurate, timely diagnosis, advocated for the proper use of laboratory tests to screen and accurately diagnose CKD, and urged providers to attentively follow up on test results to diagnose CKD in a timely manner. Participants expressed the need for more information from providers on how to better prevent CKD progression and stabilize their disease, stated that their desire to stabilize their kidney function is driven by a preference to avoid dialysis and prolong the life of their transplanted kidney, and asserted that providers could support them by supplying more information on how to better manage their CKD. Participants valued effective patient-provider communication and emphasized the importance of direct and timely communication with providers, appreciated a multidisciplinary team approach when creating treatment plans and advocated for using this approach to create consistent diet plans, and used a variety of delivery options to receive care, including telehealth and face-to-face visits.

### Perceived knowledge among patients cared for by nephrologists about chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease therapies [^117QX5Eq]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

The need to educate patients in order to enable them to participate in making appropriate choices for all therapeutic options in end stage renal disease would seem obvious yet there are many barriers to providing such information. We measured 'perceived knowledge' of the therapeutic options for end stage renal disease in a cohort of patients with chronic kidney disease in established treatment programs. A self administered questionnaire was given to 676 patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease as part of the CRIOS study designed to identify trends in practice patterns and outcomes over a 4 year period. The median patient age was 66, about three-fourths were Caucasian and almost half were diabetic. When patients were asked to rate their level of knowledge, about one-third reported limited or no understanding of their chronic kidney disease and no awareness regarding their treatment options. A significant and substantial number of patients indicated they had no familiarity with transplant, hemodialysis, and continuous ambulatory or automated peritoneal dialysis. Perceived knowledge improved with the progression of kidney disease and frequency of nephrology visits; however, only about half of patients with 4 or more nephrology appointments in the prior year reported knowing of hemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or transplant. Age, gender and disease had no impact on levels of patient knowledge, but African-Americans reported having significantly less understanding than Asians or Caucasians. These findings suggest that the lack of perception concerning the treatment options chronic kidney and end stage renal disease reflects, in part, problems with the education of patients by nephrologists and not a lack of referral of these patients to nephrologists for care. The discrepancy of perceived knowledge between African-Americans and other races needs special attention.

### Caring for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: dietary options and conservative care instead of maintenance dialysis [^113Reg7h]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

An expert advisory board discussed the prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with a focus on dietary options. This is timely, given the uptake of value based models for kidney care in the United States. Timing of dialysis start is influenced by patients' clinical status and complex patient-clinician interactions. Patients value personal freedom and quality of life and may want to delay dialysis, whilst physicians are sometimes more concerned with clinical outcomes. Kidney-preserving therapy can prolong the dialysis-free period and preserve residual kidney function, thus patients are asked to adjust their lifestyle and diet, to follow a low- or very low-protein diet, with or without ketoacid analogues. Multi-modal approaches include pharmacotherapies, management of symptoms, and a gradual, individualized dialysis transition. Patient empowerment is vital, including CKD education and involvement in decision making. These ideas may help patients, their families, and clinical teams to improve the management of CKD.

### Age and treatment of kidney failure [^112WFxJA]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses issues related to treatment of chronic kidney disease, and kidney failure in particular, among older adults.

Recent Findings

A substantial proportion of older adults have chronic kidney disease and progress to kidney failure. There is considerable variability in treatment practices for advanced kidney disease among older adults, and evidence that treatment decisions such as dialysis initiation may be made without adequate preparation. When initiated, survival among older adults on chronic dialysis remains poor, and is associated with a significant decline in functional status. There is also evidence to suggest that dialysis initiation may not reflect overall treatment goals of elderly patients, but rather a lack of clear communication between patients and health practitioners, and underdeveloped conservative care programs in many centers.

Summary

Kidney failure is common among older adults. When considering treatment options for kidney failure, patient priorities, preferences, and symptoms should be taken into account, using a shared decision-making approach.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^113cf2UM]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 3.1 - treatment of Anaemia - Erythropoiesis stimulating agents

We recommend that treatment with Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) should be offered to patients with anaemia of CKD who are likely to benefit in terms of quality of life and physical function and to avoid blood transfusion; especially in patients considered suitable for transplantation. (1B)

Audit measure

Proportion of patients on renal replacement therapy (on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis for more than 3 months) with Hb level < 100 g/L who are not prescribed an ESA.

Rationale

Treatment of anaemia in CKD with ESA can be expensive, takes time to work and carries a small but significant risk to the patient. It is therefore reasonable, as with any therapy, to treat only those who are expected to benefit in the time frame that therapy is being considered. For example, patients with severe sepsis/inflammation/acute bleeding are unlikely to respond.

Patients with a very short life expectancy (days or weeks) are not likely to survive long enough for therapy to provide benefit in terms of an increase in Hb. The clinician and patient should agree on a therapeutic plan and, at an appropriate time, review whether therapy is providing enough benefit to continue treatment.

Guideline 3.2 - treatment of Anaemia - choice of ESA

We recommend that the decision on the choice of ESA is based on local availability of ESAs. (1B)

Audit measure

Each renal unit should audit the type, route and frequency of administration and weekly dose of ESA prescribed.

Rationale

Many studies have been published comparing different ESA products against each other when used at different dosing intervals, by different routes of administration and in different patient groups. All the available products are efficacious when administered according to the manufacturers' recommendations. The choice of ESA will be dependent upon the clinician and patient agreeing a management plan and local supply arrangements.

Guideline 3.3 - treatment of Anaemia with ESA therapy - target Hb

We suggest that patients with CKD on ESA therapy should achieve Hb between:
100 and 120 g/L in adults, young people and children aged 2 years and older (2B)
95 and 115 g/L in children younger than 2 years of age (reflecting the lower normal range in that age (2B)

Guideline 3.4 - treatment of Anaemia without ESA therapy - target Hb

We suggest that these Hb targets apply exclusively to patients receiving ESA and are not intended to apply to the treatment of iron deficiency in patients receiving iron therapy without the use of ESAs. (2B)

### Chronic kidney disease: the global challenge [^111cw9EV]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

The worldwide rise in the number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and consequent end-stage renal failure necessitating renal replacement therapy is threatening to reach epidemic proportions over the next decade, and only a small number of countries have robust economies able to meet the challenges posed. A change in global approach to CKD from treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to much more aggressive primary and secondary prevention is therefore imperative. In this Seminar, we examine the epidemiology of CKD worldwide, with emphasis on early detection and prevention, and the feasibility of methods for detection and primary prevention of CKD. We also review the risk factors and markers of progressive CKD. We explore current understanding of the mechanisms underlying renal scarring leading to ESRD to inform on current and future interventions as well as evidence relating to interventions to slow the progression of CKD. Finally, we make strategic recommendations based on future research to stem the worldwide growth of CKD. Consideration is given to health economics. A global and concerted approach to CKD must be adopted in both more and less developed countries to avoid a major catastrophe.

### Diabetes management in chronic kidney disease: a consensus report by the American diabetes association (ADA) and kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) [^115VJfVK]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

People with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for kidney failure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and premature mortality. Recent clinical trials support new approaches to treat diabetes and CKD. The 2022 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease each provide evidence-based recommendations for management. A joint group of ADA and KDIGO representatives reviewed and developed a series of consensus statements to guide clinical care from the ADA and KDIGO guidelines. The published guidelines are aligned in the areas of CKD screening and diagnosis, glycemia monitoring, lifestyle therapies, treatment goals, and pharmacologic management. Recommendations include comprehensive care in which pharmacotherapy that is proven to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes is layered on a foundation of healthy lifestyle. Consensus statements provide specific guidance on use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, and a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. These areas of consensus provide clear direction for implementation of care to improve clinical outcomes of people with diabetes and CKD.

### Going upstream: coordination to improve CKD care [^115uwdX2]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Care coordination for patients with chronic kidney disease has been shown to be effective in improving outcomes and reducing costs. However, few patients with CKD benefit from this systematic management of their kidney disease and other medical conditions. As a result, outcomes for patients with kidney disease are not optimal, and their cost of care is increased. For those patients who transition to kidney failure treatment in the United States, the transition does not go as well as it could. The effectiveness of treatments to delay progression of kidney disease in contemporary clinical practice does not match the efficacy of these treatments in clinical trials. Conservative care for kidney disease, which should be an option for patients who are very old and very sick, is not considered often enough or seriously enough. Opportunities for early and even pre-emptive transplantation are missed, as are opportunities for home dialysis. The process of dialysis access creation is rarely optimal. The consequence is care which is not as good as it could be, and much more expensive than it should be. We describe our initial efforts to implement care coordination for chronic kidney disease in routine clinical care and attempt to project some of the benefits to patients and the cost savings.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111nsaSA]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Anaemia is a commonly diagnosed complication among patients suffering with chronic kidney disease. If left untreated, it may affect patient quality of life. There are several causes for anaemia in this patient population. As the kidney function deteriorates, together with medications and dietary restrictions, patients may develop iron deficiency, resulting in reduction of iron supply to the bone marrow (which is the body organ responsible for the production of different blood elements). Chronic kidney disease patients may not be able to utilise their own body's iron stores effectively and hence, many patients, particularly those receiving haemodialysis, may require additional iron treatment, usually provided by infusion. With further weakening of kidney function, patients with chronic kidney disease may need additional treatment with a substance called erythropoietin which drives the bone marrow to produce its own blood. This substance, which is naturally produced by the kidneys, becomes relatively deficient in patients with chronic kidney disease. Any patients will eventually require treatment with erythropoietin or similar products that are given by injection. Over the last few years, several iron and erythropoietin products have been licensed for treating anaemia in chronic kidney disease patients. In addition, several publications discussed the benefits of each treatment and possible risks associated with long term treatment. The current guidelines provide advice to health care professionals on how to screen chronic kidney disease patients for anaemia, which patients to investigate for other causes of anaemia, when and how to treat patients with different medications, how to ensure safe prescribing of treatment and how to diagnose and manage complications associated with anaemia and the drugs used for its treatment.

### Evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease: synopsis of the kidney disease: improving global outcomes 2024 clinical practice guideline [^115dGtHR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization updated its existing clinical practice guideline in 2024 to provide guidance on the evaluation, management, and treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults and children who are not receiving kidney replacement therapy.

Methods

The KDIGO CKD Guideline Work Group defined the scope of the guideline and determined topics for systematic review. An independent Evidence Review Team systematically reviewed the evidence and graded the certainty of evidence for each of the review topics. Latest searches of the English-language literature were done in July 2023. Final modification of the guideline was informed by a public review process during summer of 2023 involving registered stakeholders.

Recommendations

The full guideline included 28 recommendations and 141 practice points. This synopsis focuses on the recommendations that have the greatest evidence. Practice points reflect the expert opinion of the group where evidence is not that strong. Recommendations include greater emphasis on cystatin C for assessment of glomerular filtration rate, point-of-care testing in remote areas, a shift to an individualized risk-based approach to predict kidney failure, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for some patients with CKD with and without diabetes, and statin use for adults older than 50 years and CKD. Together the recommendations and practice points provide guidance for how to evaluate and manage persons with CKD.

### Iron dosing in kidney disease: inconsistency of evidence and clinical practice [^115Gg7am]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

The management of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is difficult. The availability of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) has increased treatment options for previously transfusion-requiring patients, but the recent evidence of ESA side effects has prompted the search for complementary or alternative approaches. Next to ESA, parenteral iron supplementation is the second main form of anemia treatment. However, as of now, no systematic approach has been proposed to balance the concurrent administration of both agents according to individual patient's needs. Furthermore, the potential risks of excessive iron dosing remain a topic of controversy. How, when and whether to monitor CKD patients for potential iron overload remain to be elucidated. This review addresses the question of risk and benefit of iron administration in CKD, highlights the evidence supporting current practice, provides an overview of standard and potential new markers of iron status and outlines a new pharmacometric approach to physiologically compatible individualized dosing of ESA and iron in CKD patients.

### The views of patients and carers in treatment decision making for chronic kidney disease: systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies [^115z4o8b]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Clinical guidelines in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe, and Australasia recommend that treatment options for chronic kidney disease include the preference of a fully informed patient. In the UK alone, 7000 patients a year progress to end stage kidney disease requiring transplantation, dialysis, or "supportive non-dialytic" (palliative) care. For most of these patients progression to end stage kidney disease can be anticipated, enabling patients' preferences for treatment to be incorporated into their care. Recent data from observational studies and the US Renal Data System, however, suggest that patients with chronic kidney disease may not be presented with adequate information on treatment options or given sufficient time in which to discuss management alternatives with their families or carers. Low rates of kidney transplantation in patients on low incomes and those from minority ethnic groups also suggest that patient and family preferences are not being taken into account.

Although large numbers of patients with chronic kidney disease exist worldwide, data on the factors that influence preferences for treatment from a patient or carer perspective are limited. Qualitative research methods used in focus groups or in-depth interviewing have the advantage of reporting the attitudes, feelings, and beliefs of patients, allowing readers some insight into their perspective. A synthesis of findings from several qualitative studies in chronic kidney disease has the ability to achieve a greater conceptual understanding of the topic beyond a single empirical study. Thematic synthesis, as first described in 1988, draws on the findings of original studies and uses those findings as data in a subsequent analysis. This allows readers to appreciate what has been discovered, build on what is already known, and translate these findings into their own clinical practice.

Awareness of the factors associated with decision making in the treatment of chronic kidney disease can provide health professionals with evidence on how best to deliver education programmes for patients and their families; it may also enhance communication and improve the capacity for patient and family involvement in shared decision making. We synthesised and analysed the views of patients and their informal carers on decision making in the treatment of chronic kidney disease and determined which factors influenced decisions about treatment.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^111Z19vM]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Beginning in 1972, government funding for dialysis treatment and renal transplantation became available in the US. Over time the dialysis population shifted from a younger, healthier cohort to an older, more medically complex group of patients. Between 1980 and 2012 patients aged 65–74 initiating dialysis increased by 47% while those aged ≥ 75 (older adults) increased by 300%. Dialysis can be a life-extending treatment for patients of all ages, but one year mortality for older dialysis starts in the US was 41%, as compared to 28% for the those aged 65–74 and 17% for patients aged 45–64. In addition to limited life expectancy, many older adults experience functional decline and increased episodes of hospitalization after starting dialysis.

### Patient preferences for kidney failure treatments [^112UHP3a]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

This review considers what is important to people making decisions about their kidney failure care. We begin by introducing the concept of preferences and how preference-sensitive decision-making is central to person-centered care. Next, we explore the preferences that patients have in relation to kidney failure care and the attributes of available treatments. We examine how decisions are made about kidney failure treatments and consider whether preference-sensitive care is widespread. Finally, we make recommendations regarding how kidney services could be reshaped to ensure that people's preferences guide the healthcare they receive. We conclude that people's preferences can guide decisions between treatments for kidney failure only if clinicians and systems facilitate this. The best treatment for a person is the one that fits best with what is important to them. The science of nephrology involves optimal delivery of treatments that prolong life, preserve and replace organ function. The art lies in shaping this care to the person.

### Why we need clinical practice guidelines in chronic kidney disease [^117Hh12L]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have become an essential, useful, and integral part of the practice of medicine in general and for the care of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in particular. The reasons why CPGs have proven useful are related to the need of physicians, patients, and providers. Physician needs stem from the overwhelming amount of new information generated that requires systematic analysis, synthesis, and translation into specific clinically applicable recommendations. Patient needs arise from the desire of an increasingly well-informed public seeking evidence-based information in making joint decisions with their physicians. Provider needs derive from the necessity of appropriate criteria in assessing improved outcomes and in closing existing quality chasms in health care delivery. It is in the one patient one physician clinical encounter setting that guidelines are likely at their best in helping make appropriate decisions in each specific situation. All other uses of CPGs, no matter how meritorious, are secondary derivatives.

### Factors that lead to dialysis as the preferred treatment modality for patients with chronic kidney disease [^113zVKYX]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To describe forces that lead to dialysis as the preferred treatment modality for patients with chronic kidney disease.

Recent Findings

Although chronic dialysis is life-saving and the only option available for many individuals, treatment of the underlying causes of kidney disease and transplantation may be preferable options for many patients. Factors that favor dialysis instead of treatment of underlying kidney disease or transplantation include lack of proper diagnosis, lack of proper treatment of underlying kidney disease, poor compliance, lack of consideration for transplantation, early initiation of dialysis therapy, and financial incentives. New developments that may reverse this trend include genetic panels that improve diagnosis of kidney disease, new methods of transplantation, and legislation that will encourage kidney transplantation.

Summary

By recognizing factors that favor dialysis over other therapies, nephrologists may be better able to provide care to their patients and prevent dialysis, researchers may be able to focus on research that will prevent the need for dialysis, and professional societies may work to prevent unneeded dialysis.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^116WbBGr]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Matters most to me — patient-centered CKD care and SDM: CKD patients face complex decisions and often need to make trade-offs, and some options such as initiation of dialysis have tremendous impact on lifestyle and quality of life (QoL) (see Recommendations 8–11); clinicians should assist patients in formulating and verbalizing goals of care when needed, include patient preferences and priorities for SDM that support the patient's goals of care, complete a life sustaining treatment directive (e.g., living will), and use conservative kidney management decision aids which may be useful.

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease: known knowns and known unknowns [^114YYuwL]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) updates the KDIGO 2012 guideline and has been developed with patient partners, clinicians, and researchers around the world, using robust methodology. This update, based on a substantially broader base of evidence than has previously been available, reflects an exciting time in nephrology. New therapies and strategies have been tested in large and diverse populations that help to inform care; however, this guideline is not intended for people receiving dialysis nor those who have a kidney transplant. The document is sensitive to international considerations, CKD across the lifespan, and discusses special considerations in implementation. The scope includes chapters dedicated to the evaluation and risk assessment of people with CKD, management to delay CKD progression and its complications, medication management and drug stewardship in CKD, and optimal models of CKD care. Treatment approaches and actionable guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations which followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. The limitations of the evidence are discussed. The guideline also provides practice points, which serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematic review was not conducted, and it includes useful infographics and describes an important research agenda for the future. It targets a broad audience of people with CKD and their healthcare, while being mindful of implications for policy and payment.

### Risk-directed management of chronic kidney disease [^1172uUXK]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

The timely and rational institution of therapy is a key step towards reducing the global burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is a heterogeneous entity with varied aetiologies and diverse trajectories, which include risk of kidney failure but also cardiovascular events and death. Developments in the past decade include substantial progress in CKD risk prediction, driven in part by the accumulation of electronic health records data. In addition, large randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in reducing adverse events in CKD, greatly expanding the options for effective therapy. Alongside angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, these classes of medication have been proposed to be the four pillars of CKD pharmacotherapy. However, all of these drug classes are underutilized, even in individuals at high risk. Leveraging prognostic estimates to guide therapy could help clinicians to prescribe CKD-related therapies to those who are most likely to benefit from their use. Risk-based CKD management thus aligns patient risk and care, allowing the prioritization of absolute benefit in determining therapeutic selection and timing. Here, we discuss CKD prognosis tools, evidence-based management and prognosis-guided therapies.

### Management options for an older adult with advanced chronic kidney disease and dementia: grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115g7c6T]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

About 15% of adults in the United States-37 million persons-have chronic kidney disease (CKD). Chronic kidney disease is divided into 5 groups, ranging from stage 1 to stage 5 CKD, whereas end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is defined as permanent kidney failure. The treatment options for ESKD are kidney replacement therapy (KRT) and conservative management. The options for KRT include hemodialysis (either in-center or at home), peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplant. Conservative management, a multidisciplinary model of care for patients with stage 5 CKD who want to avoid dialysis, is guided by patient values, preferences, and goals, with a focus on quality of life and symptom management. In 2015, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommended that patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 be educated about options for both KRT and conservative management. In 2018, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended that assessment for KRT or conservative management start at least 1 year before the need for therapy. It also recommended that in choosing a management approach, predicted quality of life, predicted life expectancy, patient preferences, and other patient factors be considered, because little difference in outcomes has been found among options. Here, 2 experts-a nephrologist and a general internist-palliative care physician-reflect on the care of a patient with advanced CKD and mild to moderate dementia. They discuss the management options for patients with advanced CKD, the pros and cons of each method, and how to help a patient choose among the options.

### Evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease: synopsis of the kidney disease: improving global outcomes 2012 clinical practice guideline [^115kB7DC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Description

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization developed clinical practice guidelines in 2012 to provide guidance on the evaluation, management, and treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults and children who are not receiving renal replacement therapy.

Methods

The KDIGO CKD Guideline Development Work Group defined the scope of the guideline, gathered evidence, determined topics for systematic review, and graded the quality of evidence that had been summarized by an evidence review team. Searches of the English-language literature were conducted through November 2012. Final modification of the guidelines was informed by the KDIGO Board of Directors and a public review process involving registered stakeholders.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^1137jew8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis adequacy — preparation for kidney failure (CPG 1.1): Patients who reach chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 (estimated GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) should receive timely education about kidney failure and options for its treatment, including kidney transplantation, peritoneal dialysis (PD), hemodialysis (HD) in the home or in-center, and conservative treatment, and patients' family members and caregivers also should be educated about treatment choices for kidney failure (B).

### Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease: pathophysiological insights and therapeutic options [^116AwsfP]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Patients with CKD have high cardiovascular risk, with cardiovascular death being the leading cause of death. Several novel therapies to decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases in CKD are in clinical development or have been already established, raising the hope that cardiovascular risk in patients with CKD may be modifiable in the future. Still, the lack of data from large cardiovascular outcome trials in the high-risk group of patients with CKD should be a call for action to ensure that novel therapeutic options are assessed in dedicated trials in the CKD population, in particular in those with advanced CKD, thus paving the way toward a more evidence-based approach to reduce cardiovascular risk in CKD.

### The views of patients and carers in treatment decision making for chronic kidney disease: systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies [^117BDYeG]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Gaining knowledge of options

The theme gaining knowledge of options described the ways in which the patients and their carers learnt about treatment options, and the factors influencing their decision making. Peer influence referred to the impact of other patients' experiences on treatment decision making. Timing of information related to the provision of information on treatment options along the trajectory of chronic kidney disease, with reference to other events such as hospital admissions for acute illness or creation of vascular access.

Peer influence — Patients were greatly influenced by the experiences of other patients. They imagined themselves in a similar position (for example, looking really well after transplantation or managing a Tenckhoff catheter) and described being inspired to carry out dialysis themselves. Similarly, some patients dismissed a particular therapy after seeing complications in other patients, such as refusing haemodialysis after seeing a swollen and disfigured arm following a fistula operation.

Timing of information — Ten studies reported the importance of the timing of information on treatment options. Patients recounted being too unwell to take in the information presented or too rushed into making a decision without having time to discuss the options with their families. Information about kidney transplantation was commonly introduced to patients after dialysis had been established. For some patients information about treatment options came after undergoing surgery for vascular access.

### Novel therapeutic approaches for COVID-19 in chronic kidney disease and transplant [^11499SZP]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel virus responsible for the current worldwide pandemic. The scientific and healthcare communities have made every effort to discover and implement treatment options at a historic pace. Patients with kidney disease are uniquely vulnerable to an infectious pandemic because of their need to be in frequent contact with the healthcare system for life-sustaining renal replacement therapy whether it be by dialysis or transplant.

Recent Findings

The use of targeted viral therapies, extracorporeal therapies, immunosuppressive therapy and public health interventions are important in the management of patients with COVID-19 but require special consideration in patients with kidney disease because of the complexity of their condition.

Summary

Here, we discuss some of the major efforts made to prevent spread and emerging treatment options for this virus, as they pertain to patients with kidney disease.

### Preventing chronic kidney disease and maintaining kidney health: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^115hYWhX]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

To date, the primary focus of chronic kidney disease (CKD) care has been on managing disease progression, complications, and kidney failure. In contrast, maintaining kidney health and preventing CKD have received limited attention, despite their potential to save millions of lives, reduce health care costs, and lessen environmental burdens. The cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) concept frames CKD as part of a complex, high-risk syndrome requiring global risk assessment and multifactorial intervention. CKD incidence along with CKM risk factors may be reduced by a healthy diet, physical activity, and a supportive environment. However, risk for CKD does extend beyond the cardiovascular-metabolic component, and residual risk persists despite healthy lifestyles and treatment of risk factors. Post hoc analyses of clinical trials suggest pharmacological interventions, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, may help to prevent or regress CKD in individuals with type 2 diabetes or obesity. Clinical trials are needed to validate these findings in broader high-risk populations. Personalized strategies to improve kidney health should include CKD risk prediction via targeted testing, genetic or biomarker assessments, shared decision-making, cost considerations, selection of therapeutics, and the potential for adverse effects. The overall goals of CKD prevention should prioritize a lifespan approach to risk evaluation along with safe, efficacious, and accessible interventions to maintain kidney health.

### Recommendations for the screening and management of patients with chronic kidney disease [^117CbiNA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major health problem associated with considerable increase in morbidity and mortality and with decreased quality of life. To slow the progression of kidney failure, to prevent the consequences of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to decrease cardiovascular mortality associated with CKD, it is crucial to detect patients with CKD early and to optimize their care. To assist physicians in patient management, members of a working party for the management of CKD have identified several recommendations for the screening of patients at risk of CKD and for the management of patients with established CKD.

The Kidney Disease

Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease represents the first KDIGO guideline on this subject. The guideline comes at a time when advances in diabetes technology and therapeutics offer new options to manage the large population of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) at high risk of poor health outcomes. An enlarging base of high-quality evidence from randomized clinical trials is available to evaluate important new treatments offering organ protection, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. The goal of the new guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations to optimize the clinical care of people with diabetes and CKD by integrating new options with existing management strategies. In addition, the guideline contains practice points to facilitate implementation when insufficient data are available to make well-justified recommendations or when additional guidance may be useful for clinical application. The guideline covers comprehensive care of patients with diabetes and CKD, glycemic monitoring and targets, lifestyle interventions, antihyperglycemic therapies, and self-management and health systems approaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in chronic kidney disease [^115vfy31]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

The management of patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) encompasses lifestyle modifications, glycemic control with individualized HbA1c targets, and cardiovascular disease risk reduction. Metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors are first-line agents. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are second-line agents. The use of other antidiabetic agents should consider patient preferences, comorbidities, drug costs, and the risk of hypoglycemia. Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors are strongly recommended for patients with diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria. Non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which pose less risk of hyperkalemia than steroidal agents, are undergoing further evaluation among patients with diabetic kidney disease. Here, we discuss important advancements in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

### Meeting the challenges of the new K / DOQI guidelines [^114Y6ggm]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Substantial gains in the dialytic treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease have been made during the past several decades. However, inadequate attention has been given to the problem of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a whole. CKD and its associated complications emerge years before patients develop kidney failure and become dialysis dependent. It now is evident that to improve dialysis outcomes, it is essential for practitioners to recognize the earlier stages of CKD, not only to retard disease progression, but also to prevent and treat its complications and comorbidities long before the need for dialysis arises. The recently published National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines identify the broad-based problem of CKD in the general population and introduce action plans that can be used at the different stages of CKD. This article discusses the process behind the development of the CKD guidelines and highlights the disease evaluation, classification, and stratification system provided by the guidelines. It is hoped that widespread implementation of these recommendations will increase the understanding of CKD among both providers and patients and eliminate many of the obstacles that nephrologists have faced in providing optimal care to dialysis patients in particular and to patients with CKD in general.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^115U3Shf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Dyslipidemia management in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) states that Guideline 4 focuses specifically on patients with diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 5, and the Work Group recommends that people with diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 4 be treated according to current guidelines for groups at high CVD risk. The target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level should be less than 100 mg/dL, with less than 70 mg/dL as a therapeutic option. Lipid-lowering agents in the statin class are the preferred drug therapies; however, treatment with a statin should not be initiated in patients with type 2 diabetes on maintenance hemodialysis therapy who do not have a specific cardiovascular indication for treatment because of negative results for CVD outcomes reported recently in the 4D.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^114jPzmt]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Framework for management of advanced CKD in older adults. The competing risk of death from non renal causes due to comorbidities and slow loss of renal function, < 3 ml/min/1.73 m 2 /year of eGFR, makes the likelihood of the need for a dialysis decision low. Patient's comorbidities and other parameters are used in tools for survival projections. High comorbidity and poor functional status may eliminate any dialysis survival advantage. A patient's priorities and goals should be considered in conjunction with advantages and disadvantages of dialysis (listed in Table 2), in the shared decision process

Table 1
Clinical considerations for discussions about dialysis versus conservative management a

a This table is meant as a framework for ongoing joint decision conversations with older adults, defined as age ≥ 75, with advanced CKD, eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Rate of loss of renal function, a patient's comorbidity level, and episodes of acute declines in kidney function relate to the potential need for a dialysis decision and the choice of dialysis versus conservative management

b Suggested tracks are understood as choices that a patient may make with discussion and advice from the health care team. The tracks are meant to be flexible, since patients may have changes in rate of renal function loss, comorbidities, and may have single or multiple episode of acute renal failure as well as changes in their goals and priorities which may influence their desire to be managed with dialysis versus a conservative (non-dialytic) manner

c Unless otherwise stated, dialysis modality is hemodialysis. There is no definitive data on comparative elderly patient survival with hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis. Issues regarding dialysis modality choice and consideration for renal transplantation are discussed by Berger, et al.

d The conservative track is conservative management, which includes shared decision making, active symptom management, psychosocial and spiritual support, treatment options that focus on a patients priorities which may include a palliative approach with a primary emphasis on relief of a patient's symptoms, with less monitoring and pharmacologic therapy

### The global kidney patient trials network and the CAPTIVATE platform clinical trial design: a trial protocol [^111pRAiM]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How can adaptive platform trials be designed for nephrology?

Findings

The Global Kidney Patient Trials Network (GKPTN) registry has enrolled 4334 patients with chronic kidney disease since May 2020 across 119 sites in 8 countries. The Chronic Kidney Disease Adaptive Platform Trial Investigating Various Agents for Therapeutic Effect (CAPTIVATE) is a platform randomized clinical trial that includes patients with chronic kidney disease and intends to identify new therapeutic options and clinical trial innovations to efficiently test combination therapies using bayesian approaches and trial simulations to estimate sample size.

Meaning

The GKPTN registry and the CAPTIVATE trial could find new treatments for people with kidney disease and change how trials are conducted in patients with kidney disease.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^115yxx4m]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Shared decision making (SDM) for chronic kidney disease (CKD) primary care — Providers are encouraged to use SDM to individualize treatment goals and plans based on patient capabilities, needs, values, and preferences (see Recommendations 8–10). Providers must be adept at presenting information to their patients regarding individual treatments, expected risks, possible outcomes, and levels and/or settings of care, especially where patient heterogeneity in weighing risks and benefits might exist, and the VA and DOD have embraced SDM.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^11364AKr]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Dialysis initiation rates among older adults, aged 75 years or greater, are increasing at a faster rate than for younger age groups. Older adults with advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2) typically lose renal function slowly, often suffer from significant comorbidity and thus may die from associated comorbidities before they require dialysis.

A patient's pattern of renal function loss over time in relation to their underlying comorbidities can serve as a guide to the probability of a future dialysis requirement. Most who start dialysis, initiate treatment "early", at an estimated glomerulofiltration rate (eGFR) > 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and many initiate dialysis in hospital, often in association with an episode of acute renal failure. In the US older adults start dialysis at a mean e GFR of 12.6 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and 20.6% die within six months of dialysis initiation. In both the acute in hospital and outpatient settings, many older adults appear to be initiating dialysis for non-specific, non-life threatening symptoms and clinical contexts. Observational data suggests that dialysis does not provide a survival benefit for older adults with poor mobility and high levels of comorbidity. To optimize the care of this population, early and repeat shared decision making conversations by health care providers, patients, and their families should consider the risks, burdens, and benefits of dialysis versus conservative management, as well as the patient specific symptoms and clinical situations that could justify dialysis initiation. The potential advantages and disadvantages of dialysis therapy should be considered in conjunction with each patient's unique goals and priorities.

In conclusion, when considering the morbidity and quality of life impact associated with dialysis, many older adults may prefer to delay dialysis until there is a definitive indication or may opt for conservative management without dialysis. This approach can incorporate all CKD treatments other than dialysis, provide psychosocial and spiritual support and active symptom management and may also incorporate a palliative care approach with less medical monitoring of lab parameters and more focus on the use of drug therapies directed to relief of a patient's symptoms.

### Changing the choice from dialysis to conservative care or vice versa in older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [^115YCczG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

When kidney function declines, clinical condition often deteriorates and symptoms increase. Intuitively, one may think that increasing uraemic complaints may result in more patients changing their initial choice from CC to dialysis than vice versa. However, no studies have been published presenting aggregated numbers of patients switching their treatment choice. Therefore we aim to assess the number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who made an explicit choice for dialysis or CC and switched their decision afterwards, either from dialysis to CC or from CC to dialysis.

We systematically searched five databases from inception to 25 February 2021 for studies in patients with severely reduced eGFR or kidney failure (CKD stage G4–G5) and choosing either dialysis or CC that compared patient-reported outcomes (HRQoL and symptoms), survival and treatment burden. Detailed methods on search strategy and predefined selection criteria are described elsewhere. For the present analysis we included studies reporting the number of patients switching their (initial) treatment choice in either direction. Studies that started their observations at the (putative) start of dialysis were excluded. Screening of 7634 records resulted in 10 studies that reported the number of patients changing their treatment choice from dialysis to CC or vice versa (Figure 1). (Sub)groups where the decision to withhold dialysis was based on medical grounds only were excluded from the analysis; e.g. patients who started acute dialysis or when their nephrologist decided that dialysis was not appropriate. This was done to ensure that our results reflected a patient group that was allowed to make a treatment choice. Three studies were omitted because of (partly) overlapping study populations; we excluded the studies first published and with the lowest number of CC patients or shortest follow-up duration.

FIGURE 1
Study inclusion and exclusion flow diagram.

a Explanation of reasons for exclusion: No treatment decision yet includes patients with advanced CKD who did not or did not yet have to decide on a preferred treatment (commonly referred to as 'non-dialysis dependent CKD patients'), including four studies discussed with the authors to clarify their CC-like patient group (Verberne et al.); mix of patient groups means mix of different patient categories into one patient group without subgroup analyses (e.g. mix of patients who have not made a treatment decision yet and patients who chose CC); no original research, e.g. reviews, opinion papers or study protocols; no outcomes of interest for the initial systematic reviews, i.e. on HRQoL, symptoms, hospitalization and/or mortality.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^111KnRHF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Commentary and clinical utility — implementation of effective treatment option education and counseling remains a challenge because many patients have low knowledge of their options, emerging evidence suggests that structured delivery of education employing kidney-specific decision aids results in both informed patients and lower levels of decisional conflict about their treatment choice, and future guidelines may consider the growing body of evidence regarding kidney disease education implementation, inclusive of conservative care management, to advance both practice points and recommendations.

### Kidney disease pathways, options and decisions: an environmental scan of international patient decision aids [^1179PNZq]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

A notable shift in clinical guidance for managing people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stages 4 and 5 [G4+; referred to herein as established kidney disease (EKD)] is to offer conservative management as an active treatment pathway alongside renal replacement therapies, dialysis and transplant. Most kidney services in Europe and North America have established educational programmes to help patients make decisions about their future treatment when their kidney disease is identified as progressing from chronic to EKD. Often known as pre-dialysis education, kidney professionals provide information about renal replacement options, focusing on discussions about which options fit best into a patient's life, including haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), with at-home or in-centre options. Conservative management is offered as an active option to manage symptoms arising from failing kidneys in patients meeting certain criteria, e.g. those > 75 years of age, with a high level of comorbidity and/or with a poor quality of life.

The conservative management and renal replacement therapy decision is complex and can be seen as a hierarchy of nested decisions (see Figure 1, adapted from Winterbottom et al. 2020) rather than a choice between discrete options. Decision-making takes place in the context of managing a long-term condition, with patients and professionals deliberating about treatment changes over months and years as kidney function stabilizes or continues to decline. Patients may switch or stop treatments as treatments fail, health worsens and life circumstances change. This dynamic context may explain why decision points are not easily identified or discussed and why patients may not be aware their kidney disease is worsening or may not be prepared to make shared decisions about future treatment with kidney professionals.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^112VEpub]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

### Choosing conservative care in advanced chronic kidney disease: a scoping review of patients' perspectives [^111RSPHH]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We identified a wide range of experiences reflecting what patients consider important during treatment decision making in advanced CKD. Limited awareness and knowledge about CKD and CC, as well as a perceived lack of choice, were the main barriers for optimal decision making. Patients appreciated a timely start of counselling about treatment options, with comprehensive and clear communication and involvement of family members during the decision-making process. This scoping review resulted in a list of recommendations to help healthcare professionals support their patients to choose a treatment option that fits their lives best.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^113CYjQu]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — scope and goals for primary care chronic kidney disease state that this CPG provides an evidence-based framework for evaluating and managing adult patients, 18 years or older, who have or are at risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the primary care setting to improve clinical outcomes. Successful implementation will assess the patient's condition, determine the most appropriate treatment plan in collaboration with the patient, optimize each patient's functional independence, health outcomes, and quality of life, minimize preventable complications and morbidity, and emphasize the use of patient-centered care.

### The views of patients and carers in treatment decision making for chronic kidney disease: systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies [^111i3S3X]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Timing of information

Participants often reported being too sick to make sense of the information they were given on treatment options: "The doctor might have mentioned it [continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis] but I was so sick at the time I didn't catch on to it". Patients and families also identified needing time to absorb information and to adjust to the approaching treatment regardless of whether they were contemplating a home haemodialysis modality or palliative care.

Research on nephrologist-patient communication suggests that nephrologists provide information on treatment options over an extended period of time but increase the amount of detail about specific treatments when the patient requires renal replacement therapy. Although this sounds reasonable it is likely that this approach will reduce the time available to patients to make decisions and means that information provision will coincide with the patient becoming symptomatic or cognitively impaired. From a patient's perspective this practice of increasing discussions about treatment options when end stage kidney disease is approached is inadequate for decision making. Guidelines for chronic kidney disease from the UK and kidney disease quality outcomes initiative recommend counselling for treatment options six months before the onset of established renal failure. These same guidelines, however, also recommend that a native arteriovenous access be created six months before end stage renal disease. There are several potential consequences of having a fistula created before a full discussion of treatment options. Firstly, patients risk having surgery for a treatment they do not wish to pursue. Secondly, our analysis suggests that the creation of vascular access may mean that a patient believes a treatment choice has already been made for them.

### The cardio-kidney patient: epidemiology, clinical characteristics and therapy [^113FiZpG]. Circulation Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk to develop cardiovascular disease with its manifestations coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. In addition, the presence of CKD has a major impact on the prognosis of patients with cardiovascular disease, leading to an increased morbidity and mortality if both comorbidities are present. Therapeutic options including medical therapy and interventional treatment are often limited in patients with advanced CKD, and in most cardiovascular outcome trials, patients with advanced CKD have been excluded. Thus, in many patients, treatment strategies for cardiovascular disease need to be extrapolated from trials conducted in patients without CKD. The current article summarizes the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment options for the most prevalent manifestations of cardiovascular disease in CKD and discusses the currently available treatment options to reduce morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population.

### People with CKD can lower their risk for kidney failure… [^111yptto]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

People With CKD Can Lower Their Risk for Kidney Failure Learn about CKD from a primary care doctor or a kidney doctor to better understand treatment options and protect the kidneys. People with glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, or other kidney disease should talk about specific treatment options with a kidney doctor. Monitor and manage blood sugar and blood pressure.
- Have blood sugar and blood pressure checked regularly.
- Use medicines if prescribed to lower blood sugar and blood pressure. Manage CKD:
- Make lifestyle changes to prevent more kidney damage. Meet with a dietitian to create a kidney-healthy eating plan that is low in salt and fat and has the right amount and sources of protein. As CKD gets worse, the plan may also include limiting phosphorus and potassium.
- Use medicines as directed to slow the decline in kidney function.
- Stop smoking or do not start smoking.
- Avoid exposures that can harm the kidneys or cause kidney function to suddenly get worse:

- Certain medicines:

- Over-the-counter pain medicines like ibuprofen and naproxen, which are also called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
- Some antibiotics.
- Certain herbal supplements.
- Excessive alcohol intake.
- Certain medicines:

- Review with health care providers all prescription and over-the counter medications to make sure they are safe for the kidneys. Always talk to a doctor before taking any supplements.
- Check with a doctor about other behaviors or substances that can harm the kidneys or about special precautions to take when doing medical tests or procedures, such as imaging studies or colonoscopies. Table of Contents

Treatments for CKD in People Living with T2DM

Findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that improved renal outcomes can be achieved through obesity management, intensive glycemic control using glucose-lowering medications, and anti-hypertension drugs. A caveat of using these medications is that many have reduced renal clearance due to declining kidney function or are contraindicated and often require careful dose adjustments. Furthermore, several of these therapies have only a modest glucose-lowering effect in people with reduced glomerular filtration. For these reasons, limited treatment options exist for this patient population.

Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA), in conjunction with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and KDIGO provide clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in CKD. These guidelines recommend a comprehensive strategy be followed to reduce risks of CKD in people living with T2DM and are summarized in Fig. 2. In the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes — 2021, the ADA recommend that for people with indications of high risk or established CKD either a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) be considered as a treatment option, independently of metformin use. Guidelines provided by KDIGO similarly recommend SGLT2i for people with an eGFR of ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 due to the vascular and renal benefit, despite its modest effect on glucose control. The current KDIGO guidelines do not recommend SGLT2i for people in more advanced stages of CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2), as the efficacy for lowering glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is blunted. This is indicated in the label information for empagliflozin and canagliflozin, with both of these SGLT2i not recommended for individuals with an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. For dapagliflozin, recently updated prescribing information indicates that initiation of treatment with this SGLT2i is not recommended in individuals with an eGFR < 25 ml/min/1.73 m 2. In people with T2DM and CKD, who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets despite use of metformin and SGLT2i, or are unable to use those medications due to contraindications, long-acting GLP-1 RAs are recommended. The use of GLP-1 RAs in this population is not only due to the limited use of SLGT2i in more severe stages but also because the glycemic lowering efficacy of SLGT2i is reduced in individuals with moderate renal impairment and likely absent in those with severe renal impairment. These anti-hyperglycemic therapies have shown promise in directly improving renal outcomes and reducing CKD progression independently of glycemic control. The use of GLP-1 RAs is also associated with a low risk for hypoglycemia, which is a limiting factor for many other diabetes medications in people with renal impairment.

### Summary of KDIGO guideline. what do we really know about management of blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease? [^1139xS8B]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for management of blood pressure (BP) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) supersedes the 2004 Kidney Disease Quality Outcomes Initiative document on this topic. The new guideline has been designed to assist clinical decision making in patients with CKD who are not receiving dialysis. The recommendations in the guideline acknowledge that no single BP target is optimal for all CKD patients and encourage individualization of treatment depending on age, the severity of albuminuria, and comorbidities. In general, the available evidence indicates that in CKD patients without albuminuria the target BP should be ≤ 140mmHg systolic and ≤ 90mmHg diastolic. However, in most patients with an albumin excretion rate of ≥ 30mg/24h (i.e., those with both micro- and macroalbuminuria), a lower target of ≤ 130mmHg systolic and ≤ 80mmHg diastolic is suggested. In achieving BP control, the value of lifestyle changes and the need for multiple pharmacological agents is acknowledged. Use of agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is recommended or suggested in all patients with an albumin excretion rate of ≥ 30mg/24h. Recommendations are almost identical in CKD patients with and without diabetes. Special considerations relevant to children and those of older age and those who have received a kidney transplant are included. Ongoing controversies in BP management in the context of CKD are highlighted along with key areas for future research.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^113aRMyt]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Advanced chronic kidney disease and shared decision-making — The clinical management and care of patients with advanced CKD is complex, and the decision to pursue KRT in the very elderly, frail, or medically complex CKD population is challenging for patients, their families, and providers; conservative management without dialysis, focusing on symptom management, is a reasonable treatment option that may better align with patients' values and preferences, and it is important for providers to use SDM to determine patients' goals of care and educate patients about their options in an unbiased manner to assist patients in making an informed decision. Only two studies regarding the impact of SDM in the management of patients with advanced CKD were identified in the evidence base for the 2019 VA/DOD CKD CPG, and both provided Very low quality evidence that patient satisfaction increased when patients were actively involved with modality selection; the German Choice of Renal Replacement therapy (CORETH) project evaluated the difference in patient satisfaction between peritoneal dialysis (PD) and ICHD, showing a statistically significant increase in patient satisfaction for those who participated in the process of modality choice, and the European Kidney Patients' Federation (CEAPIR) surveyed approximately 4,000 patients who were either on HD or had a functioning kidney transplant and found that approximately 75% had been involved in modality selection, which appeared to be associated with higher levels of satisfaction with their selected treatment.

### Caring for older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and considering their needs: a qualitative study [^116W7phn]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) among older patients is common in the United States and the prevalence among those aged ≥ 65 has increased from approximately 3 to 14% in the last two decades. Among patients who ultimately develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD), many are referred by their nephrologists for educational sessions to learn about different treatment options such as dialysis. However, ESRD patient education programs tend to focus on modality type, vascular access, and care setting rather than on how the different treatment modalities may affect patient lifestyles and goals of care. Few patients with advanced CKD are aware of treatment options such as conservative kidney management or advance care planning and seldom have an opportunity to discuss preferences with their clinicians or loved ones. One recent study of older patients with advanced CKD and ESRD showed that many did not fully understand dialysis and perceived it as the only alternative to death.

Emerging models of care demonstrate that integration of palliative care within nephrology practices can help promote conservative kidney management and advance care planning and also improve patient satisfaction among older patients; however, implementation has proved to be challenging. Previous research has demonstrated numerous clinician barriers to providing conservative kidney management and facilitating advance care planning including prognostic uncertainty, inconsistent collaboration between nephrologists and primary care physicians (PCP), and limited knowledge of ESRD treatment options. Although there is some literature that explores perceptions of ESRD treatment and end-of-life care options among older patients with advanced CKD and ESRD, it is unclear whether their views are consistent with their clinicians. To fill this knowledge gap, we sought to explore the alignment between clinician views of their responsibilities and patient clinical experiences via qualitative interviews with nephrologists, PCPs, patients, and caregivers regarding ESRD treatments and advance care planning.

### The next generation of therapeutics for chronic kidney disease [^117MSo2C]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a leading cause of death in the United States. There is no cure for this disease, with current treatment strategies relying on blood pressure control through blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Such approaches only delay the development of end-stage kidney disease and can be associated with serious side effects. Recent identification of several novel mechanisms contributing to CKD development - including vascular changes, loss of podocytes and renal epithelial cells, matrix deposition, inflammation and metabolic dysregulation - has revealed new potential therapeutic approaches for CKD. This Review assesses emerging strategies and agents for CKD treatment, highlighting the associated challenges in their clinical development.

### Kidney and cardiovascular-protective benefits of combination drug therapies in chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes [^114EX8Le]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the substantial burden of chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes, an aggressive approach to treatment is required. Despite the benefits of guideline-directed therapy, there remains a high residual risk of continuing progression of chronic kidney disease and of cardiovascular events. Historically, a linear approach to pharmacologic management of chronic kidney disease has been used, in which drugs are added, then adjusted, optimized, or stopped in a stepwise manner based on their efficacy, toxicity, effects on a patient's quality of life, and cost. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, which may result in missing a window of opportunity to slow chronic kidney disease progression. Instead, a pillar approach has been proposed to enable earlier treatment that simultaneously targets multiple pathways involved in disease progression. Combination therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes is being investigated in several clinical trials. In this article, we discuss current treatment options for patients with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes and provide a rationale for tailored combinations of therapies with complementary mechanisms of action to optimize therapy using a pillar-based treatment strategy.

Novel therapeutic approaches

Although CKD is one of the most common comorbidities in CVD, few specific treatment options are available for the high-risk population of patients with advanced CKD. Finding a balance between the optimization of clinical outcomes in CKD and CVD still requires validation in large prospective, multicenter clinical studies. SGLT2 inhibitors, currently used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes, have shown unprecedented cardiovascular as well as kidney protective effects. In cardiovascular outcome studies such as EMPA REG OUTCOME ([Empagliflozin] Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) with empagliflozin in > 7000 cardiovascular type 2 diabetic patients, the primary end point and cardiovascular mortality were significantly reduced in the SGLT2 group. A positive effect on cardiovascular morbidity was also demonstrated in cardiovascular outcome studies with canagliflozin and dapagliflozin.

### Choosing conservative care in advanced chronic kidney disease: a scoping review of patients' perspectives [^113ELHdb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In general, patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) have three different treatment options when their kidney function deteriorates: kidney transplantation, dialysis and conservative care (CC). CC focusses on maintaining quality of life and treating symptoms, often combined with interventions to delay the progression of kidney disease and manage complications of kidney failure. CC may especially suit older and frail patients for whom kidney transplantation is often not feasible and dialysis might yield limited survival benefit with potentially high treatment burden.

Choosing between dialysis and CC can be a complex decision, as there are multiple reasonable options, each with different potential benefits, risks and impacts on patients' lives. This makes the decisional process ideally suited for shared decision making (SDM). Patient involvement during the process of selecting a treatment modality in advanced CKD is associated with increased treatment satisfaction. Although international guidelines recommend the use of SDM, its implementation in daily practice remains limited.

The perspective of healthcare professionals on decision making about dialysis or CC has been evaluated in previous studies, but an overview of patients' perspectives is lacking. Gaining insights into the experiences and preferences of patients regarding the decision-making process is an important initial step to improve SDM. Therefore, we aimed to identify what is known about the perspective of patients regarding decision making when considering CC.

### Medical care of kidney transplant recipients after the first posttransplant year [^112v7e2X]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with ESRD. Despite improvements in short-term patient and graft outcomes, there has been no major improvement in long-term outcomes. The use of kidney allografts from expanded-criteria donors, polyoma virus nephropathy, underimmunosuppression, and incomplete functional recovery after rejection episodes may play a role in the lack of improvement in long-term outcomes. Other factors, including cardiovascular disease, infections, and malignancies, also shorten patient survival and therefore reduce the functional life of an allograft. There is a need for interventions that improve long-term outcomes in kidney transplant recipients. These patients are a unique subset of patients with chronic kidney disease. Therefore, interventions need to address disease progression, comorbid conditions, and patient mortality through a multifaceted approach. The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative from the National Kidney Foundation, the European Best Practice Guidelines, and the forthcoming Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes clinical practice guidelines can serve as a cornerstone of this approach. The unique aspects of chronic kidney disease in the transplant recipient require the integration of specific transplant-oriented problems into this care schema and a concrete partnership among transplant centers, community nephrologists, and primary care physicians. This article reviews the contemporary aspects of care for these patients.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Conservative care (CC) is increasingly recognised as a viable treatment option for older and frail patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), for whom kidney transplantation is often not feasible and dialysis might yield limited survival benefit with potentially high treatment burden.
Although the perspective of healthcare professionals on this decisional process between dialysis and CC has been evaluated in several studies, an overview of the experiences and preferences of patients is lacking.

This study adds:

We identified a wide range of experiences, including the preference for a timely start of counselling about all treatment options and clear communication about the benefits and risks and prognosis of each treatment option.
The decision-making process is facilitated by involvement of loved ones. Patients appreciate the presentation of CC as a team-based and active approach.
The main barriers in decision making are limited awareness and knowledge about CKD and CC. Some patients feel persuaded by their healthcare professionals to choose dialysis and perceive a lack of choice.

Potential impact:

This scoping review provides comprehensive insights to improve the decision-making process by taking into account what is valued most by patients.
We emphasize the importance of timely education about CC in an understandable way and to invest in a trusting relationship between the healthcare professional and patient.
We developed a list of recommendations to improve the decisional process and to provide patient-centred care in order to support patients to choose a treatment option that fits their lives best.

### Global kidney health 2017 and beyond: a roadmap for closing gaps in care, research, and policy [^112xUpnG]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The global nephrology community recognises the need for a cohesive plan to address the problem of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In July, 2016, the International Society of Nephrology hosted a CKD summit of more than 85 people with diverse expertise and professional backgrounds from around the globe. The purpose was to identify and prioritise key activities for the next 5–10 years in the domains of clinical care, research, and advocacy and to create an action plan and performance framework based on ten themes: strengthen CKD surveillance; tackle major risk factors for CKD; reduce acute kidney injury-a special risk factor for CKD; enhance understanding of the genetic causes of CKD; establish better diagnostic methods in CKD; improve understanding of the natural course of CKD; assess and implement established treatment options in patients with CKD; improve management of symptoms and complications of CKD; develop novel therapeutic interventions to slow CKD progression and reduce CKD complications; and increase the quantity and quality of clinical trials in CKD. Each group produced a prioritised list of goals, activities, and a set of key deliverable objectives for each of the themes. The intended users of this action plan are clinicians, patients, scientists, industry partners, governments, and advocacy organisations. Implementation of this integrated comprehensive plan will benefit people who are at risk for or affected by CKD worldwide.

### Cardiorenal protection with the newer antidiabetic agents in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115uKkyx]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health problem, resulting in significant cardiovascular and kidney adverse outcomes worldwide. Despite the widespread use of standard-of-care therapies for CKD with T2D over the past few decades, rates of progression to end-stage kidney disease remain high with no beneficial impact on its accompanying burden of cardiovascular disease. The advent of the newer classes of antihyperglycemic agents, including SGLT2 (sodium glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists, has changed the landscape of therapeutic options for patients with CKD with T2D, with demonstration of significant reductions in cardiovascular adverse events and progression to end-stage kidney disease. Several potential mechanisms exist through which these beneficial effects are achieved in both drug classes, which may be independent of their antihyperglycemic effects. This scientific statement summarizes the current literature on the cardiorenal protective effects with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with CKD and T2D. It reviews potential mechanistic pathways that may drive these benefits and summarizes the literature on adverse effects in patients with CKD and T2D at risk for or with established cardiovascular disease. Last, it provides practical guidance on a proposed collaborative care model bridging cardiologists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, and primary care physicians to facilitate the prompt and appropriate integration of these therapeutic classes in the management of patients with T2D and CKD.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^114duaf9]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

While both eGFR and kidney failure related symptoms figure prominently in recent dialysis initiation guidelines, much less attention has been given to a patient's goals and priorities. There is growing recognition that clinicians need to ensure maximal involvement of patients and their families in treatment decisions. This shared decision-making is a process whereby patients and providers can discuss the benefits and burdens of potential treatment strategies in the context of each patient's priorities and needs. A major challenge for to this shared decision approach is the fact that many older adults initiate dialysis during acute illness, without the time to understand the potential advantages and disadvantages of starting dialysis versus a non-dialytic conservative management approach. Early and repeat discussions are necessary to address this challenge.

The current review provides a pragmatic framework for the shared decision making process for older adults with advanced CKD [Fig. 1]. The questions addressed include: 1- how does a patient's rate of loss of renal function, comorbidities and episodes of AKI, impact the likelihood that a dialysis decision will become necessary? 2- in what clinical situations should a non dialysis approach be considered? 3-How does AKI, as a precursor to chronic dialysis, relate to dialysis decisions? 4- what symptoms justify dialysis initiation in older adults? 5- how can clinicians help patients understand the potential benefits and harms of dialysis versus conservative management in the context of a patient's symptoms, goals and priorities? Although the issues are complex, an open dialogue can help physicians understand what matters most to their patients. In turn the patient can gain greater control over decisions related to the management of their advanced CKD. When fully informed, some patients may opt for non-dialytic conservative management [Table 1] that can include all CKD therapies and may also include a palliative care emphasis, which prioritizes a patient's comfort and symptom relief.

### Dialysis in end-stage renal… [^112enros]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- When screening for or staging CKD, consider assessing function with urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and serum cystatin-C measurement.
- ACE inhibitors are the best treatment for nondiabetic CKD, whereas ACE inhibitors and ARBs are beneficial in diabetic CKD. Combination ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy should be avoided.
- Treating type 2 diabetes with metformin in CKD reduces mortality and can be continued until eGFR drops to 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m
2. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists also improve outcomes in CKD. From the AFP Editors. Blood Pressure Management One meta-analysis suggests reduced mortality in CKD when systolic blood pressure is maintained below 140 mm Hg. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers should be used to treat patients who have CKD with albuminuria and diabetes mellitus.

For CKD with albuminuria but no diabetes, an ACE inhibitor is preferred because of a 31% reduction in end-stage renal disease. Both medications cause increases in potassium and creatinine levels in CKD, so monitoring is essential; combinations of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used. ARBs are an appropriate alternative for ACE inhibitor–induced cough, but they are not appropriate after angioedema. No other antihypertensive medications reduce CKD progression. Treatment of Diabetes with CKD Metformin is considered first-line therapy to decrease mortality in type 2 diabetes with CKD. Metformin can be started above an eGFR of 45 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 and safely continued until eGFR drops to 30 mL per minute per
1. 73 m 2. Consider additional treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists to reduce CKD progression.

SGLT-2 inhibitors slow CKD progression and reduce hospitalization for heart failure, with uncertain effect on mortality. Based on a post-hoc trial analysis, GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to reduce major cardiovascular events and mortality in CKD and may slightly reduce CKD progression. Conversely, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors do not improve outcomes in CKD.
