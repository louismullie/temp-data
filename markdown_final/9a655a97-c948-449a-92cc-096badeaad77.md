## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about bronchitis, including definitions, diagnosis, treatment, special populations, and stewardship, with explicit self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology and distinguishing acute bronchitis from chronic bronchitis and COPD phenotypes. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and when to test or image. Next, I will examine treatment for acute bronchitis, including antibiotics, bronchodilators, and symptomatic care, and I need to check for any exceptions. After that, I should review chronic bronchitis management, including exacerbations and stable disease. Finally, I will consider special populations, summarize stewardship principles, and close with a concise synthesis and safety pearls, ensuring each claim is supported by guidelines or high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. Acute bronchitis is an acute lower respiratory tract infection characterized by cough with or without sputum, typically lasting up to 3 weeks, with no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia or alternative explanations, and it is usually viral in etiology, which aligns with CHEST and AAFP definitions and the CDC's public-facing framing of a "chest cold" [^1146M1eL] [^114VGSCJ] [^115JpTfU]. Chronic bronchitis, by contrast, is defined by cough and sputum on most days for at least 3 months per year for 2 consecutive years, and it is a phenotype within COPD with distinct pathophysiology and consequences, including accelerated lung function decline and higher exacerbation risk, so I need to keep these constructs separate in my recommendations [^111VD5xX].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach for suspected acute bronchitis and make sure I'm not over-ordering tests. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — most immunocompetent adults with acute cough do not need routine labs or imaging. The priority is to rule out pneumonia and other serious disease using vital signs and lung examination, reserving chest radiography for those with abnormal vitals, focal lung findings, immunocompromise, or persistent symptoms beyond about 3 weeks, which is consistent with CHEST and AAFP guidance and stewardship principles [^116yCD45] [^112BptYu] [^113ptkgp]. I should double-check that I'm not missing pertussis in prolonged cough. If suspected, testing and macrolide therapy are indicated, but that is the exception rather than the rule in adults with acute bronchitis [^1152zHys].

> Now, treatment for acute bronchitis — let me think about antibiotics first because that's where overuse is common. Multiple high-quality sources converge: antibiotics provide at best a modest reduction in cough duration of about half a day and do not improve overall clinical outcomes, while increasing adverse effects. Therefore, routine antibiotics should be avoided, and this is consistently recommended by ACP/CDC, CHEST, AAFP, and Cochrane reviews, with the CDC explicitly advising patients that antibiotics won't help a viral chest cold [^117ABtD6] [^1128x35v] [^1179Kpu9] [^112YmzVc] [^115JpTfU]. Wait, I should verify whether any subgroup benefits meaningfully; even in smokers, pooled data suggest no advantage or possibly less benefit, reinforcing the no-routine-antibiotics stance in uncomplicated cases [^115EfedN].

> I will now examine bronchodilators, since clinicians often prescribe albuterol reflexively. The Cochrane reviews and CHEST/AAFP guidance indicate no routine benefit of beta-agonists for acute bronchitis without airflow limitation, with increased tremor and nervousness; however, if wheeze or objective airflow limitation is present, a short trial may be reasonable, so I need to ensure I'm not extrapolating beyond that subgroup [^113ggfTC] [^114FVWAe] [^116X18bo] [^113jtq4u]. Hmm, wait a minute, I recall an older review suggesting albuterol shortened cough in adults; let me reconsider — those signals were inconsistent and largely unsubstantiated in pooled analyses, so the weight of evidence still supports avoiding routine beta-agonists in otherwise healthy adults with acute bronchitis [^113ggfTC] [^114FVWAe].

> For symptomatic care, I should confirm what actually helps. Patient education about the natural history of cough lasting 2–3 weeks, rest, hydration, humidified air, and analgesics are the mainstays. Antitussives may be offered selectively for short-term relief, but evidence is limited, and many OTC cough medicines lack supportive data, so shared decision-making is key and expectations should be set upfront [^115uFvJ7] [^1123gz4m] [^114BiT1W] [^114XJ6Bx]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not recommending honey here; AAFP notes insufficient evidence for honey in acute bronchitis, so I won't overstate it even though it appears in some pediatric cough contexts for other indications [^114XJ6Bx].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist or worsen — when should I reconsider the diagnosis and treatment? If cough persists beyond about 3–4 weeks, worsens, or new red flags emerge, I should reassess and consider targeted evaluation for pneumonia, pertussis, asthma, COPD, heart failure, or other causes, and only then consider antibiotics if a complicating bacterial infection is likely, which aligns with CHEST and AAFP reassessment guidance [^112BptYu] [^116yCD45] [^1134dJJY]. I need to ensure I'm not missing an exacerbation of underlying chronic airways disease, which would shift management toward bronchodilators and possibly corticosteroids rather than antibiotics for the cough itself [^1134dJJY].

> Turning to chronic bronchitis, I should confirm that management differs fundamentally from acute bronchitis. Smoking cessation and exposure avoidance are the most effective disease-modifying strategies. Beyond that, evidence for routine pharmacologic therapy to suppress chronic cough in stable chronic bronchitis is limited, and guidelines advise against routine antibiotics, bronchodilators, or mucolytics solely for cough suppression in stable disease, though mucolytics may reduce exacerbations in COPD populations, which is a different question than treating cough per se [^113t7aCp] [^113op11x] [^111bpFsU]. Let me verify the exacerbation piece — short-course antibiotics are appropriate for acute exacerbations when increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and/or purulence suggest bacterial infection, and 5-day regimens are as effective as longer courses in mild to moderate exacerbations, which is consistent with ACP and meta-analytic data [^116Dxw2f] [^111NusUR].

> I should double-check the role of mucolytics in chronic bronchitis/COPD because it's easy to overgeneralize. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests oral mucolytics reduce exacerbations and days of disability without clear harm, but effects on lung function and quality of life are modest and heterogeneous; thus, they may be considered in selected patients with frequent exacerbations, particularly when inhaled corticosteroids are not used, rather than as a routine cough therapy [^111bpFsU] [^115Vv8SZ]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not imply use in acute bronchitis — correct, these data pertain to chronic disease and should not be extrapolated to uncomplicated acute bronchitis [^111bpFsU].

> Next, I should review special populations so I don't miss important nuances. In children, acute bronchitis is managed supportively; antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated cases, but prolonged wet cough beyond 4 weeks raises concern for protracted bacterial bronchitis, where antibiotics are recommended, which is a distinct pediatric entity and should not be conflated with adult acute bronchitis [^1137RANQ] [^113Vbbu9]. In patients with established COPD, acute exacerbations with increased dyspnea, sputum volume, or purulence warrant antibiotics and bronchodilators, and short-course therapy is acceptable, whereas routine antibiotics for stable chronic bronchitic cough are not recommended [^111NusUR] [^113t7aCp]. For immunocompromised hosts, I need to ensure a lower threshold for evaluation and targeted therapy given higher risks of atypical infections and complications, though this extends beyond the scope of standard acute bronchitis algorithms [^116yCD45].

> I need to ensure antibiotic stewardship is explicit and actionable. Overprescribing for acute bronchitis remains common, with about 41% of outpatients with ARIs receiving antibiotics inappropriately during influenza seasons. Using delayed prescriptions and describing illness as a chest cold reduce unnecessary use without harming satisfaction, and I should communicate the 2–3 week natural history to set expectations and reduce demand [^113hYQ39] [^115uFvJ7]. Let me verify the harm message — yes, unnecessary antibiotics increase adverse effects and resistance risks, which should be discussed plainly with patients during shared decision-making [^115JpTfU].

> In summary, acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adults is a self-limited viral illness in which antibiotics should be avoided, bronchodilators reserved for those with wheeze or airflow limitation, and care centered on education and symptomatic relief. Chronic bronchitis, conversely, prioritizes smoking cessation and exposure avoidance, with targeted use of mucolytics or antibiotics during exacerbations rather than for routine cough suppression, and I should always reassess if symptoms persist beyond 3–4 weeks to avoid missing alternative diagnoses [^112YmzVc] [^113jtq4u] [^113t7aCp] [^112BptYu]. Hold on, I should verify alignment with major guidelines one more time — yes, this synthesis is consistent with AAFP, CHEST, ACP/CDC, and Cochrane, with the caveat that any apparent inconsistencies in older literature reflect evolving evidence and contemporary stewardship emphasis [^112YmzVc] [^1179Kpu9] [^1128x35v] [^111FGJZY].

Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, with **acute bronchitis** usually caused by viruses and **chronic bronchitis** defined by a persistent cough with sputum for at least 3 months in two consecutive years, most often due to smoking [^113t7aCp]. Acute bronchitis is typically self-limited and managed with supportive care; **antibiotics are not routinely recommended** because they offer minimal benefit and increase adverse effects [^117ABtD6] [^112YmzVc]. Chronic bronchitis requires smoking cessation, bronchodilators, and mucolytics; exacerbations may need antibiotics if bacterial infection is suspected [^113t7aCp] [^111bpFsU]. Preventive measures include vaccination, hand hygiene, and avoiding irritants; prognosis is excellent for acute cases, while chronic bronchitis can progress to COPD with significant morbidity [^115JpTfU] [^111VD5xX].

---

## Types of bronchitis

Bronchitis is classified as **acute or chronic** based on duration and underlying causes:

| **Type** | **Duration** | **Causes** | **Characteristics** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acute bronchitis | ≤ 3 weeks | Viral infections (e.g. influenza, RSV); bacterial infections less common | - Self-limited <br/> - Cough with or without sputum <br/> - Often resolves spontaneously [^1146M1eL] [^115JpTfU] |
| Chronic bronchitis | ≥ 3 months, ≥ 2 consecutive years | - Smoking <br/> - Environmental pollutants <br/> - Occupational exposures | - Persistent cough with sputum <br/> - Associated with COPD <br/> - Progressive airway obstruction [^113t7aCp] [^111VD5xX] |

---

## Etiology and risk factors

### Acute bronchitis

Viruses are the **primary cause** (about 90%), including influenza, RSV, and rhinovirus [^1156nhgo]. Bacterial infections are uncommon — typically less than 10% — and include pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae [^1156nhgo]. Risk factors include smoking, immunosuppression, occupational exposures, and chronic respiratory conditions [^notfound].

---

### Chronic bronchitis

Smoking is the **most significant risk factor**, causing mucus hypersecretion and airway obstruction [^notfound]. Environmental exposures — such as pollutants, occupational hazards, and secondhand smoke — also contribute [^113t7aCp]. Genetic predisposition may influence susceptibility and disease severity [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

### Acute bronchitis

- **Cough**: Predominant symptom, with or without sputum [^1146M1eL]
- **Sputum**: May be clear, white, yellow, or green (color does not indicate bacterial infection) [^notfound]
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, chest discomfort, wheezing [^notfound]
- **Duration**: Typically resolves within 2–3 weeks [^115uFvJ7]

---

### Chronic bronchitis

- **Persistent cough**: With sputum production, lasting ≥ 3 months, ≥ 2 consecutive years [^113t7aCp]
- **Exacerbations**: Periodic worsening of symptoms, often triggered by infections or environmental exposures [^113t7aCp]
- **Progression**: May lead to COPD, characterized by chronic airflow limitation and respiratory impairment [^113t7aCp]

---

## Diagnosis

### Acute bronchitis

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on symptoms and physical examination. Testing is generally unnecessary unless complications are suspected [^1152zHys]. If pneumonia is suspected, obtain a chest radiograph; if symptoms persist beyond 3 weeks, consider further evaluation [^1152zHys] [^112BptYu].

---

### Chronic bronchitis

Spirometry is essential to assess airflow limitation and confirm **COPD**. Imaging — **chest X-ray or CT** — may be used to assess disease severity and exclude other conditions. Laboratory tests, including CBC, sputum analysis, and inflammatory markers, can help evaluate **exacerbations** [^notfound].

---

## Treatment

### Acute bronchitis

Supportive care — rest, hydration, humidified air, and analgesics — is **first-line** [^115NqVos] [^1123gz4m]. Antibiotics are not routinely recommended due to minimal benefit and increased adverse effects; reserve for suspected bacterial infection or high-risk patients [^117ABtD6] [^112YmzVc]. Bronchodilators may be considered for wheezing or bronchospasm, but routine use is not recommended [^113ggfTC] [^116X18bo].

---

### Chronic bronchitis

Smoking cessation is the **most effective intervention** to slow disease progression [^notfound]. Bronchodilators, including beta-agonists and anticholinergics, relieve bronchospasm and improve airflow. Mucolytics, such as N-acetylcysteine, reduce sputum viscosity and frequency of exacerbations [^111bpFsU]. During exacerbations, antibiotics may be used if bacterial infection is suspected, particularly with increased sputum purulence or volume [^113t7aCp].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **vaccination** (influenza, pneumococcal, pertussis), hand hygiene, and avoiding irritants such as tobacco smoke and pollutants [^115JpTfU]. Smoking cessation programs are critical for those with chronic bronchitis or at risk of developing it [^113t7aCp].

---

## Prognosis

Acute bronchitis generally has an **excellent prognosis**, with most patients recovering fully within 2–3 weeks [^115uFvJ7]. Chronic bronchitis carries a variable prognosis; disease may progress to COPD, resulting in significant morbidity, reduced quality of life, and increased mortality risk [^111VD5xX].

---

Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, with acute cases typically viral and self-limited, while chronic bronchitis is a persistent condition often related to smoking. Management differs: acute bronchitis relies on supportive care and avoids routine antibiotics, whereas chronic bronchitis requires **smoking cessation**, **bronchodilators**, and mucolytics, with antibiotics reserved for exacerbations. Prevention through vaccination, hygiene, and avoiding irritants is essential, and prognosis is excellent for acute cases but variable for chronic disease, with potential progression to **COPD**.

Background

The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to acute bronchitis and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice. Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care clinicians and emergency department physicians. It is an acute respiratory infection with a normal chest radiograph that is manifested by cough with or without phlegm production that lasts for up to 3 weeks. Respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis; however, the organism responsible is rarely identified in clinical practice because viral cultures and serologic assays are not routinely performed. Fewer than 10% of patients will have a bacterial infection diagnosed as the cause of bronchitis. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis should be made only when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of cough. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited respiratory disorder, and when the cough persists for > 3 weeks, other diagnoses must be considered.

Methods

Recommendations for this review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004. The search was limited to literature published in the English language and human studies, using search terms such as "cough", "acute bronchitis", and "acute viral respiratory infection".

Results

Unfortunately, most previous controlled trials guiding the treatment of acute bronchitis have not vigorously differentiated acute bronchitis and the common cold, and also have not distinguished between an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute asthma as a cause of acute cough. For patients with the putative diagnosis of acute bronchitis, routine treatment with antibiotics is not justified and should not be offered. Antitussive agents are occasionally useful and can be offered as therapy for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing, but there is no role for inhaled bronchodilator or expectorant therapy. Children and adult patients with confirmed and probable whooping cough should receive a macrolide antibiotic and should be isolated for 5 days from the start of treatment; early treatment within the first few weeks will diminish the coughing paroxysms and prevent spread of the disease; the patient is unlikely to respond to treatment beyond this period.

Conclusion

Acute bronchitis is an acute respiratory infection that is manifested by cough and, at times, sputum production that lasts for no more than 3 weeks. This syndrome should be distinguished from the common cold, an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and acute asthma as the cause of acute cough. The widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute bronchitis is not justified, and vigorous efforts to curtail their use should be encouraged.

### Uncomplicated acute bronchitis [^114fk38g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is an acute cough illness in otherwise healthy adults that usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks. This review describes the pathophysiology of the condition and provides a practical approach to the evaluation and treatment of adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Practical points to be made are:1. Respiratory viruses appear to cause the large majority of cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.2. Pertussis infection is present in up to 10% to 20% of adults with cough illness of more than 2 to 3 weeks' duration. No clinical features distinguish pertussis from nonpertussis infection in adults who were immunized against pertussis as children.3. Transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness appears to be the predominant mechanism of the bothersome cough of acute bronchitis.4. Ruling out pneumonia is the primary objective in evaluating adults with acute cough illness in whom comorbid conditions and occult asthma are absent or unlikely. In the absence of abnormalities in vital signs (heart rate > 100 beats/min, respiratory rate > 24 breaths/min, and oral body temperature > 38 degrees C), the likelihood of pneumonia is very low.5. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials do not support routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.6. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that inhaled albuterol decreases the duration of cough in adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis.7. Intervention studies suggest that antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis can be reduced by using a combination of patient and physician education. Decreased rates of antibiotic treatment are not associated with increased utilization, return visits, or dissatisfaction with care.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^114hBege]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence for the diagnosis and management of cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients was reviewed as an update to the 2006 "Chronic Cough Due to Acute Bronchitis: American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines".

Methods

Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection manifested predominantly by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks with no clinical or any recent radiographic evidence to suggest an alternative explanation. Two clinical population, intervention, comparison, outcome questions were addressed by systematic review in July 2017: (1) the role of investigations beyond the clinical assessment of patients presenting with suspected acute bronchitis, and (2) the efficacy and safety of prescribing medication for cough in acute bronchitis. An updated search was undertaken in May 2018.

Results

No eligible studies relevant to the first question were identified. For the second question, only one relevant study met eligibility criteria. This study found no difference in number of days with cough between patients treated with an antibiotic or an oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent compared with placebo. Clinical suggestions and research recommendations were made based on the consensus opinion of the CHEST Expert Cough Panel.

Conclusions

The panelists suggested that no routine investigations be ordered and no routine medications be prescribed in immunocompetent adult outpatients first presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, until such investigations and treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner. If the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, a reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations should be considered.

### Mucolytic agents versus placebo for chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111bpFsU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Individuals with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer recurrent exacerbations with an increase in volume or purulence of sputum, or both. Personal and healthcare costs associated with exacerbations indicate that therapies that reduce the occurrence of exacerbations are likely to be useful. Mucolytics are oral medicines that are believed to increase expectoration of sputum by reducing its viscosity, thus making it easier to cough it up. Improved expectoration of sputum may lead to a reduction in exacerbations of COPD.

Objectives

Primary objective• To determine whether treatment with mucolytics reduces exacerbations and/or days of disability in patients with chronic bronchitis or COPDSecondary objectives• To assess whether mucolytics lead to improvement in lung function or quality of life• To determine frequency of adverse effects associated with use of mucolytics SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles on 12 separate occasions, most recently on 23 April 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised studies that compared oral mucolytic therapy versus placebo for at least two months in adults with chronic bronchitis or COPD. We excluded studies of people with asthma and cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

This review analysed summary data only, most derived from published studies. For earlier versions, one review author extracted data, which were rechecked in subsequent updates. In later versions, review authors double-checked extracted data and then entered data into RevMan 5.3 for analysis.

Main Results

We added four studies for the 2019 update. The review now includes 38 trials, recruiting a total of 10,377 participants. Studies lasted between two months and three years and investigated a range of mucolytics, including N-acetylcysteine, carbocysteine, erdosteine, and ambroxol, given at least once daily. Many studies did not clearly describe allocation concealment, and we had concerns about blinding and high levels of attrition in some studies. The primary outcomes were exacerbations and number of days of disability. Results of 28 studies including 6723 participants show that receiving mucolytics may be more likely to be exacerbation-free during the study period compared to those given placebo (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56 to 1.91; moderate-certainty evidence). However, more recent studies show less benefit of treatment than was reported in earlier studies in this review. The overall number needed to treat with mucolytics for an average of nine months to keep an additional participant free from exacerbations was eight (NNTB 8, 95% CI 7 to 10). High heterogeneity was noted for this outcome (I² = 62%), so results need to be interpreted with caution. The type or dose of mucolytic did not seem to alter the effect size, nor did the severity of COPD, including exacerbation history. Longer studies showed smaller effects of mucolytics than were reported in shorter studies. Mucolytic use was associated with a reduction of 0.43 days of disability per participant per month compared with use of placebo (95% CI -0.56 to -0.30; studies = 9; I² = 61%; moderate-certainty evidence). With mucolytics, the number of people with one or more hospitalisations was reduced, but study results were not consistent (Peto OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.89; participants = 1788; studies = 4; I² = 58%; moderate-certainty evidence). Investigators reported improved quality of life with mucolytics (mean difference (MD) -1.37, 95% CI -2.85 to 0.11; participants = 2721; studies = 7; I² = 64%; moderate-certainty evidence). However, the mean difference did not reach the minimal clinically important difference of -4 units, and the confidence interval includes no difference. Mucolytic treatment was associated with a possible reduction in adverse events (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94; participants = 7264; studies = 24; I² = 46%; moderate-certainty evidence), but the pooled effect includes no difference if a random-effects model is used. Several studies that could not be included in the meta-analysis reported high numbers of adverse events, up to a mean of five events per person during follow-up. There was no clear difference between mucolytics and placebo for mortality, but the confidence interval is too wide to confirm that treatment has no effect on mortality (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.87; participants = 3527; studies = 11; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In participants with chronic bronchitis or COPD, we are moderately confident that treatment with mucolytics leads to a small reduction in the likelihood of having an acute exacerbation, in days of disability per month and possibly hospitalisations, but is not associated with an increase in adverse events. There appears to be limited impact on lung function or health-related quality of life. Results are too imprecise to be certain whether or not there is an effect on mortality. Our confidence in the results is reduced by high levels of heterogeneity in many of the outcomes and the fact that effects on exacerbations shown in early trials were larger than those reported by more recent studies. This may be a result of greater risk of selection or publication bias in earlier trials, thus benefits of treatment may not be as great as was suggested by previous evidence.

### Future directions in the clinical management of cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116rnN6b]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To impart a call for further research into the identified domains of particular interest in the etiology, management, and treatment of cough.

Design/Methodology

A literature review was performed using the search term "cough" in PubMed between 1983 and 2004. The final draft of this guideline was reviewed, in addition to recent studies on cough, and suggestions provided by the authors were collated into a definitive inventory of specific areas in which the lack of quality evidence encumbered the development of clinically relevant evidence-based recommendations.

Results/Conclusions

Although our understanding of the causes and optimal management of chronic cough have significantly increased over the past 25 years, further research remains to be done on this common symptom. This is reflected by the generally low level of evidence for many of the recommendations in these guidelines. Research is particularly needed on the optimal treatment of postinfectious cough, how to distinguish acute bronchitis from other conditions, how to reliably diagnose and treat cough due to gastroesophageal reflux disease, clearly identifying a role for nonpharmacologic protussive treatment modalities in diseases associated with an increased production of bronchial secretions, determining how often cough in patients with interstitial lung disease is due to conditions other than these, establishing the spectrum and frequency of causes of chronic cough in the immunocompromised hosts, and better characterizing psychogenic cough. Further studies are also needed on methods for the assessment of cough, in particular, noninvasive measures of airway inflammation, and pharmacotherapy. It should be determined how often unexplained cough (previously referred to as idiopathic cough) is due to the use of non-evidence-based guidelines or to environmental causes, and assessed whether an empiric, integrative approach of diagnosing chronic cough leads to better outcomes, including cost-effectiveness, than routine testing. While much work has been done on chronic cough, we need studies on the spectrum and frequency of acute and subacute coughs.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^1134dJJY]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

CHEST Expert Panel suggestions — management of cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients state there is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the efficacy of prescribed treatments for cough due to acute bronchitis. For immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine prescription of antibiotic therapy, antiviral therapy, antitussives, inhaled beta agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, oral NSAIDs or other therapies until such treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to acute bronchitis, if the acute bronchitis worsens, we suggest consideration for treatment with antibiotic therapy if a complicating bacterial infection is thought likely (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), and remarks note that differential diagnoses, such as exacerbations of chronic airways diseases (COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis) that may require other therapeutic management (such as with oral corticosteroids) should also be considered.

### Chinese medicinal herbs for acute bronchitis [^116icixk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care physicians. It is traditionally treated with antibiotics (although the evidence for their effectiveness is weak, and modest at best) and other even less effective treatments. Chinese medicinal herbs have also been used as a treatment.

Objectives

This review aimed to summarise the existing evidence on the comparative effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs for treating uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4) which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to 19 September 19, 2011), EMBASE (1988 to 19 September 2011) and CNKI and the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1980 to 19 September, 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Chinese medicinal herbs with placebo, antibiotics or other Western medicines for the treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

In this updated review, 74 studies involving 6877 participants were reported as RCTs by the study authors. None of them met the inclusion criteria for this review. Out of the 74 trials, we identified 39 as non-RCTs and 35 compared different Chinese herbal medicines in the intervention and control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient quality data to recommend the routine use of Chinese herbs for acute bronchitis. Trial design limitations of the individual studies meant that we could not draw any conclusions about the benefits of Chinese herbs for acute bronchitis. In addition, the safety of Chinese herbs is unknown due to the lack of toxicological evidence for these herbs, although adverse events were reported in some case reports.

### Bronchitis (acute) [^114RWvnp]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis, with transient inflammation of the trachea and major bronchi, affects over 40/1000 adults a year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. A third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2007 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (amoxicillin [with or without clavulanic acid], cephalosporins, or macrolides), antihistamines, antitussives, beta(2) agonists (inhaled or oral), cephalosporins, expectorants, and analgesics.

### Información básica sobre el resfriado de pecho (bronquitis… [^1165SVPW]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Información general
- El resfriado de pecho, con frecuencia llamado bronquitis aguda, ocurre cuando las vías respiratorias en los pulmones se inflaman y producen mucosidad en los pulmones. Eso es lo que lo hace toser. Signos y síntomas El síntoma más común de la bronquitis aguda es la tos con o sin mucosidad. Los síntomas de la bronquitis aguda duran menos de 3 semanas. Otros síntomas pueden incluir:

- Dolor en el pecho
- Cansancio
- Dolor de cabeza leve
- Dolores corporales leves
- Dolor de garganta. Causas Lo que generalmente causa la bronquitis aguda es un virus. A veces, también la puede ser causada por bacterias. Prevención Usted puede ayudar a prevenir la bronquitis aguda haciendo lo posible para mantenerse sano y mantener sanos a los demás. Esto incluye:

- Limpiarse las manos.
- Ponerse las vacunas recomendadas, como la vacuna contra la influenza.
- No fumar y evitar el humo de segunda mano.
- Cubrirse la nariz y la boca al toser o estornudar.

Cuándo buscar atención médica
- Temperatura de 100. 4 °F o más.
- Tos con mucosidad y sangre.
- Falta de aire o dificultad para respirar.
- Síntomas que duran más de 3 semanas.
- Episodios repetidos de bronquitis. Esta lista no incluye todos los signos y síntomas. Vea a un proveedor de atención médica si tiene algún síntoma que sea grave o preocupante. Hable con un proveedor de atención médica de inmediato. Tratamiento Por lo general, la bronquitis aguda mejora por sí sola, sin antibióticos. Los antibióticos no lo ayudarán si no los necesita y los efectos secundarios incluso podrían hacerle daño. Los efectos secundarios pueden variar desde reacciones leves, como sarpullido, hasta problemas de salud más graves. Estos problemas pueden incluir reacciones alérgicas graves, infecciones resistentes a los antimicrobianos e infecciones por C. diff. Las infecciones por C. diff causan diarrea que puede llegar a dañar gravemente el colon y provocar la muerte.

### β₂-agonists for acute cough or a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis [^113ggfTC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of acute bronchitis is made on clinical grounds and a variety of clinical definitions have been used. There are no clearly effective treatments for the cough of acute bronchitis. Beta2-agonists are often prescribed, perhaps because clinicians suspect many patients also have reversible airflow restriction (as seen in asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) contributing to the symptoms.

Objectives

To determine whether beta2-agonists improve acute bronchitis symptoms in people with no underlying pulmonary disease (such as asthma, COPD or pulmonary fibrosis).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2015, Issue 5, MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2015), EMBASE (1974 to May 2015), Web of Science (2011 to May 2015) and LILACS (1982 to May 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which allocated people (adults, or children over two years of age) with acute bronchitis or acute cough and without known pulmonary disease to beta2-agonist versus placebo, no treatment or alternative treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently selected outcomes and extracted data while blinded to study results. Two review authors independently assessed each trial for risk of bias. We analysed trials in children and adults separately.

Main Results

Two trials of moderate quality in children (n = 134) with no evidence of airflow restriction did not find any benefits from oral beta2-agonists. Five trials in adults (n = 418) had mixed results but overall summary statistics did not reveal any significant benefits from oral (three trials) nor from inhaled (two trials) beta2-agonists. Three studies with low-quality evidence demonstrated no significant differences in daily cough scores, nor in the percentage of adults still coughing after seven days (control group 71%; risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 1.18; 220 participants). In one trial, subgroups with evidence of airflow limitation had lower symptom scores if given beta2-agonists. The trials that noted quicker resolution of cough with beta2-agonists were those with a higher proportion of people wheezing at baseline. Low-quality evidence suggests that adults given beta2-agonists were more likely to report tremor, shakiness or nervousness (RR 7.94, 95% CI 1.17 to 53.94; 211 participants; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 2).

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to support the use of beta2-agonists in children with acute cough who do not have evidence of airflow restriction. There is also little evidence that the routine use of beta2-agonists is helpful for adults with acute cough. These agents may reduce symptoms, including cough, in people with evidence of airflow restriction. However, this potential benefit is not well supported by the available data and must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with their use.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^111FGJZY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits and risks of antibiotics for acute bronchitis remain unclear despite it being one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and to assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for people with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2016, Issue 11 (accessed 13 January 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2017), Embase (1974 to 13 January 2017), and LILACS (1982 to 13 January 2017). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 5 April 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough, in people without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this 2017 update. We included 17 trials with 5099 participants in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. At follow-up there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between the antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15). Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (4 studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6) and a night cough (4 studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7). Participants given antibiotics had a shorter mean cough duration (7 studies with 2776 participants, mean difference (MD) -0.46 days, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04). The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic-treated participants were more likely to be improved according to clinician's global assessment (6 studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 11) and were less likely to have an abnormal lung exam (5 studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6). Antibiotic-treated participants also had a reduction in days feeling ill (5 studies with 809 participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and days with impaired activity (6 studies with 767 participants, MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04). The differences in proportions with activity limitations at follow-up did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group (12 studies with 3496 participants, RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; NNT for an additional harmful outcome 24).

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. Antibiotics may have a modest beneficial effect in some patients such as frail, elderly people with multimorbidity who may not have been included in trials to date. However, the magnitude of this benefit needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a self limiting condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens, and cost of antibiotic treatment.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis affects over 40/1000 adults a year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. One third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

Results

We found 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, antibiotics (macrolides, tetracyclines, cephalosporins, penicillins, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [co-trimoxazole]), antihistamines, antitussives, beta(2) agonists (inhaled or oral), and expectorants/mucolytics.

### Appropriate use of antibiotics for respiratory infections: review of recent statements and position papers [^114Zrbnc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Respiratory infections are among the most common reasons for prescribing antibiotics. The excessive use of antibiotics in ambulatory practice has contributed to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. The appropriate use of antimicrobial agents for respiratory infections could potentially reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance. This article reviews recent guidelines and position papers on the appropriate antibiotic treatment for respiratory infections. There is a wide consensus that antibiotics are not appropriate for the treatment of most cases of acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, and rhinosinusitis. The recently published community-acquired pneumonia guidelines emphasized the importance of selecting antibiotic regimens active against both typical and atypical pathogens. However, there is disagreement regarding the routine use of the new quinolones.

### Chest cold (acute bronchitis) basics… [^115JpTfU]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Cough keeping you up at night. Soreness in your chest and feeling tired. You could have a chest cold, often called acute bronchitis.
- A virus usually causes chest colds.
- Antibiotics will not help you get better if you have a chest cold.
- If you're healthy without heart or lung problems or a weakened immune system, this information is for you. Overview
- A chest cold, often called acute bronchitis, occurs when the airways of the lungs swell and produce mucus in the lungs. That's what makes you cough. Signs and symptoms The most common symptom of acute bronchitis is coughing with or without mucus. Symptoms of acute bronchitis last less than 3 weeks. Other symptoms can include:

- Soreness in the chest
- Feeling tired
- Mild headache
- Mild body aches
- Sore throat. Prevention You can help prevent acute bronchitis by doing your best to stay healthy and keep others healthy, including:

- Clean your hands.
- Get recommended vaccines, such as the flu vaccine.
- Don't smoke and avoid secondhand smoke.
- Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. When to seek medical care
- Temperature of 100. 4 °F or higher.
- Cough with bloody mucus.
- Shortness of breath or trouble breathing.
- Symptoms that last more than 3 weeks.
- Repeated episodes of bronchitis. This list is not all-inclusive. Please see a healthcare provider for any symptom that is severe or concerning. Talk to a healthcare provider right away. Treatment Acute bronchitis usually gets better on its own — without antibiotics. When antibiotics aren't needed, they won't help you, and their side effects could still cause harm. Side effects can range from mild reactions, like a rash, to more serious health problems. These problems can include severe allergic reactions, antimicrobial-resistant infections and C. diff infection. C. diff causes diarrhea that can lead to severe colon damage and death.
- **Pain relievers**:

- **Children younger than 6 months**: only give acetaminophen.
- **Children 6 months or older**: it is OK to give acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
- Never give aspirin to children because it can cause Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a very serious, but rare illness that can harm the liver and brain.

### Bronchoscopic interventions for chronic bronchitis [^111oZSrc]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic bronchitis is a phenotype of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), characterized by chronic cough and sputum production, associated with an increased rate of COPD exacerbations and hospital admissions, a more rapid decline in lung function and reduced life expectancy. Despite optimal medical therapy, chronic bronchitis remains difficult to treat. Interventional bronchoscopic procedures offer novel therapeutic approaches to this highly symptomatic condition.

Recent Findings

A characteristic feature of chronic bronchitis is the presence of an abnormal epithelium with excessive mucus producing cells, parasympathetic overactivity, and airway inflammation. Metered cryospray and bronchial rheoplasty are designed to target this abnormal epithelium to reduce mucus production and inflammation. Targeted lung denervation aims to reduce parasympathetic overactivity, which may drive mucus hypersecretion. Here, we review the available evidence to determine the safety and efficacy across the bronchoscopic interventions.

Summary

Interventional bronchoscopy is a rapidly expanding field and its application in the treatment of chronic bronchitis has been recognized by the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). The outcomes from the latest clinical trials will guide future treatment approaches in patients with difficult to treat chronic bronchitis.

### Pharmacological strategies to reduce exacerbation risk in COPD: a narrative review [^114hV1Pb]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Assessment of exacerbation risk: what do guidelines say?

COPD guidelines have historically just used lung function to grade the severity of disease, and guide treatment strategies. A more complex approach has been adopted recently, incorporating other clinical features to define clinical phenotypes. A phenotype is defined as "a single or combination of disease attributes that describe differences between individuals with COPD as they relate to clinically meaningful outcomes (symptoms, exacerbations, response to therapy, rate of disease progression, or death)". The aim of phenotyping is to enable identification of patient groups that have distinctive prognostic or therapeutic characteristics, thereby enabling a personalized approach to treatment.

The definition of the "frequent exacerbator" phenotype, based on findings from the ECLIPSE study, has been incorporated into many COPD guidelines. Current GOLD strategy advocates assessment of exacerbation risk by: (i) GOLD spirometric classification, with GOLD 3 and 4 indicating high risk; or (ii) a history of exacerbations, with ≥ 2 exacerbations (or ≥ 1 exacerbation leading to hospitalization) in the previous year indicating high risk. GOLD subdivides patients into four categories, A, B, C or D, on the basis of symptoms and risk, with the aim of using this clinical assessment to make treatment decisions. Guidelines differ in how the risk of future exacerbations is assessed (see Additional file 1: Table S2), with a previous history of exacerbations being a common feature of many, but other characteristics such as FEV₁ included in some, but not all, guidelines, e.g. Spanish GesEPOC and the Saudi Thoracic Society. In fact, the Spanish (GesEPOC) guidelines have adopted a different approach to other national guidelines. Four clinical phenotypes are defined: non-exacerbators (< 2 exacerbations/year), an asthma-COPD overlap syndrome phenotype (ACOS), and two groups of frequent exacerbators (≥ 2 exacerbations/year), specifically exacerbators with emphysema and exacerbators with chronic bronchitis. Importantly, patients with ACOS experience more frequent and severe exacerbations, as well as worse disease-related quality of life, compared with patients having COPD.

### Where is the supporting evidence for treating mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations with antibiotics? A systematic review [^113phQNA]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our historical analysis showed that many head-to-head trials of antibiotics for mild to moderate COPD exacerbations have been conducted although evidence from randomised placebo-controlled trials never showed that antibiotics were effective at all. So, in this case, the evaluation of antibiotics did not follow the general principle that placebo-controlled trials must have shown that the treatment is better than the placebo or a sham procedure, before head-to-head trials are to be conducted.

Our study has some strengths and limitations. We used a comprehensive literature search to identify trials. The selection of a widely prescribed drug for a major disease makes our 'case report' meaningful, because we could base our historical analysis on a large number of trials. A limitation of systematic reviews in COPD is the evolution of definitions and classifications of COPD over the years. This raises uncertainty about the nature of the study populations included in trials published before 1995 or even before 2000. Many trials included patients with 'chronic bronchitis' who did not present evidence of chronic airflow obstruction or poor reversibility of airflow obstruction.

It should be emphasised that the results of this study apply to antibiotic treatment for mild to moderate COPD exacerbations. In patients with severe exacerbations, antibiotics show a strong effect not only on treatment failure but also on mortality. Our analysis of placebo-controlled trials differs to some extent to that of the Cochrane review because we did not include a study that was not a randomised but, in our opinion, a matched controlled study. However, we included the trial by Sachs et al missed by the Cochrane review and received the original data from the authors. However, the Cochrane review also showed that antibiotics have a significant effect on treatment failure in hospitalised patients but not in outpatients.

We have focused in our analysis on one major treatment for COPD patients. It remains unclear if head-to-head trials are conducted frequently in other areas without an evidence base from placebo-controlled trials. It is conceivable that this example of antibiotics is just the tip of the iceberg. A recent systematic review summarised placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of exercise for low back pain. Head-to-head trials were conducted over the same period of time as the placebo-controlled trials. The same applies to trials evaluating antidepressants for elderly people or antibiotics for acute otitis media in children. For these widely prescribed treatments for common conditions, it remains as yet uncertain whether the conduct of head-to-head trials was scientifically and ethically justified.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^116yCD45]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients — summary of suggestions indicates that for cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine investigation with chest x-ray, spirometry, peak flow measurement, sputum for microbial culture, respiratory tract samples for viral PCR, serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) or procalcitonin (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). If suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, we suggest that the patient is advised to seek reassessment and targeted investigation(s) be considered (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), and suggested targeted investigations could include chest x-ray, sputum for microbial culture, peak expiratory flow rate recording(s), complete blood count and inflammatory markers such as CRP. For cough due to acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine prescription of antibiotic therapy, antiviral therapy, antitussives, inhaled beta agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, oral NSAIDs or other therapies until such treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). If acute bronchitis worsens, we suggest consideration for treatment with antibiotic therapy if a complicating bacterial infection is thought likely (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), and differential diagnoses such as exacerbations of chronic airways diseases (COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis) that may require other therapeutic management (such as with oral corticosteroids) should also be considered.

### Mucolytic agents for chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115Vv8SZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer recurrent exacerbations with an increase in volume and/or purulence of sputum. Because of the personal and healthcare costs associated with exacerbations, any therapy that reduces the number of exacerbations is useful. There is a marked difference between countries in terms of prescribing of mucolytics depending on whether or not they are perceived to be effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral mucolytics in adults with stable chronic bronchitis or COPD.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles on eight separate occasions, the most recent being in September 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials that compared oral mucolytic therapy with placebo for at least two months in adults with chronic bronchitis or COPD. We excluded studies of people with asthma and cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author extracted data. We contacted study authors and drug companies for missing information.

Main Results

Twenty-eight trials involving 7042 participants were included. Compared with placebo, there was a significant reduction in the number of exacerbations per patient with oral mucolytics (weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.04 per month, 95% confidence interval -0.05 to -0.03). Using a weighted annualised rate of exacerbations in the control patients of 2.4 per year, this is a 21% reduction. The number of days of disability also fell (WMD -0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.77 to -0.35). One recent study has shown that the benefit may apply only to patients not already receiving inhaled corticosteroids. The number of patients who remained exacerbation-free was greater in the mucolytic group (odds ratio (OR) 1.93 (95% CI 1.71 to 2.17)). There is no strong evidence of improvement in lung function and treatment is not associated with any increase in adverse effects. Patients on mucolytics may be less likely to be hospitalised during the study period.

Authors' Conclusions

In participants with chronic bronchitis or COPD, treatment with mucolytics was associated with a small reduction in acute exacerbations and a reduction in total number of days of disability. Benefit may be greater in individuals who have frequent or prolonged exacerbations, or those who are repeatedly admitted to hospital with exacerbations with COPD. Mucolytics should be considered for use, through the winter months at least, in patients with moderate or severe COPD in whom inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are not prescribed.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^115eNAML]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis — conclusions and research needs emphasize that there has been little change in treatment choices since the 2006 CHEST cough guidelines, many published studies are small with significant limitations and potential biases, and data pooling was generally not possible, making definitive recommendations difficult. The authors state they reviewed the available literature and, when possible, provided treatment recommendations, and they identified knowledge gaps and suggest areas for future research. Future priorities include a definition of CB with reliable and valid cough outcome measures and development of clinical studies to validate use of multi-ingredient prescription and nonprescription cough therapies.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^1146M1eL]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients — definition, evidence, and panel suggestions are as follows: Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection manifested predominantly by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks with no clinical or any recent radiographic evidence to suggest an alternative explanation. For the second question, only one relevant study met eligibility criteria, and this study found no difference in number of days with cough between patients treated with an antibiotic or an oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent compared with placebo, while no eligible studies relevant to the first question were identified. The panelists suggested that no routine investigations be ordered and no routine medications be prescribed in immunocompetent adult outpatients first presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, until such investigations and treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner, and if the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, a reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations should be considered.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections during influenza seasons [^113n6h24]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are targets for improving antibiotic stewardship for outpatient acute respiratory infections?

Findings

Among 14 987 outpatients with acute respiratory infections enrolled in this cohort study during influenza seasons, 41% were prescribed antibiotics, 41% of whom had diagnoses for which antibiotics are not indicated, primarily viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis; 29% of patients with influenza confirmed through research testing were prescribed antibiotics. Among patients prescribed antibiotics, 38% with pharyngitis tested negative for group A streptococcus and 38% with sinusitis had symptoms for 3 days or less before the visit, suggesting antibiotic therapy was not required.

Meaning

Eliminating antibiotic treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis, improving influenza diagnosis and treatment, and reinforcing prescription guidelines for pharyngitis and sinusitis could improve outpatient antibiotic stewardship.

### Azithromycin for acute lower respiratory tract infections [^113qHe7y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) range from acute bronchitis and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis to pneumonia. Approximately five million people die from acute respiratory tract infections annually. Among these, pneumonia represents the most frequent cause of mortality, hospitalisation and medical consultation. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, structurally modified from erythromycin and noted for its activity against some gram-negative organisms associated with respiratory tract infections, particularly Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae).

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of azithromycin to amoxycillin or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (amoxyclav) in the treatment of LRTI, in terms of clinical failure, incidence of adverse events and microbial eradication.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October week 4, 2014) and EMBASE (January 1974 to November 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, comparing azithromycin to amoxycillin or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid in participants with clinical evidence of an acute LRTI, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

The review authors independently assessed all potential studies identified from the searches for methodological quality. We extracted and analysed relevant data separately. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. We initially pooled all types of acute LRTI in the meta-analyses. We investigated the heterogeneity of results using the forest plot and Chi(2) test. We also used the index of the I(2) statistic to measure inconsistent results among trials. We conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

We included 16 trials involving 2648 participants. We were able to analyse 15 of the trials with 2496 participants. The pooled analysis of all the trials showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of clinical failure on about days 10 to 14 between the two groups (risk ratio (RR), random-effects 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.85). A subgroup analysis in trials with acute bronchitis participants showed significantly lower clinical failure in the azithromycin group compared to amoxycillin or amoxyclav (RR random-effects 0.63; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88). A sensitivity analysis showed a non-significant reduction in clinical failure in azithromycin-treated participants (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.25 to 1.21) in three adequately concealed studies, compared to RR 1.32; 95% CI 0.70 to 2.49 in 12 studies with inadequate concealment. Twelve trials reported the incidence of microbial eradication and there was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03). The reduction of adverse events in the azithromycin group was RR 0.76 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.00).

Authors' Conclusions

There is unclear evidence that azithromycin is superior to amoxycillin or amoxyclav in treating acute LRTI. In patients with acute bronchitis of a suspected bacterial cause, azithromycin tends to be more effective in terms of lower incidence of treatment failure and adverse events than amoxycillin or amoxyclav. However, most studies were of unclear methodological quality and had small sample sizes; future trials of high methodological quality and adequate sizes are needed.

### The chronic bronchitis phenotype in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: features and implications [^111VD5xX]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health problem that is projected to rank fifth worldwide in terms of disease burden and third in terms of mortality. Chronic bronchitis is associated with multiple clinical consequences, including hastening lung function decline, increasing risk of exacerbations, reducing health-related quality of life, and possibly raising all-cause mortality. Recent data suggest greater elucidation on the risk factors, radiologic characteristics, and treatment regimens. Our goal was to review the literature on chronic bronchitis that has been published in the past few years.

Recent Findings

A growing body of literature that more carefully describes environmental risk factors, epidemiology, and genetics associated with chronic bronchitis. In addition, as computed tomography technology continues to improve, the radiologic phenotype associated with chronic bronchitis is better understood.

Summary

With these new data, the clinician can recognize the newly described risk factors and the associated phenotype for chronic bronchitis and entertain new treatment options for this high-risk population.

### Prophylactic antibiotic therapy for chronic bronchitis [^1164vW1H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the frequency and severity of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis is controversial.

Objectives

To determine if prophylactic antibiotics reduce the frequency of exacerbations and/or days of disability in subjects with chronic bronchitis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Clinical Trials and the bibliographies of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with chronic bronchitis and/or COPD were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

The eligibility of studies for inclusion was evaluated by three independent reviewers.

Main Results

Nine trials involving 1055 subjects were included in the analysis. All were performed before 1970. Concealment of allocation was assessed as clearly adequate in only 3 studies. The likelihood of having a exacerbation at any time during the course of the study was decreased with treatment (Relative Risk 0.91, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 0.84, 0.99). There was a small reduction in the number of exacerbations per patient per year with prophylactic antibiotics but this was not statistically significant (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) -0.15, 95%CI -0.34, 0.04). There was a modest but significant reduction of 22% in the number of days of disability per patient per month treated (WMD -0.95, 95%CI -1.89 to - 0.01). A parallel reduction in the days of disability for each exacerbation (WMD -2.08, 95% CI -4.08 to -0.07) was seen. There was a small increase in adverse effects with antibiotics.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Prophylactic antibiotics in chronic bronchitis / COPD have a small but statistically significant effect in reducing the days of illness due to exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. They do not have a place in routine treatment because of concerns about the development of antibiotic resistance and the possibility of adverse effects. The available data are over 30 years old, so the pattern of antibiotic sensitivity may have changed and there is a wider range of antibiotics in use.

### Effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment versus antibiotic therapy and placebo for patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis with purulent sputum. the BAAP study protocol [^112FbK2C]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchitis is one of the most prevalent respiratory infections in primary care, and in more than 90% of the cases antibiotics are prescribed, mainly when purulent expectoration is present. However, this process is usually viral in origin and the benefits of antibiotic treatment are marginal. On the other hand, in recent years bronchitis has been considered more as an inflammatory than an infectious process. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a schedule of an oral anti-inflammatory compared with an antibiotic regimen and another group assigned to receive a placebo.

Methods and Design

A total of 420 patients from 15 to 70 years of age with no associated comorbidity, presenting respiratory tract infection of at least one week of evolution, with cough as the predominant symptom, the presence of purulent expectoration and at least one other symptom of the respiratory tract (dyspnoea, wheezing, chest discomfort or pain), with no alternative explanation such as pneumonia, will be included in a prospective, randomised and controlled, clinical trial with placebo. The patients will be randomised to receive one of three treatments: ibuprofen, amoxycillin and clavulanic acid or placebo for 10 days. The main outcome measure is the number of days with frequent cough defined by the symptom diary with a score of 1 or more.

Discussion

This trial is designed to evaluate the number of days with frequent cough with anti-inflammatory treatment compared with antimicrobial treatment and placebo in previously healthy patients with a clinical picture of acute bronchitis and purulent expectoration. It is hypothesized that anti-inflammatory treatment is more effective than antibiotic treatment to reduce cough, which is the most disturbing symptom for patients with this infection.

### β₂-agonists for acute bronchitis [^114FVWAe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There are no clearly effective treatments for the cough of acute bronchitis. Beta2-agonists are often prescribed, perhaps because clinicians suspect many patients also have reversible airflow restriction contributing to the symptoms.

Objectives

To determine whether beta2-agonists improve acute bronchitis symptoms in patients with no underlying pulmonary disease.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2011, issue 1 which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to February week 1, 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to February 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which patients (adults, or children over two years of age) with acute bronchitis or acute cough and without known pulmonary disease were allocated to beta2-agonist versus placebo, no treatment or alternative treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently selected outcomes and extracted data while blinded to study results. Two review authors independently assessed each trial for risk of bias. We analysed trials in children and adults separately.

Main Results

Two trials in children (n = 109) with no evidence of airway obstruction did not find any benefits from oral beta2-agonists. Five trials in adults (n = 418) had mixed results but overall summary statistics did not reveal any significant benefits from oral (three trials) nor inhaled (two trials) beta2-agonists. There were no significant differences in daily cough scores nor in the percentage of adults still coughing after seven days (control group 73%; risk ratio (RR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.09). in one trial, subgroups with evidence of airflow limitation had lower symptom scores if given beta2-agonists. The trials that noted quicker resolution of cough with beta2-agonists were those with a higher proportion of wheezing patients at baseline. Adults given beta2-agonists were more likely to report tremor, shakiness or nervousness (RR 7.94, 95% CI 1.17 to 53.94; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 2.3).

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to support the use of beta2-agonists in children with acute cough who do not have evidence of airflow obstruction. There is also little evidence that the routine use of beta2-agonists is helpful for adults with acute cough. These agents may reduce symptoms, including cough, in people with evidence of airflow obstruction. However, this potential benefit is not well-supported by the available data and must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with their use.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^112JFNM3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits and risks of antibiotics for acute bronchitis remain unclear despite it being one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 12, MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to January 2014) and LILACS (1982 to January 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough, in patients without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Seventeen trials with 3936 participants were included in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. There was limited evidence to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. At follow-up, there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 22. Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (four studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; NNTB 6); have a night cough (four studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7) and a shorter mean cough duration (seven studies with 2776 participants, mean difference (MD) -0.46 days, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04). The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic-treated patients were more likely to be unimproved according to clinician's global assessment (six studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 25); have an abnormal lung exam (five studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6); have a reduction in days feeling ill (five studies with 809 participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and a reduction in days with limited activity (six studies with 767 participants MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04). The differences in proportions with activity limitations at follow-up did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group (12 studies with 3496 participants) (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; NNT for an additional adverse effect 5).

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. Antibiotics may have a modest beneficial effect in some patients such as frail, elderly people with multimorbidity who may not have been included in trials to date. However, the magnitude of this benefit needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a self-limiting condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens and cost of antibiotic treatment.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^111rREmW]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis (CB) causes significant impairment in quality of life, and effective treatment strategies are needed. We conducted a systematic review on the management of chronic cough due to CB to update the recommendations and suggestions of the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) 2006 guideline on this topic.

Methods

This systematic review asked three questions: (1) What are the clinical features of the history that suggest a patient's cough-phlegm syndrome is due to CB? (2) Can treatment of stable CB improve or eliminate chronic cough? (3) Can therapy that targets chronic cough due to CB prevent or reduce the occurrence of acute CB exacerbations? Studies of adult patients with CB were included and assessed for relevance and quality. Based on the systematic review, guideline suggestions were developed and voted on by using the CHEST organization methodology.

Results

The search strategy used an assortment of descriptors and assessments to identify studies of chronic cough due to CB.

Conclusions

The evidence supporting the management of chronic cough due to CB is limited overall and of low quality. This article provides guidance on treatment by presenting suggestions based on the best currently available evidence and identifies gaps in our knowledge and areas for future research.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of acute respiratory tract infections in adults: background, specific aims, and methods [^116bh6kw]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The need to decrease excess antibiotic use in ambulatory practice has been fueled by the epidemic increase in antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The majority of antibiotics prescribed to adults in ambulatory practice in the United States are for acute sinusitis, acute pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, and nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections (including the common cold). For each of these conditions-especially colds, nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, and acute bronchitis (for which routine antibiotic treatment is not recommended)-a large proportion of the antibiotics prescribed are unlikely to provide clinical benefit to patients. Because decreasing community use of antibiotics is an important strategy for combating the increase in community-acquired antibiotic-resistant infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a panel of physicians representing the disciplines of internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, and infectious diseases to develop a series of "Principles of Appropriate Antibiotic Use for Treatment of Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Adults". These principles provide evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment of adults with acute respiratory illnesses. This paper describes the background and specific aims of and methods used to develop these principles. The goal of the principles is to provide clinicians with practical strategies for limiting antibiotic use to the patients who are most likely to benefit from it. These principles should be used in conjunction with effective patient educational campaigns and enhancements to the health care delivery system that facilitate nonantibiotic treatment of the conditions in question.

### β₂-agonists for acute bronchitis [^1174NTFh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

There are no clearly effective treatments for the cough of acute bronchitis, and beta2-agonists are often prescribed, perhaps because clinicians suspect many patients also have reversible airflow restriction contributing to the symptoms.

Objectives

To determine whether beta2-agonists improve symptoms of acute bronchitis in patients who do not have underlying pulmonary disease.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2005) and EMBASE (1974 to November 2005).

Selection Criteria

Trials in which patients (adults or children over two years of age) who were diagnosed with acute bronchitis or acute cough (without known pulmonary disease and without other cause) were randomized to beta2-agonist versus placebo, no treatment or alternative treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently selected outcomes and evaluated trial quality while blinded to study results, they then extracted data. Trials in children and in adults were analyzed separately.

Main Results

Two trials in children (n = 109) with acute cough and no evidence of airway obstruction did not find any benefits from beta2-agonists. Combined data did not show a significant difference in daily cough scores between patients given oral beta2-agonists and those in the control groups. Five trials in adults (n = 418) with acute cough or acute bronchitis had mixed results but overall summary statistics did not reveal any significant benefits from oral (three trials) nor inhaled (two trials) beta2-agonists. There were no significant differences in daily cough scores nor in the number of patients still coughing after seven days (control rate 73%; relative risks (RR) 0.77, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.09). Subgroups of patients with evidence of airflow limitation had lower symptom scores if given beta2-agonists, in one trial. Furthermore, the trials that did note quicker resolution of cough in patients given beta2-agonists were those that had a higher proportion of patients with wheezing at baseline. Patients given beta2-agonists were more likely to report tremor, shakiness or nervousness than patients in the control groups (for trials in children: control rate 0%; RR 6.76, 95% CI 0.86 to 53.12; number needed to harm (NNH) 9, 95% CI 5 to 100; for trials in adults: control rate 11%; RR 7.94, 95% CI 1.17 to 53.94; NNH 2.3, 95% CI 2 to 3).

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to support the use of beta2-agonists in children with acute cough who do not have evidence of airflow obstruction. There is also little evidence that the routine use of beta2-agonists is helpful for adults with acute cough. These agents may reduce symptoms, including cough, in patients with evidence of airflow obstruction. However, this potential benefit is not well-supported by the available data and must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with beta2-agonists.

### Diagnosis and management of acute bronchitis [^112hWrZf]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is one of the top 10 conditions for which patients seek medical care. Physicians show considerable variability in describing the signs and symptoms necessary to its diagnosis. Because acute bronchitis most often has a viral cause, symptomatic treatment with protussives, antitussives, or bronchodilators is appropriate. However, studies indicate that many physicians treat bronchitis with antibiotics. These drugs have generally been shown to be ineffective in patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Furthermore, antibiotics often have detrimental side effects, and their overuse contributes to the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. Patient satisfaction with the treatment of acute bronchitis is related to the quality of the physician-patient interaction rather than to prescription of an antibiotic.

Using GRADE, the Work Group rated each outcome on a 1–9 scale (7–9, critical for decision making; 4–6, important, but not critical, for decision making; and 1–3, of limited importance for decision making), and critical and important outcomes were included in the evidence review; however, only critical outcomes were used to determine the overall quality of evidence. The population of interest for all KQs included adults (≥ 18 years) who have a diagnosis of COPD that includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and chronic airflow limitation/obstruction.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis: background [^1152zHys]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated. Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician — patient communication rather than on antibiotic treatment.

### Acute bronchitis: rapid evidence review [^117PueHE]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis and accounts for more than 3 million outpatient office visits in the United States annually. The differential diagnosis includes exacerbations of preexisting conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure or other causes of acute cough, including pertussis, COVID-19, influenza, and community-acquired pneumonia. Acute cough may present with or without sputum production. Diagnostic testing is not indicated unless there is concern for other potential causes, such as community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19. Acute bronchitis is a self-limiting disease. Evidence does not support the use of antitussives, honey, antihistamines, anticholinergics, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Antibiotics do not contribute to the overall improvement of acute bronchitis; although they may decrease the duration of cough by approximately 0.5 days, their use exposes patients to antibiotic-related adverse effects. Therefore, symptom relief and patient education regarding the expected duration of cough (2–3 weeks) are recommended for the management of acute bronchitis. Strategies shown to decrease antibiotic prescribing include delayed antibiotic prescriptions and describing acute bronchitis as a chest cold.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^117WmX5o]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis (CB) is addressed by a CHEST Expert Panel through a systematic review focusing on adult patients, key diagnostic and treatment questions, and development of guideline suggestions. Chronic cough due to CB is described as causing significant impairment in quality of life, and the review examined whether features of the history suggest cough‑phlegm syndrome is due to CB, whether treatment of stable CB can improve or eliminate chronic cough, and whether therapy targeting cough due to CB can prevent or reduce acute CB exacerbations. Studies of adult CB populations were included and assessed for relevance and quality, guideline suggestions were developed and voted on using CHEST methodology, and the search strategy used varied descriptors and assessments to identify studies. The conclusions state that the evidence supporting management of chronic cough due to CB is limited overall and of low quality, and that the article provides guidance by presenting suggestions based on currently available evidence while identifying gaps and areas for future research. The report is endorsed by the American Association for Respiratory Care.

### Where is the supporting evidence for treating mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations with antibiotics? A systematic review [^113MyjFe]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

For the identification of antibiotics trials in COPD patients, we used a comprehensive literature search described elsewhere. In brief, information specialists (Bazian, London, UK,) searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2005 issue 4), PREMEDLINE (1960 to 1965), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1974 to March 2006), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, March 2006) for any randomised trials on antibiotics in COPD patients. Two reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all the identified citations without imposing any language restrictions. The full text of any article that seemed potentially eligible by one of the reviewers was ordered. The reviewers then evaluated the full text of retrieved articles and selected those meeting the inclusion criteria. Each reviewer's decisions were recorded in the Endnote file and any disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Study selection

We included randomised head-to-head trials comparing any antibiotics or an antibiotic with placebo for the treatment of mild to moderate exacerbations in COPD patients. Placebo-controlled trials allow for an estimation of the specific effects of the treatment and offer a proof of effectiveness.

As with any systematic review on this topic, a difficulty is that definitions of COPD have varied over time. In particular, spirometry criteria became widespread only after 1995 and we accepted a clinical diagnosis of COPD, chronic bronchitis or emphysema. However, in order to include only trials whose patients were very likely to have COPD, we included studies only if patients with chronic bronchitis were at least 40 years of age and/or if at least 80% were smokers or ex-smokers. The presence of these characteristics (chronic bronchitis, age and smoking history) renders a diagnosis of COPD according to modern (spirometric) criteria extremely likely. We defined patients to have 'mild to moderate exacerbations' if they needed any outpatient treatment (level I exacerbation) according to the Operational Classification of Severity of the European Respiratory and American Thoracic Societies.

### Short-course antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and COPD: a meta-analysis of double-blind studies [^111NusUR]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A study was undertaken to determine whether a short course of antibiotic treatment (≤ 5 days) is as effective as the conventional longer treatment in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched to July 2006. Studies considered eligible were double-blind randomised clinical trials including adult patients ≥ 18 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of exacerbation of COPD or chronic bronchitis, no antimicrobial therapy at the time of diagnosis and random assignment to antibiotic treatment for ≤ 5 days versus > 5 days. The primary outcome measure was clinical cure at early follow-up on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results

21 studies with a total of 10 698 patients were included. The average quality of the studies was high: the mean (SD) Jadad score was 3.9 (0.9). At early follow-up (< 25 days), the summary odds ratio (OR) for clinical cure with short treatment versus conventional treatment was 0.99 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.08). At late follow-up the summary OR was 1.0 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.10) and the summary OR for bacteriological cure was 1.05 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.26). Similar summary ORs were observed for early cure in trials with the same antibiotic in both arms and in studies grouped by the antibiotic class used in the short-course arm.

Conclusions

A short course of antibiotic treatment is as effective as the traditional longer treatment in patients with mild to moderate exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and COPD.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis: background [^113ptkgp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease.1. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes.2. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated.3. Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician-patient communication rather than on antibiotic treatment.

### Chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113t7aCp]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic bronchitis is a disease of the bronchi that is manifested by cough and sputum expectoration occurring on most days for at least 3 months of the year and for at least 2 consecutive years when other respiratory or cardiac causes for the chronic productive cough are excluded. The disease is caused by an interaction between noxious inhaled agents (eg, cigarette smoke, industrial pollutants, and other environmental pollutants) and host factors (eg, genetic and respiratory infections) that results in chronic inflammation in the walls and lumen of the airways. As the disease advances, progressive airflow limitation occurs, usually in association with pathologic changes of emphysema. This condition is called COPD. When a stable patient experiences a sudden clinical deterioration with increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, and/or worsening of shortness of breath, this is referred to as an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis as long as conditions other than acute tracheobronchitis are ruled out. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to chronic bronchitis, and to make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

Methods

Recommendations for this section of the review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "chronic bronchitis", and "COPD".

Results

The most effective way to reduce or eliminate cough in patients with chronic bronchitis and persistent exposure to respiratory irritants, such as personal tobacco use, passive smoke exposure, and workplace hazards is avoidance. Therapy with a short-acting inhaled beta-agonist, inhaled ipratropium bromide, and oral theophylline, and a combined regimen of inhaled long-acting beta-agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid may improve cough in patients with chronic bronchitis, but there is no proven benefit for the use of prophylactic antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, expectorants, postural drainage, or chest physiotherapy. For the treatment of an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, there is evidence that inhaled bronchodilators, oral antibiotics, and oral corticosteroids (or in severe cases IV corticosteroids) are useful, but their effects on cough have not been systematically evaluated. Therapy with expectorants, postural drainage, chest physiotherapy, and theophylline is not recommended. Central cough suppressants such as codeine and dextromethorphan are recommended for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing.

Conclusions

Chronic bronchitis due to cigarette smoking or other exposures to inhaled noxious agents is one of the most common causes of chronic cough in the general population. The most effective way to eliminate cough is the avoidance of all respiratory irritants. When cough persists despite the removal of these inciting agents, there are effective agents to reduce or eliminate cough.

### β₂-agonists for acute bronchitis [^115BX8qH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment for acute bronchitis is not clear. Because many patients with acute bronchitis have airflow limitation as well as cough, beta2-agonists may be useful.

Objectives

To determine whether beta2-agonists improve the symptoms of acute bronchitis in patients who do not have underlying pulmonary disease.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (through August 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to 2000), EMBASE (1974 to 2000), and Conference Proceedings using "bronchodilator (exp)", "adrenergic beta-agonist (exp)", or "sympathomimetics (exp)" and "bronchitis" or "cough"; Science Citation Index for referenced publications; and letters to manufacturers of beta2-agonists. An updated search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 3, 2003); MEDLINE (January 2000 to July 2003); EMBASE (January 2000 to July 2003) was run in July 2003.

Selection Criteria

Trials in which patients (adults or children over two years of age) without known pulmonary disease who were diagnosed with acute bronchitis or acute cough without other cause were randomized to beta2-agonist versus placebo, no treatment, or alternative treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three reviewers independently first selected outcomes and evaluated trial quality while blinded to study results, and then extracted data. Trials in children and in adults were analyzed separately.

Main Results

Two trials in children (n = 109) with acute cough and no evidence of airway obstruction did not find any benefits from beta2-agonists. Combined data did not show a significant difference in daily cough scores between patients given oral beta2-agonists and those in the control groups. Five trials in adults (n = 418) with acute cough or acute bronchitis had mixed results, but overall summary statistics did not reveal any significant benefits from oral (three trials) nor inhaled (two trials) beta2-agonists. There were no significant differences in daily cough scores nor in the number of patients still coughing after seven days (control rate 73%; RR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.54–1.09). Subgroups of patients with evidence of airflow limitation had lower symptom scores if given beta2-agonists in one trial; and the trials that did note quicker resolution of cough in patients given beta2-agonists were those that had a higher proportion of patients with wheezing at baseline. Patients given beta2-agonists were more likely to report tremor, shakiness, or nervousness than patients in the control groups (for trials in children control rate 0%; RR 6.76, 95% CI 0.86 to 53.12, NNH 9, 95% CI 5 to 100; for trials in adults, control rate 11%; RR 7.94, 95% CI 1.17 to 53.94, NNH 2.3, 95% CI 2 to 3).

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no evidence to support using beta2-agonists in children with acute cough who do not have evidence of airflow obstruction. There is also little evidence that the routine use of beta2-agonists for adults with acute cough is helpful. These agents may reduce symptoms, including cough, in patients with evidence of airflow obstruction; but this potential benefit is not well-supported by the available data and must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with beta2-agonists.

### Should we prescribe antibiotics for acute bronchitis? [^111s1h3S]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

People with acute bronchitis may show little evidence of bacterial infection. If effective, antibiotics could shorten the course of the disease. However, if they are not effective, the risk of antibiotic resistance may be increased. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotic treatment in patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Strategy

The authors searched MEDLINE, Embase, reference lists of articles, personal collections up to 1996 and Sci-search from 1989 to 1996.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute bronchitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Primary Results

The results of eight trials involving 750 patients from eight years of age to 65 and older and including smokers and nonsmokers were included. The quality of the trials was variable. A variety of outcome measures was assessed. In many cases, only outcomes that showed a statistically significant difference between groups were reported. Overall, patients taking antibiotics had slightly better outcomes than those taking placebo. They were less likely to report feeling unwell at a follow-up visit (odds ratio, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] 0.22 to 0.82), to show no improvement on physician assessment (odds ratio, 0.43; CI, 0.23 to 0.79) or to have abnormal lung findings (odds ratio, 0.33; CI, 0.13 to 0.86), and had a more rapid return to work or usual activities (weighted mean difference, 0.7 days earlier; CI, 0.2 to 1.3). Antibiotic-treated patients reported significantly more adverse effects (odds ratio, 1.64; CI, 1.05 to 2.57), such as nausea, vomiting, headache, skin rash or vaginitis.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Antibiotics appear to have a modest beneficial effect in the treatment of acute bronchitis, with a correspondingly small risk of adverse effects. The benefits of antibiotics may be overestimated in this analysis because of the tendency of published reports to include complete data only on outcomes found to be statistically significant.

### Antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis in smokers: a systematic review [^115EfedN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Community physicians in the United States prescribe antibiotics to 80% to 90% of smokers with acute bronchitis. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the efficacy of antibiotics for smokers with acute bronchitis.

Design

A medline search was done using the keywords bronchitis, cough, and antibiotics to identify English language articles published from January 1966 to September 2001. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of antibiotics in previously healthy smokers and nonsmokers with acute bronchitis were included.

Measurements and Main Results

For each study, we abstracted information on design, size, inclusion criteria, patient characteristics, and outcomes. Of 2,029 articles in the original search, 109 relevant articles were retrieved and reviewed. There have been no studies specifically addressing antibiotic use in smokers with acute bronchitis. Nine randomized, placebo-controlled trials of antibiotics have included 774 patients and over 276 smokers. Lack of subgroup reporting for smokers precluded meta-analysis. In 7 trials, smoking status did not predict or alter patients' response to antibiotics. In one trial, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resulted in less-frequent cough overall, but not among smokers. In another trial, erythromycin reduced symptom scores only among nonsmokers while antibiotic-treated smokers had a trend toward higher symptom scores.

Conclusion

Although no trials have specifically addressed antibiotic use in smokers with acute bronchitis, existing data suggest that any benefit of antibiotics is the same or less for smokers than for nonsmokers.

### Azithromycin for acute bronchitis: a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial [^117EuB71]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

The value of azithromycin for treatment of acute bronchitis is unknown, even though this drug is commonly prescribed. We have investigated this question in a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial.

Methods

Adults diagnosed with acute bronchitis, without evidence of underlying lung disease, were randomly assigned azithromycin (n = 112) or vitamin C (n = 108) for 5 days (total dose for each 1.5 g). All individuals were also given liquid dextromethorphan and albuterol inhaler with a spacer. The primary outcome was improvement in health-related quality of life at 7 days; an important difference was defined as 0.5 or greater. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings

The study was stopped by the data-monitoring and safety committee when 220 patients had been recruited. On day 7, the adjusted difference in health-related quality of life was small and not significant (difference 0.03 [95% CI -0.20 to 0.26], p = 0.8). 86 (89%) of 97 patients in the azithromycin group and 82 (89%) of 92 in the vitamin C group had returned to their usual activities by day 7 (difference 0.5% [-10% to 9%], p > 0.9). There were no differences in the frequency of adverse effects; three patients in the vitamin C group discontinued the study medicine because of perceived adverse effects, compared with none in the azithromycin group. Most patients (81%) reported benefit from the albuterol inhaler.

Interpretation

Azithromycin is no better than low-dose vitamin C for acute bronchitis. Further studies are needed to identify the best treatment for this disorder.

### Chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113NPRZt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic bronchitis (CB) is a common but variable phenomenon in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It has numerous clinical consequences, including an accelerated decline in lung function, greater risk of the development of airflow obstruction in smokers, a predisposition to lower respiratory tract infection, higher exacerbation frequency, and worse overall mortality. CB is caused by overproduction and hypersecretion of mucus by goblet cells, which leads to worsening airflow obstruction by luminal obstruction of small airways, epithelial remodeling, and alteration of airway surface tension predisposing to collapse. Despite its clinical sequelae, little is known about the pathophysiology of CB and goblet cell hyperplasia in COPD, and treatment options are limited. In addition, it is becoming increasingly apparent that in the classic COPD spectrum, with emphysema on one end and CB on the other, most patients lie somewhere in the middle. It is known now that many patients with severe emphysema can develop CB, and small airway pathology has been linked to worse clinical outcomes, such as increased mortality and lesser improvement in lung function after lung volume reduction surgery. However, in recent years, a greater understanding of the importance of CB as a phenotype to identify patients with a beneficial response to therapy has been described. Herein we review the epidemiology of CB, the evidence behind its clinical consequences, the current understanding of the pathophysiology of goblet cell hyperplasia in COPD, and current therapies for CB.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^117ABtD6]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are antibiotics associated with improved outcomes in patients with acute bronchitis?

Bottom Line

Prescribing antibiotics for acute bronchitis was associated with reduced overall and nighttime cough and with an approximately half-day reduction in duration of cough, in days feeling ill, and in days with impaired activities. However, at follow-up, there were no significant differences in patients receiving antibiotics compared with those receiving placebo in overall clinical improvements or limitations in work or other activities. There was a significant increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Bronchitis (acute) [^116AouQL]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis affects more than 40 in 1000 adults per year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. One third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2015 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 420 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 306 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 245 studies and the further review of 61 full publications. Of the 61 full articles evaluated, three updated systematic reviews and three RCTs were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 12 PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we categorised the efficacy for six intervention-comparison combinations, based on information about the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, antihistamines, antitussives, beta2 agonists (inhaled), and expectorants/mucolytics.

### Treatment of acute bronchitis and its impact on return emergency department visits [^1118T5TZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are not recommended in healthy, uncomplicated adults for the treatment of acute bronchitis, yet are still often prescribed. No randomized studies have examined whether prescribing antibiotics in the emergency department (ED) impacts hospital return rates.

Objective

Our aim was to compare hospital return rates between those who were prescribed an antibiotic vs. those who were not prescribed an antibiotic for the treatment of acute bronchitis.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was completed evaluating patients aged 18–64 years who presented to a community teaching hospital ED with acute bronchitis between January 2017 and December 2019. The primary outcomes were 30-day ED return and hospital admissions from initial ED visit. The rates of ED return or readmitted were compared for patients prescribed an antibiotic for treatment of acute bronchitis vs. those patients who were not prescribed an antibiotic.

Results

Of the 752 patients included, 311 (41%) were prescribed antibiotics. Baseline demographics were similar between both groups. Of those prescribed an antibiotic, 26 of 311 (8.4%) returned to the hospital within 30 days compared with 33 of 441 patients (7.5%) who were not prescribed an antibiotic (odds ratio 1.13; 95% confidence interval 0.66–1.92).

Conclusions

There was no association found between antibiotic therapy for treatment of acute bronchitis and return to the hospital.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^115JU8be]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients — evaluation and pharmacologic management is summarized as follows: For immunocompetent adult outpatients presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine investigation. If the cough persists or worsens, we suggest reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations. We suggest no routine prescription of antibiotic therapy, antiviral therapy, antitussives, inhaled beta agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, oral NSAIDs, or other therapies. If the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis worsens, we suggest reassessment and consideration for treatment with antibiotic therapy if a bacterial infection is thought likely or treatment for other alternative conditions deemed likely.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: when are antibiotics indicated? A systematic review [^116Dxw2f]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Methods

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotics with placebo or no antibiotics in COPD patients suffering from an acute exacerbation defined as a worsening of a previous stable situation with symptoms such as increased dyspnea, increased cough, increased sputum volume or change in sputum colour. We considered studies if > 90% of patients had a clinical (physician-based) diagnosis of COPD or, ideally, spirometrically confirmed COPD. We excluded studies of patients with acute bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma or bronchiectasis.

We included trials evaluating any antibiotics that were administered orally or parenterally daily for a minimum period of at least three days. We chose three days because this is the minimum duration for which antibiotics are usually prescribed in clinical practice for COPD exacerbations.

The outcome measure of primary interest was treatment failure defined as (1) no resolution of symptoms and signs as reported by patients or physicians or as (2) need for further antibiotics. Outcome measures of secondary interest were duration of hospital admission, admission to an intensive care unit, health-related quality of life, symptoms, mortality, and any adverse events registered during the study period.

Search strategy

The search was carried out by information specialists (Bazian, London, UK) and included searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2005 issue 4), PREMEDLINE (1960 to 1965), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1974 to March 2006), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE, March 2006). We entered all included studies into the Pub-med "related articles" function and the science citation index. In addition, we scrutinised the reference lists of included studies and review articles as well the conference proceedings of the international congresses of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society from 2000 to 2006 since these studies might not have been fully published yet. We also contacted representatives of the pharmaceutical industry for additional published or unpublished data (Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, BoehringerIngelheim, Pfizer and MSD). Finally, we searched international data bases for trial registration to identify ongoing or recently completed trials.

Study selection

Two members of the review team independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all identified citations without imposing any language restrictions. The reviewers then evaluated the full text of articles that seemed potentially eligible by one of the reviewers. Final decisions on in- and exclusion were recorded in the Endnote file and agreement was assessed using chance-adjusted kappa statistics.

### The problems of meta-analysis for antibiotic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a heterogeneous disease: a commentary on puhan et al [^115PTo5q]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchitis is among the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription worldwide. This diagnosis includes two distinct entities, acute bronchitis in the absence of underlying lung disease and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute bronchitis is predominantly a viral disease with good evidence that antibiotics are not of benefit in its management. Exacerbations of COPD, on the other hand, can be of bacterial, viral or mixed etiology, with bacterial infection currently estimated to contribute up to 50% of exacerbations. Furthermore, in contrast to acute bronchitis, these exacerbation episodes are not benign events, as they have consequences ranging from days lost from work, deterioration of health status, progression of airflow obstruction and even death. Therefore, appropriate management of COPD exacerbations is crucial.

Antibiotics are often used in the management of COPD exacerbations. It is estimated that more than 80% of COPD exacerbations are treated on an outpatient basis, which can be regarded as mild to moderate exacerbations. The article published by Puhan et al this month in BMC Medicine makes the argument that there is a lack of evidence for antibiotic benefit in mild to moderate exacerbations of COPD and that additional placebo-controlled trials are required. Their argument is based on a meta-analytic approach where they identified five placebo-controlled randomized trials in the literature, which were confined to 'mild to moderate' exacerbations of COPD. With this approach, although all but one of the trials favor antibiotics, the combined odds ratio is not statistically significant.

Although their conclusions based on the analysis are not erroneous, their approach to this question highlights a number of issues that make it difficult to resolve this argument; these include the heterogeneity of exacerbations, patients and antibiotics in these trials. Another major issue is the acceptance of the results of these trials without critically examining the limitations of the end-points used in these studies. The 'devil is in the details' in these trials, and these details are often overlooked in a meta-analytic approach.

### Chinese medicinal herbs for acute bronchitis [^112GzzQ4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary-care physicians. It is traditionally treated with antibiotics (although the evidence for their effectiveness is weak and modest at best), and other even less effective treatments. Chinese medicinal herbs have also been used as a treatment.

Objectives

This review aimed to summarise the existing evidence on the comparative effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs for treating uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2007, Issue 1), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's specialised register; MEDLINE (1966 to March Week 1, 2007); EMBASE (1988 to January 2007); The Chinese Cochrane Centre's Controlled Trials Register (up to January 2007); and the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1980 to January 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Chinese medicinal herbs with placebo, antibiotics or other Western medicines for the treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

No studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. One study with 300 participants but uncertain randomisation was analysed. The study showed that treatment with the Chinese medicinal herb Huoke granules leads to a shorter duration of cough, fever and sputum compared to using penicillin and Xiaoer Shangfeng Zhike tangjiang syrup. However, the study also lacked allocation concealment and blinding. There was a high possibility of conflict of interest as the Huoke granules were made by the trial author's hospital.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient quality data to recommend the routine use of Chinese herbs for acute bronchitis. Study-design limitations of the individual studies meant that no conclusion about the benefits of Chinese herbs could be taken. In addition, the safety of Chinese herbs is unknown due to the lack of toxicological evidence on these Chinese herbs, though adverse events were reported in some case reports.

### Antibiotics for prolonged wet cough in children [^1137RANQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cough is a frequent symptom presenting to doctors. The most common cause of childhood chronic (greater than fours weeks' duration) wet cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in some settings, although other more serious causes can also present this way. Timely and effective management of chronic wet or productive cough improves quality of life and clinical outcomes. Current international guidelines suggest a course of antibiotics is the first treatment of choice in the absence of signs or symptoms specific to an alternative diagnosis. This review sought to clarify the current evidence to support this recommendation.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of antibiotics in treating children with prolonged wet cough (excluding children with bronchiectasis or other known underlying respiratory illness) and to assess risk of harm due to adverse events.

Search Methods

We undertook an updated search (from 2008 onwards) using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, trials registries, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest searches were performed in September 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with a placebo or a control group in children with chronic wet cough. We excluded cluster and cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods as recommended by Cochrane. We reviewed results of searches against predetermined criteria for inclusion. Two independent review authors selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. We contacted authors of eligible studies for further information as needed. We analysed data as 'intention to treat'.
Main Results

We identified three studies as eligible for inclusion in the review. Two were in the previous review and one new study was included. We considered the older studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias whereas we judged the newly included study at low risk of bias. The studies varied in treatment duration (from 7 to 14 days) and the antibiotic used (two studies used amoxicillin/clavulanate acid and one used erythromycin). We included 190 children (171 completed), mean ages ranged from 21 months to six years, in the meta-analyses. Analysis of all three trials (190 children) found that treatment with antibiotics reduced the proportion of children not cured at follow-up (primary outcome measure) (odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.31, using intention-to -treat analysis), which translated to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). We identified no significant heterogeneity (for both fixed-effect and random-effects model the I² statistic was 0%). Two older trials assessed progression of illness, defined by requirement for further antibiotics (125 children), which was significantly lower in the antibiotic group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.34; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5). All three trials (190 children) reported adverse events, which were not significantly increased in the antibiotic group compared to the control group (OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.69). We assessed the quality of evidence GRADE rating as moderate for all outcome measures, except adverse events which we assessed as low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious for the treatment of children with chronic wet cough (greater than four weeks) with an NNTB of three. However, antibiotics have adverse effects and this review reported only uncertainty as to the risk of increased adverse effects when they were used in this setting. The inclusion of a more robust study strengthened the previous Cochrane review and its results.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^115ZLpNh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis, which is one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care, is controversial. Most clinicians prescribe antibiotics in spite of expert recommendations against this practice.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotic treatment for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Strategy

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2004); EMBASE (January 2000 to December 2003); SciSearch from 1989 to 2004; reference lists of articles and the authors' personal collections up to 1996, and also wrote to study authors and drug manufacturers. EMBASE has previously been searched from 1974 to 2000).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough without other obvious cause in patients without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality. Authors were contacted for missing data.

Main Results

Nine trials involving over 750 patients aged eight to over 65 and including smokers and non-smokers were included in the primary analysis. The quality of the trials was variable. A variety of outcome measures were assessed. Overall, patients receiving antibiotics had better outcomes than did those receiving placebo. At a follow-up visit, they were less likely to have a cough (relative risk (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.85; number-needed-to-treat (NNT) 5; 95% CI 3 to 14), show no improvement on physician assessment (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; NNT 14; 95% CI 8 to 50), or have abnormal lung findings (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.89; NNT 11; 95% CI 6 to 50); and had shorter durations of cough (weighted mean difference 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.16 days), productive cough (weighted mean difference (WMD) 0.52 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.03 days), and feeling ill (WMD 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.00 to 1.16 days). There were no significant differences regarding the presence of night cough, productive cough, or activity limitations at follow up, or in the mean duration of activity limitations. The benefits of antibiotics were less apparent in a sensitivity analysis that included data from two other studies of patients with upper respiratory tract infections with productive cough. There was a non significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group, relative risk (RR) 1.22 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.58).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Overall, antibiotics appear to have a modest beneficial effect in patients who are diagnosed with acute bronchitis. The magnitude of this benefit, however, is similar to that of the detriment from potential adverse effects.

### Chinese medicinal herbs for acute bronchitis [^111Gx4Xd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary-care physicians. It is traditionally treated with antibiotics, (although the evidence for their effectiveness is weak and modest at best), and other even less effective treatments. Chinese medicinal herbs have been also used as treatment.

Objectives

This review aims to summarise the existing evidence on the comparative effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicinal herbs for treating uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's specialised register; The Chinese Cochrane Centre's Controlled Trials Register (up to December 2004); MEDLINE (1966 to March Week 1, 2005); EMBASE (1988 to December 2004); and the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1980 to December 2004).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing Chinese medicinal herbs with placebo, antibiotics or other Western medicines for the treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Four trials reported the time to improvement of cough, fever, and rales associated with bronchitis and showed that patients treated with Chinese herbs had a shorter duration of signs and symptoms. Two trials reported the proportion of patients with improved signs and symptoms at follow up and showed that Chinese herbs were beneficial in terms of relief of signs and symptoms. Thirteen trials analysed the data on physician global assessment of improvement at follow up. Nine of thirteen trials showed that Chinese herbs were superior to routine treatment and the other four trials showed a similar effect to routine treatment. In general, Chinese herbs appeared beneficial. Only one trial reported on adverse effects during treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient quality data to recommend the routine use of Chinese herbs for acute bronchitis. The benefit found in this systematic review could be due to publication bias and study-design limitations of the individual studies. In addition, the safety of Chinese herbs is unknown due to the lack of toxicological evidence on these Chinese herbs, though adverse events are rarely reported. Chinese herbs should be used carefully.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^111BWZ1A]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis — evidence base and clinical statement: Only six studies were eligible, with five pharmacological and one nonpharmacological intervention, and the nonpharmacological study used positive end-expiratory pressure; although all authors reported significant improvement in cough measures, studies were very small, had design or outcome limitations, several did not present cough outcome data, most were short in duration (2 to 12 weeks for pharmacologic studies and 6 months for the nonpharmacologic study), and using GRADE the evidence level was very low; accordingly, for adult patients with chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of any pharmacologic treatments (antibiotics, bronchodilators, mucolytics) as a means of relieving cough per se.
