## Question

formula and explanation for how much ns to put in a hypotensive patient - give an example

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to calculate and administer the initial normal saline (NS) bolus for a hypotensive adult, including an example and a stepwise plan with reassessment and vasopressor triggers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether sepsis-induced hypoperfusion is likely. Then, I should verify the guideline-recommended initial bolus formula and its evidentiary basis. Next, I will calculate the bolus for a concrete example and translate that into practical aliquots and timing. After that, I need to check dynamic reassessment endpoints and when to add vasopressors. Finally, I should consider special populations, fluid type, and summarize the key principles to ensure safety and effectiveness [^1164Az2o] [^113d9FF3].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indication for the 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus. In adults with suspected sepsis and hypotension or lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends administering at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid within the first 3 hours of presentation, which is a weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence but widely adopted in practice and quality bundles [^1164Az2o] [^115d3nLk].

> Wait, let me verify the evidentiary basis and timing nuance before I overcommit to a fixed volume. The 30 mL/kg target originated from observational associations and early goal-directed therapy-era practice; contemporary guidance emphasizes that patient response should guide ongoing fluids rather than a rigid volume, and some data suggest faster delivery (e.g., within 1–2 hours) may correlate with better outcomes, though causality remains uncertain and individualization is key [^117H12Cz] [^111VUNfM] [^113d9FF3].

> I will now examine the core formula and make sure I state it precisely. The initial resuscitation volume equals 30 mL/kg of actual body weight, recognizing that this is a population-level starting point and not a universal endpoint; subsequent fluids should be titrated to clinical response and dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness rather than a fixed cumulative target [^1164Az2o] [^116XQTiT].

> Let me consider a concrete example to anchor this. For a 70 kg adult with suspected sepsis and hypotension, the initial bolus is 30 mL/kg × 70 kg = 2,100 mL, which is approximately 2.1 liters of isotonic crystalloid; in practice, this is often administered as two 1-liter bags or four 500 mL aliquots to allow reassessment between boluses, aligning with emergency care workflows and consensus statements that discourage prespecified endpoints and favor response-guided titration [^112782bC] [^1173ABH8].

> Hold on, I should verify the timing and delivery strategy. While the SSC window is within 3 hours, several studies and reviews suggest that completing the 30 mL/kg bolus within 1–2 hours may be associated with faster shock reversal and lower mortality signals, though this is observational; practically, using 500–1,000 mL aliquots over 15–30 minutes with reassessment after each bolus balances speed with safety and allows course correction if the patient is not fluid responsive [^111VUNfM] [^114RidxZ] [^1173ABH8].

> Next, I should review what to assess after each aliquot and how to decide on further fluids. I need to check blood pressure and mean arterial pressure, heart rate, capillary refill, skin temperature, mental status, and urine output; importantly, I should incorporate dynamic measures such as passive leg raise with stroke volume or cardiac output monitoring, pulse pressure variation, or echocardiography to determine fluid responsiveness, because static parameters like CVP are unreliable for this purpose in most patients [^116XQTiT] [^112o9Tv8] [^117FgygU].

> I should double-check the vasopressor trigger so I don't delay pressors unnecessarily. If hypotension persists during or after the initial 30 mL/kg bolus, or if there is life-threatening hypoperfusion, start norepinephrine to target MAP ≥ 65 mmHg while continuing diagnostic and source-control steps; I initially thought to wait for the full 30 mL/kg before pressors, but wait, the hour-1 sepsis bundle and contemporary consensus support early vasopressor initiation in persistent shock without requiring a specific fluid threshold, especially when MAP remains below 65 mmHg or the patient is clearly not fluid responsive [^113d9FF3] [^112Pewt4].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a subgroup where 30 mL/kg could cause harm. In patients with acute decompensated heart failure or other volume-intolerant states, observational data suggest that 10–20 mL/kg may be safer and associated with better outcomes, so I should individualize downward and rely more heavily on dynamic assessments; similarly, in chronic kidney disease, smaller initial volumes may reduce length of stay without compromising hemodynamics, reinforcing the need to tailor the bolus rather than apply a one-size-fits-all dose [^117DWYTJ] [^113qcjqA].

> I need to ensure I specify the fluid type. Balanced crystalloids such as lactated Ringer's are preferred over 0.9% saline for initial resuscitation in sepsis, particularly when larger volumes are anticipated, because balanced solutions are associated with improved survival signals and less hyperchloremic acidosis in sepsis cohorts; this aligns with SSC guidance and recent analyses of sepsis-induced hypotension cohorts [^112oHKo2] [^117PAxfs].

> Let me reconsider the overall approach to avoid over-resuscitation. After the initial 30 mL/kg, if perfusion improves and MAP is adequate, fluids should be paused; if hypoperfusion persists, I should reassess fluid responsiveness with dynamic tests and, if negative, escalate vasopressors and consider inotropes rather than continuing large crystalloid loads, because excessive positive fluid balance is linked to worse outcomes and the duration of hemodynamic benefit from a bolus is often limited to less than 2 hours in many patients [^114P8Wsu] [^1168pvSh].

> To synthesize, the practical formula is: initial crystalloid bolus = 30 mL/kg actual body weight, delivered in 500–1,000 mL aliquots over 15–30 minutes with reassessment after each aliquot, aiming to complete within 1–3 hours while starting vasopressors early if MAP remains below 65 mmHg or the patient is not fluid responsive; for a 70 kg adult, that equals 2.1 liters, typically given as two 1-liter bags or four 500 mL boluses, with ongoing management individualized by dynamic hemodynamic assessment and comorbidity considerations [^1164Az2o] [^112782bC] [^1173ABH8].

---

For a hypotensive adult, give **30 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid** (preferably Lactated Ringer's) [^112oHKo2] as an initial bolus within the first 3 hours [^1164Az2o] of presentation, then titrate to clinical response and perfusion targets. For a 70 kg patient, this is **2,100 mL**, typically delivered as two 1,000–1,050 mL boluses over 30–60 minutes each, with reassessment after each bolus. If MAP remains < 65 mmHg or lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L after the bolus, start vasopressors and continue fluids in 500–1,000 mL aliquots guided by dynamic measures (e.g. passive leg raise, stroke volume variation) [^116XQTiT] to avoid overload [^114P8Wsu].

---

## General formula for fluid resuscitation

The **initial fluid resuscitation volume** is calculated using the following formula:

Initial fluid volume (mL) = **patient's weight (kg) × 30 mL/kg**

This formula is based on the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) 2021 guidelines [^1164Az2o], which recommend administering **at least 30 mL/kg of intravenous crystalloid fluids within the first 3 hours** of presentation for adult patients with sepsis-induced hypotension or septic shock.

---

## Example calculation

For a patient weighing **70 kg**, the initial fluid volume is:

Initial fluid volume = 70 kg × 30 mL/kg = **2,100 mL**

This volume should be administered as **two separate boluses of 1,000–1,050 mL each**, typically over 30–60 minutes, with reassessment of the patient's hemodynamic status after each bolus.

---

## Clinical targets and endpoints

During fluid resuscitation, the following **clinical targets and endpoints** should be monitored:

- **Mean arterial pressure (MAP)**: Target MAP ≥ 65 mmHg [^113L5HxF].
- **Heart rate**: Aim for normalization or significant reduction.
- **Urine output**: Target ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hour.
- **Mental status**: Improvement in consciousness and alertness.
- **Lactate levels**: Decrease in serum lactate indicates improved tissue perfusion [^116NX4g1].

---

## Timing and rate of fluid administration

The SSC guidelines emphasize **early and rapid fluid administration**. The initial 30 mL/kg bolus should be completed within the first 3 hours of presentation, ideally as early as possible. Rapid administration is critical to restore intravascular volume, improve cardiac output, and enhance tissue perfusion.

---

## Type of fluid

Isotonic crystalloids, such as normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution, are recommended for initial resuscitation. Recent evidence suggests that **balanced crystalloids (e.g. lactated Ringer's)** may be preferred over normal saline due to lower risks of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and renal complications [^113d9FF3].

---

## Individualization of fluid therapy

While the 30 mL/kg formula provides a standardized starting point, fluid therapy should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, including:

- **Age and comorbidities**: Elderly patients or those with chronic heart failure, renal impairment, or liver disease may require cautious fluid administration to avoid fluid overload [^1125qQDd].
- **Clinical response**: Patients who respond poorly to initial fluid boluses may require earlier initiation of vasopressor therapy [^115RFJfP].
- **Dynamic assessment**: Use of dynamic measures (e.g. passive leg raise, stroke volume variation) to guide ongoing fluid administration and avoid excessive fluid loading [^112MxsEr].

---

## Potential risks and complications

Excessive fluid administration can lead to **complications**, including:

- **Fluid overload**: Pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, and respiratory distress [^112MxsEr].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic acidosis.
- **Coagulopathy**: Dilution of clotting factors and impaired coagulation [^1115rXax].
- **Abdominal compartment syndrome**: Particularly in trauma or surgical patients [^1115rXax].

## Fluid resuscitation protocol

| **Step** | **Action** | **Details** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Assess patient | - Hypotension (MAP < 65 mmHg) <br/> - Or lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L |
| 2 | Calculate initial fluid volume | Weight (kg) × 30 mL/kg |
| 3 | Administer fluids | - Two boluses of 1,000–1,050 mL <br/> - Over 30–60 minutes each |
| 4 | Reassess after each bolus | - MAP <br/> - Heart rate <br/> - Urine output <br/> - Mental status <br/> - Lactate |
| 5 | Adjust therapy | - Add vasopressors if MAP < 65 mmHg persists <br/> - Titrate fluids based on response |

---

The initial fluid resuscitation for a hypotensive adult patient is **30 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid** [^1164Az2o], administered rapidly and titrated to clinical response. This approach balances the need for rapid restoration of perfusion with the risks of fluid overload, emphasizing early intervention and individualized care.

### Fluid resuscitation of trauma patients: how fast is the optimal rate? [^114R92ku]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines recommend an initial rapid infusion of fluid (1–2 L) in trauma and hemorrhage victims as a diagnostic procedure to aid treatment decisions. Although patient response to initial fluid resuscitation is the key to determining therapeutic strategies, the appropriate rate of infusion is not clearly defined. Ninety-nine adult (age > 16 years) blunt trauma victims with hypotension were enrolled. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to hemodynamic state after initial fluid resuscitation and requirement of surgical intervention. Total volume and rate of infusion differed significantly between the groups (P < .05). Patients requiring fluid administration at higher rate were all hemodynamically unstable and required immediate surgical intervention. Moreover, rate of infusion was the best predictor of the patients who required immediate surgical intervention. Moderate fluid infusion rate should be considered to allow identification of the patient's response to initial fluid resuscitation.

Initial resuscitation

The 2012 guidelines recommended a 'protocolized, quantitative resuscitation… of patients with sepsis induced hypoperfusion as defined as hypotension persistent after initial fluid challenge or lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L'. Care bundles were developed to reflect this goal and were revised in 2015 to specify goals to be met within the first 3 hours of care and those to be achieved by 6 hours. The goals of the first bundle should be achieved within the first 3 hours of 'presentation', defined as either arrival in the emergency department or the time of the first chart documentation consistent with the patient meeting criteria for sepsis or septic shock(box 2). Time to completion of the 3-hour bundle has been shown to strongly correlate with mortality with an increased OR of 1.04 for each hour of delay.

Box 2
Three-hour and 6-hour sepsis bundles

Within 3 hours of presentation:

Measure lactate
Obtain blood cultures
Bolus 30 mL/kg crystalloid for hypotension of lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L

Within 6 hours of presentation:

If persistent hypotension (mean arterial pressure ≤ 65 mm Hg) despite adequate volume resuscitation, consider addition of vasopressors
Frequently re-assess volume status and tissue perfusion for those with persistent hypotension and/or initial lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L
Normalization of lactate

The 2016 guideline update continues to emphasize initial resuscitation with a 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus within the first 3 hours of presentation. After this initial bolus, resuscitation should be guided by either a 'repeat focused exam after initial fluid resuscitation including vital signs, cardiopulmonary, capillary refill, pulse, and skin findings'or two of the following: CVP, superior vena cava oxygenation saturation (ScvO2), bedside ultrasound or dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness. The focused examination includes reassessment of physiological parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation and urine output. The dynamic assessment includes response to straight leg raise, stroke volume variation and pulse pressure variation.

Overview of the Presentation

The three fluid and vasopressor questions identified by the Task Force as a whole are as follows:

1) What are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?
2) What is the optimal fluid for sepsis resuscitation?
3) What is the optimal approach to selection, dose titration, and escalation of vasopressor therapy?

The format for each of the three questions directly mirrors that used in the previously published overview, which contains a more extensive description of the methods. One question was assigned to each author for review and summary. The presentation of each question is followed by a critique of the existing evidence of what is currently known of the subject. Subsequently, each author presented what is not known regarding each question and the gaps in our current understanding of the subject. For each question, the suggested research questions are iterative and aim to address broad areas of uncertainty. Accordingly, clinical outcomes may need to be refined to not only determine mortality benefit but also inform stakeholders on relevant outcomes of interest, such as, quality of life, organ function, and resource utilization. Finally, each author concluded their overarching question by presenting a proposed list of research questions deemed worthy of further inquiry. This list of questions was purposefully intended to be exhaustive, and the authors acknowledge that they may not be answered in the coming decade but are necessary to describe so as to provide a roadmap for where research efforts should be directed.

Question 1: What Are Ideal Endpoints for Volume Resuscitation and How Should Volume Resuscitation Be Titrated?

What is known.

The rationale for fluid resuscitation is largely derived from multiple experimental and clinical studies. Fluid resuscitation increases cardiac output, at least at the early stages of sepsis. In addition, fluid resuscitation increases microvascular perfusion in patients with septic shock, and this is associated with improved organ function.

The impact of fluid resuscitation on outcome is less obvious and is mostly supported by experimental data. Large-scale interventional trials investigating goal-directed therapy did not directly address the amount, timing, or guiding clinical variables beyond central venous oxygenation (Sc 2). In preclinical models of sepsis, fluid administration prolongs survival time compared with no fluid resuscitation, even though long-term outcomes could not be evaluated from these types of studies. Specifically, out-of-hospital fluid administration during transport by paramedics is associated with an improved outcome in hypotensive patients (19), it has not been associated with a benefit, and it may even be associated with increased mortality, in normotensive patients.

Shortly after administration, most patients respond to fluids in the form of improved blood pressure, but this proportion decreases rapidly over time. After initial fluid bolusing, the amount of fluid required to maintain goal blood pressure varies between patients based upon a number of factors, ranging from severity of dehydration to ongoing fluid losses to severity of illness to underlying comorbidities. Understanding when to continue volume loading and when to discontinue additional fluid administration is of critical importance, since excessive fluid administration appears to be detrimental, as suggested by the association between positive fluid balance and poor outcome in observational trials. A meta-analysis of nine randomized trials comparing "low" versus "high" volumes of resuscitation found no difference in outcome, suggesting that individualization of fluid therapy is desired. The duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids is determined by the amount of fluid administered, capillary leak, and hemodynamic adjustments (including volume adjustments between stressed and nonstressed volumes) resulting from the resolution of compensatory mechanisms initiated during hypovolemia. Very few studies have evaluated the impact of the duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids in critically ill patients, and it seems that these effects may last less than 2 hours. Conceptually, fluid administration improves cardiac output and tissue perfusion. However, it is critical to note that fluid administration yields inconsistent effects in a cohort of patients. As such, there is increasing recognition of the need for individualizing care. Resuscitation by formula is not suitable for achieving endpoints of resuscitation across a heterogeneous group of patients, as varied needs would result in some patients receiving too much and others not enough fluids. Further, although the rationale for initiating fluid resuscitation is the correction of tissue malperfusion through an improvement in cardiac output, in practice, fluids are often administered in order to correct hypotension or oliguria, whereas indices assessing tissue perfusion, including cardiac output, are often not readily assessable.

### Initial fluid resuscitation (30 mL / kg) in patients with septic shock: more or less? [^111VUNfM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The 2018 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) recommends rapid administration of 30 mL/kg crystalloid fluids for hypotension or lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L in patients with septic shock; however, there is limited evidence to support this recommendation. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between initial fluid resuscitation doses and prognosis in patients with septic shock.

Methods

This was a multicenter prospective observational study of adult patients with septic shock who were admitted to four intensive care units (ICUs) in a total of three Jiangsu Province teaching hospitals over a 3-year span from May 8, 2018, to June 15, 2021. Each enrolled patients with septic shock was categorized into the low-volume (below 20 mL/kg fluid), medium-volume (20–30 mL/kg fluid) or high-volume (above 30 mL/kg fluid) fluid group according to the initial infusion dose given for fluid resuscitation. Various demographic attributes and other variables were collected from medical records. Logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier curve analysis were used to determine the relationship between initial fluid resuscitation doses and patient outcomes.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 302 patients who presented to the ICU were diagnosed with septic shock. The 28-day mortality was highest in the high-volume group (48.3%) and lowest in the medium-volume group (26.3%, P < 0.05). Patients who completed 30 mL/kg initial fluid resuscitation in the first 1–2 h had the lowest 28-day mortality rate (22.8%, P < 0.05). Logistic regression showed that a medium initial fluid volume dose was an independent protective factor, with the odds ratio (OR) indicating significantly decreased mortality (OR, 0.507; 95% confidence interval, 0.310–0.828; P = 0.007; P < 0.05). A Kaplan-Meier curve stratified by initial fluid resuscitation dose was constructed for the probability of 28-day mortality. The medium-volume fluid group showed a significantly lower 28-day mortality rate than the high-volume group or the low-volume group (log-rank test, P = 0.0016).

Conclusion

In septic shock patients, an initial fluid resuscitation rate of 20–30 mL/kg within the first hour may be associated with reduced 28-day mortality; however, this result needs to be confirmed by further high-quality randomized controlled clinical trials.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1147aP1p]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Fluid resuscitation volume and invasive ventilation

Additional file 1: Figs. S5 and S6 demonstrate a clear linear correlation between the volume of fluid resuscitation and the need for invasive ventilation in septic patients as well as in the subgroup of hypotensive patients (P < 0.05). In the hypotensive subgroup, invasive ventilation accounted for 128 cases, which is equivalent to 31.6% of the total. Both unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models consistently showed that resuscitation volumes above 20 mL/kg significantly increased the risk of endotracheal intubation (Additional file 1: Table S4).

Fluid resuscitation volume and ICU admission

In the unadjusted logistic regression model, there appears to be a correlation between fluid resuscitation volume and ICU admission. However, after adjusting for multiple variables, the initial fluid resuscitation volume is no longer associated with ICU admission, either in all septic patients or the hypotensive subgroup (Additional file 1: Table S5).

Subgroup analyses

Subsequently, subgroup analysis was conducted on sepsis-induced hypotensive patients based on NYHA classification, HFrEF, and BNP levels. The subgroups consisted of NYHA class III and IV, HFrEF (< 50%), and BNP > 4000. The results consistently supported the previously drawn conclusions regarding the effect of initial fluid resuscitation volume on various outcomes in these subgroups (Table 5). The Kaplan–Meier curves for each subgroup showed that the optimal resuscitation group had the lowest mortality rate, which was significantly different from the other resuscitation volume groups (Fig. 3). It is important to note that there was no significant difference in fluid resuscitation volume related to mechanical ventilation in the HFrEF < 50% subgroup (Table 5). However, the rate of mechanical ventilation in this specific subgroup was 39%.

Sensitivity analyses

In the sensitivity analysis, the impact of various initial fluid resuscitation volumes on in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, 1-year mortality, mechanical ventilation, and ICU admission remained consistently in line with the previous findings. Additionally, the results within the subgroup of patients showed similar trends (Additional file 1: Tables S6–S11).

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1125qQDd]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis, a life-threatening syndrome resulting from a dysregulated host response to infection, continues to be a significant global health concern. Timely and appropriate fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of sepsis management. According to the latest guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC), it is still recommended to administer an initial intravenous (IV) 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus within 3 h for septic patients with hypotension, indiscriminate of comorbidities. However, it is important to note that this recommendation is primarily based on several early observational studies. Despite being endorsed in the SSC guidelines, it is considered a weak recommendation with low-quality evidence.

The lack of consideration in this standard fluid resuscitation dose for the heterogeneity among patient populations, particularly those with heart failure (HF), is a significant concern. This one-size-fits-all fluid resuscitation strategy fails to acknowledge the complexities associated with specific comorbidities. Patients with HF may respond differently to excessive fluid resuscitation due to compromised cardiac function, potentially leading to an increased risk of further deterioration.

Limited literature exists regarding fluid resuscitation in septic patients with comorbid HF. However, the available evidence tends to support guideline recommendations. Despite the inclination to align with the recommended 30 mL/kg resuscitation volume in sepsis guidelines, there is still a critical gap in understanding whether this approach is suitable for the heterogeneous population of patients with varying degrees of HF. Real-world clinical practice shows that septic patients with HF often receive less fluid resuscitation or experience delays in achieving the recommended 30 mL/kg target. These deviations from guidelines may have different impacts on patient outcomes, highlighting clinicians' concerns regarding fluid resuscitation in this population.

In the case of a septic patient with HF, there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the appropriate amount of fluid resuscitation and its tolerability. Our study aims to address this knowledge gap by examining the relationship between initial fluid resuscitation volumes and mortality rates in septic patients with HF. Our study specifically examines the impact of early fluid dosing in septic patients with ADHF, a scenario that presents unique challenges compared to stable chronic HF. While the overall prevalence of HF in sepsis is well-documented, the acute decompensation superimposed on sepsis is less studied, and our work aims to fill this gap. By focusing on this distinct subset of patients, we aim to provide more nuanced insights into fluid management strategies that could potentially improve clinical outcomes.

### Contemporary hemodynamic monitoring, fluid responsiveness, volume optimization, and endpoints of resuscitation: an AAST critical care committee clinical consensus [^116q86yh]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Volume status assessment is measured via a compilation of "endpoints of resuscitation". Contemporarily, there is no perfect endpoint of resuscitation, each with their limitations, and thus current practice involves an assimilation of multiple endpoints of resuscitation into an overall assessment. The purpose of this guideline is to review the commonly used endpoints of resuscitation, providing an understanding of the mechanism of measure, accuracy, and potential limitations.

Fig. 2
Association between fluid resuscitation volume and in-hospital mortality among hypotensive patients with HF. A, C, E, and G represent the relationship between the resuscitation volume (in mL) at 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h, respectively, and in-hospital. B, D, F, and H represent the relationship between the resuscitation volume (in mL/kg) at 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h, respectively, and in-hospital mortality

Subsequently, patient fluid volumes ranged from < 10 mL/kg, ≥ 10 to ≤ 15 mL/kg, > 15 to ≤ 20 mL/kg, and > 20 mL/kg based on 3-h resuscitation volume and in-hospital mortality curves. Among these four groups, the in-hospital mortality rates for hypoperfusion patients were 94 (23.6%), 11 (13.9%), 16 (30.8%), and 26 (43.3%), respectively (Table 2).

Table 2
Demographics and clinical characteristics based on initial 3 h fluid resuscitation volumes (n = 405)

a Restricted to patients who survive more than 48 h

b Restricted to patients who survive more than 72 h

In unadjusted models, resuscitation volumes above 15 mL/kg was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality compared to 10–15 mL/kg resuscitation volumes, for all septic patients and specifically within the hypotensive patient subset. Resuscitation volumes below 10 mL/kg in hypotensive patients were also linked to an elevated risk of in-hospital mortality. In the multivariable adjusted logistic regression models, fluid resuscitation between 15 and 20 mL/kg is no longer associated with in-hospital mortality (OR 1.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 4.81), while above 20 mL/kg (OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.31 to 8.15) or below 10 mL/kg (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.14 to 5.20) still increased the risk of in-hospital mortality in all septic patients after adjusting for APACHE-II, age, gender, Charlson index, vasopressor use, antibiotic initiation time, lactate, and BNP. Similar results were observed in the hypotensive patient subset (Table 3).

### How I personalize fluid therapy in septic shock? [^114vJYFP]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

How to customize the initial fluid volume?

The latest SSC guidelines state that septic patients with hypotension or an elevated blood lactate should receive ≥ 30 mL/kg of crystalloid within 3 hours of presentation. This volume, which is only based on an observational study, aims to compensate for relative and absolute hypovolaemia during initial septic shock. The patient's weight is the only parameter of individualization. Yet, the degree of initial volume deficit obviously differs among patients. First, relative hypovolaemia is linked to venous vasodilation, depending on shock severity. Second, in some patients, fluid losses may account for absolute hypovolaemia, which must also be compensated. For example, the fluid deficit must be larger during peritonitis than during pneumonia. The recommendation of an arbitrary volume of 30 mL/kg inevitably leads to under-resuscitation in some patients and fluid overload in others. In addition, tolerance to fluid administration also depends on the cardiac function. The initial fluid therapy should then be individualized. For instance, deciding to reduce the initial volume infused only based on the patient condition may increase mortality.

In the very initial phase, as hypovolaemia is constant, testing preload responsiveness is not warranted and may delay resuscitation. Afterwards, volume expansion should be individualized according to the degree of preload responsiveness, to avoid unnecessary fluid infusion (Fig. 1). This is recommended by the SSC which, on this point, suggests individualization of treatment. Assessing preload responsiveness should not be delayed as it disappears quickly after the onset of septic shock and it. In the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK study, after having received 27 mL/kg of fluids, 70% of patients were still preload responsive at inclusion, and among them, < 20% remained so four hours later. Guiding initial fluid therapy by evaluating preload responsiveness during septic shock can reduce the fluid balance.

How to customize the choice of test or index of preload responsiveness?

Reviews detailing indices and tests to detect preload responsiveness can be found elsewhere. Our goal here is to describe what leads to choosing one over another. This choice depends on three questions (Fig. 1).

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^117H12Cz]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Although early fluid administration is beneficial to delayed fluid administration, the optimal amount of fluid required for an individual patient varies. "Optimal" would infer the quantity of fluid administered that restores perfusion to end organs while not worsening end-organ function. The Hour-1 bundles recommend initiating 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid to patients with suspected sepsis within 1 hour for hypotension or lactate level greater than or equal to 4 µmol/L. Although this is a strong recommendation, it is based upon a low quality of evidence, where the 30 mL/kg dose is derived from a statistical correlation between mortality and amount of fluid administered. Therefore, determining the optimal amount of fluid to be administered remains a critical issue through continued inquiry. Analysis of large databases suggest that there may be a U-shaped response curve, where limited amounts as well as large amounts of fluid administration are associated with worse outcomes. The best response was observed when fluid resuscitation was administered in volumes between 15 and 45 mL/kg, although this range is too wide to be applied readily in clinical practice. Further, data from over 50,000 patients demonstrated that delay in fluid administration was not associated with an increased risk of death. One potential explanation is "time zero" in these studies was defined as presentation to hospital and not time of sepsis recognition. Further, the benefits of fluid resuscitation may be dependent on the severity of illness in the continuum of sepsis and underlying comorbidities.

### Pharmacological management of fluid overload [^11172Z4g]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment practice for the hypotensive patient with poor tissue perfusion is rapid volume resuscitation; in some scenarios, such as septic shock, this is performed with targeted goal-directed endpoints within 6 h of presentation. As a result, patients often develop significant positive fluid accumulation, which has been associated with poor outcomes above certain thresholds.

Methods

The aim of the current paper is to provide guidance for active pharmacological fluid management in the patient with, or at risk for, clinically significant positive fluid balance from either resuscitation for hypovolaemic shock or acute decompensated heart failure.

Results

We develop rationale for pharmacological fluid management targets (prevention of worsening fluid accumulation, achievement of slow vs rapid net negative fluid balance) in the context of phases of critical illness provided in the earlier Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative 12 papers.

### Contemporary hemodynamic monitoring, fluid responsiveness, volume optimization, and endpoints of resuscitation: an AAST critical care committee clinical consensus [^115QZWvU]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

This article, on hemodynamic monitoring, fluid responsiveness, volume assessment, and endpoints of resuscitation, is part of a compendium of guidelines provided by the AAST (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma) critical care committee. The intention of these guidelines is to inform practitioners with practical clinical guidance. To do this effectively and contemporarily, expert consensus via the critical care committee was obtained. Strict guideline methodology such a GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was purposefully NOT used so as not to limit the possible clinical guidance. The critical care committee foresees this methodology as practically valuable to the bedside clinician.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116JnXM9]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Should we individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation and, if so, how? Applying a standard fluid dose to all patients with sepsis is inconsistent with other areas of sepsis management, where efforts are made to personalize care where possible. What alternative strategies can be readily used in clinical practice to individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation to maximize benefit and reduce harms?
2) Which variables should be used to titrate fluid resuscitation? Rigorous trials comparing various dynamic and static variables to evaluate fluid responsiveness are needed. Furthermore, testing various dynamic variables in subgroups of patients with sepsis would be informative. Trials should be designed to incorporate multiple methods of assessing fluid responsiveness.
3) What is the optimal timing for fluid resuscitation? After rapid identification of sepsis and septic shock, time-series studies of fluid resuscitation are needed, especially evaluating the benefits and harms of additional therapies (e.g. vasopressors) and their respective interplay.
4) Which variables should be used to trigger fluid resuscitation and deresuscitation? Related to the timing of fluid resuscitation, should a particular set of physiologic variables be assessed in a serial fashion to determine when to shift from resuscitation to deresuscitation in a structured manner?
5) Is a combined approach using several indices of fluid responsiveness better than using a single measurement in isolation? Furthermore, how should various measures be prioritized to inform clinical judgment?
6) What is the efficacy of using CRT to guide resuscitation in patients with normal lactate levels? Would the use of a rapidly assessable physiologic test be of value in patients without a derangement in lactate levels?
7) What is the duration of effect of fluid resuscitation? Recognizing that the duration of benefit of fluid resuscitation will vary between patients, having some population estimates in mind via pharmacokinetic studies would be useful to clinicians in evaluating therapeutic options and subsequent care.
8) Do early vasopressors limit the amount of fluids required to reach the same hemodynamic target? If so, what is the appropriate ratio of fluids and vasopressors? Identifying if there is a benefit to applying a polytherapeutic approach to early resuscitation is particularly interesting given the concerns regarding excessive fluid administration. A polytherapeutic approach of early fluid administration and vasopressors using a standardized assessment approach considerate of patient variables may be more precise and individualized, thereby maximizing benefit and limiting adverse effects.
9) Should the initial resuscitation of fluids be restricted to hypotensive patients or patients with lactate greater than or equal to 4 mmol/L? In an effort to limit the effects of excessive fluid administration while maximizing benefit in those patients with malperfusion, comparing strategies of fluid resuscitation in distinctive groups of septic shock would be useful.
10) Should the initial fluid resuscitation be administered as a fixed dose of 30 mL/kg or should it be administered in smaller aliquots, with further administration contingent on reassessing the patient condition prior to administering the next bolus? Although the 30 mL/kg bolus carries the risk of under- and overdosing, it has the advantage of being relatively simple to apply, especially in resource-limited settings where advanced measurements cannot be obtained. Administration of smaller doses, repeated as needed according to hemodynamic assessment, has the advantage of fine-tuning fluid administration according to an individual patient's needs. The risk associated with this approach is the potential for adding additional complexity, while still resulting with relatively similar amount of fluids administered and diverting the healthcare team from completing other essential tasks in the initial management of the patient with sepsis.
11) Should sicker patients receive a greater amount of initial resuscitation? In the continuum of sepsis and septic shock, should those patients with more severe physiologic derangements receive greater initial amounts of fluid resuscitation to restore perfusion at the cellular level? Understanding that there may be dose gradient to the initial volume of fluid resuscitation based on the severity of shock would be informative and guide further, targeted research in the field.
12) Should resuscitation differ in patient populations less able to tolerate large volumes? In an effort to individualize sepsis care for subgroups at greater risk of harm from vigorous resuscitation, trials evaluating subgroups of patients with particular comorbidities (heart failure, dysrhythmias, end-stage renal disease) are necessary. The ideal trial in this domain should test two fluid resuscitation strategies using tiered severity in the triggering variables, whereas the fluid boluses should be of similar amount and given only after the evaluation of fluid responsiveness. Ideally, the study should be stratified for subgroups such as heart failure and kidney disease.
13) What is the optimal strategy for fluid resuscitation in resource-limited settings? Data on resuscitation vary significantly between well-resourced and resource-limited settings, as in sub-Saharan Africa, the administration of fluids was associated with an increased risk of death. Understanding the physiology of fluid resuscitation in the absence of other elements of critical care provided in ICUs with higher resources is a key question for a large portion of the world's population. Developing simplified strategies for patient assessment and fluid administration would greatly improve the quality of care delivered.

### Lactated Ringer's or normal saline for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis-induced hypotension [^112oHKo2]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Is lactated Ringer's solution, as compared with 0.9% saline, for initial fluid resuscitation associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension?

Findings: In the Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) trial population, death before discharge home by day 90 occurred in 12% of participants in the lactated Ringer's group and in 16% of participants in the 0.9% saline group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51–0.99).

Meaning: In line with the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, our results suggest that initial fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, compared with 0.9% saline, might be associated with improved outcome in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension.

Fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone treatment in the management of sepsis. The controversy of early resuscitation fluid choice and its effect on outcome remains a debated question. The use of 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) has been common practice and is highly prevalent in the ICU. However, recent data suggests potential harm, such as hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, renal vasoconstriction, and acute kidney injury, associated with its use. Previously, balanced crystalloids (e.g. lactated Ringer's solution) or 0.9% saline were equally recommended, but this changed with the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines favoring balanced crystalloids for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis. Evidence for this recommendation was based on studies investigating extended treatment periods exceeding the initial fluid resuscitation. The value of using balanced crystalloids specifically for initial fluid resuscitation has not been adequately studied. Hence, in contrast to previous literature, the present study investigated the fluid choice for the initial 1–3 L of fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension, irrespective of the subsequent fluid type used.

The Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) trial randomized participants with sepsis-induced hypotension to an early restrictive treatment strategy or liberal fluid treatment strategy and was unable to detect a significant difference in mortality. We used the CLOVERS trial data to investigate whether initial fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution is associated with improved survival as compared with 0.9% saline.

### Restricted fluid resuscitation in suspected sepsis associated hypotension (REFRESH): a pilot randomised controlled trial [^1129TzWs]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine if a regimen of restricted fluids and early vasopressor compared to usual care is feasible for initial resuscitation of hypotension due to suspected sepsis.

Methods

A prospective, randomised, open-label, clinical trial of a restricted fluid resuscitation regimen in the first 6 h among patients in the emergency department (ED) with suspected sepsis and a systolic blood pressure under 100 mmHg, after minimum 1000 mL of IV fluid. Primary outcome was total fluid administered within 6 h post randomisation.

Results

There were 99 participants (50 restricted volume and 49 usual care) in the intention-to-treat analysis. Median volume from presentation to 6 h in the restricted volume group was 2387 mL [first to third quartile (Q1-Q3) 1750–2750 ml]; 30 ml/kg (Q1-Q3 32–39 ml/kg) vs. 3000 mL (Q1-Q3 2250–3900 ml); 43 ml/kg (Q1-Q3 35–50 ml/kg) in the usual care group (p < 0.001). Median duration of vasopressor support was 21 h (Q1-Q3 9–42 h) vs. 33 h (Q1-Q3 15–50 h), (p = 0.13) in the restricted volume and usual care groups, respectively. At 90-days, 4 of 48 (8%) in the restricted volume group and 3 of 47 (6%) in the usual care group had died. Protocol deviations occurred in 6/50 (12%) in restricted group and 11/49 (22%) in the usual care group, and serious adverse events in four cases (8%) in each group.

Conclusions

A regimen of restricted fluids and early vasopressor in ED patients with suspected sepsis and hypotension appears feasible. Illness severity was moderate and mortality rates low. A future trial is necessary with recruitment of high-risk patients to determine effects on clinical outcomes in this setting.

### Intravenous fluids: should we go with the flow? [^113HDVE7]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Focus on inadequate monitoring parameters results in misleading interpretations of therapeutic interventions, and even recent randomized controlled trials used conventional static pressure-based indices as measures for haemodynamic stabilization. The authors of the S3 guidelines therefore propose that future studies on volume management must employ adequate parameters for detecting hypovolaemia, must prove targeted correction according to a management algorithm, and must avoid overdosing.

### Lactated Ringer's or normal saline for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis-induced hypotension [^112ZPQ7h]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Participants

Of the 1563 participants included in the CLOVERS trial, 622 (39.8%) received lactated Ringer's solution and 690 (44.1%) received 0.9% saline for the initial fluid bolus (Fig. S1). Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups (Table S2). Patients receiving lactated Ringer's solution were slightly younger (median, 58 [IQR, 47–68] vs. 62 [52–71]) than patients receiving 0.9% saline. Comorbidities were similar between the two groups, with the exception of chronic kidney disease, which was more prevalent in the 0.9% saline group. No significant differences were observed for the SOFA score at randomization (3 [1–5] vs. 3 [1–5]), amount of fluid for initial pre-randomization bolus (mean ±, 1922 ± 601 vs. 1966 ± 621 mL), vasopressor use at randomization (17.2% vs. 17.7%), and serum lactate levels (2.2 mmol/L [1.4–3.4 mmol/L] vs. 2.2 mmol/L [1.5–3.4 mmol/L]). Fluid volumes and balance by treatment group are shown in Table S3.

### Fluid response evaluation in sepsis hypotension and shock: a randomized clinical trial [^115RFJfP]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

After enrollment and initial treatment in the ED, care was transferred to the ICU team per usual institutional practice. The remainder of sepsis care, including source control and antibiotic selection, was at the discretion of the treating clinicians. In the intervention arm, PLRs were performed before any treatment of hypoperfusion with either fluid bolus or vasopressors for the first 72 hours of ICU admission. SV-guided fluid and vasopressor management was used continuously during the intervention period (72 hours or ICU discharge, whichever occurred first). An increase in SV ≥ 10% was considered FR. If the patient demonstrated FR, protocol prompts were provided to administer a crystalloid fluid bolus (500 mL) for persistent hypotension, with repeat PLRs after every fluid bolus. If the patient was not FR, the initiation or up-titration of vasopressors was prompted with repeat PLRs after significant escalation (an increase of 1 μg/kg/min norepinephrine). In this manner, the protocol allowed for the physiologic titration of both fluid and vasopressors to treat hypoperfusion (Fig 1). Details of fluid volume collection and assessment are detailed in e-Appendix 3. This study was conducted in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by site-specific institutional review boards. All patients or their surrogates provided written informed consent before enrollment and random assignment.

Study End points

The primary end point was the difference in positive fluid balance at 72 hours or ICU discharge, whichever occurred first. Additional predefined secondary end points were a new requirement for RRT, a new requirement for mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, hours of ventilator use over a 30-day period, hours with vasopressor use, and change from baseline serum creatinine. Additional exploratory secondary end points included the incidence of adverse events, number of ICU readmissions, mortality rate, volume of treatment fluid, incidence of major cardiovascular end points (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke termed 3P- major adverse cardiac event [MACE]), discharge location, and mean difference in total fluid balance (including preenrollment) at 72 hours or ICU discharge.

### Contemporary hemodynamic monitoring, fluid responsiveness, volume optimization, and endpoints of resuscitation: an AAST critical care committee clinical consensus [^116WkLj8]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intravascular volume optimization has been found to improve critical care outcomes. There is a delicate balance between hypovolemia (and hypo-perfusion) and volume overload, which is equally associated with complications. Contemporary hemodynamic monitoring aims to offer providers with objective guidance as to their patient's actual volume status.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^112a79zM]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Initial use of a restrictive volume replacement strategy is supported by a prospective randomised trial that analysed the consequences of an initial intra-hospital hypotensive resuscitation strategy in trauma patients with haemorrhagic shock. In this study, with nearly all of the 90 patients suffering from penetrating trauma, patients who had at least one documented in-hospital systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg were randomised to a target minimum mean arterial pressure of 50 mmHg or 65 mmHg. One major drawback to this study was that no statistically significant difference between the actual mean arterial pressure was observed between the two groups over the duration of the study (64.4 mmHg vs. 68.5 mmHg, P = 0.15). Although the authors could not demonstrate a survival difference for the two treatment strategies at day 30, 24 h postoperative death and coagulopathy were increased in the group with the higher target minimum pressure. The patients in this group received not only more i.v. fluids overall, but also more blood product transfusions. Another study that supports a restrictive volume replacement strategy was reported by Brown et al. In this study 1216 trauma patients with an ISS > 15 were included; 51% suffered from hypotension, defined as a systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP) < 90 mmHg. 68% of the patients received a volume load of > 500 mL crystalloid solution. The authors demonstrated that administration of > 500 mL pre-hospital crystalloid was associated with worse outcome in patients without pre-hospital hypotension but not in patients with hypotension. The administration of > 500 mL crystalloid was associated with a correction of hypotension. The authors suggested that pre-hospital volume resuscitation should be goal-directed based on the presence or absence of hypotension. Recently, Schreiber et al. assessed the feasibility and safety of controlled resuscitation (n = 97) in hypotensive trauma patients compared to standard resuscitation (n = 95). Patients were enrolled and randomised in the pre-hospital setting. Eligible patients had a pre-hospital systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg. Controlled resuscitation patients received 250 mL fluid if no radial pulse or an SAP < 70 mmHg was present and additional 250 mL boluses to maintain a radial pulse or a systolic blood pressure ≥ 70 mmHg. The mean (SD) crystalloid volume administered during the study period was 1.0 l (1.5) in the controlled resuscitation group and 2.0 l (1.4) in the standard resuscitation group. ICU-free days, ventilator-free days, renal injury and renal failure did not differ between the groups.

### Are crystalloid-based fluid expansion strategies still relevant in the first hours of trauma induced hemorrhagic shock? [^116xiAA6]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Crystalloid-based resuscitation remains relevant in early trauma care. A delicate balance of fluid resuscitation and vasopressor use is necessary to aim for permissive hypotension in trauma induced circulatory shock. Goal directed therapies must however aim for higher blood pressure goals in the event of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Further research is essential to refine fluid resuscitation guidelines, particularly in defining safe fluid volumes and thoroughly investigate the role of vasopressors. Population based approaches by age, comorbidities and injury mechanism could help tailor trauma care and improve survival. Innovations such as integrated and point of care devices as well as machine learning enhanced tools could help clinicians further individualize trauma care.

### Fluid response evaluation in sepsis hypotension and shock: a randomized clinical trial [^112MxsEr]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

The volume of administered fluids at 72 hours was significantly less in the patients in the intervention arm than the usual care arm (e-Table 3). Separation between arms for 72-hour fluid balance and total amount of administered IV fluids were maintained even when preenrollment fluid was included in the analysis. Consistent with current guideline recommendations, patients received 2 to 3 L of IV fluids before randomization in both arms. These results indicate that PLR-guided protocol instructions during the first 72 hours of care accounted for the observed differences in fluid balance between arms.

Despite reduced fluid administration in the PLR-guided and vasopressor in the intervention arm, higher rates of new renal failure or serum creatinine elevation were not observed. There was a reduced need for RRT or invasive mechanical ventilation in the intervention arm. ICU length of stay was shorter by an average of 2.91 days in the intervention arm, although not statistically significant. Volume overload and elevated renal and central venous pressures increase renal interstitial edema, which in turn results in reduced filtration pressure, which translates into a fall in glomerular filtration. Similarly, excessive lung water is associated with worsening intrapulmonary shunting, progression to respiratory failure that necessitates intubation, potentially prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation, and death.

FRESH provides a prospective validation of earlier observations that optimal real-time physiologic monitoring and individualized assessment of FR may inform treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. In an earlier single center nonrandomized pre-post intervention assessment, a larger fluid difference (3.59 L) was reported between patients who were treated with PLR-guided strategy and usual care. We found a smaller difference in the mITT analysis of the FRESH study, which may be due to more restrictive fluid management in the usual care arm. However, the concordance in a lower risk for renal and respiratory failure between the two arms in the two studies suggests a consistent and strong clinical effect. Additionally, studies of dynamic measure-guided fluid administration in surgical patients have reported comparable overall fluid administration between dynamic measure guided treatment arms and usual care arms with greater preservation of renal and respiratory function in the intervention arm. These data suggest that resuscitation guided by dynamic assessments of cardiac performance is effective at the optimization of circulatory hemodynamics through the reduction of unnecessary and potentially harmful fluid and vasopressor administration.

### Effect of initial infusion rates of fluid resuscitation on outcomes in patients with septic shock: a historical cohort study [^117Xk79j]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The initial fluid resuscitation rate (ml/kg/min) was calculated as the volume of 30 ml/kg of the actual body weight on admission divided by the time (min) to complete. Although the literature in support of the use of 30 ml/kg of crystalloid for initial volume resuscitation among septic shock patients is scarce, it is considered as one of the major recommendations by SSC 2016. Therefore, we chose 30 ml/kg of crystalloid as a cutoff for the inclusion of patients in our study. In a recent study, investigators demonstrated that failure to deliver 30 ml/kg within 3 h of diagnosis of sepsis was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality, irrespective of other comorbidities. Patients were categorized into four groups based on the resuscitation time: ≤ 1 h, 1.1–2 h, 2.1–3 h, and > 3 h for groups 1 to 4, respectively. The corresponding fluid rate for the groups described above were ≥ 0.5, 0.25–0.49, 0.17–0.24, and < 0.17 ml/kg/min, respectively (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Schematic representation of the study protocol. Time zero (T 0) was the starting point of septic shock fluid resuscitation and defined as the first time that MAP < 65 mmHg or serum lactate > 2 mmol/l during the ICU stay. According to the different range of initial fluid resuscitation rate (equal to the slope in the graph), the cohort was divided into four groups: group 1 (≥ 0.5 ml/kg/min), group 2 (0.25–0.5 ml/kg/min), group 3 (0.17–0.25 ml/kg/min), and group 4 (< 0.17 ml/kg/min). The " on the timeline marked ICU admission, shock reversal time (T r), and ICU and hospital discharge; shock reversal time (T r), ICU discharge, and hospital discharge must be after T 0 but had no fixed time relationship with T 0. The main variables and measurements of the study are shown in the bottom half of the figure. The period of shock reversal was defined as the duration between T r and T 0 (abbreviation: ICU = intensive care unit; T 0 = time zero; T 3 = 3 h after T 0; T r = shock reversal time; VIS = Vasoactive-Inotropic Score; LOS = length of stay)

### Pre-hospital fluid therapy in the critically injured patient – a clinical update [^116cdeXp]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

Venous access and fluid therapy should still be considered to be essential elements of pre-hospital advanced life support (ALS) in the critically injured patient. Initiation of fluid therapy should be based on a clinical assessment, most importantly the presence, or otherwise, of a radial pulse. The goal in penetrating injury is to avoid hypovolaemic cardiac arrest during transport, but at the same time not to delay transport, or increase systolic blood pressure. The goal in blunt injury is to secure safe perfusion of the injured brain through an adequate cerebral perfusion pressure, which generally requires a systolic blood pressure well above 100 mmHg. Patients without severe brain injury tolerate lower blood pressures (hypotensive resuscitation). Importantly, using systolic blood pressure targets to titrate therapy is not as easy as it seems. Automated (oscillometric) blood pressure measurement devices frequently give erroneously high values. The concept of hypotensive resuscitation has not been validated in the few studies done in humans. Hence, the suggested targeted systolic blood pressures should only provide a mental framework for the decision-making. The ideal pre-hospital fluid regimen may be a combination of an initial hypertonic solution given as a 10–20 minutes infusion, followed by crystalloids and, in some cases, artificial colloids. This review is intended to help the clinician to balance the pros and cons of fluid therapy in the individual patient.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^113d9FF3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis early care — intravenous fluid and timing of vasopressors — We agree with delivering an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus during initial management of patients who have hypotension or findings of hypoperfusion absent signs of fluid overload. We do not support a prespecified volume or body mass–adjusted volume of fluid for all patients, though we recognize many patients benefit from 30 mL/kg of crystalloid; patient response may serve as the best indicator of the appropriateness of fluid resuscitation volume, rather than the delivery of a prespecified volume. We do not recognize a specific minimum fluid amount before starting vasopressor support, and vasopressor support may be coupled with plasma volume expansion in severe hypotension or life‑threatening hypoperfusion without requiring that a fluid administration threshold be reached prior to vasopressor initiation. We think serial examinations using more than one bedside tool to assess adequacy of resuscitation are best, with no one approach demonstrated as superior. We support using balanced crystalloid solutions as the primary resuscitation fluid in patients with sepsis, especially if volumes of more than 1 L are used, and note that infusions of saline solution can cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and may impair renal performance in commonly prescribed resuscitative doses.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^1164Az2o]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Initial resuscitation — timing, volume, and assessment approach: Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies, and "we recommend that treatment and resuscitation begin immediately" (Best practice statement). For patients with sepsis induced hypoperfusion or septic shock, "we suggest that at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid should be given within the first 3 hours of resuscitation" (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, "we suggest using dynamic measures to guide fluid resuscitation over physical examination or static parameters alone" (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), with dynamic parameters including response to a passive leg raise or a fluid bolus using stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), or echocardiography. A retrospective analysis "showed that failure to receive 30 mL/kg of crystalloid fluid therapy within 3 hours of sepsis onset was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality, delayed resolution of hypotension and increased length of stay in ICU".

### Effective hemodynamic monitoring [^114ewmZ5]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Minimizing the volume of resuscitation using vasopressors early

At the early phases of resuscitation, fluid and vasopressor administration is often required. While the classical approach suggested to initiate vasopressors after fluid completion in persistently hypotensive patients, initiating early vasopressors limits the administered fluid volume and minimizes hypotension time. In experimental septic shock, early administration of norepinephrine reduced lactate and decreased the volume of fluids required to achieve hemodynamic resuscitation. In humans with septic shock, observational data suggest that delayed vasopressor administration is associated with increased mortality. Early vasopressor use is physiologically sound in vasodilatory shock, as it reverses the vasodilation-induced shift of blood from the stressed to unstressed volume. Using a propensity matched analysis of sepsis patients, early introduction of vasopressors was associated with less fluid and improved survival, though not confirmed in another retrospective study which found that similar amounts of fluids were given in early and later vasopressor groups and the use of vasopressors early was associated with a higher mortality. Whether this association reflects more severely ill patients requiring vasopressors early or the independent impact of vasopressors is unknown. In a pilot randomized trial of sepsis with hypotension, administration of fixed dose norepinephrine (0.05 μg kg −1 min −1) within 1 h of hypotension resulted in less fluid administration, less cardiogenic pulmonary edema, fewer arrhythmias and a lower mortality. The CLOVERS trial comparing crystalloid liberal or vasopressors in the early resuscitation in sepsis from the PETAL network was stopped for futility, while the CLASSIC trail showed no difference in mortality between these two treatments.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1133QL6E]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Individualized fluid management in sepsis improves outcomes in patients with septic shock. The recommendation of 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation originates from the early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) trial conducted by Rivers et al. in 2001. Subsequently, both the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) and Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Early Management Bundle (SEP-1) have endorsed this approach. From 2014 to 2015, three independent, government-funded, multicenter randomized controlled trials were conducted: early septic shock in the United States (ProCESS), sepsis resuscitation assessment in Australia (ARISE), and sepsis programmed management in the UK (ProMISe). The average fluid volume administered to patients prior to randomization in these studies was also around 30 mL/kg, which led to the adoption of 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation volume in routine clinical practice. However, there has been significant debate regarding the optimal fluid volume for sepsis management. Increasing evidence suggests that the fluid administration during the EGDT era, which followed a permissive intravenous fluid strategy, resulted in suboptimal treatment outcomes. This has raised persistent questions about the appropriateness of the 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation volume. Additionally, the guidelines do not mention a specific rehydration scheme for septic patients at risk of volume overload, and there is no randomized controlled study for reference. Individualized fluid resuscitation may be necessary for patients at risk of volume overload, as the fixed fluid rehydration amount of 30 mL/kg may not be suitable for all sepsis subgroups. The CLOVERS trial demonstrated that early administration of vasopressors to reduce fluid resuscitation volumes did not decrease the 90-day mortality rate in patients with septic hypotension. In line with these findings, our study emphasizes the importance of tailored fluid management strategies in sepsis, particularly for patients with comorbid heart failure, where the optimal initial fluid resuscitation volume of 10–15 mL/kg within the first 3 h may offer the best clinical outcomes.

### Are crystalloid-based fluid expansion strategies still relevant in the first hours of trauma induced hemorrhagic shock? [^114SozyA]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Crystalloid-based fluid resuscitation has long been a cornerstone in the initial management of trauma-induced hemorrhagic shock. However, its benefit is increasingly questioned as it is suspected to increase bleeding and worsen coagulopathy. The emergence of alternative strategies like permissive hypotension and vasopressor use lead to a shift in early trauma care practices. Critical appraisal of current evidence is necessary to guide clinicians and outline research perspectives.

Main Text

Current guidelines for managing trauma-induced hemorrhagic shock suggest titrating fluids and using vasopressors to achieve minimal blood pressure targets until hemorrhage is controlled. In case of traumatic brain injury with severe hemorrhage, blood pressure target increases. The scientific literature supporting these recommendations is limited, and several aspects remain the subject of ongoing scientific debate. The aim of this review is to evaluate the existing evidence on low-volume fluid resuscitation during the first hours of trauma management, with an emphasis on its integration with permissive hypotension, vasopressor use and cerebral perfusion pressure in traumatic brain injury. The review also highlights the limitations of current guidelines, particularly the lack of robust evidence supporting specific type of fluid, volumes and administration protocols tailored to specific trauma scenarios and populations. Emerging technologies such as point-of-care diagnostics, integrated monitoring systems, and machine learning hold promise for enhancing clinical decision-making in trauma care. These innovations could play a crucial role, ultimately helping clinicians address critical unanswered questions in trauma management and improve patient survival.

Conclusions

Crystalloid-based resuscitation remains relevant in early trauma care, but its application must be reassessed considering recent evidence and evolving practices. Further research is essential to refine fluid resuscitation guidelines, particularly in defining safe fluid volumes and the role of vasopressors. The integration of advanced monitoring technologies may offer new opportunities to optimize trauma care and improve outcomes.

Fluid resuscitation volume and 30-day mortality, 1‑year mortality

In the hypotensive subgroup, the 30-day mortality rate was 24.7% and the 1-year mortality rate was 29.1%. Similar to the in-hospital mortality, Additional file 1: Fig. S2 shows that there is an S-shaped association between the volume of early fluid resuscitation and the 30-day mortality rate in septic patients. On the other hand, Additional file 1: Fig. S3 demonstrates a U-shaped correlation between the volume of early fluid resuscitation and the 30-day mortality rate in the hypotensive subgroup. In the unadjusted Cox model, resuscitation volumes above 15 mL/kg or below 10 mL/kg were all associated with a higher likelihood 30-day mortality rate. In the multivariable Cox models, resuscitation volumes below 10 mL/kg (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.88) and above 20 mL/kg (HR 3.19, 95% CI 1.31 to 8.15) continued to show correlations with the 30-day mortality rate in both septic patients and the hypotensive subgroup (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.07 to 5.32 and HR 3.26, 95% CI 1.32 to 8.43, respectively). However, resuscitation between 15 and 20 mL/kg did not have a statistically significant association with the 30-day mortality rate (Table 4). The relationship between the volume of early fluid resuscitation and the 1-year mortality rate is shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S4 and summarized in Additional file 1: Table S3. The results closely align with those observed for the 30-day mortality rate.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^115KUzaA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Ongoing fluid administration — assessment‑driven resuscitation for suspected sepsis specifies that fluid administration after an initial bolus should be based on serial assessments of the patient and response to therapy. No singular assessment approach is superior, and we recommend using multiple assessments at multiple time intervals; if using a quantitative resuscitation approach, we recommend dynamic measures over static measures. Up to 50% of patients with septic shock fail to increase cardiac output in response to fluid administration and, when fluid loading does increase cardiac output, the response is often transient; all patients with ongoing hypotension or elevated lactate levels after initial fluid resuscitation need repeated hemodynamic assessment. Because no specific method of hemodynamic assessment is clearly superior in altering survival, we present 2 approaches — a clinical evaluation with basic techniques widely available in emergency care settings and a quantitative evaluation using more advanced assessment methods — and both are reasonable for monitoring and serial assessment; using either method, sepsis assessment should iteratively use multiple parameters to guide therapy. Patients who improve with the initial bolus of fluid are candidates for subsequent fluid boluses using aliquots such as 500 to 1,000 mL, followed by repeat serial clinical examinations to evaluate response and volume overload.

### Incorporating dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness into goal-directed therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112o9Tv8]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Using a prespecified published protocol, we performed a systematic review congruent with the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews and reported outcomes according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines.

Research Question and Eligibility Criteria

We posed the following research question: "In adult patients admitted to the ICU requiring acute volume resuscitation, does goal-directed fluid therapy guided by FT-DYN compared with standard care result in improved clinically relevant outcomes?" Our primary outcome was the incidence of mortality at the longest duration of reported follow-up. Secondary outcomes were ICU and hospital length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and frequency of renal complications. Additional physiologically relevant secondary outcomes included serum lactate at end intervention and quantities of IV fluids administered. We included trials satisfying the following criteria: prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in human subjects, adult patients (≥ 18 yr old), greater than or equal to 80% of patients admitted to the ICU, patients having indication for acute volume resuscitation (e.g. hypovolemia, hypotension, shock), allocation to resuscitation based on a goal-directed therapy algorithm that included fluid therapy guided by FT-DYN, and comparator group receiving standard care (empiric fluid therapy based on weight, static variables, or the clinical examination). Observational trials were not included to reduce the potential for performance and selection bias. We excluded trials evaluating electrical bioimpedance techniques due to published concerns regarding their accuracy in predicting fluid responsiveness. We also excluded quasi-randomized, cross-over, or cluster randomized trials and trials in which control groups received fluid therapy guided by FT-DYN.

### Strategies for intravenous fluid resuscitation in trauma patients [^116NX4g1]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Post-resuscitation fluid management

Background

The consequences of under- or over-resuscitation with intravenous fluids are both detrimental. Hypovolemia resulting in adrenergic stimulated vasoconstriction, hypervolemia and fluid overload, massive intravenous fluid administration causing large sodium loads, dilution of coagulation factors, and rapid administration of cold fluids all result in damage to the endothelial layer and glycocalyx, impairment of microcirculatory function and inappropriate fluid shifts. The decision when to transition from an initial resuscitation phase to a post-resuscitation period is critical to a successful outcome.

Following the initial resuscitation phase, physiological targets may change despite the overall objective of adequate tissue perfusion remaining the primary goal. The post-resuscitation period may be considered after:
Hemostasis and correction of coagulopathy (ongoing blood product replacement no longer required).
Evidence of improving microcirculatory flow (for example, improving lactate and blood gas parameters).
Hemodynamic stability (systolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg with a mean arterial blood pressure of > 65 mmHg in most cases; no longer need for inotropic or vasopressor support; an improving pulse rate in the presence of appropriate analgesia).

At this stage, most patients will no longer be responsive to rapid fluid administration, with normalization of markers for volume status (barometric or volumetric preload indicators) and markers for fluid responsiveness (pulse pressure variation (PPV), stroke volume variation (SVV), passive leg raise (PLR) test).

Importantly, in certain circumstances where patients remain fluid responsive, curtailment of ongoing fluid resuscitation may be necessary if the tolerance to further intravenous fluid is deemed detrimental to physiological processes (for example, abrupt increase in extravascular lung water; worsening intra-abdominal pressure or abdominal compartment syndrome; difficult ventilation). Alternative strategies should be considered including inotropic support guided by cardiac output monitoring, alternative fluid strategies, and planning for hemodialysis with net ultrafiltration.

The clinician should be aware of the different phases within fluid management according to the ROSE concept. After the initial resuscitation (R) phase comes organ support (O) and stabilization (S), and finally evacuation (E) of excess fluids may be needed in some patients (Table 2).

### Assessing the impact of CKD on outcomes in septic shock patients receiving standard Vs reduced initial fluid volume [^113qcjqA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine if following fluid resuscitation recommendations in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines affects hospital length of stay (LOS) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who present to the emergency department with sepsis-induced hypotension or septic shock.

Design

Retrospective, single center, cohort study.

Setting

433-bed community hospital with a 35-bed emergency department in central Kentucky.

Patients

Adults (≥ 18 years of age) who presented to the emergency department with severe sepsis or septic shock, as defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), with documented CKD and at least one episode of hypotension within 6 h of presentation. A total of 106 patients were included in the study.

Measurements and Main Results

Patients were stratified into two groups based on the total volume of weight-based crystalloid fluid bolus initiated within the first three hours of hypotension onset (< 27 mL/kg and ≥ 27 mL/kg). There was a statistically significant reduction in the primary outcome of median LOS among patients who received less than 27 mL/kg of a crystalloid fluid bolus (5.1 vs 7.7 days, p = .003). Likewise, there was a statistically significant reduction in the secondary outcome of total cost per case in the reduced fluid volume cohort (p = .019. No significant differences were found in other secondary outcomes, including vasopressor requirements, ICU admission rate, and normalization of MAP at 6 h.

Conclusion

The results of this single-center, retrospective study indicate that CKD patients who receive guideline-directed fluid resuscitation (≥ 27 mL/kg) for sepsis-induced hypotension or septic shock experience a longer hospital LOS compared to those who receive a reduced initial fluid volume.

### Timing of norepinephrine in septic patients: NOT too little too late [^113EKFy5]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Initial resuscitation of septic shock

Sepsis is a disease of common occurrence with vexingly high mortality rates despite all of the advances in diagnosis, process changes, and treatment modalities. Based on recommendations from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, if a patient with sepsis is hypotensive within the first 6 hours of diagnosis, the clinician should initiate vasopressor agents to raise the MAP to 65 mm Hg if fluid resuscitation of 30 mL/kg fails to achieve that goal. Not addressed in this study are the optimal choice for vasopressor agent and the optimal target MAP. Other recent studies do address these issues.

### Predictors, prevalence, and outcomes of early crystalloid responsiveness among initially hypotensive patients with sepsis and septic shock [^111Ytj1X]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The prevalence of responsiveness to initial fluid challenge among hypotensive sepsis patients is unclear. To avoid fluid overload, and unnecessary treatment, it is important to differentiate these phenotypes. We aimed to 1) determine the proportion of hypotensive sepsis patients sustaining favorable hemodynamic response after initial fluid challenge, 2) determine demographic and clinical risk factors that predicted refractory hypotension, and 3) assess the association between timeliness of fluid resuscitation and refractoriness.

Design

Secondary analysis of a prospective, multisite, observational, consecutive-sample cohort.

Setting

Nine tertiary and community hospitals over 1.5 years.

Patients

Inclusion criteria 1) suspected or confirmed infection, 2) greater than or equal to two systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, 3) systolic blood pressure less than 90mm Hg, greater than 40% decrease from baseline, or mean arterial pressure less than 65mm Hg.

Measurements and Main Results

Sex, age, heart failure, renal failure, immunocompromise, source of infection, initial lactate, coagulopathy, temperature, altered mentation, altered gas exchange, and acute kidney injury were used to generate a risk score. The primary outcome was sustained normotension after fluid challenge without vasopressor titration. Among 3,686 patients, 2,350 (64%) were fluid responsive. Six candidate risk factors significantly predicted refractoriness in multivariable analysis: heart failure (odds ratio, 1.43; CI, 1.20–1.72), hypothermia (odds ratio, 1.37; 1.10–1.69), altered gas exchange (odds ratio, 1.33; 1.12–1.57), initial lactate greater than or equal to 4.0 mmol/L (odds ratio, 1.28; 1.08–1.52), immunocompromise (odds ratio, 1.23; 1.03–1.47), and coagulopathy (odds ratio, 1.23; 1.03–1.48). High-risk patients (≥ three risk factors) had 70% higher (CI, 48–96%) refractory risk (19% higher absolute risk; CI, 14–25%) versus low-risk (zero risk factors) patients. Initiating fluids in greater than 2 hours also predicted refractoriness (odds ratio, 1.96; CI, 1.49–2.58). Mortality was 15% higher (CI, 10–18%) for refractory patients.

Conclusions

Two in three hypotensive sepsis patients were responsive to initial fluid resuscitation. Heart failure, hypothermia, immunocompromise, hyperlactemia, and coagulopathy were associated with the refractory phenotype. Fluid resuscitation initiated after the initial 2 hours more strongly predicted refractoriness than any patient factor tested.

Pediatric sepsis without intensive care access with hypotension — initial bolus fluids. In healthcare systems with no availability of intensive care, if hypotension is present, we suggest administering up to 40 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10–20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour with titration to clinical markers of cardiac output and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Personalized blood pressure targets in shock: what If your normal blood pressure is "Low"? [^113UaG7o]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The cornerstone of resuscitation of septic shock is volume infusion followed by vasopressors if fluid volume does not restore adequate perfusion. Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend an initial target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mm Hg, subsequently adjusted. The target MAP and the relative proportions of use of volume versus vasopressors varies widely. But there remains the overarching large question of how to personalize a MAP target in shock (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
At present, the target resuscitation mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 65 mm Hg, despite patients having premorbid blood pressures ranging from hypertension to normal-to-low blood pressure. The goal now is to personalize the initial MAP target according to premorbid blood pressure, aiming for 80–85 mm Hg in patients with previous hypertension; 65 mm Hg in patients with previous normotension; and a lower target, perhaps 55 mm Hg, in patients having a low premorbid blood pressure. In all patients, resuscitation should also aim to achieve normal peripheral perfusion (normal capillary refill time < 2 s, absence of cyanosis), improved mentation (Glasgow Coma Score > 12 mm Hg without sedation), and adequate urine output > 0.5 ml/kg/h.

### Lactated Ringer's or normal saline for initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis-induced hypotension [^117PAxfs]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess whether initial fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution compared with 0.9% saline is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension.

Design

Secondary analysis of the randomized controlled Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) trial.

Setting

ICUs and emergency departments in 60 U.S. centers from March 2018 to January 2022.

Patients

Participants from the CLOVERS trial. Adult patients with a suspected or confirmed infection and hypotension caused by sepsis.

Interventions

Participants received 1–3L of crystalloid fluid for initial fluid resuscitation before randomization. In this analysis, participants were categorized into a lactated Ringer's group and a 0.9% saline group based on the fluid type predominantly used for the initial fluid resuscitation (i.e., ≥ 95% of pre-randomization fluid).

Measurements and Main Results

Of 1563 participants with sepsis-induced hypotension included in the CLOVERS trial, 622 (39.8%) received lactated Ringer's solution and 690 (44.1%) received 0.9% saline as solution for the initial fluid bolus. Death before discharge home by day 90 occurred in 76 of 622 participants (12.2%) in the lactated Ringer's group and in 110 of 690 participants (15.9%) in the 0.9% saline group, resulting in an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.51–0.99; p = 0.043). Patients receiving lactated Ringer's solution had more hospital-free days at 28 days than those receiving 0.9% saline (16.6 ± 10.8 vs. 15.4 ± 11.4, respectively; adjusted mean difference, 1.6 d [95% CI, 0.4–2.8 d; p = 0.009]). Treatment with 0.9% saline was associated with higher levels of serum chloride and decreased levels of serum bicarbonate.

Conclusions

Initial fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, compared with 0.9% saline, might be associated with improved survival in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension.

Key Question 3.4

Vasopressors treatments versus permissive hypotension in geriatric trauma patients: which are the clinical parameters and laboratory tests to consider for choice?

Statement 3.4.1

The administration of vasopressors versus permissive hypotension debate during the early resuscitative stage of elderly trauma patients remains unresolved. Management should be individualized according to the mechanism of trauma, the patient's acute and chronic conditions, and frailty (QoE B-C moderate-low).

Recommendation 3.4

We recommend to carefully evaluate to implement permissive hypotension in managing selected elderly trauma patients. Tissue perfusion has to be constantly monitored by base excess level, arterial lactate dosage, urine output, and when possible, neurologic assessment. [Strong recommendation based on a high-low quality level of evidence 1A].

Summary of evidence and discussion

The concept of "permissive hypotension" refers to managing trauma patients by restricting the amount of fluid resuscitation administered while maintaining blood pressure lower than normal if there is still active bleeding during the acute period of injury Although this treatment approach may avoid the adverse effects of early and high-dose fluid resuscitation, it carries the potential risk of tissue hypoperfusion. It is included in the damage-control resuscitation (DCR) protocol and provides optimal fluid resuscitation and transfusion to patients with hemorrhagic shock secondary to severe trauma. The main DCR principles are: (1) permissive hypotension/hypotensive resuscitation; (2) rapid and definitive/surgical control of bleeding; and (3) the prevention/treatment of hypothermia, acidosis, and hypocalcemia;

Its main endpoints are: (1) to minimize iatrogenic resuscitation injury; (2) to prevent worsening of initial traumatic shock; and (3) to obtain definitive hemostasis.

### Effect of initial infusion rates of fluid resuscitation on outcomes in patients with septic shock: a historical cohort study [^114RidxZ]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this retrospective analysis of MICU patients with septic shock who received fluid resuscitation, we demonstrated that a fluid resuscitation rate > 0.25 ml/kg/min was associated with a shorter time to shock reversal and lower 28-day mortality. Based on our observations, the optimal fluid rate was 0.25–0.5 ml/kg/min (equivalent to 30 ml/kg fluid administration within 2 h). Faster initial fluid resuscitation, in our study, was also associated with lower 28-day mortality. This finding is consistent with a recent prospective observational cohort study, which found that sepsis patients who received initial fluid resuscitation in > 2 h after diagnosis had increased mortality rates. Vincent also suggested administration of 30 ml/kg of fluid over 3 h to be too slow for appropriate fluid resuscitation.

The goal of initial fluid resuscitation in septic shock is to restore intravascular volume, cardiac output, and oxygen delivery. To restore intravascular volume, the rate of initial fluid infusion should be faster than the speed of fluid loss via leaky vascular endothelium. A faster initial fluid resuscitation rate could also decrease the early inflammation and blood viscosity to improve the microcirculation and tissue perfusion. A higher fluid rate is also associated with a more significant increase in MAP and a greater reduction in lactate, a marker for tissue perfusion. This finding is consistent with previous reports that showed improved microcirculation in sepsis following the early administration of fluids. The improvement both in macrocirculation and microcirculation can lead to improved outcomes including less time to shock reversal, need and duration of mechanical ventilation, SOFA score, hospital, MICU stay, and 28-day mortality rates.

On the other hand, very fast fluid replacement may increase glycocalyx shedding and exacerbate vascular dysfunction. The endothelial glycocalyx layer is damaged during sepsis, which negatively impacts its barrier function. Receiving 40–60 ml/kg IV fluid boluses in 1 h (up to 0.67–1 ml/kg/min) among critically ill children led to a cardiovascular collapse in a large trial. Bryne and colleagues found a rapid increase in vasopressor requirement and a significant increase in glycocalyx layer damage after initial fluid resuscitation in an ovine model of endotoxemia following fluid infusion rate of 0.67 ml/kg/min. In our study, while we noted rapid fluid replacement is associated with improved outcomes of septic shock, we were not able to assess the impact of very high fluid rates (> 0.67 ml/kg/min).

### Effect of initial infusion rates of fluid resuscitation on outcomes in patients with septic shock: a historical cohort study [^116MYUq5]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

We also identified an association between a lower initial fluid resuscitation rate and a lower VIS at various time points in the first 24 h of septic shock onset. This result was most likely due to later initiation of vasopressors and the impact of higher baseline weight in calculating VIS. A higher VIS at 48 h after cardiovascular surgery was found to be associated with a longer ICU length of stay and longer ventilator days in pediatric sepsis patients. In our study, group 4 with a lower fluid resuscitation rate and a lower VIS in the first 24 h had worse clinical outcomes. This discrepancy could be due to not assessing VIS beyond 24 h. Also, the relationship between VIS and patient outcomes has not been validated in sepsis.

In our study, a faster initial fluid resuscitation rate was associated with a larger positive fluid balance in the first 3 h of resuscitation, but the differences in fluid balance among the groups were not significant at MICU discharge. Treating patients with septic shock inevitably would result in initial positive fluid balance, which in the early phases of fluid resuscitation increases cardiac output in most patients. In a study by Lee et al. septic shock patients who received a larger volume of fluid in the first 3 h were more likely to survive. The differences in positive fluid balance among the groups resolved beyond the first 3 h because group 1 received fewer fluids after the initial resuscitation phase. Patients who receive less fluid in the first 6 h have significantly higher fluid balance in the next 7 to 72 h, in-hospital, and 28-day mortality. Shen and colleagues also showed a positive fluid balance during the second, but not the first 24 h of septic shock was associated with increased mortality in sepsis. Positive fluid balance during the initial resuscitation phase is associated with the improved outcome as long as the fluid balance is carefully monitored after the resuscitation targets are met.

The potential impact of this research

In this study, we assess the impact of the initial fluid replacement rate on the outcome of patients with septic shock managed based on Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines. We found among septic shock patients the minimum initial fluid resuscitation rate of 0.25–0.50 ml/kg/min (i.e. completion of the initial 30 ml/kg IV fluid resuscitation within the first 2 h) is associated with a shorter time to shock reversal and improved patient outcome.

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^1161kCQ7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Summary statements:

Adequate preoperative preparation for elective major abdominal surgery should not induce a fluid deficit exceeding 2.5% of body weight.
Most studies regarding fluid administration in the perioperative setting are limited to early therapy.
Intraoperative/postoperative rehydration of elective cases should be performed with a balanced salt solution. Although this may be accompanied by an increase in circulating cytokines no clinically deleterious effect has been observed.
Colloids may be administered in elective surgery cases if required- there is no evidence of increased risk in this patient population and there is evidence of better gastrointestinal microcirculatory blood flow and tissue oxygen tension.
Adding vasopressor therapy to fluid administration remains controversial - while it likely decreases the amount of fluid administered it may also decrease end organ perfusion.
The principles guiding fluid administration in sepsis should also guide perioperative fluid administration in patients undergoing urgent abdominal surgery.
The crystalloid chosen for patients after urgent abdominal surgery should be determined individually, based on patient condition at the time of ICU arrival.

Trauma

Recent years have seen some interesting changes in fluid management of trauma patients. Although severe bleeding is the lead cause of death in trauma patients, the European guidelines for management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma strongly recommend restricting volume replacement during initial trauma resuscitation. This recommendation is based on data showing not only the feasibility of this approach but also its advantages in term of both process (e.g. hospital length of stay) and outcomes (e.g. survival).

For many years treatment with colloids was considered particularly efficacious in trauma patients. This concept was based on the assumption that the vascular endothelium remains intact after trauma (contrary to septic shock). Early experimental data supported this assumption, showing that resuscitation with HES 130/0.4 was superior to lactated Ringer. In humans, an exploratory study of patients monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter showed similar hemodynamic outcomes with a lower volume of colloids than crystalloids. However, subgroup analyses of trauma patients included in the RCTs comparing colloids and crystalloids have since failed to confirm this assumption with regards to wither mortality or transfusion requirements. In patients with TBI, mortality was actually higher with albumin than with saline, probably due to the greater increase in intracranial pressure observed during administration of albumin. The European guidelines for management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma therefore recommend isotonic crystalloids rather than colloids for initial resuscitation of hypotensive bleeding trauma patients.

### Are crystalloid-based fluid expansion strategies still relevant in the first hours of trauma induced hemorrhagic shock? [^113TV9Ww]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite major growth and improvements in trauma systems, circulatory shock remains a leading cause of trauma deaths worldwide. The highest mortality rates in severe hemorrhage have been observed in the first hours following trauma giving prehospital care a significant role. By decreasing intravascular blood volume, severe hemorrhage can lead to a state of shock defined as inadequate tissue perfusion due to decreased cardiac output. Aimed at restoring intravascular volume and therefore cardiac output, fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of prehospital trauma care. Its clinical benefit remains however insufficiently characterized and documented harm stems from excessive fluid resuscitation. Indeed, aggressive fluid resuscitation has been suspected of exacerbating acute bleeding by increasing hydrostatic pressure and decreasing clot firmness. Permissive hypotension based on maintaining blood pressure at lower-than-normal levels to ensure minimal organ perfusion emerged to address such concerns. Restrictive fluid expansion strategies combined with vasopressor use could represent an alternative.

Current recommendations suggest for traumatic hemorrhagic shock without severe head injury, to titrate fluids and use vasopressors to maintain permissive hypotension (target systolic blood pressure 80–90 mmHg) until hemorrhage control. If traumatic brain injury is associated to severe hemorrhage, guidelines recommend targeting a systolic blood pressure > 110 mmHg. Isotonic crystalloid solutions are recommended as first line for fluid expansion. The level of evidence for these recommendations is however weak and several aspects remain a matter of scientific controversy. The aim of this perspective is to review the available evidence on low volume fluid resuscitation in the first six hours of trauma management and its articulation with permissive hypotension, vasopressor use and cerebral perfusion pressure in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although they represent exciting alternatives, this review will not address the use of blood products. Further evidence is required to establish their benefit or harm in early trauma resuscitation. Blood products are also not immediately available in all systems, and in consequence fluids remain a first line treatment. This perspective will focus on the evidence and rationale of crystalloid fluids in humans in the first hours of trauma induced hemorrhagic shock. A structured search of literature was conducted and restricted to human studies only. The supplementary material details the search and selection strategy.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — fluid bolus strategy beyond initial resuscitation: If fluid therapy beyond the initial 30 mL/kg administration is required, clinicians may use repeated small boluses guided by objective measures of stroke volume (SV) and/or cardiac output (CO). In post-cardiac surgery patients, fluid challenges of 4 mL/kg compared to 1 to 3 mL/kg increased sensitivity for detecting fluid responsiveness based on CO measurement. In resource-limited regions where CO or SV cannot be measured, a > 15% increase in pulse pressure during a passive leg-raise test for 60–90 seconds could indicate fluid responsiveness.

When less treatment is more

Less aggressive treatment is sometimes associated with better outcomes in critically ill patients. Less red blood cell transfusions, conservative fluid management and lower tidal volume mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients improve outcomes. Similarly, the non-specific use pulmonary artery catheterization may have led to greater resuscitation and worse survival. Similarly, a too restrictive approach may also be detrimental as both approaches may have adverse results if used systematically, effective hemodynamic monitoring may help to achieve the optimal therapy at the individual level. Dynamic hemodynamic monitoring approaches predict fluid responsiveness mitigating the risks of excessive fluid administration identifying those who benefit from fluids. Similarly, when the decision to start an inotrope has been made based on the clinical picture, together with the analysis of perfusion indices and the confirmation of abnormal cardiac function by bedside echocardiography, inotropes can be titrated to achieve the maximum benefit for the least possible dose because high dosages and sustained use can be toxic. Hemodynamic monitoring-derived dynamic measures guiding therapy in septic shock patients leads to less fluid administration with similar or superior outcomes.

Optimizing cardiovascular support in circulatory shock: salvage, optimization, stabilization, de-escalation

No clinical trials have compared hemodynamic monitoring-guided resuscitation from shock to no hemodynamic monitoring conditions, thus most studies compare threshold values of monitor-specific hemodynamic values on specific outcomes when specific treatments or drugs are used to reach those hemodynamic values. The monitoring and management of CVI can be separated into "phases" of care, defined by changing monitoring and management priorities, defined as salvage, optimization, stabilization and de-escalation. During the salvage phase, it is essential to correct profound hypotension as it is a strong predictor of mortality and to identify and treat severe cardiac dysfunction leading to a low CO. During this phase therapies restore and/or maintain MAP > 65 mmHg or more in previously hypertensive patients. Thus, invasive arterial pressure monitoring to guide therapy is indicated if initial fluid bolus does not restore MAP. Echocardiography should be performed as soon as possible to check cardiac function. The level of invasiveness is the subject of other expert consensus statements.

The Trauma Hemostasis and Oxygenation Research (THOR) Network has developed a consensus statement on the role of permissive hypotension in remote damage control resuscitation (RDCR). A summary of the evidence on permissive hypotension follows the THOR Network position on the topic. In RDCR, the burden of time in the care of the patients suffering from noncompressible hemorrhage affects outcomes. Despite the lack of published evidence, and based on clinical experience and expertise, it is the THOR Network's opinion that the increase in prehospital time leads to an increased burden of shock, which poses a greater risk to the patient than the risk of rebleeding due to slightly increased blood pressure, especially when blood products are available as part of prehospital resuscitation. The THOR Network's consensus statement is, "In a casualty with life-threatening hemorrhage, shock should be reversed as soon as possible using a blood-based HR fluid. Whole blood is preferred to blood components. As a part of this HR, the initial systolic blood pressure target should be 100 mm Hg. In RDCR, it is vital for higher echelon care providers to receive a casualty with sufficient physiologic reserve to survive definitive surgical hemostasis and aggressive resuscitation. The combined use of blood-based resuscitation and limiting systolic blood pressure is believed to be effective in promoting hemostasis and reversing shock".

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^1115rXax]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale

In order to maintain tissue oxygenation, traditional treatment of trauma patients uses early and aggressive fluid administration to restore blood volume. This approach may, however, increase the hydrostatic pressure on the wound, cause a dislodgement of blood clots, a dilution of coagulation factors and undesirable cooling of the patient. The concept of low-volume fluid resuscitation, so-called 'permissive hypotension', avoids the adverse effects of early aggressive resuscitation while maintaining a level of tissue perfusion that, although lower than normal, is adequate for short periods. A controlled hypotensive fluid resuscitation should aim to achieve a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg or more. Its general effectiveness remains to be confirmed in RCTs; however, studies have demonstrated increased survival when a low volume fluid resuscitation concept was used in penetrating trauma. In contrast, no significant difference in survival was found in patients with blunt trauma. One study concluded that mortality was higher after on-site resuscitation compared with in-hospital resuscitation. It seems that greater increases in blood pressure are tolerated without exacerbating haemorrhage when they are achieved gradually and with a significant delay following the initial injury. All the same, a recent Cochrane systematic review concluded that there is no evidence from RCTs for or against early or larger volume intravenous fluids to treat uncontrolled haemorrhage. However, a recent retrospective analysis demonstrated that aggressive resuscitation techniques, often initiated in the prehospital setting, appear to increase the likelihood that patients with severe extremity injuries develop secondary abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). In this study, early, large-volume crystalloid administration was the greatest predictor of secondary ACS. Moreover, a retrospective analysis of the German Trauma Registry database including 17,200 multiply injured patients showed that the incidence of coagulopathy increased with increasing volume of intravenous fluids administered pre-clinically. Coagulopathy was observed in more than 40% of patients with more than 2000 ml, in more than 50% with more than 3000 ml, and in more than 70% with more than 4000 mL administered.

### Is restriction of intravenous fluid beneficial for septic shock in ICU patients? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116EyRQo]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Restrictive fluid resuscitation, also known as permissive hypotension, was first proposed by Stern et al. in 1992. This new resuscitation strategy focuses on restricting fluid intake and uses vasopressors to reverse hypotension and maintain tissue perfusion. However, restrictive fluid resuscitation is in the early stages of research, and it remains unclear which fluid resuscitation strategy is more beneficial for ICU patients. Although there are supporting data for both resuscitation strategies, there is insufficient robust evidence to prove the superiority of one approach over the other. Moreover, although restrictive fluid resuscitation proposedly reduces the risk of fluid overload, its impact on clinical outcomes in patients with septic shock remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to systematically compare the effects of restrictive and conventional fluid resuscitation strategies on clinical outcomes in adult ICU patients with septic shock. The outcomes of interest included acute kidney injury and ICU mortality, based on data from randomized controlled trials.

Timing of crystalloid resuscitation

Unlike the well-established process within the military to make blood products available out of hospital, few prehospital emergency medical service (EMS) agencies have access to RBCs and plasma where the majority only have crystalloid fluid available for resuscitation. As crystalloid is not ideal for replacing blood loss, a question arises of whether crystalloid is helpful or harmful in the early stages of resuscitation. A study by Bickell et al in 1994examined the effects of delaying fluid resuscitation until definitive hemorrhage control was obtained in hypotensive patients with penetrating torso injuries. This was a prospective study of patients with prehospital systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 90 mm Hg in which patients were randomized to immediate standard fluid resuscitation versus no fluid. The intervention started in the field and continued until hemorrhage was controlled. Labs on arrival including hemoglobin, platelets, prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were consistent with a greater degree of anemia and coagulopathy in the immediate resuscitation group. In the delayed resuscitation group, 70% survived versus 62% in the standard group (p = 0.04). Whereas the intraoperative blood transfusion volume was similar in the two groups, the rate of intraoperative fluid administration was greater in the immediate group, and the total fluids and blood products administered was significantly higher in the immediate group. The delayed resuscitation group also showed a trend toward fewer complications and had a significant reduction in length of hospital stay.

### Effects of very early start of norepinephrine in patients with septic shock: a propensity score-based analysis [^112Pewt4]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Early detection and prompt reversion of sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion are key elements in the treatment of patients with septic shock. Fluid administration is widely accepted as the first-line therapy followed by vasopressor use in persistently hypotensive patients or in those in whom arterial pressure is judged to be insufficient to ensure an adequate tissue perfusion. Studies on implementation of therapeutic bundles in sepsis and recent randomized controlled trials on early goal-directed therapy in septic shock highlighted the importance of the initial fluid loading and turned this into a standard for the clinical practice. Indeed, current guidelines on sepsis management emphasize on the administration of at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloids within the first 3 h of identification of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, but a recommendation on the timing to start vasopressor support was not clearly stated. Nevertheless, a recent update on the last recommendations of Surviving Sepsis Campaign claims for an immediate start of resuscitation and treatment in a "1-h bundle" including the use of vasopressors in the case of life-threatening hypotension, during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg. Although this initiative embraces the concept of sepsis as a medical emergency, the level of evidence for these recommendations is quite limited and remains debatable.

### Prediction of arterial pressure increase after fluid challenge [^113TM361]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Timing

Previous studies on fluid responsiveness have evaluated the outcome either at the end of volume infusion or at 30 minutes after it. We performed outcome measurements at 1 hour after the end of fluid challenge to avoid misclassification of transient effects as clinically relevant effects. At this time, the volume effect of hydroxyethyl starch was fully maintained. Moreover timing of measurement of effect of volume expansion on cardiac output and arterial pressure could strongly influence results. In fact changes of cardiac output and arterial pressure after fluid challenge have different time course. In preload-dependent patients cardiac output can initially increase by a large extent despite minimal arterial pressure increase because of decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Then cardiac output returns to baseline value and arterial pressure increases for the combined effect of an increase of venous capacitance associated to disappearance of initial decrease in systemic vascular resistance. This dynamic process begins immediately after the fluid challenge and it is complete in few hours. In particular the evaluation of fluid responsiveness should be delayed at least 40 minutes after the fluid challenge to allow the first acute stabilization of cardiac output and arterial pressure.

Patients

Fluid administration should follow different approaches in the first hours of resuscitation and after the stabilization of the patients. If, in the first hours, more fluid is better than less, liberal fluid administration should be avoided in the following phases. We aimed to study only stable patients after the start phase of fluid resuscitation. We avoided selecting patients with specific clinical diagnosis because they are often extremely heterogeneous from a pathophysiologic point of view. For example, patients with septic shock/severe sepsis are probably the most studied population of critically ill hypotensive patients. All these patients share an infection-related hypotension but they should be considered a heterogeneous population when they are enrolled in a physiological study. It is well recognized that they could have low or normal or high cardiac preload associated with low or normal or high cardiac output. Therefore we chose to increase the external validity of the study both avoiding apparent homogeneity and including patients independently of cardiac output measurement, cardiac rhythms and modality of ventilation. This study should be considered as a pilot trial and the sample size was considered convenient for this purpose. Nevertheless these preliminary data have shown that predictors were much too weak for a successful prediction even in much more patients.

Demographical and clinical variables

The study systematically collected the following variables from the electronic medical records (EMR): age upon admission, gender, height, actual body weight (ABW), NYHA functional classification, ejection fraction (EF), source of infection, underlying comorbidities, Charlson comorbidity index, admission type, vital signs, SOFA score, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II) score at the time of sepsis diagnosis, time of antibiotic initiation, vasopressor use, fluid resuscitation volumes at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h following sepsis diagnosis, urine output at 1, 2, and 3 days, as well as laboratory test results. The initial recorded values of ABW and height within 24 h of admission were considered for definition. The ideal body weight (IBW) was calculated using the Devine formula as follows:

For patients whose ABW ≥ 1.3 times of their IBW, IBW was further adjusted as:

Sepsis-induced hypoperfusion was defined as the presence of sepsis accompanied by either hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≤ 65 mm Hg, or a drop of > 40 mm Hg from baseline) or elevated serum lactate levels (≥ 4 mmol/L), regardless of blood pressure. Vasopressors administered in the presence of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion were categorized as septic shock. Acute renal dysfunction (AKD) was identified based on the criteria established by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. The fluids supplied by the pre-admission emergency medical service (EMS) were excluded from the analysis as they were not recorded in the EMR of the hospital. Maintaining fluid volume is also not included in the calculation of fluid resuscitation volume. Only crystalloid fluids administered as bolus doses within the first 6 h after the diagnosis of sepsis were included in the calculation of resuscitation volume. The specific volume of fluid resuscitation at each time point (3 h, 6 h, etc.) was determined based on the timestamps of administered intravenous fluids recorded in the nursing notes, which indicated the initiation and completion of fluid resuscitation. Fluid resuscitation was calculated per kilogram of body weight (mL/kg) based on IBW in this study.

### A contemporary analysis of prehospital crystalloid resuscitation after trauma [^116ymg7F]. Injury (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Minimizing crystalloid administration to hemorrhaging trauma patients has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality. Iatrogenic harm from 'over-resuscitation' may be a concern for trauma patients undergoing prolonged EMS transport. Our primary objective was to quantify the volume of prehospital crystalloid administered to hypotensive trauma patients with at least 30 min of exposure to prehospital care for whom fluid administration was not indicated in the intervention arm of prior randomized trials of fluid restriction. In addition, we aimed to identify factors associated with crystalloid administration and determine if trends in administration were present across the study period.

Study Design

The ESO Data Collaborative 2018–2022 annual datasets were used for this study. Trauma patients who received prehospital vascular access, had a minimum systolic blood pressure between 75 and 90 mmHg, a GCS ≥ 14, and were exposed to EMS care for > 30 min (on-scene to destination arrival interval) were evaluated for inclusion. The primary outcome for this analysis was the documented volume of crystalloid administration. Logistic regression modeling was used to investigate factors associated with the administration of > 500 mL of crystalloid.

Results

After application of exclusion criteria, 26,447 patients treated by 1150 EMS agencies were evaluated. Patients received a median of 200 [10,500] mL of fluid in the prehospital setting, and 95% of patients received < 1010 mL. Overall, 5745 (21.7%) patients received > 500 mL of fluid. Factors associated with administration of > 500 mL of fluid included increased 'EMS exposure' time (OR 1.01 [1.01, 1.01] per minute), IV cannula size (22 G OR: 0.5 [0.4, 0.6], 20 G OR, 18 G OR: 2.1 [2.0, 2.3], 16 G OR: 4.6 [4.1, 5.2]), age (0.996 [0.994, 0.997]) per year, female sex (0.72 [0.68, 0.77]), minimum SBP (0.95 [0.94, 0.96] per mmHg), and penetrating injury, (1.9 [1.7, 2.1]).

Conclusion

Overall, crystalloid volumes administered in the prehospital setting were low in this cohort of hypotensive trauma patients exposed to at least 30 min of prehospital care. This may suggest that the practice of fluid restriction for patients who are hypotensive following trauma has permeated into EMS practice nationwide.

### Fluid response evaluation in sepsis hypotension and shock: a randomized clinical trial [^114n5aef]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

This study has several notable limitations. We sought to minimize potential confounding by using a decision-support tool to guide fluid and vasopressors. Nevertheless, the inclusion of an unblinded usual care arm may have been insufficient to eliminate all sources of residual bias or potential for Hawthorne effect. Another potential limitation is the unequal sex distribution between the intervention and usual care arms, despite the 2:1 block-randomization schedule. The intervention and usual care arms were well matched on all other patient characteristics, including qSOFA and SIRS criteria. A sensitivity analysis did not support that there was significant confounding as a result of this imbalance; however, sex-differences in both sepsis disease severity and response to treatments cannot be discounted. BMI was similar between the arms and indicated that weight-guided preenrollment fluid volumes were also comparable between the arms, as confirmed by a nearly identical volume of preenrollment fluid between the two arms.

Although the study enrollment was sufficient to evaluate the prespecified primary outcome, it was not powered to detect differences in all sepsis-associated organ dysfunctions or patient deaths. Further research in larger patient populations, potentially including specific biomarker enrichment strategies, would be important to replicate the magnitude and direction of these results and to determine whether PLR-guided dynamic measure resuscitation results in improved sepsis survival.

In conclusion, physiologically informed fluid and pressor resuscitation with the use of PLR-induced SV change to guide personalized management of sepsis-associated hypotension and shock was safe. Among patients who met prespecified enrollment criteria and were treated according to protocol, dynamic measure-guided resuscitation was associated with lower net fluid balance and reductions in the risk of renal and respiratory failure. Functional evaluation for lack of FR adequately identifies a group of patients with sepsis-associated hypotension who should not have further IV fluids infused. Although PLR-guided fluid and vasopressor resuscitation did not improve survival in this study, the administration of IV fluids and vasopressors only when they were likely to improve CO did reduce 72-hour fluid balance and improve discharge to home.

Fluid management

Fluid management is the cornerstone for the resuscitation of the septic patient, aiming at improved tissue perfusion through an increase in cardiac output. While most patients are usually fluid responsive in the initial stages, fluid resuscitation becomes more challenging at a later stage as many patients may no longer be fluid responsive. In addition, a positive fluid balance, especially at later stages, is associated with poor outcome. Hence, several approaches can be used to predict the response to fluids. Static measurements of preload such as CVP are only useful at their extreme values. Targeting a specific CVP value is only valid at the population level, as close to two-thirds of the patients respond to fluids when baseline CVP is below 8 mmHg and two-thirds do not respond when CVP is higher than 12 mmHg. Use of dynamic tests allows prediction of the response to fluids at the individual level. Among the most attractive tests, respiratory variations in stroke volume (directly measured by different pulse contour techniques or by Doppler ultrasounds) or its derivative variations in pulse pressure can reliably predict the response to fluids when several pre-requirements are met (absence of arrhythmias, tidal volume larger than 8 ml/kg, no respiratory movements, etc.). Passive leg raising is another reliable test, but this requires a fast-response cardiac output monitor and can be fastidious if it has to be repeated frequently. These dynamic tests are now recommended in recent guidelines.

An alternative is the so-called mini fluid challenge. It has been proposed that administration of a limited amount of fluids (~100 ml) in a short period of time may predict the administration of further fluids. This concept is only partly valid: if a patient does not respond to the first bolus, there is very limited chance that they will respond to further fluid administration. However, a positive response to the first bolus does not imply a response to further fluid administration (and the trials were biased as the response to the first bolus was integrated in the assessment of the total amount of fluids). If anything it should be the contrary, as the likelihood of the response to fluids in preload responsive patients (and thus on the ascending part of the Starling relationship) is higher with the initial bolus than with later boluses. It is nevertheless safer to repeatedly administer small boluses of fluids, evaluating their effects, and to predict the response to fluids before the next bolus, than to administer large boluses of fluids once patients are predicted to be fluid responsive. The decision algorithm is shown in Fig. 4.

### Liberal versus restrictive intravenous fluid therapy for early septic shock: rationale for a Randomized trial [^115VYKm6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Prompt intravenous fluid therapy is a fundamental treatment for patients with septic shock. However, the optimal approach for administering intravenous fluid in septic shock resuscitation is unknown. Two competing strategies are emerging: a liberal fluids approach, consisting of a larger volume of initial fluid (50 to 75 mL/kg [4 to 6 L in an 80-kg adult] during the first 6 hours) and later use of vasopressors, versus a restrictive fluids approach, consisting of a smaller volume of initial fluid (≤ 30 mL/kg [≤ 2 to 3 L]), with earlier reliance on vasopressor infusions to maintain blood pressure and perfusion. Early fluid therapy may enhance or maintain tissue perfusion by increasing venous return and cardiac output. However, fluid administration may also have deleterious effects by causing edema within vital organs, leading to organ dysfunction and impairment of oxygen delivery. Conversely, a restrictive fluids approach primarily relies on vasopressors to reverse hypotension and maintain perfusion while limiting the administration of fluid. Both strategies have some evidence to support their use but lack robust data to confirm the benefit of one strategy over the other, creating clinical and scientific equipoise. As part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury Network, we designed a randomized clinical trial to compare the liberal and restrictive fluids strategies, the Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressor Early Resuscitation in Sepsis trial. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature on approaches to early fluid resuscitation in adults with septic shock and outline the rationale for the upcoming trial.

### Prediction of arterial pressure increase after fluid challenge [^114W3WMj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

When we tried to predict the effect of fluid challenge, we obtained frustrating results. Before fluid challenge all variables were similar between responders and non-responders. Moreover, study variables displayed very low accuracy in identifying responders to fluid challenge, with their areas under ROC curves ranging from 0.502 to 0.604. Finally, even logistic regression did not identify any variables associated with responder status. These results further discourage the use of central venous pressure to drive fluid administration in hypotensive patients.

Most variables tested in this study depends mainly on pressure and flow. Therefore our results suggest that physiological variables depending on flow and pressure could not accurately predict arterial pressure changes after fluid administration. For this purpose it appears more appropriate an approach based on the arterial elastance evaluation as calculated by ratio between pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation.

In previous studies fluid challenge increased cardiac output or stroke volume in 40–64% of patients and similarly, in our study, fluid challenge worked in 61% of the patients. At least one in every three hypotensive patients does not show any improvement after fluid challenge. On the contrary, inappropriate fluid administration negatively impacts on several relevant outcomes. Considering the impossibility of predicting the effect of volume expansion on arterial pressure and the high rate of non-responders, cardiac output monitoring or estimation could help to guide therapy in hypotensive patients whose arterial pressure does not increase after fluid challenge or who are at risk of fluid overload.

The results of this study strongly depended on fluid challenge technique used, the timing of outcome evaluation, study outcome, patient and variable selection.

Fluid challenge

We chose to administer maximal fluid challenge to avoid any possibility of fluid underresuscitation. Each fluid challenge was scheduled to administer about 500 mL over 30 minutes for patients of 70 kg in weight. Because some patients could require larger volumes, we decided to repeat the fluid challenge provided that there were no criteria for stopping fluid administration. The total amount of hydroxyethyl starch remained largely below the safety threshold dose even when both fluid challenges were carried out.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) — AGA guideline recommendation 1A states that in patients with AP, the AGA suggests using goal-directed therapy for fluid management, with a conditional recommendation and very low quality evidence, and the AGA makes no recommendation whether normal saline or Ringer's lactate is used. The technical review identified a total of 7 randomized trials on fluid resuscitation, with 4 primarily addressing goal-directed targeted therapy, and goal-directed therapy is defined as titrating intravenous fluids to targets such as heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, urine output, blood urea nitrogen concentration, and hematocrit. Compared to non-targeted therapy, goal-directed therapy did not result in significantly improved mortality, prevention of pancreatic necrosis, or decrease in the rate of persistent multiple organ failure, and the panel issued a conditional recommendation suggesting the use of judicious goal-directed fluid therapy over other methods while recognizing potential harms of overly aggressive fluid therapy including respiratory complications and abdominal compartment syndrome. Due to the lack of randomized controlled trial evidence addressing the optimal initial rate, volume, and duration of fluid resuscitation, the panel was unable to make specific recommendations on these parameters, and it could not make a recommendation regarding use of Ringer's lactate versus normal saline for resuscitation based on the low quality of evidence.

Adult burn shock resuscitation — initial crystalloid rate (2 mL/kg/%TBSA vs 4 mL/kg/%TBSA): We recommend that clinicians consider starting acute fluid resuscitation using 2 mL/kg/%TBSA burn to reduce the total volume of resuscitation fluids, noting this suggests only the initial fluid rate and that titration based on the patient's response must follow. Evidence cited found no significant difference in 48-hour resuscitation volumes between 2 and 4 mL/kg/%TBSA approaches (5.52 ± 2.08 vs 6.90 ± 2.37 mL/kg/%TBSA, P = 0.078), and one analysis of acute kidney injury (AKI) on arrival reported 19% vs 10% (P = 0.33). The guideline states that neither study found any clinically meaningful differences in measures such as oxygenation or the development of ACS, and it is unable to make any recommendation on use of 2 mL/kg/%TBSA burn to reduce edema-related complications while suggesting that more research is needed to assess the effect on the development of AKI.

### Fluid therapy for critically ill adults with sepsis: a review [^1168pvSh]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 20% to 30% of patients admitted to an intensive care unit have sepsis. While fluid therapy typically begins in the emergency department, intravenous fluids in the intensive care unit are an essential component of therapy for sepsis.

Observations

For patients with sepsis, intravenous fluid can increase cardiac output and blood pressure, maintain or increase intravascular fluid volume, and deliver medications. Fluid therapy can be conceptualized as 4 overlapping phases from early illness through resolution of sepsis: resuscitation (rapid fluid administered to restore perfusion); optimization (the risks and benefits of additional fluids to treat shock and ensure organ perfusion are evaluated); stabilization (fluid therapy is used only when there is a signal of fluid responsiveness); and evacuation (excess fluid accumulated during treatment of critical illness is eliminated). Among 3723 patients with sepsis who received 1 to 2 L of fluid, 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reported that goal-directed therapy administering fluid boluses to attain a central venous pressure of 8 to 12 mm Hg, vasopressors to attain a mean arterial blood pressure of 65 to 90 mm Hg, and red blood cell transfusions or inotropes to attain a central venous oxygen saturation of at least 70% did not decrease mortality compared with unstructured clinical care (24.9% vs 25.4%; p = 0.68). Among 1563 patients with sepsis and hypotension who received 1 L of fluid, an RCT reported that favoring vasopressor treatment did not improve mortality compared with further fluid administration (14.0% vs 14.9%; p = 0.61). Another RCT reported that among 1554 patients in the intensive care unit with septic shock treated with at least 1 L of fluid compared with more liberal fluid administration, restricting fluid administration in the absence of severe hypoperfusion did not reduce mortality (42.3% vs 42.1%; p = 0.96). An RCT of 1000 patients with acute respiratory distress during the evacuation phase reported that limiting fluid administration and administering diuretics improved the number of days alive without mechanical ventilation compared with fluid treatment to attain higher intracardiac pressure (14.6 vs 12.1 days; P < .001), and it reported that hydroxyethyl starch significantly increased the incidence of kidney replacement therapy compared with saline (7.0% vs 5.8%; p = 0.04), Ringer lactate, or Ringer acetate.

Conclusions and Relevance

Fluids are an important component of treating patients who are critically ill with sepsis. Although optimal fluid management in patients with sepsis remains uncertain, clinicians should consider the risks and benefits of fluid administration in each phase of critical illness, avoid use of hydroxyethyl starch, and facilitate fluid removal for patients recovering from acute respiratory distress syndrome.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^113icEQE]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric guidelines — fluid bolus in low-resource settings: For children without signs of fluid overload where advanced supportive and intensive care is not available, the panel recommends against bolus fluid administration in the first hour if hypotension is not present, and suggests administering up to 40 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10–20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour if hypotension is present; for the subset with septic shock and hypotension, the panel suggests cautious administration of fluid bolus therapy as a weak recommendation based on low quality of evidence. For this weak recommendation, hypotension can be defined as systolic blood pressure less than 50 mm Hg in children younger than 12 months old, less than 60 mm Hg in children 1 to 5 years old, and less than 70 mm Hg in children older than 5 years old, or by World Health Organization criteria of cold extremities with prolonged capillary refill greater than 3 seconds and weak, fast pulse; WHO recommends 10–20 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid over 30–60 minutes, followed by an additional 10 mL/kg over 30 minutes if condition has not improved and there are no signs of fluid overload, cardiac failure, or neurologic deterioration. In a FEAST analysis of children with moderate hypotension, fluid bolus therapy was not beneficial or harmful compared with maintenance fluid only (RR of death = 1.48; 95% CI, 0.61–3.66; p = 0.41), while among children reclassified as meeting all three WHO shock criteria mortality was 48% in the bolus groups versus 20% in the control group (p = 0.07), a very small proportion of FEAST participants (only 72 [2.3%] with moderate hypotension and 65 [2%] meeting full WHO shock criteria).

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^113L5HxF]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Target for blood pressure in the management of shock

Aggressive fluid resuscitation should be avoided and hypotension tolerated in trauma patients with penetrating injury — until the bleeding is surgically stopped. No equivalent guidelines are available for patients with blunt trauma. Regarding cardiogenic shock, no clinical studies have investigated the optimal blood pressure level, and guidelines no longer recommend a target blood pressure. Blood pressure should be individualized for all patients. There is evidence, however, that a mean MAP of around 65 mmHg is sufficient in most patients with septic shock, although in patients with a history of hypertension, a higher MAP is associated with a lower risk of acute kidney injury. Therefore, clearly the arterial blood pressure level must be individualized. Vasopressors may have to be used if fluid resuscitation is not sufficient, or they may be indicated to maintain the desired value of MAP. In-dwelling arterial catheters allow continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring and at the same time allow for regular blood gas analysis. This is particularly important in patients not responding to the initial therapy. Central venous access may be required and preferred to peripheral venous access when patients admitted to the ICU require vasopressor infusions.
We recommend individualizing the target blood pressure during shock resuscitation. Recommendation. Level 1; QoE moderate (B).
We recommend to initially target a MAP of ≥ 65 mmHg. Recommendation. Level 1; QoE low (C).
We suggest to tolerate a lower level of blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled bleeding (i.e. bleeding patients from a road traffic accident) without severe head injury. Recommendation. Level 2; QoE low (C).
We suggest a higher MAP in septic patients with a history of hypertension and in patients who improve with higher blood pressure. Recommendation. Level 2; QoE moderate (B).
We recommend arterial and CVC insertion in cases of shock unresponsive to initial therapy and/or requiring vasopressor infusion. Best practice.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^112YrZZS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Rivers and coll. demonstrated that a strategy of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) decreases the in-hospital mortality of patients who are taken to the emergency department in septic shock.

An organized approach to the haemodynamic support to sepsis includes use of fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy and inotropic therapy.

Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock may present ineffective perfusion. Poor tissues perfusion may cause a global tissue hypoxia, often associated to an elevated serum lactate level. A serum lactate value greater than 4 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) is correlated with poorer outcomes, even if hypotension is not yet present. Fluid resuscitation should be started as early as possible.

According to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines during the first 6 hrs of resuscitation, the goals of initial resuscitation of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion should include all of the following as one part of a treatment protocol:

- Central venous pressure 8 to 12 mm Hg

- Mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 mm Hg

- Urine output > 0.5 mL/kg/hr

- Central venous (superior vena cava) or mixed venous oxygen saturation > 70% or > 65%, respectively

The early hypovolemic phase of sepsis must be always treated by providing appropriate high volume resuscitation.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend that fluid challenge in patients with suspected hypovolemia be started with ≥ 1000 mL of crystalloids or 300–500 mL of colloids over 30 mins. More rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion.

As the volume of distribution is less large for colloids than for crystalloids, resuscitation with colloids requires less fluid to achieve the same goals. A colloid equivalent is an acceptable alternative to crystalloid. Crystalloids are less expensive.

Burns

Appropriate and effective initial resuscitation of victims of burns is vital for survival and reduction of morbidity and mortality. The deeper and more extensive the burn, the greater the fluid requirements, but excessive fluid administration will also increase morbidity by generation of edema. The formulas used for calculating volume requirements (e.g. Brooke & Parkland) use only body surface area (BSA) and do not compensate for depth. In clinical practice, the fluid requirement is approximately 5 ml/kg/ %BSA during the first 24 h.

The rate of fluid administration will initially be rapid with up to half the daily requirement given in the first 6 h. The use of colloid solutions is controversial. Hyperoncotic colloids worsen outcome, but the role of albumin or synthetic colloids (e.g. HES) is less clear. Colloid solutions shorten the time to achieve hemodynamic goals, but increase expense without a concomitant improvement in outcome.

Enteral resuscitation is effective if commenced within 6 h. Placement of a feeding tube should be part of the resuscitation protocol for burns. Delay of feeding for more than 6 h will result in an increasing feeding failure due to gastroparesis and ileus. Maintenance of enteral feeding maintains the gut associated lymphoid tissue that participates in maintenance of immunity at all epithelial surfaces including the skin. A standard formula may be used starting at 2 ml/kg/h and increasing incrementally every 3 h until the goal rate calculated for each patient is reached.

Two simple investigations should be used to monitor the effectiveness of resuscitation from burns. The first is the hematocrit, which may be as high as 70% on admission after extensive burns. Failure to reduce the hematocrit below 40% within the first 6 h is an accurate indicator of poor prognosis. The second is urine output, which should be maintained at around 1 ml/kg/h. Development of acute renal failure carries a very poor prognosis with extensive burns. A more detailed review of fluids in burn resuscitation is beyond the scope of this paper; however, further references are provided.

### Clinical review: hemorrhagic shock [^112xwE64]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

This review addresses the pathophysiology and treatment of hemorrhagic shock - a condition produced by rapid and significant loss of intravascular volume, which may lead sequentially to hemodynamic instability, decreases in oxygen delivery, decreased tissue perfusion, cellular hypoxia, organ damage, and death. Hemorrhagic shock can be rapidly fatal. The primary goals are to stop the bleeding and to restore circulating blood volume. Resuscitation may well depend on the estimated severity of hemorrhage. It now appears that patients with moderate hypotension from bleeding may benefit by delaying massive fluid resuscitation until they reach a definitive care facility. On the other hand, the use of intravenous fluids, crystalloids or colloids, and blood products can be life saving in those patients who are in severe hemorrhagic shock. The optimal method of resuscitation has not been clearly established. A hemoglobin level of 7–8 g/dl appears to be an appropriate threshold for transfusion in critically ill patients with no evidence of tissue hypoxia. However, maintaining a higher hemoglobin level of 10 g/dl is a reasonable goal in actively bleeding patients, the elderly, or individuals who are at risk for myocardial infarction. Moreover, hemoglobin concentration should not be the only therapeutic guide in actively bleeding patients. Instead, therapy should be aimed at restoring intravascular volume and adequate hemodynamic parameters.

Sepsis early care — fluid volume and concurrent titration of vasopressors — For the past 2 decades, large mean volumes of intravenous fluid (eg, more than 3,000 to 5,000 mL) have been common in the care of ED patients with sepsis. Many trials have used body mass–based intravenous fluid dosing (20 or 30 mL/kg) to guide initial fluid resuscitation, but practical issues limit feasibility, including unit doses of 500 mL and 1,000 mL, which make for natural break‑points to assess for clinical response. We do not believe data that support a singular body mass–based volume for all or most patients, although we recognize that many will receive and respond to certain targets like 30 mL/kg. Administration of an initial volume of 500 to 1,000 mL of crystalloid is a common and reasonable practice, as it helps gauge response without establishing an endpoint for fluid therapy and informs need for concomitant vasopressor support.

### Association between fluid balance and mortality for heart failure and sepsis: a propensity score-matching analysis [^113LKxHZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Early and immediate fluid resuscitation has been recommended in the updated Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines because fluid intake can reverse hypotension and correct tachycardia in patients with sepsis. However, this guideline also acknowledged that this recommendation is based on low-quality evidence. Several studies reported the relationship between FB and mortality in sepsis by setting various thresholds of volume and time points. A multicentric Scandinavian study showed no statistical difference between FB and mortality. Moreover, a meta-analysis published by Meyhoff et al. did not find the protective effects of restrictive fluid intake as well. On the contrary, there is still evidence of harmful effects of fluid resuscitation. Fluid intake of more than 5 L on the 1st day of hospital admission increased the risk of excess deaths. Similarly, FB over 3 L between the 24th and the 48th hour after diagnosis increased the risk of mortality in severe sepsis. Consecutive positive FB within 3 days had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. However, the time point of FB varies among current studies and no unified criteria have been achieved. Conclusions regarding the relationship between early FB status and mortality are conflicting in current studies. It has also been suggested that early fluid accumulation (within 24 h after ICU admission) was not associated with increased mortality in septic patients, and even Brotfain et al. highlighted the beneficial effects of early fluid resuscitation. This might indicate that septic patients have a certain tolerance for the adverse effects of fluid overload, and furthermore, early fluid resuscitation is still recommended by the guidelines. Besides, the volume of fluid intake and output may be recorded inaccurately during clinical practice due that partial fluid losses are difficult to measure. Many studies only calculated the absolute volumes of fluid intake, instead of the relative volumes adjusted by individuals' weight. Additionally, fluid responsiveness and levels of haemodynamic disturbance are hard to be defined and stratified in various groups. Therefore, with respect to fluid resuscitation for sepsis, the evidence of most trials was not strong enough to make a clear consensus.

### Higher initial formula for resuscitation after severe burn injury means higher 24-hour volumes [^115bH3ck]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Initial fluid infusion rates for resuscitation of burn injuries typically use formulas based on patient weight and total body surface area (TBSA) burned. However, the impact of this rate on overall resuscitation volumes and outcomes have not been extensively studied. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of initial fluid rates on 24-hour volumes and outcomes using the Burn Navigator (BN). The BN database is composed of 300 patients with ≥ 20% TBSA, > 40 kg that were resuscitated utilizing the BN. Four study arms were analyzed based on the initial formula-2 ml/kg/TBSA, 3 ml/kg/TBSA, 4 ml/kg/TBSA or the Rule of Ten. Total fluids infused at 24 hours after admission were compared as well as resuscitation-related outcomes. A total of 296 patients were eligible for analysis. Higher starting rates (4 ml/kg/TBSA) resulted in significantly higher volumes at 24 hours (5.2 ± 2.2 ml/kg/TBSA) than lower rates (2 ml/kg/TBSA resulted in 3.9 ± 1.4 ml/kg/TBSA). No shock was observed in the high resuscitation cohort, whereas the lowest starting rate exhibited a 12% incidence, lower than both the Rule of Ten and 3 ml/kg/TBSA arms. There was no difference in 7-day mortality across groups. Higher initial fluid rates resulted in higher 24-hour fluid volumes. The choice of 2ml/kg/TBSA as initial rate did not result in increased mortality or more complications. An initial rate of 2ml/kg/TBSA is a safe strategy.

Pediatric septic shock fluid therapy — initial resuscitation recommendations specify system-dependent bolus strategies and fluid choices. In healthcare systems with availability of intensive care, we suggest administering up to 40–60 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10–20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour with titration to clinical markers of cardiac output and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop for the initial resuscitation of children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. In healthcare systems with no availability of intensive care and in the absence of hypotension, we recommend against bolus fluid administration while starting maintenance fluids, whereas if hypotension is present, we suggest administering up to 40 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10–20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour with titration to clinical markers of cardiac output and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop. For fluid type, we suggest using crystalloids, rather than albumin, and we suggest using balanced/buffered crystalloids, rather than 0.9% saline, for the initial resuscitation of children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, and we recommend against using starches and suggest against using gelatin in this setting.

The use of corticosteroids has been debated in recent years. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines suggest against using IV hydrocortisone to treat septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability. If this is not achievable, the guidelines suggest IV hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg per day.

### Optimizing mean arterial pressure in septic shock: a critical reappraisal of the literature [^112njLeK]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend that a mean arterial pressure (MAP) value greater than 65 mm Hg should be the initial blood pressure target in septic shock, but what evidence is there to support this statement? We searched Pubmed and Google Scholar by using the key words 'arterial pressure', 'septic shock', and 'norepinephrine' and retrieved human studies published between 1 January 2000 and 31 July 2014. We identified seven comparative studies: two randomized clinical trials and five observational studies. The results of the literature review suggest that a MAP target of 65 mm Hg is usually sufficient in patients with septic shock. However, a MAP of around 75 to 85 mm Hg may reduce the development of acute kidney injury in patients with chronic arterial hypertension. Because of the high prevalence of chronic arterial hypertension in patients who develop septic shock, this finding is of considerable importance. Future studies should assess interactions between time, fluid volumes administered, and doses of vasopressors.

Pediatric acute pancreatitis — fluid administration rate: Adult studies report that the group receiving the highest volume, > 4 L, had an increased rate of persistent organ failure, and that aggressive fluids (approximately 5 L) were associated with increased severity of disease and local complications. Adult guidance cited includes the American College of Gastroenterology recommending an initial rate of 250 to 500 mL/h in addition to boluses if hypotension or tachycardia is present and using BUN to direct therapy; Awais et al advises 3 to 4 L in the first 24 hours (not to exceed 4 L) with an initial 1 L bolus followed by 3 mL · kg −1 · h −1 for the first 24 to 48 hours; and Nasr recommends 1 to 2 L boluses initially and 150 to 300 mL/h for maintenance, with 2 mL · kg −1 · h −1 if the patient responds to initial resuscitation, otherwise 3 mL · kg −1 · h −1. Pediatric data include one study involving 201 patients in which early IV fluid (< 48 hours) plus aggressive fluids (> 1.5–2 times maintenance in the first 24 hours) decreased LOS and severe disease and aggressive IV fluids did not adversely affect outcomes; the adult literature summary suggests boluses of 250 to 1000 mL initially and up to 3 to 4 L fluids within first 24 hours. Recommendation 2ai states that children with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should be provided 1.5 to 2 times maintenance IV fluids with monitoring of urine output over the next 24 to 48 hours, with 22/24 = 92% agreement (Strongly agree = 12; agree = 10; neutral = 2; disagree = 0; strongly disagree = 0).

National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — shock treatment and interventions include oxygen titration, perfusion and metabolic assessment, vascular access, fluid resuscitation, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets. Oxygen is administered with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation. Perfusion assessment notes that an end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) reading of less than 25 mmHg may be sign of poor perfusion. Metabolic thresholds include correction of blood glucose if less than 60 mg/dL and recognition that lactate greater than 2 mmol/L is abnormal. If intravenous (IV) access is not obtained within two attempts or less than 90 seconds, place an intraosseous (IO) needle. For fluids, give boluses that are pressure infused over less than 15 minutes each to achieve a MAP, calculated as (MAP = [(2 × diastolic) + (systolic)/3]). Adult targets specify a physiologic MAP goal 65 mmHg and a fluid goal of up to 30 mL/kg using rapid, predetermined boluses (e.g., 500 mL) unless the MAP goal is achieved, or pulmonary edema develops; if available, packed red blood cells or whole blood may be indicated for hemorrhagic shock.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^1118qHgZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Are there individual patient populations in which saline should be avoided entirely? Testing types of fluids in subgroups of patients to detect the likelihood of adverse effects would be useful.
2) Are there differences between buffered solutions? Is lactated Ringers superior to acetated/gluconated buffered solution or vice versa?
3) What are the implications of acetate and gluconate contained in some balanced solutions? In cardiac surgery patients, an acetate-based balanced solution had similar hemodynamic effects compared with lactated ringers. However, significant infusion of acetate may contribute to vasoplegia and myocardial dysfunction in patients with kidney dysfunction.
4) Recent data suggest that maintenance fluids and fluids used in diluting drugs may provide significant amount of chloride and have a major impact on fluid balance. Data suggest that selecting sodium/chloride poor maintenance fluids may improve fluid balance and chloride load in postoperative patients, but data in septic patients are still lacking. As such, should chloride containing solutions (including balanced solutions) be minimized or entirely avoided? Notably, this question is especially pertinent given recent instances of supply chain interruption, resulting in shortages of critical fluids and necessitating therapeutic substitutions at the individual patient level.
5) Are the beneficial renal outcomes associated with buffered solutions compared with saline due to the reduction in chloride content? In other words, is chloride toxic in itself, so that toxicity occurs even in absence of obvious hyperchloremia/acidosis (in which condition chloride-free solutions should be favored and saline-based dilution of drugs should be avoided whenever possible) or is it deviation of chloride/pH that generates the toxicity of high volumes of NaCl 0.9% (in which context closer monitoring of these variables may limit the toxicity)? Can lactated sodium solutions serve as a substitute for saline to minimize renal injury?
6) Is albumin superior to buffered crystalloid solutions? If used, when should albumin be administered? Ideally, this comparison of albumin with balanced crystalloid solutions would include subgroups of patients of particular interest (chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis).
7) Should albumin be initiated in an attempt to correct hypoalbuminemia or as a volume replacement fluid? Given the colloidal qualities of albumin, would albumin be of greater benefit in cases of severe shock, necessitating greater amounts of fluid resuscitation? Or should it be used to correct hypoalbuminemia? If there is a benefit to albumin administration as a fluid resuscitation therapy, where does it provide the greatest benefit in light of its cost?
8) What is the optimal concentration of the albumin solution (4–5% or 20%)? Studies of albumin have evaluated various concentrations of albumin. Contingent on its proposed mechanism of benefit in fluid resuscitation (correction of hypoalbuminemia vs intravascular fluid expansion), studies comparing the various albumin concentrations are necessary.
9) Should severity of sepsis play a role in determining which fluid to use for resuscitation? In the continuum of sepsis and septic shock, would patients specifically with more severe forms of shock benefit from a combination approach of crystalloids and colloids to fluid resuscitation?
10) Does resource setting play a role in determining the efficacy of which fluid is chosen? Studies outlined above were performed in resource-intensive environments. Considering data demonstrating that outcomes to fluid resuscitation are disparate between resource-intensive environments and resource-limited environments, it is possible that the type of fluid might also impact outcomes, understanding that fluid choices will likely be significantly more limited in resource \-constrained locations and in the face of unpredictable supply.

### Strategies for intravenous fluid resuscitation in trauma patients [^111TyiA9]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Maintenance fluid

In providing maintenance fluids, care should be taken to avoid causing tissue edema. This requires limitation of crystalloid administration, which can only really be achieved in the post-resuscitation period. Crystalloid fluid administration is not without hazards. Excessive crystalloid administration is associated with edema of skin, abdominal organs (leading to abdominal compartment syndrome), kidneys (leading to renal compartment syndrome, contributing to acute renal failure) and heart (leading to myocardial dysfunction). The ideal concept would be to use a strategy where the fluid stays intravascular and expands this compartment for longer. However, the design of the recent large studies involving HES showed that ongoing use of these fluids in critically ill patients, beyond initial resuscitation (even in the trauma subgroup analysis), was without benefit and may increase the need for renal replacement therapy.

During the post-resuscitation phase, crystalloids are not only required for fluid supplementation, but also as vehicles for administration of medication, including antibiotics, sedation and inotropes/vasopressors. The fluid required for the administration of these solutions together with those required for nutrition should as a guide not exceed 2 ml/kg/h. 0.9% "normal" saline has often been the fluid of choice for this purpose; however, concerns about both the sodium and chloride load may favor other "balanced" fluids. This fluid can again be substituted for the one designed specifically for maintenance of daily fluid and electrolyte requirements once certainty regarding fluid requirements and responsiveness has been reached. During this period, the solutions infused as medications may also be made more concentrated to limit volume requirements.

It must be remembered that intravenous fluids are drugs providing both electrolytes and water. While calculating these requirements, the patient's medication and feed also need to be incorporated to avoid excessive volumes of each.

Assessing volume status

### Trends in pre-hospital volume resuscitation of blunt trauma patients: a 15-year analysis of the British (TARN) and German (traumaRegister DGU ®) national registries [^113TcuWc]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Blunt trauma patients with pre-hospital hypotension constitute a subgroup of particular clinical importance. Resuscitation guidelines in both the UK and Germany recommend volume resuscitation in these patients, an approach supported by recent studies. Secondary analysis of the PROMMTT Study suggests that moderate pre-hospital crystalloid administration (median 700 ml) correlates with reduced mortality compared to administering no fluids. Similarly, pilot randomised trial data and secondary analysis of the PAMPer trial data demonstrated that resuscitation with moderate volumes (250–1250 ml) of pre-hospital crystalloids was associated with improved 24-h mortality in hypotensive blunt trauma patients, compared with lower or higher volumes. While these studies provide valuable insights into volume resuscitation strategies for shocked patients following blunt injury, the scope of our study is broader, evaluating fluid resuscitation practice in both shocked and non-shocked patients, and longer-term outcomes across the UK and Germany. Our data does not isolate the subgroup of shocked patients for direct comparison, further emphasising the need for future research to delineate the precise role of fluid resuscitation in different trauma subgroups.

Crystalloids have known negative effects on coagulation function in trauma patients, including dilutional effects on the coagulation factors, increased fibrinolysis, and glycocalyceal shedding. A sub-analysis of a large multi-centre randomised trial demonstrated that pre-hospital crystalloid administration in trauma patients is associated with increased rates of coagulopathy, as well as an elevated risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, corroborating findings from earlier registry-based studies. Our study findings were consistent with these observations, as we observed a strong correlation between the volume of pre-hospital fluid administered and admission coagulation function. Both the TARN and TR-DGU registries demonstrated a significant reduction in crystalloid use over the study period. Similar reductions have been reported in other countries, most notably a recent study from the US Department of Defence Trauma Registry, which showed a decrease in the number of injured patients receiving pre-hospital crystalloids between 2007 and 2020.

### FIGO recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022 [^114u7Kwu]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

11.1.4 Final objectives in resuscitation

DCR should be maintained as long as there are signs of bleeding and coagulopathy. A continuous assessment of the hemodynamic and physiological status of the patient is required. Monitoring several resuscitation parameters is essential until tissue hypoxia reverts. These parameters include pH, base deficit, lactate, hematocrit, and coagulation — ideally evaluated with conventional laboratory tests and point‐of‐care testing (POCT) of viscoelastic coagulation such as thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). In patients with a clinical trend toward improvement, the decision to perform definitive surgery is appropriate.

BOX 14
FIGO recommends that damage control resuscitation (DCR) should be implemented in the management algorithms for major obstetric hemorrhage.

All countries should establish one or more referral hospital(s) and develop expert teams that are familiar with this strategy, the technique, and indications to be able to offer DCR.

11.2 Resuscitation

Once the shock has occurred in PPH, it is estimated that the mortality of patients will increase dramatically. To mitigate metabolic complications, strategies such as hypotensive fluid resuscitation and transfusion protocols have been studied for hemostatic reanimation.

There are two strategies for fluid resuscitation in patients with hemorrhage: the aggressive approach and the hypotensive resuscitation approach. Aggressive resuscitation refers to the traditionally used strategy in which the key principle is restoring the effective circulating blood volume, and rapid normalizing of blood pressure with administration of large amounts of crystalloids. Hypotensive resuscitation, also called permissive hypotension, consists of restrictive crystalloid resuscitation during the early stages of a hemorrhagic shock to maintain lower than normal systolic or mean blood pressure, sustaining organ perfusion until control of the bleeding occurs.

In contrast, hemostatic reanimation is based on early and aggressive blood product replacement, transfusing red blood cells (PRBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets (PLT) in the same proportion as found in circulating blood to correct coagulopathy. Hypotensive resuscitation and hemostatic reanimation are the fundamentals for DCR.

### Sodium nitroprusside injection, 50 mg / 2mL (25mg / mL) [^112sGD4L]. FDA (DailyMed) (2021). Medium credibility.

In association with the decrease in blood pressure, sodium nitroprusside administered intravenously to hypertensive and normotensive patients produces slight increases in heart rate and a variable effect on cardiac output. In hypertensive patients, moderate doses induce renal vasodilatation roughly proportional to the decrease in systemic blood pressure, so there is no appreciable change in renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate. In normotensive subjects, acute reduction of mean arterial pressure to 60 to 75 mm Hg by infusion of sodium nitroprusside caused a significant increase in renin activity. In the same study, ten renovascular-hypertensive patients given sodium nitroprusside had significant increases in renin release from the involved kidney at mean arterial pressures of 90 to 137 mm Hg.

The hypotensive effect of sodium nitroprusside is seen within a minute or two after the start of an adequate infusion, and it dissipates almost as rapidly after an infusion is discontinued. The effect is augmented by ganglionic blocking agents and inhaled anesthetics. Sodium nitroprusside is also indicated for producing controlled hypotension in order to reduce bleeding during surgery. Sodium nitroprusside is also indicated for the treatment of acute congestive heart failure. Sodium nitroprusside should not be used in the treatment of compensatory hypertension, where the primary hemodynamic lesion is aortic coarctation or arteriovenous shunting. Excessive Hypotension: Small transient excesses in the infusion rate of sodium nitroprusside can result in excessive hypotension, sometimes to levels so low as to compromise the perfusion of vital organs. These hemodynamic changes may lead to a variety of associated symptoms; see ADVERSE REACTIONS.

Nitroprusside-induced hypotension will be self-limited within 1 to 10 minutes after discontinuation of the nitroprusside infusion; during these few minutes, it may be helpful to put the patient into a head-down position to maximize venous return. If hypotension persists more than a few minutes after discontinuation of the infusion of Sodium Nitroprusside, Sodium Nitroprusside is not the cause, and the true cause must be sought. Drug Interactions: The hypotensive effect of sodium nitroprusside is augmented by that of most other hypotensive drugs, including ganglionic blocking agents, negative inotropic agents, and inhaled anesthetics.

In hypertensive patients, moderate doses induce renal vasodilatation roughly proportional to the decrease in systemic blood pressure, so there is no appreciable change in renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate. The hypotensive effect of sodium nitroprusside is seen within a minute or two after the start of an adequate infusion, and it dissipates almost as rapidly after an infusion is discontinued. The effect is augmented by ganglionic blocking agents and inhaled anesthetics. Sodium nitroprusside injection is indicated for the immediate reduction of blood pressure of adult and pediatric patients in hypertensive crises.

Concomitant longer-acting antihypertensive medication should be administered so that the duration of treatment with sodium nitroprusside can be minimized. Sodium nitroprusside injection is also indicated for producing controlled hypotension in order to reduce bleeding during surgery. Excessive Hypotension: Small transient excesses in the infusion rate of sodium nitroprusside can result in excessive hypotension, sometimes to levels so low as to compromise the perfusion of vital organs. These hemodynamic changes may lead to a variety of associated symptoms; see ADVERSE REACTIONS. Nitroprusside-induced hypotension will be self-limited within 1 to 10 minutes after discontinuation of the nitroprusside infusion; during these few minutes, it may be helpful to put the patient into a head-down position to maximize venous return.

If hypotension persists more than a few minutes after discontinuation of the infusion of sodium nitroprusside, sodium nitroprusside is not the cause, and the true cause must be sought. Sodium nitrite is available in a 3% solution, and 4 to 6 mg/kg should be injected over 2 to 4 minutes. This dose can be expected to convert about 10% of the patient's hemoglobin into methemoglobin; this level of methemoglobinemia is not associated with any important hazard of its own. The nitrite infusion may cause transient vasodilatation and hypotension, and this hypotension must, if it occurs, be routinely managed.

Infusion of sodium nitroprusside should therefore be started at a very low rate, with upward titration every few minutes until the desired effect is achieved or the maximum recommended infusion rate has been reached.

the blood pressure of a patient receiving this drug must be continuously monitored, using either a continually reinflated sphygmomanometer or an intra-arterial pressure.

In association with the decrease in blood pressure, sodium nitroprusside administered intravenously to hypertensive and normotensive patients produces slight increases in heart rate and a variable effect on cardiac output. In hypertensive patients, moderate doses induce renal vasodilatation roughly proportional to the decrease in systemic blood pressure, so there is no appreciable change in renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate. In normotensive subjects, acute reduction of mean arterial pressure to 60 to 75 mm Hg by infusion of sodium nitroprusside caused a significant increase in renin activity. In the same study, ten renovascular-hypertensive patients given sodium nitroprusside had significant increases in renin release from the involved kidney at mean arterial pressures of 90 to 137 mm Hg.

Hypotensive anesthetic techniques may also cause abnormalities of the pulmonary ventilation/perfusion ratio. Patients intolerant of these abnormalities may require a higher fraction of inspired oxygen. Extreme caution should be exercised in patients who are especially poor surgical risks.
