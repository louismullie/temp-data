## Question

Hydrochlorotiazide suspension prior surgery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hydrochlorothiazide should be held prior to surgery and, if so, when and why. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "hydrochlorothiazide suspension" implies clinically and whether any guideline or label differentiates suspension from tablet formulations. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about thiazide diuretics in the perioperative period. Next, I will examine the pharmacologic rationale for holding thiazides, including hypotension risk and electrolyte effects. After that, I should review any direct evidence or labeling statements that mention stopping thiazides before surgery. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm it aligns with contemporary guidance and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the formulation issue. Wait, let me verify whether "hydrochlorothiazide suspension" changes perioperative management compared with tablets. I don't see any guideline or FDA labeling that distinguishes suspension from tablet formulations for perioperative decisions, so the same principles for oral hydrochlorothiazide should apply regardless of the oral dosage form, assuming comparable bioavailability and dose equivalence [^notfound].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance on thiazides perioperatively. The 2022 ESC perioperative guideline explicitly recommends considering transient discontinuation of diuretics on the day of noncardiac surgery in patients with hypertension who are receiving diuretics, which directly includes hydrochlorothiazide, and the 2023 ESH hypertension guideline similarly advises considering preoperative discontinuation of diuretics in selected patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, aligning with a cautious, individualized approach [^111gU4QQ] [^112GG9iE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the pharmacologic rationale. Thiazides reduce plasma volume and can potentiate intraoperative hypotension, particularly in the setting of fasting, preoperative bowel prep, or neuraxial anesthesia. They also cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia, which can complicate perioperative arrhythmia risk and fluid management, so transient omission on the day of surgery is reasonable to mitigate these risks while maintaining overall hemodynamic stability [^111Zh7cW] [^111gU4QQ].

> I should confirm whether any direct evidence or labeling explicitly says to stop thiazides before surgery. One FDA label for a captopril/hydrochlorothiazide product advises, if feasible, discontinuing hydrochlorothiazide therapy one week prior to surgery, which is the most explicit statement I can find; however, this is a conservative, label-level suggestion and not a universal mandate, so I need to balance it against guideline nuance and patient-specific risk [^1173NV5R].

> Let me consider the clinical context and risk stratification. For low-risk patients with stable blood pressure, no significant heart failure, and normal renal function, holding the thiazide on the morning of surgery is a measured approach that reduces hypotension risk without exposing the patient to rebound hypertension. For higher-risk patients, those with heart failure or volume-sensitive physiology, or when significant fluid shifts are anticipated, a longer preoperative hold (for example, 2–3 days) may be reasonable, and in select cases a one-week hold as suggested by the captopril/HCTZ label could be considered, though that is more conservative than most contemporary practice patterns [^111gU4QQ] [^112GG9iE] [^1173NV5R].

> I should double-check electrolyte and renal implications. Preoperative labs should include potassium, sodium, and creatinine, with correction of hypokalemia or hyponatremia before elective surgery when feasible; in patients with CKD or those at risk of AKI, careful fluid planning and postoperative re-initiation of the thiazide once euvolemia and stable hemodynamics are achieved is prudent to avoid renal hypoperfusion and electrolyte disturbances [^111Zh7cW] [^113Q9kd9].

> But wait, what if the patient is on combination therapy with a beta-blocker or clonidine? I need to ensure I don't inadvertently advise stopping those, because abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockers or clonidine can precipitate rebound hypertension. Guidelines emphasize continuing chronic beta-blockers perioperatively and avoiding abrupt discontinuation, so the thiazide can be held independently while the beta-blocker is maintained through the perioperative period [^113AUH9h].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation. For most patients taking hydrochlorothiazide suspension who are undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, it is reasonable to hold the dose on the morning of surgery and resume postoperatively once hemodynamics are stable and oral intake is tolerated. In higher-risk scenarios or when the surgical team prefers a more conservative approach, holding for 2–3 days preoperatively can be considered, and in select cases a one-week hold may be used if aligned with labeling language and patient-specific risk, recognizing that this is more conservative than current guideline norms [^111gU4QQ] [^112GG9iE] [^1173NV5R].

> Finally, I should confirm postoperative planning. Thiazides should be restarted after surgery when the patient is euvolemic, electrolytes are stable, and blood pressure allows, with close monitoring for hypotension or renal function changes. Failure to restart chronically indicated antihypertensives postoperatively has been associated with worse outcomes, so timely resumption is important once hemodynamic stability is achieved [^113Q9kd9] [^113894Lw].

Hold hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on the **morning of surgery** [^111gU4QQ] to reduce intraoperative hypotension and electrolyte disturbances [^111Zh7cW]. If the patient is volume-depleted or at high risk for hypotension, **consider holding it 24–48 hours earlier** [^notfound]. Resume HCTZ postoperatively once the patient is hemodynamically stable, euvolemic, and able to take oral medications. Continue beta-blockers if already prescribed, and monitor electrolytes and renal function closely [^113AUH9h] [^113Q9kd9].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

HCTZ is a thiazide diuretic that reduces plasma volume and can cause **electrolyte disturbances** (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia) [^113CqQxM] and metabolic effects (hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia) [^113CqQxM]. These effects can increase the risk of intraoperative hypotension, arrhythmias, and renal complications [^113CqQxM].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Current guidelines and clinical evidence recommend **holding HCTZ on the day of surgery** [^111gU4QQ] to minimize intraoperative hypotension and electrolyte disturbances [^1173NV5R]. The ESC/ESH 2022 guidelines specifically advise considering transient discontinuation of diuretics, including HCTZ, on the day of noncardiac surgery [^111gU4QQ].

---

## Risks associated with continuation

Continuing HCTZ perioperatively may lead to:

- **Intraoperative hypotension**: Increased risk due to volume depletion and impaired compensatory mechanisms [^1173NV5R].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia and hyponatremia can predispose to arrhythmias and neuromuscular complications [^116MLdD9].

- **Renal complications**: Volume depletion and electrolyte disturbances may exacerbate renal impairment, particularly in patients with preexisting renal conditions [^115ZyWxP].

---

## Risks associated with discontinuation

Discontinuing HCTZ perioperatively may lead to:

- **Rebound hypertension**: Temporary elevation in blood pressure upon withdrawal, though generally manageable [^notfound].

- **Fluid retention**: Short-term fluid retention may occur, particularly in patients with heart failure or renal impairment [^116s4jCZ].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision

The decision to hold or continue HCTZ should be individualized based on:

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Patients with high cardiovascular risk may benefit from continued beta-blocker therapy, while HCTZ can be safely held [^113AUH9h].

- **Renal function**: Patients with impaired renal function require careful monitoring and individualized decision-making regarding diuretic management [^114Auq3t].

- **Electrolyte status**: Patients with preexisting electrolyte disturbances may benefit from holding HCTZ perioperatively [^1173NV5R].

---

## Recommended perioperative management strategy

Based on current evidence and guidelines, the following strategy is recommended:

| **Medication** | **Preoperative management** | **Postoperative management** |
|-|-|-|
| hydrochlorothiazide | Hold on the morning of surgery; consider holding 24–48 hours earlier in high-risk patients | Resume once hemodynamically stable, euvolemic, and able to take oral medications |
| beta-blockers | Continue perioperatively | Continue postoperatively |
| ACE inhibitors/ARBs | Hold 24 hours before surgery | Resume postoperatively once hemodynamically stable [^116cFk9R] |

---

## Monitoring and precautions

- **Electrolytes**: Monitor potassium, sodium, and magnesium levels closely perioperatively [^112fTEBd].

- **Renal function**: Regularly assess renal function, particularly in patients with preexisting renal impairment [^1137Hx3A].

- **Blood pressure**: Monitor blood pressure closely, managing rebound hypertension if it occurs [^116VdbfG].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Hold HCTZ**: On the morning of surgery; consider holding 24–48 hours earlier in high-risk patients [^111gU4QQ].

- **Resume HCTZ**: Postoperatively once hemodynamically stable, euvolemic, and able to take oral medications.

- **Continue beta-blockers**: Perioperatively if already prescribed [^113AUH9h].

- **Monitor**: Electrolytes, renal function, and blood pressure closely throughout the perioperative period [^112gSXwj].

Patients scheduled for surgical procedures — For patients with hypertension scheduled for major surgery who have been on beta blockers (BBs) chronically, BBs should be continued throughout the preoperative period to assist with blood pressure (BP) control (Class 1, Level B-NR). For elective major surgery, it is reasonable to continue most medications for hypertension throughout the preoperative period (Class 2a, Level C-EO). In major surgery, discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) preoperatively may be considered to prevent hypotension during surgery (Class 2b, Level B-R). In elective major surgery with systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 110 mm Hg, deferring surgery may be considered especially in high-risk patients to minimize perioperative complications (Class 2b, Level C-LD). In patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, abrupt preoperative discontinuation of BB or clonidine may result in rebound hypertension and is potentially harmful (Class 3: Harm, Level B-NR). For patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, BB should not be started on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients because of increased risk of postoperative mortality (Class 3: Harm, Level B-R).

### Evaluating routine diuretics after coronary surgery: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^112mVtzi]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Routine diuretic administration after cardiopulmonary bypass is common despite the lack of evidence for its benefit. We performed a prospective study to evaluate if diuretics assist in weight loss or alter clinical outcome.

Methods

Seventy-nine patients undergoing primary elective coronary bypass surgery were randomized to either diuretic (fusemide and amiloride) or placebo (lactose) postoperatively until preoperative weight was achieved or for 5 days in total. Proportions were compared with chi2 or Fisher's exact test.

Results

Forty patients were randomized to diuretics and 39 to placebo. By day 5, 97% of patients (37 of 38) still in the diuretic arm, and 74% of patients (29 of 39) in the placebo arm, achieved preoperative weight (p = 0.02). There were no differences in clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

Routine diuretics promote an earlier diuresis but no clinical benefits are apparent in low risk patients with normal renal function. Clinicians should reconsider routine diuretic prescription in this setting.

### A systematic review of outcomes associated with withholding or continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers before noncardiac surgery [^115bVAQT]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The global rate of major noncardiac surgical procedures is increasing annually, and of those patients presenting for surgery, increasing numbers are taking either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). The current recommendations of whether to continue or withhold ACE-I and ARB in the perioperative period are conflicting. Previous meta-analyses have linked preoperative ACE-I/ARB therapy to the increased incidence of postinduction hypotension; however, they have failed to correlate this with adverse patient outcomes. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether continuation or withholding ACE-I or ARB therapy in the perioperative period is associated with mortality and major morbidity.

Methods

This meta-analysis was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42017055291). A comprehensive search of MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL (EBSCO host), ProQuest, Cochrane database, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted on December 6, 2016. We included adult patients > 18 years of age on chronic ACE-I or ARB therapy who underwent noncardiac surgery in which ACE-I or ARB was either withheld or continued on the morning of surgery. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality and major cardiac events (MACE). Secondary outcomes included the risk of congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, stroke, intraoperative/postoperative hypotension, and the length of hospital stay.

Results

After abstract review, the full text of 25 studies was retrieved, of which 9 fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 5 were randomized control trials, and 4 were cohort studies. These studies included a total of 6022 patients on chronic ACE-I/ARB therapy before noncardiac surgery. A total of 1816 patients withheld treatment the morning of surgery and 4206 continued their ACE-I/ARB. Preoperative demographics were similar between the 2 groups. Withholding ACE-I/ARB therapy was not associated with a difference in mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–1.52; I = 0%) or MACE (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.82–1.52; I = 0%). However, withholding therapy was associated with significantly less intraoperative hypotension (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47–0.85; I = 71%). No effect estimate could be pooled concerning length of hospital stay and congestive heart failure.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis did not demonstrate an association between perioperative administration of ACE-I/ARB and mortality or MACE. It did, however, confirm the current observation that perioperative continuation of ACE-I/ARBs is associated with an increased incidence of intraoperative hypotension. A large randomized control trial is necessary to determine the appropriate perioperative management of ACE-I and ARBs.

### Amlodipine besylate valsartan hydrochlorothiazide (Amlodipine, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide) [^117Fmymi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients

Excessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with the maximum dose of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (10/320/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of valsartan/HCTZ (320/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10/320 mg) patients, and 0.2% of HCTZ/amlodipine (25/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in patients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur in patients receiving angiotensin receptor blockers. Correct this condition prior to administration of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide.

Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide has not been studied in patients with heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or in patients undergoing surgery or dialysis. Patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction patients given valsartan commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, but discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed. In controlled trials in heart failure patients, the incidence of hypotension in valsartan-treated patients was 5.5% compared to 1.8% in placebo-treated patients. In the Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT), hypotension in post-myocardial infarction patients led to permanent discontinuation of therapy in 1.4% of valsartan-treated patients and 0.8% of captopril-treated patients.

Since the vasodilation induced by amlodipine is gradual in onset, acute hypotension has rarely been reported after oral administration. Do not initiate treatment with amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in patients with aortic or mitral stenosis or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

If excessive hypotension occurs with amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, place the patient in a supine position and, if necessary, give intravenous normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.

5.3 Increased Angina and/or Myocardial Infarction

Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.

### Management of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors prior to major surgery: insights from the STOP-or-NOT trial [^116TPXAU]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Strong recommendations on how to manage renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, before surgery are lacking because of a lack of evidence, which is mostly limited to data from observational studies. The STOP-or-NOT trial was a large multicentre randomised trial designed to determine whether chronic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors should be continued or discontinued before major noncardiac surgery. As principal investigators of the STOP-or-NOT trial, we discuss the trial's results and how they contribute to the existing literature on management of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors before surgery.

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112MHPGZ]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative blood pressure thresholds, risk stratification, and beta-blocker initiation/withdrawal: There is conflicting evidence for patients with diastolic BP (DBP) > 110 mm Hg regarding recommending delay of surgery, and in a systematic review and meta-analysis, preoperative hypertension was associated with a 35% increase in cardiovascular complications; an increase in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications and renal failure has been reported in patients with DBP > 110 mm Hg immediately before surgery, whereas patients with DBP < 110 mm Hg do not appear to be at significantly increased risk. During induction of anesthesia, a sympathetic reaction can result in a 20 to 30 mm Hg increase in BP, and an elevated BP on the day of surgery may represent "white-coat hypertension"; therefore referring to patients' baseline ambulatory BP is recommended to guide BP management. Without evidence for increased risk for perioperative complications in patients whose preoperative systolic/diastolic BP is < 180/110 mm Hg, there is little evidence to defer surgery and BP can be controlled postoperatively or after discharge. Although few studies describe risks of withdrawing BB in the perioperative period, longstanding evidence suggests that abrupt withdrawal of long-term BB is harmful and should be avoided; there are fewer data to describe whether short-term (1 to 2 days) perioperative use of BB followed by rapid discontinuation is harmful, and abrupt discontinuation of clonidine can result in rebound hypertension associated with norepinephrine surge. This guideline recommends against starting a BB on the day of surgery in BB-naïve patients, particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and if there are no plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events.

### Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (avalide) [^114sVaHg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5	Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances

Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide

In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was < 1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide.

Coadministration of AVALIDE with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

5.6	Hepatic Impairment

Hydrochlorothiazide

Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.

Combination therapy — withdrawals and adverse events: For thiazide diuretic plus citrate versus thiazide monotherapy, one fair-quality trial reported no withdrawals for either group and did not report adverse events. For thiazide diuretic plus allopurinol versus thiazide monotherapy, withdrawal rates were 4.0% for thiazide plus allopurinol, 24.0% for thiazide-only, and 16.0% for control, with withdrawals due to adverse events in 8% of the thiazide group and none for thiazide plus allopurinol or control.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for hypertension, more specifically with respect to perioperative management of antihypertensives, AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AHA/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM 2025 guidelines recommend to avoid abrupt preoperative discontinuation of β-blockers or clonidine in patients with HTN scheduled for surgery, as it may result in rebound HTN and is potentially harmful.

### Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide [^1173NV5R]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Nondepolarizing Muscle Relaxants, Preanesthetics and Anesthetics Used in Surgery (e.g. Tubocurarine Chloride and Gallamine Triethiodide): effects of these agents may be potentiated; dosage adjustments may be required. Monitor and correct any fluid and electrolyte imbalances prior to surgery if feasible.

Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents: in some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effect of loop, potassium-sparing or thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when hydrochlorothiazide and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.

Methenamine: possible decreased effectiveness due to alkalinization of the urine.

Pressor Amines (e.g. Norepinephrine): decreased arterial responsiveness, but not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Use caution in patients taking both medications who undergo surgery. Administer preanesthetic and anesthetic agents in reduced dosage, and if possible, discontinue hydrochlorothiazide therapy one week prior to surgery.

Probenecid or Sulfinpyrazone: increased dosage of these agents may be necessary since hydrochlorothiazide may have hyperuricemic effects.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Captopril: Captopril may cause a false-positive urine test for acetone.

Hydrochlorothiazide: Hydrochlorothiazide may cause diagnostic interference of the bentiromide test.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide [^1137Hx3A]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include assessment of renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Hyperkalemia: In clinical trials hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 5.7 mEq/L) occurred in approximately 1.4 percent of hypertensive patients treated with lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide. In most cases these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Hyperkalemia was not a cause of discontinuation of therapy. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes. Hyperkalemia can cause serious, sometimes fatal, arrhythmias. Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide should be used cautiously, if at all, with these agents and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions)

Cough: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, almost always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.

Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, lisinopril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension — patients scheduled for surgical procedures (medication continuation) states that in patients with hypertension scheduled for major surgery who have been on BBs chronically, BBs should be continued throughout the perioperative period to assist with BP control. In patients with hypertension scheduled for elective major surgery, it is reasonable to continue most medications for hypertension throughout the perioperative period. In patients with hypertension scheduled for major surgery, discontinuation of ACEI or ARB preoperatively may be considered to prevent hypotension during surgery.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide [^1128t7YW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment, except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis.

Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.

If progressive renal impairment becomes evident consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy. Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.

Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

Patients were enrolled between July 2013 and October 2013 and were either male or female outpatients aged ⩾20 years with uncontrolled essential hypertension despite treatment with T80/H12.5 during a 6-week run-in period. The patients were also required to be taking two or three antihypertensive drugs at the time they provided informed consent, and to have a mean seated DBP ⩾90 and ≤ 114 mm Hg and a mean seated SBP ≤ 200 mm Hg at week −6 (the pseudo baseline; at the beginning of the run-in period) and week 0 (the reference baseline; at the end of the 6-week run-in period). All patients had to be able to safely stop all current antihypertensive drugs (other than the study medication) from –6 weeks through to the end of the trial without risk and had to provide informed consent.

The exclusion criteria included known or suspected secondary hypertension; current sustained ventricular tachycardia or other cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication; congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class III–IV); a history of myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or unstable angina within the previous 3 months; hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, or hemodynamically relevant stenosis of the aortic or mitral valve and a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack within the previous 6 months. Patients who had taken any investigational drugs within 28 days of signing the informed consent form were also excluded.

The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was granted by the institutional review boards at each center, and the documentation and conduct met the requirements and definitions of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice ((GCP) ICH E6), 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.3, and of the participating country (Japan). All patients provided written informed consent, which they were free to withdraw at any time during the study.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Thiazide-type diuretics — terminology and agent selection: Throughout this guideline, the term thiazide-type diuretic collectively refers to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), chlorthalidone, and indapamide, and although chemical-structure differences are noted, the guideline groups them under a single term and states it is acceptable for clinicians to choose among these agents for treatment.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Medication management — thiazide-type diuretics terminology and use — clarifies that this guideline uses the term thiazide-type diuretic to collectively refer to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), chlorthalidone, and indapamide; HCTZ is categorized as thiazide-type because it possesses a benzothiadiazine ring, while chlorthalidone and indapamide are categorized as thiazide-like because they lack this ring; in most settings it is acceptable for clinicians to choose among these agents, but in resistant hypertension thiazide-like diuretics are preferred due to their greater efficacy and treatment recommendations in this setting continue to advocate thiazide-like diuretics.

### Enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide [^116MLdD9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Surgery/Anesthesia

In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, enalapril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance: hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, irrespective of cause, include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, seizures, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy. Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and may also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). Because enalapril reduces the production of aldosterone, concomitant therapy with enalapril attenuates the diuretic-induced potassium loss (see Drug Interactions, Agents Increasing Serum Potassium).

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets (lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide) [^111N822v]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE-inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see also INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy or a neprilysin inhibitor may be at increased risk for angioedema (see PRECAUTIONS).

Intestinal Angioedema: Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain.

Anaphylactoid reactions during desensitization: Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge.

Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure: Sudden and potentially life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in some patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. In such patients, dialysis must be stopped immediately, and aggressive therapy for anaphylactoid reactions must be initiated. Symptoms have not been relieved by antihistamines in these situations. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of antihypertensive agent. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension management in noncardiac surgery — continuation of chronic therapy and target blood pressure: If well tolerated, beta blockers (BBs) should be continued in patients who are currently receiving them for guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) indications, and clinical judgment is useful in titrating BB during the perioperative period with a focus on continuation throughout the hospital stay and at discharge unless clear contraindications arise. In the absence of conclusive randomized controlled trials (RCTs), control of blood pressure (BP) to levels recommended by this guideline (BP < 130/80 mm Hg) or other target levels specified for a particular individual is reasonable before undertaking major elective procedures in either the inpatient or outpatient setting, and if the patient is unable to take oral medications, it is reasonable to use intravenous medications as necessary to control BP. Caution is advised when continuing antihypertensive therapy in patients with low perioperative diastolic BP (DBP), older adults (age ≥ 65 years), and patients in whom the risk for perioperative hypotension is high. Regarding renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), evidence from a large cohort study demonstrates that patients who stopped their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) 24 hours before noncardiac surgery were less likely to suffer the primary composite outcome and intraoperative hypotension than those continuing these medications until surgery, whereas POISE-3 randomized 7490 patients with at least 1 high-risk factor and did not find a significant difference between perioperative discontinuation versus maintenance of ACEi/ARB therapy during the operative and immediate perioperative periods; omitted RAASi before surgery has been shown to reduce intraoperative hypotension, whereas RCTs have failed to prove their continuation or implementation improves clinical outcomes.

### Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide [^1118YB6g]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypotension

Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, fosinopril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume- and/or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide.

Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be used cautiously in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other antihypertensives. The thiazide component of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs, especially ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic-blocking drugs. The antihypertensive effects of the thiazide component may also be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient.

In patients with congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria, azotemia, and (rarely) with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of fosinopril or diuretic is increased.

If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111w9mV1]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Perioperative management of hypertension — It is recommended that newly diagnosed hypertensive patients who are scheduled for elective surgery should be preoperatively screened for HMOD and CV risk, and it is recommended to avoid large perioperative BP fluctuations during the perioperative period. Non-cardiac surgery may not be deferred in patients with grade 1 or 2 hypertension (SBP < 180 mmHg; DBP < 110 mmHg). For medications, perioperative continuation of beta-blockers is recommended in hypertensive patients on chronic treatment with these drugs, abrupt discontinuation of beta-blockers or centrally acting agents (e.g. clonidine) is potentially harmful and is not recommended, and transient preoperative discontinuation of RAS blockers should be considered in patients with hypertension undergoing non-cardiac surgery. On-page definitions specify BP = blood pressure, SBP = systolic blood pressure, DBP = diastolic blood pressure, CV = cardiovascular, HMOD = hypertension-mediated organ damage, and RAS = renin–angiotensin system.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^113RmDvq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Ménière's disease (MD) — oral diuretics for maintenance: Diuretics are believed to alter the electrolyte balance in endolymph, subsequently reducing endolymph volume. The most commonly prescribed diuretics are thiazides with or without potassium-sparing agents such as hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene or spironolactone, and the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (Diamox) is used as a second-line therapy. Thiazides are contraindicated in patients with gout, and potassium-sparing diuretics are contraindicated in patients with acute or severe renal failure; since the prolonged use of thiazides can precipitate gout, other diuretic options should be considered, and clinicians should monitor electrolytes and blood pressure in patients who are prescribed diuretics. Evidence from a Cochrane systematic review identified 10 studies but none met inclusion due to allocation problems (not randomized, n = 4; unclear allocation, n = 2; or not placebo controlled, n = 7) or problems extracting data (n = 2); crossover trials comparing hydrochlorothiazide or triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide with placebo lacked pre-crossover data, and while effects on MD could not be rigorously evaluated due to a lack of high-quality studies, some studies reported improvement in vertigo with diuretics.

### Introducing an AKI predictive tool for patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery [^116mc2kn]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Consideration was also given as to whether patients at high risk should be catheterised routinely. Due to the risk of catheter-related infection, we did not include routine catheterisation of high-risk patients.

Our second intervention related to withholding certain medications around the time of surgery. The perioperative drug management guideline in place prior to this project stipulated patients on ACE inhibitors or ARBs should have these medications withheld on the day of surgery and that patients on NSAIDs should stop these 3 days before surgery. It also stated that aldosterone antagonists should be withheld on the day of surgery but not did comment on loop or thiazide diuretics.

In the baseline audit, six patients were on an ACE inhibitor or ARB. All six patients had these medications withheld on the day of surgery though it was restarted on day 1 postoperatively in four patients. Of note, four of the patients who had their ACE inhibitors or ARBs restarted postoperatively required further doses to be withheld during their admission due to low BP, which suggested that restarting these medications routinely on day 1 postoperatively was premature. We recommended that patients at high risk of AKI withhold these medicines on the day of surgery and day 1 and day 2 postoperatively.

With regards to NSAIDs, 4/37 patients were on regular NSAIDs preoperatively. Only one of these patients did not have their NSAIDs withheld preoperatively. This was a patient undergoing palliation for metastatic cancer. NSAIDs were started for postoperative pain in three patients (all low risk). Our intervention bundle did not alter the advice to withhold the NSAIDs from 3 days preoperatively but added that they should be used with caution postoperatively for those at high risk of AKI.

No patients in the baseline audit were on loop or thiazide diuretics; one patient was on spironolactone and this was withheld on the day of surgery. Our intervention bundle advised that all diuretics should be withheld routinely on the day of surgery and that fluid balance should be monitored closely when restarting these medications postoperatively. It was agreed that the anaesthetist would make this decision based on the individual patient.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (lisinopril with hydrochlorothiazide) [^114efsio]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions:

Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious.

Head and Neck Angioedema:

Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril. This may occur at any time during treatment. ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients. Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets should be promptly discontinued and the appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. Even in those instances where swelling of only the tongue is involved, without respiratory distress, patients may require prolonged observation since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient. Very rarely, fatalities have been reported due to angioedema associated with laryngeal edema or tongue edema. Patients with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx are likely to experience airway obstruction, especially those with history of airway surgery. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS .)

Intestinal Angioedema:

Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain.

Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see also INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS).

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^113ompT5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients

Excessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was seen in 1.7% of patients treated with the maximum dose of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets (10/320/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of valsartan/HCTZ (320/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10/320 mg) patients, and 0.2% of HCTZ/amlodipine (25/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial in patients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur in patients receiving angiotensin receptor blockers. Correct this condition prior to administration of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have not been studied in patients with heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or in patients undergoing surgery or dialysis. Patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction patients given valsartan commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, but discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed. In controlled trials in heart failure patients, the incidence of hypotension in valsartan-treated patients was 5.5% compared to 1.8% in placebo-treated patients. In the Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT), hypotension in post-myocardial infarction patients led to permanent discontinuation of therapy in 1.4% of valsartan-treated patients and 0.8% of captopril-treated patients.

Since the vasodilation induced by amlodipine is gradual in onset, acute hypotension has rarely been reported after oral administration. Do not initiate treatment with Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with aortic or mitral stenosis or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

If excessive hypotension occurs with amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, place the patient in a supine position and, if necessary, give intravenous normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.

5.3 Increased Angina and/or Myocardial Infarction

Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.

### The measurement of adult blood pressure and management of hypertension before elective surgery: joint guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland and the British hypertension society [^111cd9Ge]. Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Best practice: the treatment of hypertension

This section summarises the recommendations for primary care following the diagnosis of hypertension. There is good evidence (GRADE 1A) for the treatment of hypertension with one or more of the following: diuretics (thiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide); beta‐blockers; calcium channel‐blockers (CCB); angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or an angiotensin‐2 receptor blocker (ARB) 1. In the future, the threshold for treating high blood pressure might change to cardiovascular risk (see below, the treatment of cardiovascular risk, not hypertension).

Step 1 treatment

Patients aged less than 55 years should be offered an ACE inhibitor, or a low‐cost ARB. If an ACE inhibitor is prescribed but is not tolerated (for example, because of cough), offer a low‐cost ARB. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and ARBs are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. An ACE inhibitor should not be combined with an ARB.

Patients aged over 55 years and Black patients of African or Caribbean family origin of any age should be offered a CCB. If a CCB is not suitable, for example because of oedema or intolerance, or if there is evidence of heart failure or a high risk of heart failure, a thiazide‐like diuretic should be offered.

If diuretic treatment is to be initiated or changed, offer a thiazide‐like diuretic, such as chlorthalidone (12.5–25.0 mg once daily), or indapamide (1.5 mg modified‐release once daily or 2.5 mg once daily), in preference to a conventional thiazide diuretic such as bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide.

For patients who are already having treatment with bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide and whose blood pressure is stable and well controlled, treatment with the bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide should be continued.

Beta‐blockers are not a preferred initial therapy for hypertension. However, beta‐blockers may be considered in younger patients, particularly those with an intolerance or contraindication to ACE inhibitors and ARBs, or women of childbearing potential or patients with evidence of increased sympathetic drive. If beta‐blockers are started and a second drug is required, add a CCB rather than a thiazide‐like diuretic to reduce the person's risk of developing diabetes.

### Impact of renin-angiotensin system blockers on mortality in veterans undergoing cardiac surgery [^117CymUr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Finally, while our study and the weight of evidence from prior research clearly demonstrate the long‐term benefits of RASBs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the appropriate timing and protocol for initiation or resumption of these medications remains unclear given the concerns for short‐term adverse events (intraoperative and early postoperative). While some experts have reported the safety 47 of clear institutional protocols, which can help avoid many of these short‐term adverse events, yet providing the long‐term cardiovascular benefits, these are not widely tested. This lacuna in evidence is clearly a reason for the variable practice patterns. 43 While a few studies have clearly demonstrated that a strategy of continuation of preoperative RASB is safe compared with routine discontinuation, 48 such evidence is lacking regarding the postoperative approaches with no validated protocols that have been tested in a prospective well‐designed study. Factors such as intraoperative events, postoperative hemodynamics, and patient risk and comorbidities should all be considerations that dictate the timing and dose of the RASB initiation or resumption. Therefore, a protocolized approach that can be individualized is necessary for minimizing short‐term adverse effects and maximizing long‐term benefits of RASBs in these patients. Given the retrospective nature of our study, these various factors could not be assessed, and future research is necessary.

Methods

Study design

This study was a preplanned analysis of the Stopping Perioperative ACE-inhibitors/ARBs (SPACE) phase 2a Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (ISRCTN17251494), regulated by the Health Research Authority (UK) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency UK (Eudract: 2016–004141–90). Six UK centres recruited patients who provided written informed consent, in accord with the London (City and East) research ethics committee (16/LO/1495). An independent steering committee and data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC) oversaw the trial (Supplementary data).

Inclusion criteria

- Adults prescribed RAS inhibitors aged ≥ 60 yr
- American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status ≥ 3
- Elective major surgery requiring general anaesthesia for procedures lasting ≥ 120 min

Exclusion criteria

- Current participation in any other interventional clinical trial
- Myocardial infarction within the 3 months preceding surgery

Randomisation

Patients were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to either continue or discontinue RAS inhibitors according to the individual pharmacokinetics of each drug. Randomisation was performed centrally, with minimisation by centre, planned surgical procedure category, and RAS inhibitor type.

Post-randomisation management of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors

RAS inhibitors were restarted after surgery on the morning of postoperative day 2 in accord with recommendations by European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelinesat the usual dose. Restarting RAS inhibitors did not occur on postoperative day 2 if systolic arterial pressure was < 90 mm Hg in the preceding 12 h or vasoactive therapy was used or if acute kidney injury occurred (KDIGO criteria). All other treatments were managed by the local clinical teams.

Data collection

Blood samples were collected before induction of anaesthesia, 24 h, and 48 h after surgery (see Supplementary data for schedule of visits), from which serum and plasma was prepared. Plasma troponin samples were batch-analysed at the same laboratory (The Doctor's Laboratory, London, UK) by personnel masked to all study details. To minimise bias, follow-up data were collected by a study team member who was masked to the treatment group allocation.

Criteria for withdrawal / discontinuation of participants

Criteria of IMP discontinuation or study discontinuation are listed in Table 3. Participants who permanently discontinue the IMP are expected to continue in the follow-up period and to attend all protocol-specified study visits. If study visits are not possible, a telephone consultation will be performed to determine if relevant health events / endpoints have occurred. A study participant who discontinues study participation prematurely for any reason is defined as dropout if the participant has already been randomized. A study participant who terminates the study before randomization is regarded as a screening failure.

Criteria for withdrawal / discontinuation of participants

Study assessments

Outpatients referred to stone clinics for metabolic stone work-up will be recruited for the trial. For work-up and follow-up visits of participants, the NOSTONE protocol strictly adheres to recommendations of the American and European guidelines on nephrolithiasis with regard to scheduling of patient visits, lab analyses and imaging. Prior to randomization, patients will undergo a screening visit to check health status (including lab values), eligibility and determine stone history. At randomization, eligible patients will undergo a low-dose, renal-limited non-iv contrast CT and receive the assigned IMP. Participants enrolled in the trial will be followed-up 3 months after randomization and thereafter with yearly visits and every 3 months through phone calls. Symptomatic recurrence will be assessed at follow-up visits and during phone calls between visits. Radiologic recurrence will be assessed at treatment end by a low-dose, renal-limited non-iv contrast CT.

Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis.

Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient.

If progressive renal impairment becomes evident consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy.

Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.

### Efficacy of standard and low dose hydrochlorothiazide in the recurrence prevention of calcium nephrolithiasis (NOSTONE trial): protocol for a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^1161ey6K]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nephrolithiasis is a global healthcare problem with a current lifetime risk of 18.8% in men and 9.4% in women. Given the high cost of medical treatments and surgical interventions as well as the morbidity related to symptomatic stone disease, medical prophylaxis for stone recurrence is an attractive approach. Thiazide diuretics have been the cornerstone of pharmacologic metaphylaxis for more than 40years. However, evidence for benefits and harms of thiazides in the prevention of calcium containing kidney stones in general remains unclear. In addition, the efficacy of the currently employed low dose thiazide regimens to prevent stone recurrence is not known.

Methods

The NOSTONE trial is an investigator-initiated 3-year prospective, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of standard and low dose hydrochlorothiazide treatment in the recurrence prevention of calcium containing kidney stones. We plan to include 416 adult (≥ 18years) patients with recurrent (≥ 2 stone episodes in the last 10years) calcium containing kidney stones (containing ≥ 50% of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate or a mixture of both). Patients will be randomly allocated to 50mg or 25mg or 12.5mg hydrochlorothiazide or placebo. The primary outcome will be incidence of stone recurrence (a composite of symptomatic or radiologic recurrence). Secondary outcomes will be individual components of the composite primary outcome, safety and tolerability of hydrochlorothiazide treatment, changes in urinary biochemistry elicited by hydrochlorothiazide treatment and impact of baseline disease severity, biochemical abnormalities and stone composition on treatment response.

Discussion

The NOSTONE study will provide long-sought information on the efficacy of hydrochlorothiazide in the recurrence prevention of calcium containing kidney stones. Strengths of the study include the randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled design, the large amount of patients studied, the employment of high sensitivity and high specificity imaging and the exclusive public funding support.

### Risk of intraoperative hypotension with loop diuretics: a randomized controlled trial [^111U5Myp]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

There is growing concern regarding the safety of blood pressure-lowering medications administered during the perioperative period. Whether loop diuretics also induce intraoperative hypotension is uncertain. Our objective was to compare the effects of continuing or withholding furosemide on the day of noncardiac elective surgery on intraoperative hypotension among chronic users of furosemide.

Methods

A double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial was conducted at 3 North American university centers between September 2000 and December 2006. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either furosemide or placebo on the day of surgery. The primary outcome was risk of developing intraoperative hypotension. A priori secondary outcomes included risk of heart failure; composite cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, stroke or transient ischemic attack, or death); and change in renal function and electrolytes.

Results

Of the 212 patients enrolled, 193 patients underwent surgery. There was no significant difference in risk of developing intraoperative hypotension between the furosemide (49%) and placebo (51.9%) groups (relative risk [RR], 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–1.24; p = 0.78). The intraoperative administration of vasopressors and fluids were similar between both groups. The risk of developing postoperative cardiovascular events was not significantly different between those randomized to furosemide (4.8%) or placebo (2.8%) (RR, 1.73; 95% CI, 0.42–7.06; p = 0.49). There was no significant difference in renal function or electrolytes between the 2 groups.

Conclusion

Among elective, noncardiac surgeries in patients chronically treated with furosemide, the administration of furosemide on the day of surgery did not significantly increase the risk for intraoperative hypotension.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Medical management — thiazide-type diuretics: The guideline uses the term thiazide-type diuretic to collectively refer to HCTZ, chlorthalidone, and indapamide, and in most settings it is acceptable for clinicians to choose among these agents for treatment. Differences in potency and half‑life may be relevant in some situations, particularly in the management of resistant hypertension, in which thiazide‑like diuretics are preferred due to their greater efficacy; therefore, treatment recommendations in this setting continue to advocate thiazide‑like diuretics.

Diuretics in heart failure — patient selection and dosing advises that diuretics should be prescribed to all patients who have evidence of, and to most patients with a prior history of, fluid retention and should generally be combined with an ACEI and a beta-blocker, as few patients with HF will be able to maintain dry weight without diuretics; for initiation and maintenance, the most commonly used loop diuretic is furosemide, though some respond to torsemide due to superior absorption and longer duration of action; outpatient therapy is commonly started with low doses and increased until urine output rises and weight decreases, generally by 0.5 to 1.0 kg daily, with further dose or frequency escalations (i.e., twice-daily dosing) possibly required; the ultimate goal is elimination of clinical evidence of fluid retention, and diuretics are generally combined with moderate dietary sodium restriction (3 to 4 g daily).

Step 4 treatment

If resistant blood pressure exceeds 140/90 mmHg in clinic after treatment with the optimal or highest‐tolerated doses of an ACE inhibitor, or an ARB plus a CCB, with a diuretic; adding a fourth antihypertensive drug and expert advice should be considered.

Further diuretic therapy with low‐dose spironolactone (25 mg once daily) should be considered if the serum potassium concentration < 4.6 mmol.l⁻¹. Caution is required in patients with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rates because of an increased risk of hyperkalaemia. Increasing the dose of thiazide‐like diuretics should be considered if the serum potassium concentration > 4.5 mmol.l⁻¹.

Serum sodium and potassium concentrations and renal function should be checked within 1 month of increasing diuretic dose, and repeated as required thereafter. If further diuretic therapy for resistant hypertension at Step 4 is not tolerated, or is contraindicated or ineffective, consider an alpha‐blocker or beta‐blocker. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled with the optimal or maximum tolerated doses of four drugs, expert advice should be sought if it has not yet been obtained.

As recently as 2008, the HYVET study demonstrated the clinical benefits of treating hypertension in people aged ≥ 80 years, while health economic analysis has confirmed the cost effectiveness of this strategy 1, 20. As a result, NICE now recommends that patients aged ≥ 80 years should be offered treatment only if they have stage 2 hypertension. The 2011 Hypertension Guideline also recommends that the decision to treat should be based on standing blood pressure, and should take into account the presence of co‐morbidities such as dementia. The guideline also makes a distinction between initiating treatment in the over‐80s and continuing long‐term and well‐tolerated treatment when patients reach this age. In other words, patients who were started on treatment when younger should not have their current therapy back‐titrated when they celebrate their 80th birthday.

### Should renin-angiotensin system inhibitors be held prior to major surgery? [^111yVFSq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Many patients undergoing surgical procedures have a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, or a combination. Often, these conditions involve the chronic use of a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Observational studies have suggested that continuing ACEIs/ARBs before major noncardiac surgery can increase the risk of intraoperative hypotension, which might drive postoperative complications such as acute kidney injury, myocardial injury, or stroke. Strong recommendations on how to manage ACEIs/ARBs before surgery are, however, lacking owing to insufficient evidence, mostly limited to data from observational studies. Recently, the SPACE trial investigated the impact of preoperative management of ACEIs/ARBs on postoperative myocardial injury. Myocardial injury occurred in 48.3% patients randomised to discontinue and 41.3% patients randomised to continue ACEI/ARB (odds ratio for continuing: 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.45–1.31). Patients randomised to the 'Stop' group experienced more postoperative hypertension. In a post hoc analysis, patients randomised to the 'Continue' group with low preoperative NT-proBNP concentrations (< 100 pg mL⁻¹) experienced less myocardial injury after surgery than the 'Stop' group, whereas no significant difference was observed in patients with elevated preoperative NT-proBNP concentrations. The SPACE trial provides important and new reassuring data on the safety of continuing ACEIs/ARBs before major surgery, challenging previous beliefs.

### Efficacy of standard and low dose hydrochlorothiazide in the recurrence prevention of calcium nephrolithiasis (NOSTONE trial): protocol for a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^114nc9tT]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis of the trial will be done at CTU Bern by a statistician first blinded to the group allocation. Blinding will remain in place until the statistician codes the primary analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes and produces a dummy report of the primary analysis using a randomly generated group variable. The true group variable becomes open after the completion of the dummy report and gives place to the final report of all the analysis as well as the quality control by the independent statistician. Primary analyses will be done using the full analysis set according to the intention-to-treat principle where all randomized patients will be analyzed in the allocated group regardless of any protocol violations or early treatment discontinuations. In the secondary per-protocol analysis, we will evaluate primary and secondary outcomes based on the per-protocol analysis set (i.e. considering only subjects who effectively followed the protocol). No formal interim analysis is planned.

Primary analysis

We will assess the time to the stone event using the log-rank test stratified for the number of stones at baseline, Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by treatment dose and hazard ratios between dosage groups using the Cox proportional hazards. Comparisons between placebo and the three active trial arms will be considered exploratory, as the trial is not powered to detect differences with placebo. Components of the primary outcome will be analyzed as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes (changes in urinary biochemistry from baseline and through the study) will be analyzed using the random effects model.

Secondary analysis

We will assess the impact of baseline disease severity on stone recurrence; the impact of biochemical abnormalities on stone recurrence; and the impact of stone composition on stone using the multivariable Cox-model.

Sensitivity analysis and some additional analyses

We will compare the full analysis set and per protocol analysis of continuous outcomes based on multiple imputations with the analysis of all available cases. We will assess the sensitivity of time-to- stone-event approach comparing it with multiple event models or frailty (count) models or marginal count models. In the secondary analysis in case of a relevant number of patients with multiple events, we will consider a shared-frailty Cox model for multiple recurrent events.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of hydrochlorothiazide PO:
- **Acute angle-closure glaucoma, acute transient myopia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydrochlorothiazide has been associated with an increased risk of acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma, especially in patients with a history of sulfonamide or penicillin hypersensitivity.
- **Decreased serum potassium**: use caution in patients with brisk diuresis when severe cirrhosis is present or after prolonged therapy, inadequate oral electrolyte intake, or concomitant use of corticosteroids or ACTH. Consider prescribing potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium supplements to avoid hypokalemia. Monitor serum potassium levels periodically.
- **Decreased serum sodium**: use extreme caution in patients with edema during hot water. Monitor serum sodium levels periodically. Restrict water intake in case of dilutional hyponatremia.
- **Electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydrochlorothiazide can cause hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypercalcemia, and hyperuricemia, potentially precipitating a gout attack in susceptible patients. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.
- **Exacerbation of SLE**: use caution in patients with SLE.
- **Hepatic coma**: use caution in patients with sever liver disease.
- **Hypotension**: use caution in patients after sympathectomy.
- **Increased blood glucose**: use caution in patients with diabetes or prediabetes. Adjust the doses of insulin and/or other hypoglycemic agents.
- **Increased serum calcium, decreased serum phosphate**: use caution in all patients, especially with hyperparathyroidism or prolonged therapy. Discontinue thiazides before obtaining parathyroid function tests.
- **Metabolic alkalosis**: use caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

### Efficacy of standard and low dose hydrochlorothiazide in the recurrence prevention of calcium nephrolithiasis (NOSTONE trial): protocol for a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^113d3Mka]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The efficacy of thiazides in the recurrence prevention of kidney stones has been studied in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (Table 1). With the exception of two trials, thiazides significantly reduced stone recurrence compared to placebo or control. However, as detailed in Table 1 and highlighted by a recent systematic review, thiazide RCTs thus far conducted suffer from significant methodological deficiencies, including: use of high thiazide doses, low overall number of patients studied, lack of outcome uniformity, use of outdated dietary recommendations, unclear allocation concealment, lack of double-blinding and intention-to-treat analysis, absence of adverse event and drop out reporting, unknown baseline risk of disease severity and baseline biochemical abnormalities of patients studied, lack of patient stratification and employment of low sensitivity and specificity imaging modalities.

Table 1
Randomized controlled trials of thiazides in the prevention of recurrent nephrolithiasis

a TID, three times daily, b BID, twice times daily, c RR, relative risk

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) was used in five of the 11 thiazide RCTs for stone prevention and is thus currently the best studied thiazide in the prevention of stone recurrence. However, other thiazides such as bendroflumethiazide, chlorthalidone, trichlormethiazide and indapamide also reduced stone recurrence in one or more trials and seem to be effective as well. In all trials, high thiazide doses were employed, in the case of HCTZ, 50–100 mg daily. In four of the five HCTZ trials, the diuretic was given twice daily, whereas in the treatment of arterial hypertension, HCTZ is typically given once daily. Once daily HCTZ at the dose of 50 mg, 25 mg or 12.5 mg reduces calciuria in healthy volunteers, a surrogate marker for stone prevention. Detailed HCTZ dose-response studies with respect to urinary composition and stone recurrence are lacking. Twice daily HCTZ increases the frequency of side effects and augments diuresis at night and thereby likely affects compliance.

Perioperative renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (ACEi/ARB) and outcomes — noncardiac surgery: Data on the potential risk and benefit of ACEi in the perioperative setting are controversial. A large cohort study found that patients who stopped their ACEi or ARB 24 hours before noncardiac surgery were less likely to suffer the primary composite outcome and intraoperative hypotension than those continuing therapy, whereas POISE-3, which randomized 7490 patients, did not find a significant difference between strategies of perioperative discontinuation versus maintenance during the operative and immediate perioperative periods. Omitting RAASi before surgery has been shown to reduce intraoperative hypotension, whereas randomized controlled trials have failed to prove that interruption or implementation improves clinical outcomes.

5.5 Major Surgery

Avoid initiation of high-dose regimen of LOPRESSOR HCT in patients with cardiovascular risk factors undergoing non-cardiac surgery, since use in such patients has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, stroke and death.

Chronically administered beta-adrenergic blockers should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.000000000000000e+00 6 Masked Symptoms of Hypoglycemia

Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at anytime during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment.

5.7 Electrolyte and Metabolic Effects

LOPRESSOR HCT contains hydrochlorothiazide which can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which may be difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide reduces clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels.

5.000000000000000e+00 8 Renal Impairment

Patients with chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion may be at increased risk for developing acute renal failure on drugs containing hydrochlorothiazide, including LOPRESSOR HCT.

5.000000000000000e+00 9 Peripheral Vascular Disease

Beta-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease.

5.000000000000000e+00 10 Pheochromocytoma

If LOPRESSOR HCT is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.

Perioperative management of hypertension — surgical timing, BP targets, and medication handling are specified: Postponing necessary surgery is usually not warranted in grade 1 or 2 hypertension, whereas in those with an SBP > 180 mmHg and/or DBP > 110 mmHg, deferring the intervention until BP is reduced or controlled is advisable, except for emergency situations; it is important to avoid large preoperative BP fluctuations, with cohort data showing that maintaining a stable BP with a 70 mmHg threshold for SBP and pre‑induction BP values within 10% difference from the preoperative office SBP reduced postoperative organ dysfunction; there is no clear evidence in favour of against one or another antihypertensive treatment mode in non‑cardiac surgery, so general drug treatment algorithms apply; continuation of beta‑blockers is nevertheless recommended in hypertensive patients on chronic beta‑blocker treatment because abrupt discontinuation may lead to BP or heart rate rebounds, which may also occur with central agents such as clonidine; while the question has been raised whether RAS blockers should be discontinued before surgery, a large international cohort reported that withholding ACE inhibitors or ARBs 24 h before non‑cardiac surgery was associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality 30 days after the intervention.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension — Hypertension in the perioperative period increases the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and bleeding. As many as 25% of patients who undergo major noncardiac surgery and 80% of patients who have cardiac surgery experience perioperative hypertension. In general, the level of risk is related to the severity of the hypertension. Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with increased perioperative and postoperative complications. Certain medications (eg, BB, clonidine) may be associated with rebound hypertension if discontinued abruptly.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Patients scheduled for surgical procedures — perioperative antihypertensive management and surgical timing: In patients with hypertension scheduled for major surgery who have been on BBs chronically, BBs should be continued throughout the perioperative period to assist with BP control (1, B-NR). In patients with hypertension scheduled for elective major surgery, it is reasonable to continue most medications for hypertension throughout the perioperative period (2a, C-EO). In patients with hypertension scheduled for major surgery, discontinuation of ACEI or ARB preoperatively may be considered to prevent hypotension during surgery (2b, B-R). In patients scheduled for elective major surgery with SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg, deferring surgery may be considered especially in high-risk patients to minimize perioperative complications (2b, C-LD). In patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, abrupt preoperative discontinuation of BB or clonidine may result in rebound hypertension and is potentially harmful (3: Harm, B-NR). For patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, BB should not be started on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients because of increased risk of postoperative mortality (3: Harm, B-R).

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Heart Failure: Initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily (2.2).
Hypertension: Initiate treatment at 25 to 100 mg daily in either single or divided doses (2.3).
Edema: Initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly. The recommended initial daily dose is 100 mg in single or divided doses (2.4).
Primary hyperaldosteronism: Initiate treatment at 100 to 400 mg in preparation for surgery. In patients unsuitable for surgery use the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient (2.5).

2.1	General Considerations

ALDACTONE can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2	Treatment of Heart Failure

In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m², initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily. Patients who tolerate 25 mg once daily may have their dosage increased to 50 mg once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 25 mg once daily may have their dosage reduced to 25 mg every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73 m², consider initiating therapy at 25 mg every other day because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3	Treatment of Essential Hypertension

The recommended initial daily dose is 25 to 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses is recommended. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses greater than 100 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

2.4	Treatment of Edema

In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. The recommended initial daily dosage is 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, administer for at least five days before increasing dose to obtain desired effect.

2.5	Treatment of Primary Hyperaldosteronism

Administer ALDACTONE in doses of 100 to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery. For patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery, ALDACTONE can be used as long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient.

### Quinapril hcl and hydrochlorothiazide [^116oEih8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels in patients with hypercalcemia receiving Quinapril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets.

Cough: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.

Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, quinapril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.

Information for Patients

Angioedema: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Tell patients receiving Quinapril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets to immediately report any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in breathing) and to temporarily discontinue Quinapril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets until after consulting with the prescribing physician.

Pregnancy: Tell female patients of childbearing age about the consequences of exposure to Quinapril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Ask patients to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible.

### Perioperative use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists [^116nxjQ8]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Clinical repercussions of perioperative treatment with ACEIs/ARBs.

Design

Systematic review according to PRISMA statement.

Setting

Perioperative period.

Patients

29 studies 11 cases/cases series, 12 observational studies and 6 randomized studies.

Measurements

Arterial blood pressure differences, refractory hypotension, other comorbidities.

Main Results

The studies show different results regarding the topics measured. They are divided in the results regarding blood pressure, long term morbidities and effects in neuraxial anesthesia.

Conclusions

Withholding AECI/ARBs on the morning prior to surgery could be recommended as a potentially effective measure, with a low level of evidence, in order to reduce the appearance of hypotension in the perioperative period of non-cardiac surgery.

### Consequences of continuing renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonists in the preoperative period: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115WMEuP]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the data available at the time this study was conducted did not provide sufficient evidence to support that continuing ACEIs/ARBs on the day of surgery in patients who chronically received these drugs is associated with obvious disadvantages. No significant incidences of severe or refractory hypotension or postoperative ischemia-related complications were observed between those patients continuing ACEIs/ARBs and those who either discontinued these drugs or continued using other antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, evidence supporting the discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs on the day of surgery is lacking. However, anesthetists should be cautious about the possibility of hypotension in patients chronically receiving ACEIs/ARBs, and should know how to treat it effectively. To explore the long-term effects of continuing or discontinuing ACEIs/ARBs in patients, RCTs involving a large number of patients are required.

### Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide [^115S7wM4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The opposite effects of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium will approximately balance each other in many patients, so that no net effect upon serum potassium will be seen. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Initial and periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.

Chloride deficits are generally mild and require specific treatment only under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides. In a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy, pathological changes in the parathyroid gland have been observed, with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. More serious complications of hyperparathyroidism (renal lithiasis, bone resorption, and peptic ulceration) have not been seen.

Thiazides increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, and hypomagnesemia may result.

Other Metabolic Disturbances

Thiazide diuretics tend to reduce glucose tolerance and to raise serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and uric acid. These effects are usually minor, but frank gout or overt diabetes may be precipitated in susceptible patients.

Cough

Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.

Surgery/Anesthesia

In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension — surgical scheduling thresholds and perioperative beta-blocker/clonidine use specifies that in patients scheduled for elective major surgery with SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg, deferring surgery may be considered especially in high-risk patients to minimize perioperative complications. In patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, abrupt preoperative discontinuation of BB or clonidine may result in rebound hypertension and is potentially harmful. For patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, BB should not be started on the day of surgery in BB-naïve patients because of increased risk of postoperative mortality.

Step 2 treatment

If blood pressure is not controlled by Step 1 treatment, use a CCB in combination with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB.

If a CCB is not suitable for Step 2 treatment, for example because of oedema or intolerance, or if there is evidence of heart failure or a high risk of heart failure, offer a thiazide‐like diuretic.

For Black patients of African or Caribbean family origin, consider an ARB in preference to an ACE inhibitor, in combination with a CCB.

Step 3 treatment

Before considering Step 3 treatment, check that drugs from Step 2 have been prescribed at optimal doses, or at the maximum tolerated doses. If treatment with three drugs is required, the combination of ACE inhibitor or ARB, CCB and thiazide‐like diuretic should be used.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^115mohmS]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Diuretics are listed in hypertension guidelines as one of three equally weighted first-line treatment options. In order to differentiate between antihypertensives, a lot of discussion has been directed at side effect profiles and as a result, has created a perhaps disproportionate fear of the metabolic effects that can be associated with diuretics. Data, however, show that the risk of a clinically meaningful change in laboratory parameters is very low, whereas the benefits of volume control and natriuresis are high and the reductions in morbidity and mortality are clinically significant. Moreover, as clinically significant differences in safety and efficacy profiles exist among diuretics, several international guidelines have started making a distinction between thiazides (hydrochlorothiazide) and thiazide-like (chlorthalidone, indapamide) diuretics; and some of them now recommend longer acting thiazide-like diuretics. In time, pending more data, chlorthalidone and indapamide may need to be subdivided further into separate classifications.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115v7KAm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension management — beta blockers (BB) and clonidine: If well tolerated, BBs should be continued in patients receiving them for guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) indications, with continuation through hospitalization and at discharge unless contraindications arise. Abrupt withdrawal of long-term BB is harmful and should be avoided, and data are fewer on whether short-term (1 to 2 days) perioperative BB followed by rapid discontinuation is harmful. Special consideration is noted for patients taking clonidine or BB because stopping these medications acutely carries risk, and abrupt discontinuation of clonidine can cause rebound hypertension with norepinephrine surge. This guideline recommends against starting a BB on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients, particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and without plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events.

### Perindopril arginine and amlodipine besylate (Prestalia) [^111GTAmL]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

5.4 Hypotension

PRESTALIA can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume- or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting.

In patients at risk of excessive hypotension, start PRESTALIA therapy under close medical supervision. Follow patients closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of PRESTALIA is increased or a diuretic is added or its dose increased.

If excessive hypotension occurs, immediately place patient in a supine position and, if necessary, treat patient with an intravenous infusion of physiological saline. PRESTALIA treatment can usually be continued following restoration of volume and blood pressure.

Patients with severe aortic stenosis may be more likely to experience symptomatic hypotension. Because of the gradual onset of action, acute hypotension is unlikely.

Surgery/Anesthesia

In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, PRESTALIA may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.

5.5 Hyperkalemia

Elevations of serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including PRESTALIA. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of agents such as potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving PRESTALIA.

5.6 Cough

Presumably because of the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, generally resolving after discontinuation of therapy. Consider ACE inhibitor-induced cough in the differential diagnosis of cough.

5.7 Impaired Renal Function

Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving PRESTALIA. Drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system can cause reductions in renal function, including acute renal failure. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system — (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, severe heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) or who are on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) or angiotensin receptor blockers — may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on PRESTALIA. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on PRESTALIA.

### Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide [^115ZyWxP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Major Surgery

Avoid initiation of high-dose regimen of metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with cardiovascular risk factors undergoing non-cardiac surgery, since use in such patients has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, stroke and death.

Chronically administered beta adrenergic blockers should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.6 Masked Symptoms of Hypoglycemia

Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at anytime during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment.

5.7 Electrolyte and Metabolic Effects

Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets contains hydrochlorothiazide which can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which may be difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide reduces clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels.

5.8 Renal Impairment

Patients with chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion may be at increased risk for developing acute renal failure on drugs containing hydrochlorothiazide, including metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

5.9 Peripheral Vascular Disease

Beta-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease.

5.10 Pheochromocytoma

If metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.

5.11 Thyrotoxicosis

Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade may precipitate a thyroid storm.

### Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^112fTEBd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances

Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide

In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was < 1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide.

Coadministration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

5.6 Hepatic Impairment

Hydrochlorothiazide

Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad? [^116FAYZD]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Alpha blockers and nitric oxcide donors might be also considered as additional therapies in those uncontrolled with conventional therapies. Beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics should be used with caution; both may have unfavorable effects on glucose metabolism, and thiazide may worsen pre-existing hypokalemia. However, in selected cases, such as those patients with previous myocardial infarction, vasodilating beta-blockers (including carvedilol, labetalol, and nebivolol) may be considered, as benefits to improve cardiovascular risk related to myocardial infarction might outweigh other risks. A similar risk-benefit analysis can be applied to hydrochlorothiazide, which may be considered in those patients with kidney stones due to its effect in preventing cortisol-induced hypercalciuria.

Osteoporosis

Although recent guidelines differ in the precise indications for pharmacological intervention, in general, patients planning to start GC treatment for more than 3 months at any dose and who have experienced a prior fragility fracture should start bone protective therapy, regardless of age or GC dose. It is recommended that this should be initiated at the same time as GC treatment. Due to the reversibility of the effects of GC on bone, all current treatment guidelines suggest that bone protective therapy can be stopped after GC therapy is discontinued unless there is an additional prior indication. However, epidemiologic studies published after the guidelines were released suggest that there may be an increase in fracture risk that persists for up to 15 months after GC treatment has been stopped. Clinicians may therefore choose to continue therapy for another 3 to 6 months for lower cumulative exposures (less than 1 g. of prednisone equivalent cumulative dose) or longer periods (6–18 months after GC discontinuation) for higher cumulative exposures.

Perioperative hypertension — ACEi/ARB and RAAS inhibitor (RAASi) management: Observational data show patients who stopped their ACEi or ARB 24 hours before noncardiac surgery were less likely to have the composite of all-cause death, stroke, or myocardial injury and intraoperative hypotension versus those who continued, but POISE-3 randomized 7490 patients and did not find a significant difference between discontinuation and maintenance strategies during the operative and immediate perioperative periods. Omitted RAASi before surgery has been shown to reduce intraoperative hypotension, whereas randomized controlled trials have failed to prove continuation or implementation improves clinical outcomes.

### Discontinuation vs. continuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibition before non-cardiac surgery: the SPACE trial [^1142ZU9K]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment

For patients randomized to discontinue RAS inhibitors, the duration of cessation before surgery was defined by the pharmacokinetics of each drug (see Supplementary data online, Appendix for full protocol). For RAS inhibitors with a duration of action ≥ 24 h, the drug was discontinued 48 h prior to surgery. All other ACE-I and/or ARB were stopped on the morning of the day (i.e. 24–32 h) before surgery.

After randomization, participants received confirmation of which treatment group they have been allocated to and reminded of their randomized allocation by daily telephone call and/or text message, or in person if they were in hospital. Renin–angiotensin system inhibitors were restarted after surgery on the morning of post-operative day 2, in accord with recommendations by the ESC guidelines. Resumption or continuation of ACE-I and/or ARB did not involve dose modifications. Recommencing RAS inhibitors was delayed on post-operative day 2 if systolic blood pressure was < 90 mmHg in the preceding 12 h, vasoactive therapy was required to maintain blood pressure and/or if acute kidney injury [as defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria] had been sustained. The decision to restart ACE-I and/or ARB was confirmed by the principal investigator at each site. All other treatments (concomitant care) were administered according to usual peri-operative practice and were not influenced by trial-group allocation, in accord with recent ESC peri-operative guidelines.

Follow-up

Blood samples were collected before induction of anaesthesia and on the morning 24 and 48 h after surgery. Investigators reviewed the medical record of participants (paper or electronic) at 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery. To minimise bias, follow-up data were collected by a study team member who was masked to the treatment group allocation. The schedule of assessments is detailed in the protocol.

### Loop diuretics-analysis of efficacy data for the perioperative clinician [^117A8gVu]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

HEART FAILURE (HF) is one of the most common causes of hospitalization in the United States. Loop diuretics (LD) are the mainstay of treatment in the management of acute and chronic HF. Although they generally are effective in relieving symptoms and reducing congestion, LD have not been shown to significantly affect morbidity and mortality. The initial decongestion strategy for management of HF is likely to be an LD, with evidence suggesting that an initial "high-dose" strategy either by twice-daily bolus injection or by continuous infusion is likely to be more successful than an initial lower dose in respect to relief of symptoms but at the expense of increased worsening of renal function. This review focuses on the current state of evidence of different strategies related to the use of LD in the treatment of congestive symptoms in critically ill patients and presents a summary of the body of evidence regarding dosages, timing, and different diuretic agents.

### Postoperative acute kidney injury in adult non-cardiac surgery: joint consensus report of the Acute Disease Quality Initiative and Perioperative Quality Initiative [^113Q9kd9]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

Postoperative strategies

The early postoperative period has not been extensively studied in relation to kidney outcomes. However, therapeutic strategies used in the hours after surgery could likely modify the risk of AKI (Box 5). Clinically important postoperative hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg and requiring medical intervention) affects over 30% of patients, often goes uncorrected for longer than intraoperative hypotension and is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and myocardial injury. These findings suggest that maintenance of fluid and haemodynamic status in the early postoperative phase is important to avoid organ injuries including AKI. A trial that used stroke volume optimization and vasopressors to target a MAP within 10% of the preoperative baseline value during and for 4 h after surgery showed that this strategy was associated with a reduction in postoperative organ injury, but was not powered to assess kidney-specific outcomes. Further research is warranted to evaluate postoperative monitoring strategies and ideal clinical settings to reduce the risk of PO-AKI in moderate- to high-risk patients.

As postoperative hyperglycaemia is strongly associated with AKI, avoidance of perioperative hyperglycaemia (> 180 mg/dl) is recommended. Failure to restart chronic ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy that was suspended preoperatively is associated with increased 30-day mortality. However, the optimal time point to restart these medications has not been clearly established. Given their effects on the kidney, a reasonable approach would be to conduct a focused KHA before restarting ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Enhanced recovery after surgery pathways are typically multimodal, multidisciplinary interventions that have been promoted to facilitate recovery from surgery. Use of NSAIDs to minimize opiate analgesia requirements is a common component of such pathways, along with avoidance of markedly positive fluid balance. Accordingly, in some settings such as colorectal surgery, implementation of an enhanced recovery after surgery pathway could be associated with a higher, rather than lower, incidence of AKI.

Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment, except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis.

Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.

If progressive renal impairment becomes evident consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy.

Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.

Medication management — thiazide-type diuretics terminology and preference in resistant hypertension: Throughout this guideline, we use the term thiazide-type diuretic to collectively refer to HCTZ, chlorthalidone, and indapamide. In most settings, it is acceptable for clinicians to choose among these agents for treatment. In that setting, thiazide-like diuretics are preferred due to their greater efficacy; therefore, treatment recommendations in this setting continue to advocate thiazide-like diuretics.

Changes in kidney function during intercurrent illness

Regardless of whether patients are treated with RAAS inhibitors, changes in renal function are common during acute intercurrent illness; the incidence of AKI is between 7% and 18% of hospitalised patients. AKI is a powerful risk marker for poor outcome and is strongly associated with an increase in the risk of subsequent admission for heart failure. Renal function often does not to return to baseline level in survivors of AKI, especially in those with pre-existing CKD.

The incidence of AKI as defined by hospital coding is rising rapidly, which may reflect a genuine increase or simply greater awareness. Conditions associated with the development of AKI (such as diabetes and CKD) are also common indications for RAAS inhibitors and thus AKI in association with RAAS blockade is a common clinical scenario. However, it is not clear that ACEI/ARB therapy alone is associated with a substantially increased risk of AKI.

When AKI is associated with overt hypovolaemia, hypotension or sepsis, it is axiomatic that prompt correction of these abnormalities will improve outcome. However, the reflex inclusion of patients with HFrEF in treatment algorithms for AKI is dangerous. Administration of crystalloids to patients who are already fluid overloaded defies common sense. There is no good evidence that temporary cessation of RAAS therapy given for HFrEF during hospitalisation or perioperatively reduces rates of AKI. Among patients hospitalised with AKI, treatment with ACEI or ARB is associated with a lower risk of death.

In patients on a RAAS inhibitor, intercurrent illness commonly causes AKI, but there is no evidence that stopping the RAAS inhibitor is beneficial.
If a patient with HFrEF develops hyperkalaemia (table 2): Potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L, monitor closely, medication review and consider suspending RAAS inhibitor(s). Potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L, stop RAAS inhibitor(s).
If the patient with HFrEF has a rise in creatinine during intercurrent illness: By less than 30%, continue RAAS inhibitor(s) but monitor closely. Stop any other medication that may worsen renal function, including diuretic if clinically appropriate. If by ≥ 30%, RAAS inhibitor(s) should be stopped.
There must be robust arrangements to make certain that the reduced or stopped RAAS inhibitors prescribed for HFrEF are reintroduced and/or reuptitrated once the intercurrent illness is over.
