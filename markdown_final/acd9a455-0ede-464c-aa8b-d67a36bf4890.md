## Question

Tell me about the progression of liver disease following tylenol overdose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the progression of liver disease after acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and dose thresholds that initiate injury. Then, I should verify the classic clinical phases and their timing. Next, I will examine the laboratory trajectory and early risk predictors. After that, I need to assess prognostic factors and transplant criteria. Then, I will review management by phase, including N-acetylcysteine, decontamination, and supportive care. Finally, I should consider special scenarios like repeated supratherapeutic ingestion, pediatric patterns, and emerging biomarkers, and close with a concise timeline summary that ties these together.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic foundation and dose thresholds. Acetaminophen is a dose-dependent hepatotoxin. Ingestion exceeding 4 g in 24 hours or repeated excessive dosing over several days can cause acute pericentral (zone 3) hepatocellular necrosis, driven by NAPQI formation that depletes glutathione and causes mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, with risk amplified by fasting, malnutrition, chronic alcohol use, and enzyme inducers [^114svRWo] [^115Y2yEc] [^113Xe4a6] [^114QdLa3]. Wait, let me verify the single-dose threshold for ALF risk. Yes, single ingestions above roughly 10–15 g carry a meaningful risk of progression to acute liver failure, particularly without timely antidotal therapy [^1159x4gH] [^1139M4Yt].

> I will now examine the classic phase-based clinical course to anchor the timeline. Stage I, within the first 24 hours, typically presents with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and malaise, while liver tests may be normal or only mildly abnormal, so patients can appear deceptively well early on [^114VepHx] [^114VVf2C]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the absence of early liver test abnormalities does not exclude significant injury, so clinical suspicion must remain high if the history suggests overdose [^114VepHx].

> Next, I should review Stage II, roughly 24–72 hours, when biochemical injury declares itself. Aminotransferases rise rapidly, often exceeding 1000 IU/L within 24–48 hours, with AST and ALT increasing in tandem and frequently peaking by 72–96 hours. Bilirubin may remain relatively low early, and coagulopathy begins to emerge as INR prolongs, reflecting declining synthetic function [^1159x4gH] [^1119ttsh] [^111xu8XH]. Wait, I should double-check the AST:ALT relationship. In most cases the ratio approximates 1:1, but in the sickest patients, AST may exceed ALT, which can portend worse outcomes and should heighten vigilance [^1119suUH].

> I need to ensure I capture Stage III, approximately 72–96 hours, when injury peaks and complications dominate. This is the window of maximal hepatocellular necrosis, with very high transaminases, rising bilirubin, worsening coagulopathy, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, and multiorgan dysfunction. Hepatic encephalopathy may appear, and mortality is highest in this phase if liver failure is established [^1159x4gH] [^1139M4Yt] [^114VepHx]. Hold on, I should verify the prognostic triad; yes, the severity of encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and acidosis are the principal determinants of prognosis in acetaminophen-related ALF [^111NkAHy].

> Let me consider Stage IV, beyond 96 hours, the recovery phase. If the patient survives the peak injury window, transaminases decline, bilirubin and INR gradually improve, and clinical status stabilizes. Most survivors recover fully within about a week, consistent with the liver's robust regenerative capacity when regeneration is not impaired by overwhelming injury [^114VVf2C] [^115bjvYY]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm that this full recovery trajectory assumes no irreversible complications; indeed, recovery is contingent on adequate hepatocyte proliferation and absence of catastrophic cerebral edema or sepsis [^115bjvYY].

> Next, I should review early laboratory predictors and risk stratification. Very high aminotransferases, often above 3000 IU/L, with relatively modest hyperbilirubinemia early on, are characteristic. A rapidly rising ALT/AST and a prolonged INR are worrisome, and the APAP × aminotransferase multiplication product at presentation can help identify high-risk patients when the time of ingestion is uncertain [^1159x4gH] [^115e6XSe]. I should confirm the role of novel biomarkers; miR-122, HMGB1, and K18 show promise for earlier detection of injury even when ALT is normal, though they are not yet standard of care in most centers [^11758Zst] [^112jQ6xC].

> I will now examine prognostic factors and transplant decision tools. The King's College Criteria remain widely used: arterial pH less than 7.3 after resuscitation, or the combination of grade III–IV encephalopathy with INR greater than 6.5 and creatinine greater than 3.4 mg/dL indicate poor prognosis and warrant urgent transplant referral. MELD and ALFSG indices also inform prognosis, but clinical judgment and trajectory matter [^115ZRf2w] [^116Born2]. Hold on, I should verify outcomes; in established ALF, roughly one-third die or require transplantation, while the remainder recover spontaneously with supportive care, and transplant-free survival can approach 60–70% even in severe cases when managed expertly [^114VVf2C] [^117QAecK].

> Let me first confirm the management in the earliest window. If presentation is within 4 hours of a single-time ingestion, activated charcoal at 1 g/kg (max 50 g) reduces absorption. Beyond 4 hours, benefit wanes, but charcoal may still be reasonable if there is suspected delayed absorption or concretions, and it can be paired with NAC without loss of efficacy [^117MejwK] [^111xu8XH]. I should double-check that this applies to single-time ingestion; yes, for repeated supratherapeutic ingestion, routine charcoal is usually not helpful [^111xu8XH].

> Next, I should review N-acetylcysteine, the cornerstone antidote. Administered within 12 hours, NAC virtually assures minimal liver damage. After 12 hours, NAC is still recommended because it replenishes glutathione, mitigates ongoing oxidative stress, and may enhance regeneration, though efficacy diminishes with delay [^116W4XeM] [^112fA4RV] [^114VVf2C]. Wait, let me verify dosing. Standard IV regimens use a 150 mg/kg load over 15–60 minutes, followed by 50 mg/kg over 4 hours, then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours, with continuation until INR is less than 2 and ALT is clearly declining. Oral regimens use 140 mg/kg load then 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for 17 doses, often extended if injury is evolving [^111xu8XH].

> I need to ensure supportive care and transplant coordination are addressed. All patients with coagulopathy, encephalopathy, or rising INR require ICU-level care with close monitoring of glucose, acid–base status, renal function, and intracranial pressure; early transfer to a transplant-capable center is essential when King's criteria are met or when clinical deterioration persists despite NAC [^1159x4gH] [^113teeJ8]. Hold on, I should verify that transplant outcomes in ALF are acceptable; while early post-transplant mortality is higher than in chronic disease, long-term survival can surpass non-transplanted survivors, reinforcing timely referral [^113teeJ8].

> But wait, what if the ingestion was unintentional over several days rather than a single large dose. Repeated supratherapeutic ingestion (RSTI) often presents later, with undetectable acetaminophen levels and a less reliable nomogram; in these cases, diagnosis rests on history, pattern of hepatocellular injury, and exclusion of alternatives, and NAC should be started empirically when liver injury is present or strongly suspected [^111xu8XH] [^113Xe4a6]. I should confirm that APAP–protein adducts can help in this scenario; they are promising but not widely available commercially, limiting routine use [^111xu8XH].

> Let me consider pediatric nuances. In children, unintentional overdoses are common due to dosing errors, and the same phase-based progression applies, though encephalopathy may be less prominent early; pediatric-specific critical care and transplant protocols should be engaged early when ALF is suspected [^114VepHx]. I should double-check that NAC safety and efficacy are comparable in pediatrics; yes, weight-based IV or oral regimens are standard, with outcomes generally favorable when treated promptly [^114VepHx].

> Next, I should review emerging strategies and biomarkers. Circulating CYP-generated acetaminophen metabolites and their balance with sulfation products can stratify risk at presentation and may refine NAC decisions or identify candidates for adjuncts like fomepizole in research settings; mechanistic biomarkers such as miR-122, HMGB1, and K18 offer earlier injury signals than ALT and are under active validation [^111RQ4Zo] [^11758Zst]. Hold on, I should verify translational repair strategies; alternatively activated macrophage infusions and bile acid pathway modulation show promise in preclinical models for enhancing regeneration, but these remain investigational [^115aa3st] [^117GZ5dS].

> Finally, I will synthesize the timeline to ensure internal consistency. Within 0–24 hours, patients may be minimally symptomatic with normal or near-normal labs. 24–72 hours bring explosive transaminase rises and early coagulopathy. 72–96 hours represent peak injury with encephalopathy, acidosis, renal failure, and highest mortality. Beyond 96 hours, survivors enter recovery with falling aminotransferases and improving synthetic function, often completing biochemical recovery within 7 days if regeneration is adequate [^114VepHx] [^1159x4gH] [^114VVf2C]. I should confirm that this timeline aligns with guideline descriptions. Yes, major society guidance consistently maps this phase-based course and underscores the narrow window for NAC to alter trajectory [^113Xe4a6].

Tylenol (acetaminophen) overdose causes **dose-dependent hepatotoxicity** [^114svRWo] via NAPQI, which depletes glutathione and triggers mitochondrial injury, necrosis, and acute liver failure (ALF) [^115pXaAj]. Progression is **phased**: Stage 1 (0–24 h) — nausea/vomiting with normal or mildly elevated LFTs; Stage 2 (24–72 h) — RUQ pain, rapidly rising ALT/AST (often > 1,000 IU/L), and early coagulopathy; Stage 3 (72–96 h) — peak hepatocellular injury with jaundice, encephalopathy, renal failure, and high mortality; Stage 4 (> 96 h) — recovery with falling transaminases and improving liver function if the patient survives [^114VepHx] [^114VVf2C]. Early N-acetylcysteine (within 8–10 h) **prevents ALF** [^116W4XeM]; delayed therapy reduces efficacy, and severe cases may require transplant [^1134x8QL].

## Pathophysiology of acetaminophen-induced liver injury

Acetaminophen is metabolized mainly by glucuronidation and sulfation; a small fraction is converted by CYP2E1 to **NAPQI**, which is normally detoxified by glutathione. Overdose depletes glutathione, allowing NAPQI to bind hepatocyte proteins, causing mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and necrosis [^115pXaAj].

---

## Clinical progression of liver disease following acetaminophen overdose

The clinical course is **characteristically phased** [^114VepHx]:

| **Stage** | **Timeframe** | **Clinical features** | **Laboratory findings** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Stage 1 | 0–24 hours | - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Malaise <br/> - Often minimal or no symptoms | - Normal or mildly elevated LFTs <br/> - Normal INR |
| Stage 2 | 24–72 hours | - Right upper quadrant pain <br/> - Hepatomegaly <br/> - Continued nausea/vomiting | - Rapidly rising ALT/AST (often > 1,000 IU/L) <br/> - INR begins to rise |
| Stage 3 | 72–96 hours | - Jaundice <br/> - Hepatic encephalopathy <br/> - Coagulopathy <br/> - Renal failure <br/> - Metabolic acidosis <br/> - Highest mortality | - Peak ALT/AST (often > 3,000 IU/L) <br/> - INR > 2.0 <br/> - Elevated bilirubin <br/> - Creatinine rise |
| Stage 4 | > 96 hours | - Clinical improvement <br/> - Resolution of encephalopathy <br/> - Recovering liver function | - Declining ALT/AST <br/> - Improving INR <br/> - Improving bilirubin |

---

## Factors influencing severity and progression

Several factors influence **severity and progression**:

- **Dose and timing**: Single ingestions > 10–15 g or > 4 g/day over several days increase risk; early NAC is protective [^1159x4gH] [^116W4XeM].
- **Alcohol use**: Chronic alcohol use induces CYP2E1, increasing NAPQI and risk of hepatotoxicity [^114QdLa3].
- **Nutritional status**: Malnutrition/fasting depletes glutathione and increases risk [^114QdLa3].
- **Genetic factors**: CYP2E1 and glutathione pathway variants may increase susceptibility [^notfound].
- **Comorbidities**: Pre-existing liver disease increases severity risk [^117Tv9ti].

---

## Management and prognosis

- **Early NAC**: Administered within 8–10 hours, NAC nearly prevents ALF; efficacy declines with delay but remains beneficial [^116W4XeM] [^1134x8QL].
- **Supportive care**: ICU management of encephalopathy, coagulopathy, renal failure, and metabolic derangements is essential [^112wWBej].
- **Liver transplantation**: Consider for severe ALF with encephalopathy, INR > 2.0, or metabolic acidosis; King's College and MELD criteria guide decisions [^1134x8QL] [^116Born2].
- **Prognosis**: Early NAC yields high survival; late presenters have higher mortality and transplant needs [^114VVf2C] [^115V2w5t].

---

## Long-term sequelae

Most patients recover fully, but **severe injury** can lead to chronic liver disease, and ALF survivors may have persistent neurocognitive deficits.

---

Tylenol overdose causes predictable, **phase-based liver injury** driven by NAPQI; **early NAC is critical**, and severe cases may require transplant.

### Acetaminophen and acetylcysteine dose and duration: past, present and future [^113pTZsz]. Clinical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Acetylcysteine has been utilized successfully in the treatment of acetaminophen overdose since the 1970s. Although prospective trials as to efficacy and safety of acetylcysteine were conducted, there were no randomized controlled trials. This commentary addresses the reasons for this, and the background to choice of dose of acetylcysteine utilized in the oral and IV dosing regimens. Nomograms to predict possible hepatotoxicity based upon time of ingestion of acetaminophen were developed from a relatively arbitrary definition of toxicity as an aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (ALT/AST) greater than 1000 IU/L. While these have proved generally useful, patients still continue to develop hepatic damage after acetaminophen overdose, particularly if they present late after ingestion. The optimum management of these patients remains unclear, and one area of uncertainty is the dose and duration of acetylcysteine in various circumstances. This article discusses the issues that need to be elucidated to better target changes in acetylcysteine dose. The potential for measurements of other markers to improve treatment selection is the subject of further research.

Introduction

Acute liver failure is a rare, life-threatening disease characterized by acute liver dysfunction in patients who have no previous history of underlying liver disease. It is a rapidly progressive disorder with a reported incidence of around 2000–3000 cases per year in the US, with mortality as high as 30%. The term was originally used by Trey and Davidson in the 1970s. The International Association for the Study of the Liver further classifies liver failure into hyperacute liver failure, occurring within 10 days of the inciting event, fulminant, occurring within 10–30 days, and subacute hepatic failure, occurring within 5–24 weeks.

Acetaminophen remains the most common etiology of acute liver failure in the US, followed by other drug-induced liver injury and hepatitis B virus. Medical management usually involves supportive measures that depend on the underlying etiology. Liver transplant remains the only effective treatment, but given the limited number of organs available, other treatment modalities have been sought.

### Acute liver failure: summary of a workshop [^114ExZUk]. Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare but challenging clinical syndrome with multiple causes; a specific etiology cannot be identified in 15% of adult and 50% of pediatric cases. The course of ALF is variable and the mortality rate is high. Liver transplantation is the only therapy of proven benefit, but the rapidity of progression and the variable course of ALF limit its use. Currently in the United States, spontaneous survival occurs in approximately 45%, liver transplantation in 25%, and death without transplantation in 30% of adults with ALF. Higher rates of spontaneous recovery (56%) and transplantation (31%) with lower rates of death (13%) occur in children. The outcome of ALF varies by etiology, favorable prognoses being found with acetaminophen overdose, hepatitis A, and ischemia (approximately 60% spontaneous survival), and poor prognoses with drug-induced ALF, hepatitis B, and indeterminate cases (approximately 25% spontaneous survival). Excellent intensive care is critical in management of patients with ALF. Nonspecific therapies are of unproven benefit. Future possible therapeutic approaches include N-acetylcysteine, hypothermia, liver assist devices, and hepatocyte transplantation. Advances in stem cell research may allow provision of cells for bioartificial liver support. ALF presents many challenging opportunities in both clinical and basic research.

Cardio respiratory evaluation

Figures 3a and 3b demonstrate that injured pigs (as opposed to uninjured pigs) developed the typical haemodynamic pattern of acute liver injury characterised by arterial hypotension (40.8 ± 5.9 vs 59 ± 2.0 mmHg, p = 0.16) (MAP, mean arterial pressure), increased cardiac output (CO) (7.26 ± 1.86 vs 3.30 ± 0.40 l/min, p = 0.01) and decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (8.48 ± 2.75 vs 16.2 ± 1.76 mPa·s/m 3, p = 0.03) that was unresponsive to fluid infused in an attempt to maintain normal pulmonary arterial occlusion pressures (PAOP) (figure 4). Positive pressure lung ventilation was associated with a reduction in total compliance as injury progressed and the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (636 ± 95 vs 301 ± 26.9 mPa·s/m 3, p < 0.01) increased in this group (figure 4). This may have indicated the onset of an adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like picture.

Figure 3
Profile of Pulse, Mean Arterial pressure, Cardiac Output and Systemic Vascular Resistance in control and acetaminophen injured pigs. Chart A demonstrates a progressive increase in pulse and concomitant reduction in MAP following liver injury. Furthermore, chart B demonstrates a marked increase in cardiac output (CO) and decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) following liver injury. These haemodynamic changes are in keeping with the multi-organ failure seen in acute liver injury.

Figure 4
Profile of Pulmonary Artery Occlusion Pressure and Pulmonary Vascular Resistance in control and acetaminophen injured pigs. Fluid resuscitation was guided by Pulmonary Artery Occlusion Pressure (PAOP), and therefore this was similar between the two groups. Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR) became noticeably higher in the acetaminophen injured pigs. This was also seen in an increased ventilatory requirement in the latter stages of the injury experiments.

### Ethyl pyruvate reduces liver injury at early phase but impairs regeneration at late phase in acetaminophen overdose [^114kSo53]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Currently, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a glutathione precursor, is the antidote for APAP overdose. However, this antidotal therapy is effective for early-presenting patients and is less effective for late-presenting patients. Therefore, additional therapies are needed. In this study, EP therapy protected against liver injury at an early phase. However, at a late time point, even though there was a large number of infiltrating inflammatory cells, the anti-inflammation therapy with EP impaired hepatocyte regeneration. More investigations are needed to reevaluate the role of inflammation in APAP hepatotoxicity.

### Prolonged treatment with N-acetylcystine delays liver recovery from acetaminophen hepatotoxicity [^111ZjTMr]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the US and Europe; however, the underlying mechanisms of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity are still not completely understood. The toxic response to APAP is triggered by a highly reactive metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which reacts with and depletes glutathione (GSH), after which it forms covalent adducts and initiates mitochondrial oxidative stress. This increases the membrane permeability transition and causes the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, which results in a diminished mitochondrial capacity to synthesize ATP, and ATP depletion leads to cell death. Massive necrosis of the hepatocyte is a characteristic feature of APAP-induced acute lung injury (ALI).

Liver regeneration is a vital process for survival after a toxic insult. Regeneration ensures the replacement of necrotic cells and the full recovery of organ function. As hepatocytes are mostly in a quiescent state (G 0), the regeneration process requires entry into the highly regulated cell cycle. The induction of cyclin D1 is the most reliable marker for cell cycle (G 1 phase) progression in hepatocytes. Once hepatocytes express cyclin D1, they have passed the G 1 restriction point and are committed to DNA replication.

### The platelet receptor CLEC-2 blocks neutrophil mediated hepatic recovery in acetaminophen induced acute liver failure [^115pXaAj]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Toxic liver injury exemplified by acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in Europe and North America; it is responsible for more cases of ALF than all other aetiologies combined. Acute liver failure has a high mortality rateand accounts for 10% of all liver transplants in the UK. Although N -acetyl cysteine (NAC) can prevent liver injury if given in time, once liver failure is established the only treatment other than transplantation is supportive. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for effective and specific treatments to reduce or reverse acute toxic liver injury.

Hepatic injury in APAP overdose-induced acute liver failure in humans follows a characteristic pattern with biochemical signs of liver damage becoming apparent at 24–48 h, and hepatocyte death peaking at around 72 h. In severe injury, this results in fulminant liver failure necessitating superurgent liver transplantation. Murine APAP toxicity closely mimics the human response and is a valuable model for preclinical studies investigating toxic liver damage. APAP in both humans and mice is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoforms into the alkylating metabolite N -acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Excess NAPQI formation in APAP overdose, overwhelms the livers antioxidant glutathione (GSH) reserves. This allows excess NAPQI to bind mitochondrial proteins, forming cytotoxic adductsthat drive severe mitochondrial dysfunction and extensive hepatocellular necrosis. Another agent extensively studied in the context of acute toxic murine liver injury is carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4), which is also metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes into reactive intermediates. These radicals cause hepatocyte membrane lipid peroxidation and extensive hepatocellular necrosis leading to liver failure.

Clinical outcomes

Acute liver injury was defined as a peak ALT > 1,000 U/L (hepatotoxicity). We also examined a peak ALT > 100 U/L (the UK criteria for the use of additional acetylcysteine beyond the standard 20–21‐hour course). ALT is a continuous measure, however, these dichotomous outcomes were chosen as they are commonly utilized clinically and in research. We also recorded complications, such as coagulopathy (defined as an international normalized ratio (INR) > 2.0), severe acute kidney injury (AKIN classification stage 3: serum creatinine rise of ≥ 3× baseline or a rise of ≥ 1.5 baseline to > 354 μmol/L, a urine output < 0.3 mL/kg/h for ≥ 24 hours, or anuria for ≥ 12 hours), liver transplant, and death.

### Drug-induced liver injury: advances in mechanistic understanding that will inform risk management [^112dTc6b]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major public health problem. Intrinsic (dose-dependent) DILI associated with acetaminophen overdose is the number one cause of acute liver failure in the US. However, the most problematic type of DILI impacting drug development is idiosyncratic, occurring only very rarely among treated patients and often only after several weeks or months of treatment with the offending drug. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of DILI suggest that three mechanisms may underlie most hepatocyte effects in response to both intrinsic and idiosyncratic DILI drugs: mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and alterations in bile acid homeostasis. However, in some cases hepatocyte stress promotes an immune response that results in clinically important idiosyncratic DILI. This review discusses recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of both intrinsic and idiosyncratic DILI as well as emerging tools and techniques that will likely improve DILI risk identification and management.

### Evaluation for liver transplantation in adults: 2013 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^113teeJ8]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) — with onset of hepatic encephalopathy within 8 weeks of initial symptoms of liver disease — carries distinct transplant considerations; transplant outcomes for ALF are generally worse in the first postoperative year compared to chronic liver disease recipients, whereas beyond 1 year they surpass survivors for liver transplantation (LT), and intractable cerebral edema with cerebral perfusion pressure < 40 mmHg for more than 2 hours and other evidence of medical instability are contraindications to LT; recommendations state that 40. Patients with ALF require immediate referral to a liver transplant center (1-A), and 41. Patients with acetaminophen overdose should be evaluated for and meet reasonable expectations for adherence to medical directives and mental health stability as determined by the psychosocial evaluation (1-A).

### Prolonged N-acetylcysteine therapy in late acetaminophen poisoning associated with acute liver failure – a need to be more cautious? [^113iaGka]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Since the 1970s, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has shown proven efficacy as an antidote for acetaminophen (APAP) poisoning and APAP-induced liver failure for early presenters. The current evidence of benefits of NAC for late presenters is controversial because of the poor understanding of the mechanism of late toxicity. In the previous issue of Critical Care, Yang and colleagues use a mouse model to demonstrate that NAC in doses similar to those used therapeutically to treat APAP poisoning in humans impairs liver regenerative capacity and that the effect is more pronounced when administered for a longer duration. Studies based on cell cultures support this evidence. Cytokine and growth factor signalling pathways are recognised to be involved in the process of liver regeneration and apoptosis. This research paper generates several issues related to the future management of APAP-induced liver failure and research into the mechanism of toxicity, especially of late toxicity.

### Acetaminophen poisoning: an update for the intensivist [^115hWXga]. Critical Care (2002). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen overdose is common and can result from deliberate/nonstaggered or accidental/staggered ingestion. Patients presenting within 24 h of an acetaminophen overdose can safely be managed on medical wards. Early management of nonstaggered overdose is guided by the plasma acetaminophen concentration, whereas management of accidental/staggered ingestion is guided by ingested dose. Ingested dose and time from ingestion to presentation are important prognostic factors in accidental/staggered ingestion. Acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure (ALF) requires meticulous supportive care in an intensive care unit (ICU), with early identification and transfer of patients who are likely to require liver transplantation to a specialist liver centre. The modified King's College Hospital criteria (incorporating lactate into the traditional criteria) represent the best tool for identifying patients who require transplantation.

Guidance statements — APAP is a dose-dependent hepatotoxin that leads to acute pericentral liver injury when doses exceeding 4 g are ingested within a 24-h period or excessive doses over several days; APAP overdose is the leading cause of ALF; a diagnosis of APAP hepatotoxicity relies on a history of excessive APAP ingestion, detection of an elevated serum APAP level following single-time-point ingestion, and exclusion of competing causes of acute hepatocellular liver injury; gastric lavage and activated charcoal should be given to all patients presenting within 4 h of a single-time-point APAP overdose; intravenous or orally administered N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can prevent liver injury nearly completely if given within 12 h of ingestion, but is also recommended for patients presenting later; the prognosis in APAP-related ALF is related to the degree of encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and acidosis.

Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose — diagnosis and initial laboratory assessment is based on a history of ingestion of excessive doses (usually > 4 g as a single time point) with towering transaminase levels (often > 1000 IU/L) within the first 24 h of observation, and measurement of a serum APAP level after a single-time-point ingestion can help identify patients at greatest risk of developing liver injury.

### Circulating acetaminophen metabolites are toxicokinetic biomarkers of acute liver injury [^112fxmUF]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Our data are from an early‐phase discovery study that only included patients treated with NAC (because they had serial blood tests). Future work will include those patients deemed not to require treatment after overdose based on interpretation of the currently used biomarkers. In this study we interpreted the APAP metabolite data at first presentation without regard for time from ingestion. In the future, nomograms may be developed that are analogous to the APAP treatment lines. The increase in ALT used to define our primary outcome of ALI (50% rise) was modest. This was chosen by the SNAP trialists before this randomized clinical trial started and so was also used in this follow‐up biomarker discovery study. The incidence of larger increases in ALT (such as > 1,000 U/L) was too low in both our discovery and validation cohorts for robust analysis. Therefore, future studies will be needed to define the relationship between CYP metabolites and more severe injury.

In summary, circulating APAP metabolites formed by CYP enzymes are toxicokinetic biomarkers that stratify patients by their risk of subsequent ALI prior to starting NAC. With development, there is the potential for enhanced patient identification for entry into clinical trials of novel treatment pathways and refined clinical decision‐making.

Mechanisms of liver regeneration

The liver has a remarkable regenerative capacity after injury. Many studies have shown that a compensatory regenerative response is stimulated following liver injury that plays a decisive role in the final outcome. Most studies on liver regeneration rely on DILI models involving systemic exposure to hepatotoxicants such as carbon tetrachloride, thioacetamide, or APAP. Timely stimulation of liver regeneration in proportion to the liver injury is the most critical determinant of survival after ALF. Following the initial phase of liver cell death and tissue injury, the regeneration and recovery phase occurs, where if a prompt compensatory liver regeneration is stimulated, liver mass and function recovers; however, if regeneration is delayed, ALF ensues. The regeneration and recovery phase is therapeutically important, because medical care is most often started after the initial tissue injury phase has already occurred.

Liver regeneration following toxicant-induced ALI is dose dependent. Thus, a moderate overdose and moderate injury results in proportional liver regeneration, leading to complete recovery. However, after severe overdoses, regeneration is inhibited, resulting in expansion of injury, liver failure, and death (Figure 5). Using the APAP overdose model, recent studies have identified several pathways involved in liver regeneration after ALI, including Wnt/β-catenin signaling, EGFR signaling, bile acids, TGFβ signaling, Hippo Kinase signaling, and DNA damage and repair system. In addition, infiltrating immune cells including macrophages and neutrophils are required for liver regeneration during ALF.

FIGURE 5
Mechanisms of liver regeneration and recovery after APAP overdose. Studies show that survival after APAP overdose depends on the extent of stimulation of the compensatory liver regeneration. Following moderate overdose, timely initiation of compensatory cell proliferation is driven by activation of pro-mitogenic signaling involving cytokines, growth factors, bile acids, and pathways such as Wnt/beta-catenin. This is further supported by timely GSH replenishment that mitigates the oxidative stress, improves mitochondrial health, and accelerates DNA repair, which is a key regulator of cell cycle progression. During severe overdose, these mechanisms are actively inhibited due to extensive oxidative stress and tremendous DNA damage, which inhibit cell cycle progression and induce cellular senescence. A 2-fold approach involving mitigation of oxidative and DNA damage along with supplementation of pro-mitogenic signals could be the key to successful regenerative therapies against APAP overdose. Abbreviations: APAP, acetaminophen; GSH, glutathione.

Future directions

Characterization of the mechanisms that ultimately promote or inhibit human liver regeneration in ALF is needed to identify which pathway is most important so that therapies that enhance regeneration can be developed.

### Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity-isn' T it time for APAP to go away? [^116Demib]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) is the most commonly used drug for the treatment of pain and fever around the world. At the same time, APAP can cause dose-related hepatocellular necrosis, responsible for nearly 500 deaths annually in the United States (US) alone, as well as 100,000 calls to US Poison Control Centers, 50,000 emergency room visits and 10,000 hospitalisations per year. As an over-the-counter and prescription product (with opioids), APAP toxicity dwarfs all other prescription drugs as a cause of acute liver failure in the US and Europe, but it is not regulated in any significant way. In this review the ongoing controversy surrounding the proper role for this ubiquitous pain reliever: its history, pathogenesis, clinical challenges in recognition and management, and current regulatory status are highlighted. A new solution to a 50-year-old problem is proposed.

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate [^112kV5WT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatotoxicity

Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products.

The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.

Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence].

Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.

Key messages

- Ethyl pyruvate (EP) treatment reduces liver injury at 24 hours after acetaminophen (APAP) challenge. This early protective effect is associated with decreased hepatic myeloperoxidase and a reduced number of infiltrating inflammatory cells.

- EP therapy impairs liver regeneration at 48 hours after APAP overdose. This effect is associated with reduced serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha and decreased cyclin D1 level.

### Mathematical modeling of liver injury and dysfunction after acetaminophen overdose: early discrimination between survival and death [^11273FKE]. Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Acetaminophen (APAP) is the leading cause of acute liver injury in the developed world. Timely administration of N-acetylcysteine (N-Ac) prevents the progression of serious liver injury and disease, whereas failure to administer N-Ac within a critical time frame allows disease progression and in the most severe cases may result in liver failure or death. In this situation, liver transplantation may be the only life-saving measure. Thus, the outcome of an APAP overdose depends on the size of the overdose and the time to first administration of N-Ac. We developed a system of differential equations to describe acute liver injury due to APAP overdose. The Model for Acetaminophen-induced Liver Damage (MALD) uses a patient's aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and international normalized ratio (INR) measurements on admission to estimate overdose amount, time elapsed since overdose, and outcome. The mathematical model was then tested on 53 patients from the University of Utah. With the addition of serum creatinine, eventual death was predicted with 100% sensitivity, 91% specificity, 67% positive predictive value (PPV), and 100% negative predictive value (NPV) in this retrospective study. Using only initial AST, ALT, and INR measurements, the model accurately predicted subsequent laboratory values for the majority of individual patients. This is the first dynamical rather than statistical approach to determine poor prognosis in patients with life-threatening liver disease due to APAP overdose.

Conclusion

MALD provides a method to estimate overdose amount, time elapsed since overdose, and outcome from patient laboratory values commonly available on admission in cases of acute liver failure due to APAP overdose and should be validated in multicenter prospective evaluation.

Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic, or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION; WARNINGS).

### Alternatively activated macrophages promote resolution of necrosis following acute liver injury [^117UTdUq]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen (paracetamol, APAP) overdose is a common cause of acute liver injury (ALI) in the clinic and is the leading cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in the United States. APAP also serves as a model hepatotoxin for preclinical studies and the molecular mechanisms that underpin APAP hepatotoxicity are relatively well understood. Therapeutic management of APAP-induced ALI (APAP-ALI) is primarily limited to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy, which serves as an effective antidote. However, NAC efficacy is substantially diminished in patients who present late after APAP ingestion (i.e. longer than 10 h). Liver transplantation may be required in patients who subsequently develop ALF. However, due to the shortages of suitable donor tissue, and associated life-long immunosuppression, liver transplantation is not an ideal therapeutic intervention. Therefore, novel therapies to prevent liver injury progressing to ALF are urgently sought.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^112v8aUY]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acetaminophen overdose:

- **Definition**: Acetaminophen overdose is defined as the ingestion of a dose of acetaminophen that exceeds the recommended limit, typically > 4 g within a 24-hour period or excessive doses over several days.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of acetaminophen overdose involves its action as a dose-dependent hepatotoxin, causing acute pericentral liver injury. Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver, and in overdose situations, its toxic metabolite can cause hepatocellular necrosis. In some cases, renal insufficiency can also occur, attributed to cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase isoenzymes present in the kidney.
- **Epidemiology**: In 2021, US poison control centers recorded over 80,000 cases related to acetaminophen products. The incidence of acetaminophen overdose in Iceland is estimated at 16 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of acetaminophen overdose can include symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, mental status changes. Hepatotoxicity is indicated by elevated liver enzymes, and in severe cases, it can lead to ALF, characterized by encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The severity of liver damage, as indicated by laboratory tests such as serum transaminases and coagulation profile, is a key determinant of prognosis. The prognosis in acetaminophen-related ALF is related to the degree of encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and acidosis.

### Ethyl pyruvate reduces liver injury at early phase but impairs regeneration at late phase in acetaminophen overdose [^114xvqmH]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity is the major cause of acute liver failure in the US and Europe. Massive necrosis of the hepatocyte is the feature of APAP-induced acute liver injury (ALI). Currently, the underlying mechanisms of APAP toxicity are still not clear, but inflammation is certainly involved in the pathogenesis of APAP hepatotoxicity. Neutrophils and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) have been shown to contribute to liver injury in APAP overdose, and pro-inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) has been shown to promote tissue damage. However, conflicting data are also reported: a significant reduction in neutrophil accumulation shows no protection against APAP toxicity, and TNF-α is shown to have a role in repair in APAP liver injury. It is also reported that Kupffer cell depletion confers protection at early time points after APAP treatment but can lead to a more severe injury at a later time point. These data suggest that there is a possibility that some inflammatory factors contribute to APAP liver injury at an early injurious phase but that these factors might also facilitate liver regeneration at a late phase.

Tissue repair is an important determinant of final outcome of toxicant-induced injury. Since hepatocytes are mostly in a quiescent state (G 0), pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are needed to prime hepatocytes. This process makes cells more responsive to growth factors. The exposure to hepatocyte growth factor results in the expression of cell cycle proteins. The induction of cyclin D1 is the most reliable marker for cell cycle (G 1 phase) progression in hepatocytes. Once hepatocytes express cyclin D1, they have passed the G 1 restriction point and are committed to DNA replication.

Ethyl pyruvate (EP) is a potent anti-inflammatory agent and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. EP can inhibit LPS-stimulated macrophages to release TNF-α and IL-6. EP also protects against liver injury in a couple of murine models such as acute alcoholic hepatitis, hemorrhagic shock, sepsis, acute extrahepatic obstruction, and acute necrotizing pancreatitis.

In light of this information, we hypothesize that inflammation might contribute to liver injury at an early injurious phase but facilitate liver regeneration at a late time point. We tested this hypothesis by using EP, a potent anti-inflammatory agent, to treat APAP overdose for 24 or 48 hours in a murine model.

### Advanced preclinical models for evaluation of drug-induced liver injury-consensus statement by the European drug-induced liver injury network [PRO-EURO-DILI-NET] [^112wL1Vz]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major cause of acute liver failure (ALF) and one of the leading indications for liver transplantation in Western societies. Given the wide use of both prescribed and over the counter drugs, DILI has become a major health issue for which there is a pressing need to find novel and effective therapies. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying DILI, our incomplete knowledge of its pathogenesis and inability to predict DILI is largely due to both discordance between human and animal DILI in preclinical drug development and a lack of models that faithfully recapitulate complex pathophysiological features of human DILI. This is exemplified by the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen (APAP) overdose, a major cause of ALF because of its extensive worldwide use as an analgesic. Despite intensive efforts utilising current animal and in vitro models, the mechanisms involved in the hepatotoxicity of APAP are still not fully understood. In this expert Consensus Statement, which is endorsed by the European Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network, we aim to facilitate and outline clinically impactful discoveries by detailing the requirements for more realistic human-based systems to assess hepatotoxicity and guide future drug safety testing. We present novel insights and discuss major players in APAP pathophysiology, and describe emerging in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical models, as well as advanced imaging and in silico technologies, which may improve prediction of clinical outcomes of DILI.

### Mechanistic biomarkers provide early and sensitive detection of acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury at first presentation to hospital [^11758Zst]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Acetaminophen overdose is a common reason for hospital admission and the most frequent cause of hepatotoxicity in the Western world. Early identification would facilitate patient-individualized treatment strategies. We investigated the potential of a panel of novel biomarkers (with enhanced liver expression or linked to the mechanisms of toxicity) to identify patients with acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury (ALI) at first presentation to the hospital when currently used markers are within the normal range. In the first hospital presentation plasma sample from patients (n = 129), we measured microRNA-122 (miR-122; high liver specificity), high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1; marker of necrosis), full-length and caspase-cleaved keratin-18 (K18; markers of necrosis and apoptosis), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH; marker of mitochondrial dysfunction). Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis and positive/negative predictive values were used to compare sensitivity to report liver injury versus alanine transaminase (ALT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR). In all patients, biomarkers at first presentation significantly correlated with peak ALT or INR. In patients presenting with normal ALT or INR, miR-122, HMGB1, and necrosis K18 identified the development of liver injury (n = 15) or not (n = 84) with a high degree of accuracy and significantly outperformed ALT, INR, and plasma acetaminophen concentration for the prediction of subsequent ALI (n = 11) compared with no ALI (n = 52) in patients presenting within 8 hours of overdose.

Conclusion

Elevations in plasma miR-122, HMGB1, and necrosis K18 identified subsequent ALI development in patients on admission to the hospital, soon after acetaminophen overdose, and in patients with ALTs in the normal range. The application of such a biomarker panel could improve the speed of clinical decision-making, both in the treatment of ALI and the design/execution of patient-individualized treatment strategies.

### Current management of acute liver failure [^116Ecf2C]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare but life-threatening systemic disorder. Survival rates with or without emergency liver transplantation (ELT) are increasing. The benefit of ELT in some cases has been questioned and the potential for survival with medical management alone is changing our approach to the management of this disease.

Recent Findings

Survival rates for all causes of ALF are increasing because of improvements in the care of the critically ill patient. A multifactorial approach involving support of respiratory, circulatory and renal function together with measures to avoid intracranial hypertension, metabolic disequilibrium and sepsis are required. For those who do not respond to these measures or specific antidotes, the selection methods for those likely to benefit from transplantation remain imperfect and novel methods based on the prediction of hepatic regeneration are required. For patients with ALF secondary to acetaminophen overdose, some experts believe a randomized controlled trial is required to find those most likely to benefit from ELT.

Summary

ALF remains a life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate requiring prompt support of multiorgan failure. Historical listing criteria for ELT are being questioned and improvement in medical management offers the option of continued improvements in transplant-free survival.

### Drug-induced liver injury: a comprehensive review [^115PXJvc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Management

Prompt discontinuation of the implicated drug remains the most important step to managing DILI. Cessation of the causative agent often leads to spontaneous recovery in days to weeks and does not require any further therapeutic interventions. Yet, the trajectory of clinical and biochemical resolution is not always predictable. Protraction of or deterioration in hepatic function despite cessation of the culprit drug can generate significant clinical uncertainty, leading to alternative causes being missed and appropriate therapy not being administered. Moreover, biochemical resolution of liver tests may not always connote clinical improvement, with decreasing ALT observed in patients with reducing hepatic reserve from liver necrosis. Active surveillance with frequent blood tests is critical for this patient cohort. Spontaneous recovery from paracetamol-induced ALF is observed in 65% of cases. In contrast, recovery from idiosyncratic drug-induced ALF is uncommon, with 27.1% of patients surviving longer than 3 weeks. Consequently, early involvement of a hepatologist and transfer to a gastroenterology ward are paramount to patient survival. With LT improving overall survival to 66%, any signs of ALF including coagulopathy [international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5], ascites and encephalopathy should prompt transfer to intensive care and urgent referral to a tertiary liver unit.

Two treatment approaches have been endorsed to manage patients who develop drug-induced ALF. One is through rapid depuration of the toxic drug to limit its absorption and dose-dependent hepatotoxic effects. Activated charcoal is widely used to treat drug overdoses such as paracetamol, phenobarbital and carbamazepine. – As its therapeutic benefit is restricted to within 3–4 h of acute ingestion of the toxin, the efficacy of depuration therapy is highly dependent on prompt admission of patients for assessment, recognition of potential DILI by physicians and healthcare resource availability. Consequently, depuration therapy is often limited to drugs that cause an intrinsic pattern of DILI and has shown to be of little benefit in idiosyncratic DILI and HILI. Previous uses of whole bowel irrigation and gastric lavage have largely been superseded by activated charcoal depuration but can sometimes be used in cases of acute poisoning with iron, lithium, sustained release tablets and body packing.

### When do the aminotransferases rise after acute acetaminophen overdose? [^1119ttsh]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Rising aminotransferases (ATs) [either aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are one of the first signs of hepatotoxicity following acetaminophen (APAP)] overdose (OD). However, the timing and speed of such rises are not well characterized, hampering early risk prediction.

Objective

To describe the kinetics of AT release in acute APAP OD patients who develop hepatotoxicity despite treatment.

Methods

A descriptive study of acute APAP OD patients with peak AT > 1,000 IU/L taken from the derivation subset of the Canadian Acetaminophen Overdose Study (CAOS), a large, multicenter retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized for APAP poisoning.

Results

Of 2,488 hospital admissions for acute APAP OD, 94 met inclusion criteria. Treatment with acetylcysteine, mostly intravenously, was begun in all cases within 24 h of ingestion. The initial AT concentration was already elevated in most patients at presentation [median 211 (IQR 77–511) IU/L obtained at 15.3 (12.1–19.2) h postingestion], and exceeded 100 IU/L in almost all patients within 24 h of ingestion. Serum AT concentrations rose rapidly [doubling time 9.5 h (95% CI: 8.7–10.4 h)], especially in patients who developed AT > 1,000 IU/L within 48 h of ingestion. Coagulopathy was worse in these patients and in those with an AT > 250 IU/L during the first 12 h of treatment with acetylcysteine.

Discussion and Conclusions

An abnormal and rapidly doubling AT at presentation is more typical in severely poisoned patients, as judged by the effects on clotting. These data suggest that risk prediction instruments may be improved by incorporating both the serum AT concentration at initiation of antidotal therapy and its rate of change. Further studies using such an approach are warranted.

### Ethyl pyruvate reduces liver injury at early phase but impairs regeneration at late phase in acetaminophen overdose [^117Sz1dp]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inflammation may critically affect mechanisms of liver injury in acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity. Kupffer cells (KC) play important roles in inflammation, and KC depletion confers protection at early time points after APAP treatment but can lead to more severe injury at a later time point. It is possible that some inflammatory factors might contribute to liver damage at an early injurious phase but facilitate liver regeneration at a late time point. Therefore, we tested this hypothesis by using ethyl pyruvate (EP), an anti-inflammatory agent, to treat APAP overdose for 24–48 hours.

Methods

C57BL/6 male mice were intraperitoneally injected with a single dose of APAP (350 mg/kg dissolved in 1 mL sterile saline). Following 2 hours of APAP challenge, the mice were given 0.5 mL EP (40 mg/kg) or saline treatment every 8 hours for a total of 24 or 48 hours.

Results

Twenty-four hours after APAP challenge, compared to the saline-treated group, EP treatment significantly lowered serum transaminases (ALT/AST) and reduced liver injury seen in histopathology; however, at the 48-hour time point, compared to the saline therapy, EP therapy impaired hepatocyte regeneration and increased serum AST; this late detrimental effect was associated with reduced serum TNF-α concentration and decreased expression of cell cycle protein cyclin D1, two important factors in liver regeneration.

Conclusions

Inflammation likely contributes to liver damage at an early injurious phase but improves hepatocyte regeneration at a late time point, and prolonged anti-inflammation therapy at a late phase is not beneficial.

### Acetaminophen metabolites on presentation following an acute acetaminophen overdose (ATOM-7) [^111RQ4Zo]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

In acute APAP poisonings, APAP‐Cys/APAP‐Sul detects those at risk of developing subsequent acute liver injury (defined as an increased serum ALT activity of 50% or more) with an AUC‐ROC 0.91 (0.83–0.98). We confirmed this association for hepatotoxicity with a similarly high AUC‐ROC. APAP‐Cys/APAP‐Sul reflects both an increase in APAP‐Cys production and/or a decrease in APAP‐Sul. These results may indicate it is the balance among glutathione depletion, CYP metabolism, and sulfation that is important. However, we found that a combination of markers performed even better to predict acute liver injury. These represent a combination of traditional liver biomarkers, APAP body load (e.g. APAP ratio), and APAP metabolites. APAP metabolites complement these traditional markers by offering potential refinement of risk stratification. This may help identify those patients who may benefit from newly proposed adjuvants to acetylcysteine, such as fomepizole.

Limitations of this study include its reliance on patient reporting of timing of ingestion and dose of APAP. However, generally, these aspects of clinical history are carefully recorded as they drive treatment decisions. Second, some patients had early initiation of acetylcysteine prior to the 4 hours APAP concentration on the treating doctor's discretion or local guidelines and the initial metabolites concentrations was post‐initiation of acetylcysteine. Acetylcysteine replenishes glutathione and is a substrate for sulfation. Hence, acetylcysteine treatment may increase sulfation and/or CYP metabolites in those who are glutathione and/or sulfate depleted. However, when these patients were excluded (Table S1) the results remained similar. Other limitations included the number of patients with hepatotoxicity and fulminant hepatic failure was low, particularly those with an initial ALT < 50 U/L who went on to develop acute liver injury. Hence, further studies with more patients are required to validate our findings and to determine if metabolites can aid in better prediction of outcomes, such as liver transplant or death. Some patients in this study with an initial non‐toxic patient's concentration did not have a repeat ALT at 24 hours. Although uncommon, some patients may have developed liver injury.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for drug-induced liver injury, more specifically with respect to patterns of injury, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- direct hepatotoxins, such as acetaminophen, can cause liver injury in nearly all exposed patients once a threshold dose or duration of use is exceeded

- indirect hepatotoxins are generally independent of the dose administered and have a variable latency and manifestations arising from the biological action of the drug on the liver and/or host immune system

- idiosyncratic DILI is largely independent of the dose and duration of medication use and characterized by a low incidence and variable drug latency and clinical and histological features, and is believed to arise from an aberrant adaptive host immune response to the drug and/or its metabolites.

### Acetaminophen and the U.S. acute liver failure study group: lowering the risks of hepatic failure [^112v5s5W]. Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen overdose is the leading cause for calls to Poison Control Centers (> 100,000/year) and accounts for more than 56,000 emergency room visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, and an estimated 458 deaths due to acute liver failure each year. Data from the U.S. Acute Liver Failure Study Group registry of more than 700 patients with acute liver failure across the United States implicates acetaminophen poisoning in nearly 50% of all acute liver failure in this country. Available in many single or combination products, acetaminophen produces more than 1 billion US dollars in annual sales for Tylenol products alone. It is heavily marketed for its safety compared to nonsteroidal analgesics. By enabling self-diagnosis and treatment of minor aches and pains, its benefits are said by the Food and Drug Administration to outweigh its risks. It still must be asked: Is this amount of injury and death really acceptable for an over-the-counter pain reliever?

### Functional compensation precedes recovery of tissue mass following acute liver injury [^1173aewE]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The liver is a vital organ with a wide array of functions, including homeostasis of glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism; production of bile; synthesis of critical serum proteins; and metabolism of endogenous and xenobiotic toxins. The liver experiences frequent toxic insults that can result in cellular injury and death. Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the most common cause of toxic liver injury in the United States. Another cause for acutely reduced liver function is surgical resection, often used to remove liver tumors or cancer metastases. Typically, any injury to the liver is followed by liver regeneration through cellular proliferation. While the process and signals involved in liver regeneration have been studied in great detail, it remains unclear how an organism can survive the period immediately following the loss of substantial functional liver tissue.

Hepatocytes are the major parenchymal cells of the liver and are organized into lobules with coordinated blood flow from the portal to the central vein. Within each lobule, hepatocyte gene expression is heterogenously structured, governed by metabolic demands and signaling pathways, supporting distinct hepatocellular functionality across the periportal, midlobular, and pericentral zones. The impact of either zone-specific injury or global loss of liver mass on gene expression in these different regions has not been examined.

Acetaminophen

If an acetaminophen overdose is suspected, obtain a serum acetaminophen assay as soon as possible, but no sooner than 4 hours following oral ingestion. Obtain liver function studies initially and repeat at 24-hour intervals. Administer the antidote N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as early as possible. As a guide to treatment of acute ingestion, the acetaminophen level can be plotted against time since oral ingestion on a nomogram Rumack-Matthew). The lower toxic line on the nomogram is equivalent to 150 mcg/mL at 4 hours and 37.5 mcg/mL at 12 hours. If serum level is above the lower line, administer the entire course of NAC treatment. Withhold NAC therapy if the acetaminophen level is below the lower line.

Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained immediately if the patient presents 4 hours or more after ingestion to assess potential risk of hepatotoxicity; acetaminophen levels drawn less than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading. To obtain the best possible outcome, NAC should be administered as soon as possible where impending or evolving liver injury is suspected. Intravenous NAC may be administered when circumstances preclude oral administration.

Vigorous supportive therapy is required in severe intoxication. Procedures to limit the continuing absorption of the drug must be readily performed since the hepatic injury is dose-dependent and occurs early in the course of intoxication.

APAP hepatotoxicity

APAP is used widely as a ubiquitous over‐the‐counter analgesic. In North America, APAP overdose is believed to result in 100,000 calls to poison control centers, 50,000 emergency room visits, and at least 500 deaths annually. The annual number of ALF cases from APAP dwarfs the number of ALF cases associated with all idiosyncratic reactions combined. The reason for this widespread toxicity is that, unlike drugs associated with idiosyncrasy, APAP is a dose‐related hepatotoxin, with all mammalian species susceptible to liver injury in doses only 2 to 3 times therapeutic dosing. Although APAP initially was noted to be a frequent cause of toxicity in attempts at self‐harm, increasing recognition of inapparent or unintentional overdosing has become apparent. Unintentional overdosing may occur in the setting of chronic pain or flu‐like symptoms because of the lack of awareness of dosing limitations and/or the simultaneous use of multiple APAP‐containing products. Other risk factors for APAP toxicity include fasting and malnutrition, which can lead to depletion of intrahepatic glutathione stores, as well as use of alcohol and other medications that can induce the cytochrome P‐450 system and lead to enhanced production of the toxic metabolite, N ‐acetyl‐p‐benzoquinone imine. Recent data suggest that APAP hepatotoxicity may occur even when therapeutic doses are used, but particularly in association with these other cofactors. Histologically, APAP toxicity is characterized by a variable degree of pericentral necrosis.

A diagnosis of APAP overdose is based on a history of ingestion of excessive doses (usually > 4 g as a single time point) that can then lead to variable severity of acute hepatocellular liver injury with towering transaminase levels (often > 1000 U/L) within the first 24 h of observation (Table 10). Measurement of a serum APAP level after a single‐time‐point ingestion can help identify the patients at greatest risk of developing liver injury. More recently, detection of serum APAP‐protein adducts has been proposed as a more specific way to diagnose APAP hepatotoxicity particularly in patients presenting late or with an unintentional overdose, but this assay is not commercially available.

Management of APAP overdose

After a single‐time‐point APAP overdose, symptoms of nausea and vomiting ensue within 12–24 h, peaking at about 72 h, and resolving rapidly thereafter. The severity of necrosis is linked to the extent of excess dosing and can lead to hyperacute ALF because of its rapid onset. Administration of oral or intravenous NAC is an effective antidote, given as a loading dose followed by maintenance doses over several days. If NAC is administered within 12 h of ingestion, it virtually assures that the liver damage will be minimal. The characteristic laboratory profile of APAP hepatotoxicity includes very high aminotransferase levels with low bilirubin. The coagulopathy can be severe, and a prolonged INR is a bad prognostic sign.

Management in the early hours after an APAP overdose includes activated charcoal by ingestion or gavage, and certainly NAC, even if given more than 12 h after APAP ingestion. For unintentional cases, NAC is also given, although its efficacy may be limited. Development of signs and symptoms of liver failure (encephalopathy, primarily) are concerning, and once they are present, nearly one‐third of patients either die or require a liver transplant. The remaining patients make a full and complete recovery within 7 days.

Prognosis

Several prognostic scores have been developed and evaluated including the King's College Hospital score, Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score, and the Acute Liver Failure Study Group prognostic index. In countries in which the over‐the‐counter sale of APAP has been restricted, the incidence of serious APAP toxicity has fallen. Outcomes have also generally improved over the past two decades, likely because of improvements in intensive care, with only 8% of patients undergoing transplantation.

### Toxin-induced hepatic injury [^116pzEj1]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Toxins such as pharmaceuticals, herbals, foods, and supplements may lead to hepatic damage. This damage may range from nonspecific symptoms in the setting of liver test abnormalities to acute hepatic failure. The majority of severe cases of toxin-induced hepatic injury are caused by acetaminophen and ethanol. The most important step in the patient evaluation is to gather an extensive history that includes toxin exposure and exclude common causes of liver dysfunction. Patients whose hepatic dysfunction progresses to acute liver failure may benefit from transfer to a transplant service for further management. Currently, the mainstay in management for most exposures is discontinuing the offending agent. This manuscript will review the incidence, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of the different forms of toxin-induced hepatic injury and exam in-depth the most common hepatic toxins.

### Role of bile acids in liver injury and regeneration following acetaminophen overdose [^117GZ5dS]. The American Journal of Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Bile acids play a critical role in liver injury and regeneration, but their role in acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury is not known. We tested the effect of bile acid modulation on APAP hepatotoxicity using C57BL/6 mice, which were fed a normal diet, a 2% cholestyramine (CSA)-containing diet for bile acid depletion, or a 0.2% cholic acid (CA)-containing diet for 1 week before treatment with 400 mg/kg APAP. CSA-mediated bile acid depletion resulted in significantly higher liver injury and delayed regeneration after APAP treatment. In contrast, 0.2% CA supplementation in the diet resulted in a moderate delay in progression of liver injury and significantly higher liver regeneration after APAP treatment. Either CSA-mediated bile acid depletion or CA supplementation did not affect hepatic CYP2E1 levels or glutathione depletion after APAP treatment. CSA-fed mice exhibited significantly higher activation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinases and a significant decrease in intestinal fibroblast growth factor 15 mRNA after APAP treatment. In contrast, mice fed a 0.2% CA diet had significantly lower c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase activation and 12-fold higher fibroblast growth factor 15 mRNA in the intestines. Liver regeneration after APAP treatment was significantly faster in CA diet-fed mice after APAP administration secondary to rapid cyclin D1 induction. Taken together, these data indicate that bile acids play a critical role in both initiation and recovery of APAP-induced liver injury.

ETIOLOGY AND PROGNOSIS

All patients with ALF should undergo a rapid and comprehensive diagnostic evaluation at presentation because the etiology of ALF has both therapeutic and prognostic implications (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Recommended evaluation and treatment of adults with ALF

Acetaminophen

Each year there are > 60,000 instances of acetaminophen (APAP) overdose in the United States and nearly 500 individuals who progress to ALF despite NAC treatment. APAP overdose accounts for nearly 50% of all adult ALF cases and up to 20% of pediatric ALF cases (predominantly in teenagers; Figure 1). Some patients intentionally ingest a large single dose of APAP, typically > 4–6 g, as a suicide gesture, while others may unintentionally overdose on APAP containing narcotic congeners or over‐the‐counter products in the setting of an acute illness or chronic pain over several days. Cofactors for inadvertent APAP hepatotoxicity are increased hepatic oxidative metabolism due to chronic alcohol use and poor nutrition as well as fasting that can deplete intrahepatic glutathione stores. Initial serum APAP drug levels are useful for risk stratification with single‐time‐point ingestions (i.e. Rumack nomogram) but often are low or undetectable in individuals with unintentional overdose.

FIGURE 1
The most common causes of ALF in adult Americans. Among 2718 adults enrolled into the US multicenter ALFSG registry, APAP overdose was the most common etiology of ALF followed by idiosyncratic DILI, AIH, HBV, and indeterminate ALF

At presentation, most patients with APAP overdose have markedly elevated serum aminotransferases, a variably elevated INR, and normal or minimally elevated total bilirubin level. Lactic acidosis, acute kidney injury, hypoglycemia, and cerebral edema may develop over the first 72 h. Transplantation‐free survival remains high at 60%–70% even in patients with grade 3–4 hepatic encephalopathy. In patients with a single‐time‐point ingestion, ipecac syrup or gastric lavage with administration of activated charcoal is recommended within the first 12 h. Whenever APAP overdose is suspected, NAC therapy should be rapidly instituted via an enteral or intravenous route (Table 2).

### New insights into liver injury and regeneration from single-cell transcriptomics [^114tG7ZQ]. Egastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Novel insights gained from single-cell transcriptomic studies

Single-cell transcriptomics has significantly advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in key cell types — such as hepatocytes, HSCs, endothelial cells and macrophages — during ALI and regeneration. In this section, we review the main findings from single-cell transcriptomic analysis of various liver cell types and discuss potential therapeutic targets aimed at mitigating injury and promoting tissue repair in acute liver diseases. Notably, many of these studies have focused on repair processes following pericentral injury induced by acetaminophen (APAP) overdose (table 1), which shares similar mechanisms in mice after carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) insult. We also extend the discussion of the novel mechanisms underlying APAP-induced ALI to ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The regenerative mechanisms are further revealed in mice post-partial hepatectomy (PHx).

Hepatocytes

ALI can be rapidly resolved by surviving hepatocytes without the involvement of progenitor cells. In cases of hepatotoxin-induced liver injury, such as that caused by CCl 4 or APAP, midzonal (zone 2) and the remaining pericentral (zone 3) hepatocytes proliferate to repopulate necrotic pericentral areas following excessive hepatocyte loss. Additionally, periportal (zone 1) hepatocytes exhibited increased expression of proliferation markers, such as Mki67, indicating their participation in compensatory hepatocyte proliferation after acute injury, although their proliferative activity is not as pronounced as that of pericentral hepatocytes. Wang et al further analysed the temporal changes in the transcriptomic landscape in hepatocytes during repair following CCl 4 -induced liver injury. By comparing ST data from various time points postinjury with that acquired from undamaged control livers, they demonstrated significant increases in gene expressions associated with cell-cycle progression, proliferation-associated anabolism, fetal liver development and cell motility. Notably, the peak of proliferative activity occurred on day 2, fetal liver development pathways peaked between day 2 and day 3 and cell motility pathways peaked on day 3, suggesting a dynamic progression of hepatocyte repopulation during liver repair.

### Alternatively activated macrophages promote resolution of necrosis following acute liver injury [^115aa3st]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aim

Following acetaminophen (APAP) overdose, acute liver injury (ALI) can occur in patients that present too late for N-acetylcysteine treatment, potentially leading to acute liver failure, systemic inflammation, and death. Macrophages influence the progression and resolution of ALI due to their innate immunological function and paracrine activity. Syngeneic primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were tested as a cell-based therapy in a mouse model of APAP-induced ALI (APAP-ALI).

Methods

Several phenotypically distinct BMDM populations were delivered intravenously to APAP-ALI mice when hepatic necrosis was established, and then evaluated based on their effects on injury, inflammation, immunity, and regeneration. In vivo phagocytosis assays were used to interrogate the phenotype and function of alternatively activated BMDMs (AAMs) post-injection. Finally, primary human AAMs sourced from healthy volunteers were evaluated in immunocompetent APAP-ALI mice.

Results

BMDMs rapidly localised to the liver and spleen within 4 h of administration. Injection of AAMs specifically reduced hepatocellular necrosis, HMGB1 translocation, and infiltrating neutrophils following APAP-ALI. AAM delivery also stimulated proliferation in hepatocytes and endothelium, and reduced levels of several circulating proinflammatory cytokines within 24 h. AAMs displayed a high phagocytic activity both in vitro and in injured liver tissue post-injection. Crosstalk with the host innate immune system was demonstrated by reduced infiltrating host Ly6C hi macrophages in AAM-treated mice. Importantly, therapeutic efficacy was partially recapitulated using clinical-grade primary human AAMs in immunocompetent APAP-ALI mice, underscoring the translational potential of these findings.

Conclusion

We identify that AAMs have value as a cell-based therapy in an experimental model of APAP-ALI. Human AAMs warrant further evaluation as a potential cell-based therapy for APAP overdose patients with established liver injury.

Lay Summary

After an overdose of acetaminophen (paracetamol), some patients present to hospital too late for the current antidote (N-acetylcysteine) to be effective. We tested whether macrophages, an injury-responsive leukocyte that can scavenge dead/dying cells, could serve as a cell-based therapy in an experimental model of acetaminophen overdose. Injection of alternatively activated macrophages rapidly reduced liver injury and reduced several mediators of inflammation. Macrophages show promise to serve as a potential cell-based therapy for acute liver injury.

### COVID-19 and liver injury: where do we stand? [^112Y4vpr]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Characteristics of liver injury (liver test abnormalities) from various COVID-19 studies

Although the rate of developing liver injury was higher in patients with severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 than in mild patients, these differences were statistically non-significant in all studies. Moreover, the role of liver dysfunction as a potent predictor of severe COVID-19 manifestation or death was not documented by all selected studies. However, in a recently published study, patients with abnormal liver tests had a higher risk of progressing to severe disease. Moreover, in a death case study, one patient died from liver failure and a significant association was revealed between AST and ALT levels and time from initial symptom to death.

The possibility of DILI during hospitalization, and other cofactors, such as hypoxic hepatitis, as causes of liver dysfunction, or rhabdomyolysis as a cause of elevated liver enzymes cannot be easily ruled out in clinical practice. There are only limited available data linking underlying liver diseases with the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection (pre-existing liver disease ranged from 2–11% in the available data). The European Association for the Study of the Liver and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases have issued a position paper, providing recommendations for clinicians who care for patients with chronic liver diseases during the current COVID-19 pandemic. This position paper promotes telemedicine in the outpatient setting and suggests avoiding nosocomial dissemination. Additionally, the paper provides recommendations to prevent acetaminophen overdosing, to prevent administration of any NSAID, to continue treatment for cirrhosis-associated complications, to avoid reducing immunosuppressive therapy in patients with autoimmune liver diseases, to include testing for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with acute decompensation or acute on chronic liver failure, and to consider early admission according to the presence of additional risk factors.

In conclusion, the experience so far of clinicians and researchers worldwide suggests that attention should be paid to liver function in all patients infected by COVID-19, but slight/moderate abnormalities are likely to be of small importance. However, during the course of the disease, one of the important issues which should be taken into consideration is the use of drugs that may induce DILI in these patients (especially when study protocols are scheduled). Finally, increased surveillance with careful monitoring of serum hepatic enzymes is imperative, especially in hospitalized patients or those with liver comorbidities.

### Mechanistic biomarkers provide early and sensitive detection of acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury at first presentation to hospital [^112Twehf]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

There is an urgent need to identify and validate biomarkers that show both improved sensitivity and hepatic specificity to assist the clinical management of acetaminophen poisoning. Current biomarkers to assess liver integrity include circulating markers of hepatocellular death and hepatic function assessed in combination. However, it is well documented that delayed presentation time, staggered overdose, and a lack of sensitivity of current clinical chemistry parameters remains a critical impediment to the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. Furthermore, there is an important and unmet need for the development of improved biomarkers that exhibit higher sensitivity and specificity for other forms of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). By building on our previous clinical investigations, *and the preclinical reports from our laboratory and from others revealing that these biomarkers are more sensitive (with respect to time) indicators of changes in hepatic histology than ALT activity, *we report for the first time that miR-122, HMGB1, and necrosis K18 represent early and sensitive biomarkers that predict the development of clinical acetaminophen hepatotoxicity.

In acetaminophen overdose patients with established liver failure, we have shown previously that the circulating level of HMGB1 and necrosis K18 predict which patients reach the Kings College Criteria (KCC) and which patients die / require a liver transplant, in particular the acetylated isoform of HMGB1.*Moreover, our group have shown previously that miR-122 is 96% higher, on average, in patients meeting KCC versus patients who did not meet KCC; however, this did not meet statistical significance (P = 0.15). Within our previously published clinical investigations we sought to address the question as to whether or not these biomarkers could predict the outcome in patients with established acute liver injury; in the present study we now present the first data indicating that these biomarkers hold clinical utility to predict liver injury on presentation at the hospital emergency department.

### Liver regeneration after acetaminophen hepatotoxicity: mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities [^115bjvYY]. The American Journal of Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acetaminophen (N-acetyl-para-aminophenol; APAP) overdose is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the Western world, with limited treatment opportunities. For years, research on APAP overdose has been focused on investigating the mechanisms of hepatotoxicity, with limited success in advancing therapeutic strategies. Acute liver injury after any insult, including APAP overdose, is followed by compensatory liver regeneration, which promotes recovery and is a crucial determinant of the final outcome. Liver regeneration after APAP-induced liver injury is dose dependent and impaired after severe APAP overdose. Although robust regenerative response is associated with spontaneous recovery and survival, impaired regeneration results in faster progression of injury and death after APAP overdose. APAP hepatotoxicity-induced liver regeneration involves a complex time- and dose-dependent interplay of several signaling mediators, including growth factors, cytokines, angiogenic factors, and other mitogenic pathways. Compared with the liver injury, which is established before most patients seek medical attention and has proved difficult to manipulate, liver regeneration can be potentially modulated even in late-stage APAP-induced acute liver failure. Despite recent efforts to study the mechanisms of liver regeneration after APAP-induced liver injury, more comprehensive research in this area is required, especially regarding factors that contribute to impaired regenerative response, to develop novel regenerative therapies for APAP-induced acute liver failure.

FIGURE 2
Outcomes according to study day in patients with ALF according to etiology with hyperacute ALF (APAP overdose; A) or subacute ALF (eg, AIH; B). Diagrammatic representation of events by day after registry enrollment/listing. For APAP, essentially all outcomes have occurred by day 4. Abbreviations: AIH, autoimmune hepatitis; ALF, acute liver failure; ALFSG, Acute Liver Failure Study Group; APAP, acetaminophen.

Midway through the 22-year study, the ALFSG expanded the study population by adding a separate category of patients with severe ALI but no evident HE seeking to compare the outcome of this group to those with ALF. To limit the number of enrolled cases to those with the most severe injury, we defined ALI as having aminotransferases of at least 500 IU/L and an INR of 2.0 (N.B. higher than for ALF). Of interest, only 10% of patients with ALI progressed to ALF following admission to the study. Patients with ALI were more frequently due to APAP overdose than the proportion with ALF but overall had much better outcomes than patients who developed HE.

Recent trends in ALF etiologies and outcomes

Over the past 30 years, the incidence of various etiologies of ALF have waxed and waned, while the overall number of ALF cases per year in the United States has remained quite stable. Although the overall incidence of HAV and HBV infections in the United States has declined with the adoption of safe and effective vaccines, a recent uptrend appears related to local outbreaks of HAV in homeless populations and HBV related to injection drug use and high-risk sexual behavior. Over the 2 decades of the ALFSG, overall patient outcomes have improved across etiologies. Specifically, overall 21-day survival and TFS increased significantly, while numbers of patients listed and transplanted decreased. Of interest, there did not appear to be any variation in the overall disease severity at presentation but there was a decrease in the use of ICU measures including intubation, vasopressor use, renal replacement therapy, and transfusion of blood products.

### Acetaminophen metabolites on presentation following an acute acetaminophen overdose (ATOM-7) [^115H6TCU]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This study found that absolute concentrations of CYP pathway APAP metabolites and combination of metabolites were good early predictors of liver injury on presentation. CYP and/or sulfate metabolites may allow for early recognition of high‐risk patients and possibly improve treatment algorithms or the use of adjunct treatments in these patients.

### HepaRG cells: a human model to study mechanisms of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity [^116h9yhg]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure in Western countries. In the last four decades much progress has been made in our understanding of APAP-induced liver injury through rodent studies. However, some differences exist in the time course of injury between rodents and humans. To study the mechanism of APAP hepatotoxicity in humans, a human-relevant in vitro system is needed. Here we present evidence that the cell line HepaRG is a useful human model for the study of APAP-induced liver injury. Exposure of HepaRG cells to APAP at several concentrations resulted in glutathione depletion, APAP-protein adduct formation, mitochondrial oxidant stress and peroxynitrite formation, mitochondrial dysfunction (assessed by JC-1 fluorescence), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Importantly, the time course of LDH release resembled the increase in plasma aminotransferase activity seen in humans following APAP overdose. Based on propidium iodide uptake and cell morphology, the majority of the injury occurred within clusters of hepatocyte-like cells. The progression of injury in these cells involved mitochondrial reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen formation. APAP did not increase caspase activity above untreated control values and a pancaspase inhibitor did not protect against APAP-induced cell injury.

Conclusion

These data suggest that key mechanistic features of APAP-induced cell death are the same in human HepaRG cells, rodent in vivo models, and primary cultured mouse hepatocytes. Thus, HepaRG cells are a useful model to study mechanisms of APAP hepatotoxicity in humans.

### Role of the inflammasome in acetaminophen-induced liver injury and acute liver failure [^116wc1kU]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Drug-induced acute liver failure carries a high morbidity and mortality rate. Acetaminophen overdose is the number one cause of acute liver failure and remains a major problem in Western medicine. Administration of N-acetyl cysteine is an effective antidote when given before the initial rise in toxicity; however, many patients present to the hospital after this stage occurs. As such, treatments which can alleviate late-stage acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure are imperative. While the initial mechanisms of toxicity are well described, a debate has recently occurred in the literature over whether there is a second phase of injury, mediated by inflammatory processes. Critical to this potential inflammatory process is the activation of caspase-1 and interleukin-1β by a molecular complex known as the inflammasome. Several different stimuli for the formation of multiple different inflammasome complexes have been identified. Formation of the NACHT, leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and pyrin (PYD) domains-containing protein 3 (Nalp3) inflammasome in particular, has directly been attributed to late-stage acetaminophen toxicity. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms of acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice and man with a particular focus on the role of inflammation and the inflammasome.

### Mechanistic biomarkers provide early and sensitive detection of acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury at first presentation to hospital [^115dy1jn]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Our conclusions are largely based on the observation and ROC statistical analysis that in this cohort of acetaminophen overdose patients, when liver function tests are within the normal range, each of miR-122, HMGB1, and necrosis K18 strongly predicted which patients subsequently developed liver injury and those who did not. Moreover, each biomarker significantly outperformed plasma acetaminophen concentrations measured in samples taken at the time of admittance, and 4-hour back-extrapolated acetaminophen determinations, for the prediction of the subsequent development of ALI. All the patients within our cohort received AC after the first blood sample was taken and no significant kidney injury was detected. The serum levels of each of the biomarkers investigated were not significantly elevated in patients who did not develop liver injury compared to healthy volunteers from our previous study.*Immunohistochemistry data obtained from a mouse model of acetaminophen-induced ALI indicates that miR-122 is hepatocyte-specific and is lost progressively from necrotic areas of the liver during acetaminophen-induced liver injury (data not shown). The fact that miR-122 is greatly enriched in hepatocytesprovides a significant advance in the development of novel biomarkers to identify and stratify acetaminophen hepatotoxicity early.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^111xu8XH]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity — diagnosis and management for intentional versus unintentional overdose are contrasted by timing, dose patterns, coingestants, laboratory features, and treatments. Time course differs as "Single time point" versus "Several days of repeated use", and dosing descriptions include "Supratherapeutic (typically > 4 g over 24 h)" and "Repeated therapeutic (up to 4 g per day) or supratherapeutic dosing". Intentional cases show "24–72 h: rapid rise in ALT to > 1000 IU/L… total bilirubin is typically < 10 mg/dL" with peaks at "72–96 h", while unintentional cases are often delayed but still have a "rapid rise in ALT to > 1000 IU/L". Risk assessment states to "Use modified Rumack-Matthew nomogram to estimate risk of hepatotoxicity", whereas in repeated-use cases levels are "Often undetectable at initial presentation" and "APAP-protein adducts useful but assay not commercially available". Gastrointestinal decontamination for intentional overdose includes "Activated charcoal (1 g/kg, max dose 50 g) if within 4 h of ingestion", whereas for unintentional overdose it is "Usually not helpful nor recommended". N-acetylcysteine regimens include oral "140 mg/kg load followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 h" and intravenous dosing with "150 mg/kg load over 15–60 min, followed by 50 mg/kg (12.5 mg/kg/h)… then 100 mg/kg (6.25 mg/kg/h) over 16 h (overall total 300 mg/kg over 24 h)", with continuation "at 6.25 mg/kg/h until ALT is decreasing and INR is < 2". For acute liver failure risk, the table advises "Close monitoring in intensive care unit and consider prompt referral to a liver transplant center". Coingestants differ, with "Diphenhydramine and other sedatives" in intentional cases and "Opioids often used in combination" in unintentional cases.

### Multiplying the serum aminotransferase by the acetaminophen concentration to predict toxicity following overdose [^115e6XSe]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

The first available predictors of hepatic injury following acetaminophen (APAP) overdose are the serum APAP and aminotransferases [AT, i.e., aspartate (AST) aminotransferase or alanine (ALT) aminotransferase].

Objective

We describe the initial value, rate of change, and interrelationship between these biomarkers in patients who develop hepatotoxicity despite treatment following acute overdose. A new parameter, the APAP × AT multiplication product, is proposed for early risk stratification.

Methods

We conducted a descriptive study of individuals selected from a multicenter retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized for APAP poisoning. We selected those acute APAP overdose patients who subsequently developed AT > 1,000 IU/L. Rising serum AT values were compared to simultaneously measured (or estimated) falling serum APAP. The APAP × AT was expressed relative to initiation of acetylcysteine therapy and grouped by time to meeting hepatotoxicity criteria.

Results

In the 94 cases studied, serum APAP concentrations were still appreciable [median 570 (interquartile range (IQR) 314–983) μmol/L] at the time of the first measured AT [211 (77–511) IU/L at 15.3 (12.1–19.2) h post-ingestion], yielding an initial APAP × AT of 99,000 (52,000–240,000) μmol × IU/L(2). Because serum AT rose rapidly (doubling time 9.5 h) and APAP fell slowly (half-life 4.8 h), the multiplication product remained elevated during the first 12–24 h of antidotal therapy, especially among patients who developed earlier hepatotoxicity (AT > 1,000 IU/L).

Discussion and Conclusions

The APAP × AT multiplication product, calculated at the time of presentation and after several h of antidotal therapy, holds promise as a new risk predictor following APAP overdose. It requires neither graphical interpretation nor accurate time of ingestion, two limitations to current risk stratification.

### Early indicators of prognosis in fulminant hepatic failure [^115ZRf2w]. Gastroenterology (1989). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "King's College Criteria for acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure" for acute liver failure, acetaminophen overdose and drug-induced liver injury.

The King's College Criteria is a clinical calculator used specifically for patients with acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure. This scoring system is used to predict mortality in patients who have overdosed on acetaminophen and subsequently developed acute liver failure. The criteria help clinicians to identify patients who are likely to require a liver transplant for survival.

The King's College Criteria includes variables such as arterial blood pH, serum creatinine, prothrombin time, and grade of hepatic encephalopathy. Patients with a high score according to this criteria are at a higher risk of mortality and may need urgent liver transplantation.

The exclusion criteria for the use of the King's College Criteria include patients with chronic liver disease or those who have developed acute liver failure due to causes other than acetaminophen overdose.

The King's College Criteria for acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure is a tool designed to assess whether patients with liver damage after an acetaminophen overdose should be referred for liver transplantation. This evaluation hinges on specific clinical parameters to determine the severity of liver failure. Essentially, the tool examines a set of four medical conditions:

- Arterial pH < 7.3 after adequate volume resuscitation
- Grade III/IV hepatic encephalopathy
- Serum creatinine levels exceeding 300 mcmol/L (3.4 mg/dL)
- International normalized ratio > 6.5, corresponding to a prothrombin time over 100 seconds

The determination of whether a patient meets the criteria for liver transplantation referral is straightforward. A critical condition involves the arterial pH level. If arterial pH is below 7.3, this alone warrants referral due to the severity of acidosis. Alternatively, if the patient exhibits advanced hepatic encephalopathy (Grade III/IV) and concurrently has elevated serum creatinine and INR values, this combination also signals the need for transplantation consideration due to severe liver impairment.

In summary, the criteria for liver transplantation consideration are met if either there is acidosis indicated by arterial pH < 7.3 or a combination of advanced hepatic encephalopathy, high serum creatinine, and elevated INR is present. The system ensures early detection of critical conditions, promoting timely specialist intervention.

### Guidance for industry drug-induced liver injury… [^112LKNFZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

severe DILI, even if drug administration is continued. It is only those drugs that can cause hepatocellular injury extensive enough to reduce the liver's functional ability to clear bilirubin from the plasma or to synthesize prothrombin and other coagulation factors that cause severe DILI. It is important to identify those drugs as early as possible. A more specific signal of such potential is a higher rate of more marked peak AT elevations, with cases of increases to > 1, 000 U/L causing increased concern. The single clearest predictor found to date of a drug's potential for severe hepatotoxicity. Zimmerman's observation that drug-induced hepatocellular injury accompanied by jaundice had a poor prognosis, with a 10 to 50 percent mortality from acute liver failure. The reason for this. now seems clear.

Because the liver has a large excess of bilirubin-excreting capacity, injury to hepatocytes sufficient to cause jaundice or even mild hyperbilirubinemia represents an extent of liver injury so great that recovery may not be possible in some. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Hy's Law is essentially a translation of Zimmerman's observation that pure hepatocellular injury sufficient to cause hyperbilirubinemia is an ominous indicator of the potential for a drug to cause serious liver injury. Thus, a finding of ALT elevation, usually substantial, seen concurrently. excess of these elevations compared to a control group is nearly always seen for drugs that ultimately prove severely hepatotoxic at relatively high rates. Therefore, the sensitivity of a significantly increased incidence compared to control as an indicator of a potential for liver injury is high. But many. DILI are low.

An increased incidence of mild hepatotoxicity in early trials usually results in heightened screening to detect and evaluate liver injury during phase 3 testing. It is critical, however, to determine whether mild hepatotoxicity reflects a potential for severe DILI or reflects a capacity for only limited injury. To make this distinction, it is important to.

### Ethyl pyruvate reduces liver injury at early phase but impairs regeneration at late phase in acetaminophen overdose [^111ndYYL]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Inflammation likely contributes to liver injury at an early phase but facilitates hepatocyte regeneration at a late time point in APAP hepatotoxicity, and prolonged anti-inflammation therapy at a late phase is not beneficial.

### Pleiotropic role of p53 in injury and liver regeneration after acetaminophen overdose [^112z9GgG]. The American Journal of Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

p53 is the major cellular gatekeeper involved in proliferation, cell death, migration, and homeostasis. The role of p53 in pathogenesis of drug-induced liver injury is unknown. We investigated the role of p53 in liver injury and regeneration after acetaminophen (APAP) overdose, the most common cause of acute liver failure in the Western world. Eight-week-old male wild-type (WT) and p53 knockout (p53KO) mice were treated with 300 mg/kg APAP, and the dynamics of liver injury and regeneration were studied over a time course of 0 to 96 hours. Deletion of p53 resulted in a threefold higher liver injury than in WT mice. Interestingly, despite higher liver injury, p53KO mice recovered similarly as the WT mice because of faster liver regeneration. Deletion of p53 did not affect APAP bioactivation and initiation of injury. Microarray analysis revealed that p53KO mice had disrupted metabolic homeostasis and induced inflammatory and proliferative signaling. p53KO mice showed prolonged steatosis correlating with prolonged liver injury. Initiation of liver regeneration in p53KO mice was delayed, but once initiated, cell cycle was significantly faster than WT mice because of sustained AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. These studies show that p53 plays a pleotropic role after APAP overdose, where it prevents progression of liver injury by maintaining metabolic homeostasis and also regulates initiation of liver regeneration through proliferative signaling.

### Consensus-based recommendations on management of acetaminophen poisoning… [^111MhsX3]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

line. 9 A line beginning at 300 μg/mL at 4 hours was derived as 50% greater than the original nomogram line to denote patients and increased risk of developing liver injury. 10 Acetylcysteine should be initiated if a serum or plasma acetaminophen blood concentration drawn 4 to 24 hours after ingestion falls on or above the treatment line. If the concentration falls on or above the high-risk line, many clinicians would provide an increased dose of acetylcysteine. However, the medical literature is insufficient to allow recommendation of a specific acetylcysteine dose in this circumstance. Objective To develop consensus guidelines for the management of acetaminophen poisoning in the US and Canada. Evidence Review. Acetaminophen poisoning may occur as a self-harm attempt or the inadvertent consumption of repeated doses in the treatment of pain or fever.

Toxic effects of acetaminophen are characterized by hepatocellular damage, which may lead to acute liver injury, acute liver failure, or death. Consultation with a liver transplant team for possible liver transplant should be considered in patients with progressive increases in aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase and coagulation abnormalities. Liver transplant team consultation should also be considered in patients with encephalopathy or multisystem failure despite acetylcysteine treatment. The need for more standardized care of acetaminophen poisoning is pressing. Although a common toxicologic condition, an individual acute-care clinician rarely encounters a patient with serious poisoning patient. Unfamiliarity fosters suboptimal clinical management and treatment. Unlike most other poisonings, acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure is life-threatening, and the use of acetylcysteine can be lifesaving.

Numerous changes in our understanding of acetaminophen toxic effects have developed during the past 25 years. In particular, the occurrence of acute liver injury despite early acetylcysteine treatment in patients with high-risk ingestions has become apparent. 17 Today, most PCs recommend an increased dose of acetylcysteine in high-risk ingestions, but the practice varies and few data are available to guide management. Acetaminophen poisoning may result in acute liver failure and death if not treated with acetylcysteine in a timely manner. Future work should focus on refining critical elements of history-taking in poisoned patients, comparative effectiveness and safety research on various acetylcysteine regimens, and refining the clinical roles of fomepizole and hemodialysis in acetaminophen poisoning.

### Modern management of acute liver failure [^112wWBej]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Acute liver failure is a rare but life-threatening disease that can lead to progressive encephalopathy, intracranial hypertension, and multiorgan failure. In the developed world, the most common cause remains acetaminophen overdose, but there are still many cases in which there is acute liver failure of unknown etiology. The mainstay of acute liver failure management remains supportive care in the critical care setting. If supportive treatment does not stabilize the disease process, the patient may require emergent liver transplantation. This article summarizes the current management of acute liver failure.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^1139M4Yt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Table 5 — etiologies of acute liver failure — details typical presentations, laboratory patterns, and timing cues across major causes. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity often follows ingestion of > 10 g and can show marked transaminase elevation with relatively low bilirubin, with rapid progression to ALF accompanied by hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and renal failure within 72–96 hr. Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury is not necessarily dose dependent with highly variable latency, and antimicrobials followed by complementary and alternative medications are common culprits. Viral hepatitis notes that hepatitis A, B, and E virus infections are most common and a viral prodrome often precedes ALF; prognosis is reported as Variable (favorable for HAV, but poor for HBV, and HEV during pregnancy). Pregnancy-related ALF commonly involves HELLP syndrome or acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP), both occurring in the third trimester or immediately postpartum, with a hepatocellular pattern and median AST/ALT > 10× ULN. Autoimmune hepatitis shows a predominantly hepatocellular pattern with marked transaminase elevation and elevated anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle actin antibody, and immunoglobulin G levels. Wilson disease may have modest transaminase elevation with normal or very low alkaline phosphatase and can present with Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and rapid progression to renal failure. Mushroom poisoning presents with severe gastroenteritis at 6–12 hr after ingestion, evolving hepatotoxicity within 24–36 hr, and progressive liver and multiorgan failure within 4–7 d. Budd-Chiari syndrome most commonly affects women in their fourth to fifth decades of life; laboratory findings include transaminase elevation in the 1000s and an AST:ALT ratio that often exceeds 1.

### Mechanistic biomarkers provide early and sensitive detection of acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury at first presentation to hospital [^112jQ6xC]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Although the data presented here provide evidence that miR-122, HMGB1, and necrosis K18 represent sensitive and early biomarkers of clinical acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, without a tissue biopsy reflecting the actual degree of organ damage the observed quantification of these biomarkers could, in theory, overstate the degree of cell death. However, our data are consistent with those obtained in preclinical models, where quantitative circulating levels of a particular biomarker can be directly related to changes (or a lack of a change) in hepatic histology over time, *and the finding that these biomarkers can report on the mechanistic basis of other DILIs in patient cohorts. Qualification is a common challenge for potential new biomarkers in man and it is important to note that ALT itself has never been fully qualified against human histology for drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, the potential importance of the findings presented here is underpinned by the relatively heterogeneous nature of acetaminophen overdose cohort samples (particularly with respect to the amount of acetaminophen ingested and the time of presentation). We therefore believe that our data add to the growing body of evidence to support the ongoing clinical qualification of these markers of liver injury.

### Acetaminophen metabolites on presentation following an acute acetaminophen overdose (ATOM-7) [^112nMLY6]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) is a commonly utilized analgesic agent and in recommended doses is safe in healthy individuals. Due to its wide availability, APAP is one of the most common medications leading to hospital presentations and admissions following deliberate self‐poisoning and accidental overdose in many countries. APAP toxicity is the leading cause of acute liver failure in North America, Europe, and Australia. The mainstay of treatment is the antidote acetylcysteine. Its use in acute APAP overdose is guided by the history of ingestion, APAP concentration, and liver enzymes. Most acute APAP ingestions requiring treatment present within 8 hours of ingestion and are at low risk of liver injury. However, there are multiple reports of liver injury despite treatment within 8 hours of ingestion and liver injury despite an initial APAP concentration below the nomogram line. New biomarkers, including APAP metabolites, may improve identification of these patients for clinical and research purposes and provide insights into reasons for treatment "failure".

### A descriptive analysis of aspartate and alanine aminotransferase rise and fall following acetaminophen overdose [^1119suUH]. Clinical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Risk prediction following acetaminophen (paracetamol, APAP) overdose is based on serum APAP, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. One recently proposed risk stratification tool, the APAPxAT multiplication product, uses either AST or ALT, whichever is higher, yet their interrelation is not well known following APAP-induced hepatic injury.

Objective

To describe the kinetics of AST and ALT release into and disappearance from the circulation following APAP overdose.

Materials and Methods

An observational case series of adult patients with peak AST or ALT > 100 IU/L attributable to APAP toxicity. Cases were identified by electronic search of hospital laboratory database and by discharge diagnosis corroborated by structured explicit medical record review.

Results

Of 68 cases identified (mean age (SD): 39 (18) years, 63% female, and 21% ethanol co-ingested), 28 (41%) developed hepatotoxicity (peak AST or ALT > 1000 IU/L), 28 (41%) coagulopathy (international normalized ratio or INR > 2), and 21 (31%) both. Three patients (4%) were transferred for liver transplantation and ultimately six (8.8%) died. Serum AST and ALT activity rose in a closely aligned 1:1 AST:ALT ratio, but fell at distinctly different rates: AST activity fell with a half-life (interquartile range [IQR]) of 15.1 (12.2, 19.4) hours, and ALT 39.6 (32.9, 47.6) hours. Using an aminotransferase falling to below 50% of peak as the basis for discontinuing acetylcysteine would have resulted in antidotal treatment being stopped 24 (IQR: 9.6, 40) hours earlier (and in no cases later) using AST rather than ALT. Only six patients had an AST:ALT ratio greater than 2:1 at the time of acetylcysteine administration; of these six, four died and one survivor developed coagulopathy.

Discussion

AST and ALT release into the circulation appears tightly linked and numerically similar, except in the sickest patients. Once the aminotransferases peak, AST returns to baseline more quickly.

Conclusion

Either AST or ALT can be used for early risk stratification tools when only one is known. Any criterion for N-AC discontinuation should be based on the decline of AST rather than ALT, with a potential benefit measured in days.

### The mitochondrial negative regulator MCJ is a therapeutic target for acetaminophen-induced liver injury [^11758bkL]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

In this study, we show that APAP-induced liver injury progresses through the central participation of MCJ in vitro and in vivo. The repression of MCJ expression prevents APAP-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity and ATP production, as well as APAP-induced oxidative stress in hepatocytes by sustaining the formation of supercomplexes. These mechanisms lead to reduction in liver damage triggered by APAP as well as increased liver regeneration capacity by targeting MCJ levels. Moreover, we show higher levels of MCJ in livers from patients admitted with life-threating overdoses of APAP relative to healthy individuals. Thus, MCJ emerges as a novel druggable target for APAP-induced liver injury.

### Asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase elevations with therapeutic doses of acetaminophen [^114kp2NL]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

While acetaminophen overdose has been recognized as a cause of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations for over 40 years, recent studies have reported asymptomatic ALT elevations in research subjects who are administered with therapeutic doses (4 g/d or less) of acetaminophen for more than 4 days. While the clinical course of these elevations is not completely defined, available evidence suggests that even in high risk groups the elevations are not accompanied by evidence of hepatic dysfunction and that resolve if treatment is continued. Toxicologists should consider therapeutic acetaminophen use as a cause of ALT elevation. Further study of the mechanism of ALT elevations may provide new insight into other causes of drug-induced liver injury and hepatic adaptation.
