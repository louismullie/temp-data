## Question

A previously healthy 17-year-old girl comes to the emergency department because of a 5-day history of progressive lower abdominal pain, fever, and malodorous vaginal discharge. Menarche was at the age of 12 years, and her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses a combination contraceptive patch. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows severe lower quadrant tenderness bilaterally. Pelvic examination shows a purulent cervical discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 13,000/mm3 , and platelet count is 345,000/mm3 . A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?

Answer Choices:
A. Oral azithromycin
B. Vaginal clindamycin
C. Intravenous penicillin and vancomycin
D. Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pharmacotherapy is most appropriate for a 17-year-old with suspected pelvic inflammatory disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the clinical presentation meets criteria for PID and whether hospitalization is indicated. Then, I should verify the likely pathogens and the need for empiric coverage. Next, I will review guideline-supported outpatient regimens and compare them with the alternatives. Finally, I will confirm dosing, duration, and follow-up requirements, including partner management and what to do if there is no improvement in 72 hours [^f87fe1b9].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. The patient has lower abdominal pain, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness, which fulfills the CDC minimum clinical criteria for PID in a sexually active adolescent, and the malodorous discharge and leukocytosis support an infectious etiology; she is hemodynamically stable and afebrile, so this is mild to moderate disease rather than severe illness warranting hospitalization [^e71f0410] [^d885fb82].

> I need to check the likely pathogens and the rationale for empiric therapy. PID is typically polymicrobial, with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis as key sexually transmitted causes, and anaerobes such as Bacteroides species commonly implicated; importantly, negative endocervical testing does not exclude upper tract infection, so empiric treatment should cover gonorrhea, chlamydia, and anaerobes to reduce the risk of infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain [^1ed7c963] [^f19caa48].

> Now, I will examine the guideline-supported outpatient regimen. The CDC recommends ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once plus doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days, with the addition of metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 14 days when anaerobic coverage is indicated; this regimen provides reliable coverage for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and anaerobes, and is supported by randomized trials and systematic reviews showing similar outcomes between parenteral and oral therapy in mild to moderate PID [^6d5d247d] [^1307e942] [^22460cf4].

> Wait, let me verify the alternatives against this standard. Option A, oral azithromycin monotherapy, lacks reliable anaerobic coverage and is not recommended as monotherapy for PID; while azithromycin has been studied, it is not a substitute for the CDC-endorsed combination regimen in this context, so I should not choose this [^notfound]. Option B, vaginal clindamycin, is inappropriate because it does not treat upper tract infection and lacks coverage for gonorrhea and chlamydia; topical therapy is not indicated for PID [^notfound]. Option C, IV penicillin plus vancomycin, is too narrow and misaligned with PID pathogens; vancomycin is not part of PID regimens and this choice omits chlamydia coverage and adequate anaerobic therapy, so it is incorrect [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing nuances. For adolescents and adults weighing 150 kg or less, ceftriaxone 500 mg IM is appropriate; for those heavier than 150 kg, 1 g IM is recommended, though that does not apply here. Doxycycline and metronidazole should be continued for a full 14 days, and metronidazole can be given orally with good bioavailability when the patient can tolerate it, which supports outpatient completion of therapy [^6d5d247d] [^02657013].

> I should confirm follow-up and partner management. The patient should demonstrate clinical improvement within 72 hours; if there is no improvement, hospitalization, reassessment of the regimen, and additional diagnostics including consideration of tubo-ovarian abscess are recommended. All sexual partners within the last 60 days should be notified, tested, and presumptively treated for gonorrhea and chlamydia, and the patient should abstain from sex until therapy is complete and symptoms have resolved [^f87fe1b9] [^a3cef31a] [^9d699c92].

> But wait, what if Mycoplasma genitalium is a concern? Doxycycline provides partial coverage and may reduce bacterial load; if M. genitalium is detected, moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 14 days is an option, though routine testing for M. genitalium in PID is not currently recommended, so I should not alter initial empiric therapy based on that possibility alone [^f9be22d7] [^e3b9d364].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is intramuscular ceftriaxone plus oral doxycycline, with the addition of metronidazole to ensure anaerobic coverage; among the choices provided, option D matches this evidence-based regimen and is therefore the correct answer [^6d5d247d] [^1307e942].

---

The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this 17-year-old with suspected PID is **ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once** [^6d5d247d] plus **doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days** [^3ebd8e74], with **metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 14 days** added for anaerobic coverage [^f19caa48]. This regimen covers N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and anaerobes, and is recommended for mild-to-moderate PID in adolescents [^6d5d247d]. Hospitalization is not indicated here, but the patient should be reassessed within 72 hours [^f87fe1b9]; if there is no improvement, escalate care and consider alternative diagnoses [^a3cef31a].

---

## Clinical diagnosis and indications for treatment

PID is a **clinical diagnosis** [^e71f0410] characterized by pelvic or lower abdominal pain with cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness in sexually active women [^a70e6128]. Empiric treatment should be initiated when these findings are present and no other cause is identified, especially in adolescents and young women at risk for STIs [^e71f0410]. The patient meets these criteria, so empiric therapy is indicated [^e71f0410].

---

## Recommended pharmacotherapy

Current CDC guidelines recommend the following **outpatient regimen** for mild-to-moderate PID:

| **Medication** | **Dose and route** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Ceftriaxone | 500 mg IM once | Single dose |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg orally twice daily | 14 days |
| Metronidazole | 500 mg orally twice daily | 14 days |

---

This regimen provides **coverage for N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and anaerobes** [^f19caa48], which are commonly implicated in PID [^1ed7c963]. Anaerobic coverage is particularly important given the presence of malodorous discharge, suggesting anaerobic involvement [^f19caa48].

---

## Rationale for recommended regimen

- **Ceftriaxone**: Effective against N. gonorrhoeae, including resistant strains [^notfound].
- **Doxycycline**: Effective against C. trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium, common PID pathogens [^notfound].
- **Metronidazole**: Provides anaerobic coverage, important for malodorous discharge and polymicrobial infections [^f19caa48].

---

## Alternative regimens

Alternative regimens include **cefoxitin 2 g IM with probenecid 1 g orally**, followed by doxycycline and metronidazole for 14 days [^6d5d247d], or **levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily** or moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily with metronidazole for 14 days [^42477954]. However, fluoroquinolone regimens are not recommended in areas with high fluoroquinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae or in patients with severe cephalosporin allergy [^42477954].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

Hospitalization and parenteral therapy are indicated for any of the following:

- Surgical emergencies (e.g. appendicitis) cannot be excluded [^d885fb82].
- Tubo-ovarian abscess [^d885fb82].
- Pregnancy [^cf92774e].
- Severe illness, nausea/vomiting, or oral temperature > 38.5°C (101°F) [^d885fb82].
- Unable to follow or tolerate outpatient therapy [^d885fb82].
- No clinical response to outpatient therapy within 72 hours [^f87fe1b9].

This patient does not meet these criteria, so **outpatient therapy is appropriate** [^d885fb82].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

- **Re-evaluation**: Within 72 hours to ensure clinical improvement (defervescence, reduction in tenderness) [^f87fe1b9].
- **Partner management**: Sexual partners within the last 60 days should be notified, tested, and treated empirically for gonorrhea and chlamydia [^a3cef31a].
- **Testing**: Obtain NAATs for gonorrhea and chlamydia at the time of diagnosis, and retest in 3 months [^9d699c92].

---

## Potential complications of untreated PID

Untreated PID can lead to **significant morbidity**, including:

- Chronic pelvic pain [^3ebd8e74].
- Infertility [^3ebd8e74].
- Ectopic pregnancy [^3ebd8e74].
- Tubo-ovarian abscess [^f19caa48].
- Chronic pelvic pain and adhesions [^f04d5db6].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is **ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once**, plus **doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days**, with **metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 14 days** [^6d5d247d]. This regimen provides broad-spectrum coverage, is evidence-based, and aligns with current CDC guidelines. Close follow-up and partner management are essential to ensure treatment success and prevent complications [^a3cef31a].

### Pelvic inflammatory disease [^c6f01b7b]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease is a polymicrobial infection of the upper genital tract. It primarily affects young, sexually active women. The diagnosis is made clinically; no single test or study is sensitive or specific enough for a definitive diagnosis. Pelvic inflammatory disease should be suspected in at-risk patients who present with pelvic or lower abdominal pain with no identified etiology, and who have cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are the most commonly implicated microorganisms; however, other microorganisms may be involved. The spectrum of disease ranges from asymptomatic to life-threatening tubo-ovarian abscess. Patients should be treated empirically, even if they present with few symptoms. Most women can be treated successfully as outpatients with a single dose of a parenteral cephalosporin plus oral doxycycline, with or without oral metronidazole. Delay in treatment may lead to major sequelae, including chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Hospitalization and parenteral treatment are recommended if the patient is pregnant, has human immunodeficiency virus infection, does not respond to oral medication, or is severely ill. Strategies for preventing pelvic inflammatory disease include routine screening for chlamydia and patient education.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: diagnosis, management, and prevention [^3ebd8e74]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper genital tract occurring predominantly in sexually active young women. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causes; however, other cervical, enteric, bacterial vaginosis-associated, and respiratory pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, may be involved. PID can be acute, chronic, or subclinical and is often underdiagnosed. Untreated PID can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and intra-abdominal infections. The diagnosis is made primarily on clinical suspicion, and empiric treatment is recommended in sexually active young women or women at risk for sexually transmitted infections who have unexplained lower abdominal or pelvic pain and cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness on examination. Mild to moderate disease can be treated in an outpatient setting with a single intramuscular injection of a recommended cephalosporin followed by oral doxycycline for 14 days. Additionally, metronidazole is recommended for 14 days in the setting of bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, or recent uterine instrumentation. Hospitalization for parenteral antibiotics is recommended in patients who are pregnant or severely ill, in whom outpatient treatment has failed, those with tubo-ovarian abscess, or if surgical emergencies cannot be excluded. Treatment does not change in patients with intrauterine devices or those with HIV. Sex partner treatment is recommended; expedited partner treatment is recommended where legal. Prevention of PID includes screening for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae in all women younger than 25 years and those who are at risk or pregnant, plus intensive behavioral counseling for all adolescents and adults at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^e71f0410]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) diagnosis and empiric treatment—Presumptive treatment for PID should be initiated for sexually active young women and other women at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for the illness other than PID can be identified, or if one or more of the following three minimum clinical criteria are present on pelvic examination: cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness. Requiring that all three minimum criteria be present before the initiation of empiric treatment can result in insufficient sensitivity for a PID diagnosis, and after deciding whether to initiate empiric treatment, clinicians should also consider the risk profile for STIs. In addition to one of the three minimum criteria, one or more additional criteria can be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical criteria and support a PID diagnosis, including oral temperature >38.3°C (>101°F), abnormal cervical mucopurulent discharge or cervical friability, presence of abundant numbers of white blood cells (WBCs) on saline microscopy of vaginal fluid, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, elevated C-reactive protein, and laboratory documentation of cervical infection with N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis. The majority of women with PID have either mucopurulent cervical discharge or evidence of WBCs on a wet prep, and if the cervical discharge appears normal and no WBCs are observed on the wet prep of vaginal fluid, a PID diagnosis is unlikely, and alternative causes of pain should be considered; a wet prep of vaginal fluid also can detect the presence of concomitant infections such as bacterial vaginosis (BV) or trichomoniasis. Because of the difficulty of diagnosis and of the potential for damage to the reproductive health of women, health care providers should maintain a low threshold for the clinical diagnosis of PID, and more elaborate diagnostic evaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis and management of PID might cause unnecessary morbidity.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^a70e6128]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Episodes of PID often go unrecognized. Although certain cases are asymptomatic, others are not diagnosed because the patient or the health care provider do not recognize the implications of mild or nonspecific symptoms or signs (e.g. abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, and vaginal discharge). Even women with mild or asymptomatic PID might be at risk for infertility. Because of the difficulty of diagnosis and the potential for damage to the reproductive health of women, health care providers should maintain a low threshold for the clinical diagnosis of PID. The recommendations for diagnosing PID are intended to assist health care providers to recognize when PID should be suspected and when additional information should be obtained to increase diagnostic certainty. Diagnosis and management of other causes of lower abdominal pain (e.g. ectopic pregnancy, acute appendicitis, ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, or functional pain) are unlikely to be impaired by initiating antimicrobial therapy for PID. Presumptive treatment for PID should be initiated for sexually active young women and other women at risk for STIs if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for the illness other than PID can be identified, or if one or more of the following three minimum clinical criteria are present on pelvic examination: cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness.

More specific criteria for diagnosing PID include endometrial biopsy with histopathologic evidence of endometritis; transvaginal sonography or magnetic resonance imaging techniques demonstrating thickened, fluid-filled tubes with or without free pelvic fluid or tubo-ovarian complex, or Doppler studies indicating pelvic infection (e.g. tubal hyperemia); and laparoscopic findings consistent with PID. A diagnostic evaluation that includes some of these more extensive procedures might be warranted in certain cases. Endometrial biopsy is warranted for women undergoing laparoscopy who do not have visual evidence of salpingitis because endometritis is the only sign of PID for certain women.

Requiring that all three minimum criteria be present before the initiation of empiric treatment can result in insufficient sensitivity for a PID diagnosis. After deciding whether to initiate empiric treatment, clinicians should also consider the risk profile for STIs. More elaborate diagnostic evaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis and management of PID might cause unnecessary morbidity. For example, the presence of signs of lower genital tract inflammation (predominance of leukocytes in vaginal secretions, cervical discharge, or cervical friability), in addition to one of the three minimum criteria, increases the specificity of the diagnosis. One or more of the following additional criteria can be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical criteria and support a PID diagnosis:

Medical and family history for adnexal masses—personal medical and detailed gynecologic history with symptom review are critical, and family history and review of other risk factors will help assess malignancy likelihood. Symptom patterns refine the differential: the potential for pregnancy should be evaluated in all women of reproductive age because ectopic pregnancy is in the differential; unilateral, intermittent, and then acutely worsening pelvic pain may indicate ovarian torsion; indolent progressive pelvic pain with fevers, chills, vomiting, and vaginal discharge may indicate an infectious etiology such as a tubo-ovarian abscess; women with acute or chronic dysmenorrhea or pain with intercourse may have an endometrioma; persistent bloating, generalized abdominal pain, and early satiety may be signs of malignancy; and abnormal or postmenopausal bleeding may be caused by estrogen produced by sex cord-stromal tumors.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^a3cef31a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Follow-Up

Women should demonstrate clinical improvement (e.g. defervescence; reduction in direct or rebound abdominal tenderness; and reduction in uterine, adnexal, and cervical motion tenderness) <3 days after therapy initiation. If no clinical improvement has occurred <72 hours after outpatient IM or oral therapy, then hospitalization, assessment of the antimicrobial regimen, and additional diagnostics, including consideration of diagnostic laparoscopy for alternative diagnoses, are recommended. All women who have received a diagnosis of chlamydial or gonococcal PID should be retested 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether their sex partners have been treated. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, these women should be retested whenever they next seek medical care <12 months after treatment.

Management of Sex Partners

Persons who have had sexual contact with a partner with PID during the 60 days preceding symptom onset should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for chlamydia and gonorrhea, regardless of the PID etiology or pathogens isolated. If the last sexual intercourse was >60 days before symptom onset or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be treated. Sex partners of persons who have PID caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae frequently are asymptomatic. Arrangements should be made to link sex partners to care. If linkage is delayed or unlikely, EPT is an alternative approach to treating sex partners who have chlamydial or gonococcal infection (see Partner Services). Partners should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners have been treated (i.e. until therapy is completed and symptoms have resolved, if originally present).

### The challenge of pelvic inflammatory disease [^f0adfc55]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper genital tract in women that can include endometritis, parametritis, salpingitis, oophoritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and peritonitis. The spectrum of disease ranges from subclinical, asymptomatic infection to severe, life-threatening illness; sequelae include chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. PID is diagnosed clinically, with laboratory and imaging studies reserved for patients who have an uncertain diagnosis, are severely ill, or do not respond to initial therapy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria include uterine, adnexal, or cervical motion tenderness with no other obvious cause in women at risk of PID. Empiric treatment should be initiated promptly and must cover Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; the possibility of fluoroquinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae also should be considered. Hospitalization for initial parenteral therapy is necessary for patients with tubo-ovarian abscess and for those who are pregnant, severely ill, unable to follow a prescribed treatment plan, or unable to tolerate oral antibiotics. Patients also should be hospitalized if a surgical emergency cannot be excluded or if no clinical improvement occurs after three days. Routine screening for asymptomatic chlamydial infection can help prevent PID and its sequelae.

Day 16

The laboratory results were reviewed with the patient the following day and she was treated for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) with ceftriaxone intramuscular (IM) 500 mg, doxycycline 100 mg by mouth (PO) twice daily (BID) for 14 days, and metronidazole 500 mg (PO) BID for 14 days.

(Although treatment for the partner may have been indicated, it was not pursued in part due to the negative sexually transmitted infection (STI) tests and the patient’s relationship with her partner).

Day 19

Three days after starting the PID treatment, the patient presented to the emergency department (ED) for abdominal pain and back pain. Her examination showed a soft and nondistended abdomen but was notable for RLQ and right CVA tenderness. Repeat urinalysis showed ketones and trace blood with a negative culture. Her pregnancy test was negative. Her transvaginal ultrasound showed normal blood flow to the ovaries, a 1.4 × 1.7 × 2.3 cm left ovarian cyst, consistent with a dominant follicle, and was otherwise unremarkable. Her computed tomography (CT) scan (without contrast) showed no acute pathology within the abdomen or pelvis including no indication of pyelonephritis. She was discharged with instructions to continue PID antibiotic therapy and apply diclofenac gel to her back.

Day 22

The patient returned to her PCP where she reported that her nausea and pain had improved. The patient also had an improved abdominal examination with active bowel sounds and resolution of abdominal tenderness.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^d885fb82]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)—anaerobic coverage, early initiation, and hospitalization criteria: Addition of metronidazole to intramuscular (IM) or oral PID regimens more effectively eradicates anaerobes, and until non-anaerobic regimens are proven equivalent, using regimens with anaerobic activity should be considered; treatment should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. For women with mild or moderate clinical severity, parenteral and oral regimens appear to have similar efficacy. Hospitalization should be based on provider judgment and whether any of the following are present: Surgical emergencies (e.g., appendicitis) cannot be excluded; Tubo-ovarian abscess; Pregnancy; Severe illness, nausea and vomiting, or oral temperature >38.5°C (101°F); Unable to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regimen; No clinical response to oral antimicrobial therapy.

Case Presentation

Day 1

A previously healthy, sexually active, cisgender female adolescent presented to urgent care for several days of bilateral, stabbing back pain. She was advised to take ibuprofen 600 MG as needed, up to three times daily (TID), and do stretching exercises.

Day 15

Two weeks later, the unaccompanied patient was evaluated in her primary care physician’s (PCP) office for four days of intermittent red/orange-appearing urine, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and a sensation of incomplete voiding. She reported nausea without emesis, reduced appetite, watery diarrhea, diffuse abdominal pain (worse left lower quadrant [LLQ] and suprapubic), and back pain. She had pain with vaginal intercourse in the last few days and red/brown vaginal discharge. She stated that she had sex without a barrier method with a monogamous boyfriend of eight months and had an etonogestrel implant which was placed five months prior. She reported a history of frequent, untreated episodes that she thought were urinary tract infections (UTIs) for which she never sought medical care.

On physical examination, the patient was afebrile and in no apparent distress; she had hypoactive bowel sounds, abdominal tenderness over the right lower quadrant (RLQ) and suprapubic region, no rebound tenderness or tenderness over McBurney point (despite diffuse RLQ tenderness), negative Murphy sign, and positive bilateral costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness. On genitourinary examination (bimanual and speculum), she had mild cervical motion tenderness (CMT) and no thickened, discolored, or odorous vaginal discharge. Urinalysis, urine culture, HIV antigen/antibody, cervical swab for trichomonas, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and vaginal wet mount for bacterial vaginosis (BV) and yeast were all normal or negative. Her C-reactive protein (CRP) was within normal levels (WNL) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated at 27 (normal limit, 0-13 mm/h).

Introduction

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women is described as an inflammation of the upper genital tract and surrounding structures as a result of ascending infection from the lower genital tract—bacteria spread directly from the cervix to the endometrium and on to the upper genital tract.The signs and symptoms of PID are not specific and may range from asymptomatic to abdominal pain/tenderness, fever, vomiting, dyspareunia and menorrhagia.

The incidence of PID in the UK has been estimated to range between 1.1% and 1.7% among women between 16 and 46 years old.Among women with PID, 10%–20% may become infertile, 40% will develop chronic pelvic pain, and 10% of those who conceive will have an ectopic pregnancy.The cost of pelvic infection has been estimated to exceed US$2.4 billion in the USA, and the mean total cost per episode managed as an outpatient is around US$700.In the UK, the mean cost of an uncomplicated episode of PID is £163, considering an average of two outpatient appointments per woman across all settings.

PID requires effective treatment to reduce the incidence of chronic pelvic pain, infertility and ectopic pregnancy. The main intervention for treating acute PID is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics which cover Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobic bacteria, but the optimal treatment strategy is unclear. A variety of antibiotic regimens and routes of administration (intravenous, intramuscular or oral) have been used, with marked geographical variation. Current practice generally involves the use of multiple agents to provide broad antimicrobial cover, but the best combination of agents is unknown. Guidelines have been produced in the USA,and in Europe,to guide therapy, but these have not been based on a systematic review. The authors of the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and International Union against Sexually Transmitted Infections (IUSTI) guidelines state that there is limited evidence for the need to eradicate anaerobes or for the use of alternative regimens, such as azithromycin.

The current review is an abridged version of a Cochrane systematic review and presents the main findings from the primary outcomes and an enhanced discussion section.This review addresses clinical questions raised in the current guidelines on the treatment of PIDregarding the effectiveness and safety of nitroimidazole, the relative benefits of azithromycin versus doxycycline, the use of quinolones, and the relative benefits of cephalosporins compared with clindamycin plus aminoglycoside, to inform future guideline development and clinical practice.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease [^cba503dd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection-caused inflammatory continuum from the cervix to the peritoneal cavity. Most importantly, it is associated with fallopian tube inflammation, which can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. The microbial etiology is linked to sexually transmitted microorganisms, including Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrheae, Mycoplasma genitalium, and bacterial vaginosis-associated microorganisms, predominantly anaerobes. Pelvic pain and fever are commonly absent in women with confirmed PID. Clinicians should consider milder symptoms such as abnormal vaginal discharge, metrorrhagia, postcoital bleeding, and urinary frequency as potential symptoms associated with the disease, particularly in women at risk of sexually transmitted infection. The diagnosis of PID is based on the findings of lower genital tract inflammation associated with pelvic organ tenderness. The outpatient treatment of mild-to-moderate PID should include tolerated antibiotic regimens with activity against the commonly isolated microorganisms associated with PID and usually consists of an extended spectrum cephalosporin in conjunction with either doxycycline or azithromycin. Clinically severe PID should prompt hospitalization and imaging to rule out a tuboovarian abscess. Parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with activity against a polymicrobial flora, particularly gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, should be implemented. Screening for and treatment of Chlamydia infection can prevent PID.

Diagnostic laparoscopy, antibiotic therapy, and pregnancy surveillance.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Surveillance and outcome of pregnancy.

Result(S)

The patient presented with abdominal pain and fever 26 days after her last menstrual period. Examination revealed peritoneal irritation and cervical tenderness, with free fluid in the pelvis. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed, with no evidence of ectopic pregnancy. A significant quantity of yellow purulent fluid was drained from the pelvis, which cultured for Escherichia coli. Antibiotic therapy yielded excellent response. The pregnancy continued, with no complications, to healthy term delivery.

Conclusion(S)

This rare diagnosis of peri-implantation pelvic inflammatory disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in early pregnancy. Timely, rational treatment, including early pelvic drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy, may save the pregnancy.

Definition of postabortion infection and PID criteria: Postabortion infection is defined by the pathologic presence of bacteria in the upper genital tract after abortion or pregnancy loss, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s definition of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can be used as a proxy, requiring pelvic or lower abdominal pain with no other identifiable cause plus at least one of cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness; additional criteria that enhance specificity include oral temperature > 38.3°C (101°F), abnormal cervical mucopurulent discharge or cervical friability, elevated C-reactive protein, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukocytosis on saline microscopy of vaginal fluid, or neutrophilia.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: current concepts in pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^41b1d05a]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is characterized by infection and inflammation of the upper genital tract in women and can cause significant reproductive health sequelae for women. Although a definitive diagnosis of PID is made by laparoscopic visualization of inflamed, purulent fallopian tubes, PID is generally a clinical diagnosis and thus represents a diagnostic challenge. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment algorithms advise a high index of suspicion for PID in any woman of reproductive age with pelvic or abdominal pain. Antibiotic therapy should be started early, and given for an adequate period of time to reduce the risk of complications. Coverage for anaerobic organisms should be considered in most cases.

Case Report

In February 2001, a 39-year-old woman was admitted to the district hospital of Dornbirn, Vorarlberg, Austria, for chronic abdominal pain, increased vaginal discharge, and unusually heavy menses. Her medical record showed two uncomplicated pregnancies, followed by an aseptic abortion in the second trimester, a further uncomplicated pregnancy, and two first-trimester miscarriages. Since adolescence, the patient had experienced lower abdominal complaints, including menstrual irregularities, urinary symptoms, and unspecific vaginal discharge. Repeated treatment of mycosis and infections of the urinary tract did not lead to substantial clinical improvement nor did symptomatic treatment with corticosteroids or with Lactobacillus acidophilus. Her condition was exacerbated after a copper-containing intrauterine device was inserted in 1999. Episodes of lower abdominal pain became more frequent and more severe. They were accompanied by fatigue, general malaise, and sometimes by elevated temperature. Her menses became increasingly heavy, finally resulting in 10 days of heavy bleeding. Clinical investigation on admission showed lower abdominal tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness, more prominent on the right. The patient had signs of compensatory hypochromic anemia, which was attributable to menorrhagia. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (22–44 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (0.6 mg/dL) were moderately elevated. Leukocyte count was normal as was the patient’s oral temperature. Results of tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis by ligase chain reaction (LCx; Abbot Laboratories, Vienna, Austria) were negative.

Discussion

Clinical Course

A sexually active cisgender female adolescent with a two-week history of back pain presented to clinic with red urine, dysuria, nausea, and diarrhea. On examination, she was found to have CMT and negative STI screens. She was diagnosed with PID. The patient visited the ED for continued abdominal pain three days after initiating treatment for PID. Imaging ruled out tubular ovarian abscess (TOA). She later returned to her PCP’s office with improved nausea and pain.

Final Diagnosis

Pelvic inflammatory disease.

Making a Diagnosis of PID

PID is a clinical diagnosis, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends presumptive treatment for women at risk of STIs with pelvic or lower abdominal pain AND at least one of the following four criteria: (1) no other cause for the illness can be identified, (2) CMT, (3) uterine tenderness, or (4) adnexal tenderness.

Supportive examination and laboratory findings include fever, vaginal discharge with white blood cells (WBCs) on microscopy, elevated CRP and ESR, and positive STI tests. These are not required for diagnosis. This patient had abdominal pain, CMT, and mildly elevated ESR. Timely diagnosis and prompt treatment should not wait for laboratory results and are imperative to avoid complications.Frequently, as with this patient, STI results may be negative as testing for many implicated pathogens is not readily accessible (see section “Developing a Differential for Abdominal and Flank Pain in a Sexually Active Adolescent Cisgender Female”) and the available STI testing is conducted on a sample collected from the lower reproductive tract, not the upper reproductive organs.

Developing a Differential for Abdominal and Flank Pain in a Sexually Active Adolescent Cisgender Female

Several diagnoses were considered for this patient (Table 1). The differential diagnosis for PID can be even more broad.

### Spontaneously conceived 17-week heterotopic pregnancy: a challenging and unusual diagnosis [^70e8cbeb]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 37-years-old pregnant woman, gravida 2 para 1, consulted our emergency clinic at 16 2/7 weeks of amenorrhoea for abdominal pain, which started 2 days before. Her pregnancy was spontaneously conceived. She was initially treated with cefuroxime prescribed by her gynaecologist who suspected cystitis, but failed to improve. In our service, she had problem of acute left pelvic pain irradiating to the back and left thigh. The patient denied having had vaginal bleeding, urinary or digestive symptoms. She did not have any relevant medical history, except for a normal vaginal delivery 16 months earlier.

On clinical examination, her heart rate was 84 beats/min, blood pressure was 100/55 mm Hg with a temperature of 37.3°C. The abdominal wall was tender without guarding nor rebound. On pelvic examination, there was a small quantity of blood in the vagina, and no adnexal mass was palpable on bimanual examination. The uterus was measured at 17 cm, as expected for the gestational age.

Laboratory testing—Laboratory testing may clarify the suspected etiology of a pelvic mass, and pregnancy testing should be obtained in reproductive-aged women, if indicated. If an infectious etiology is suspected, a complete blood count and testing for gonorrhea and chlamydial infection should be performed, and other laboratory tests that may have value depending on the history and examination findings include urinalysis, fecal blood testing or other assessment of intestinal involvement, and serum marker testing.

Management of PID

Most patients with PID can be managed outpatient with close follow-up. The CDC recommended outpatient treatment is: ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once, doxcycline 100 mg PO BID × 14 days, and metronidazole 500 mg PO BID for 14 days.

Symptoms should improve within 72 hours after starting treatment. If symptoms do not improve within 72 hours, complications of PID should be considered, such as tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA), or the diagnosis should be re-evaluated.

We had a low threshold for diagnosing and treating this patient for PID because the risks of overtreating PID outweigh the possible complications (see section “Complications of PID”) of undertreatment.

Indications for inpatient management include TOA, pregnancy, intolerance of oral medications, intractable vomiting, and lack of improvement with outpatient treatment.

Sexual partners within the last 60 days of diagnosis should be notified, advised to seek testing, and empirically treated for gonorrhea and chlamydia, regardless of the patient’s STI test results. Patients with PID should abstain from sex until both the patient and their partner complete treatment.

Complications of PID

After a single episode of PID, one in four women will develop a complication including ectopic pregnancy, infertility, recurrent PID, and chronic pelvic pain.Women who delayed care for three or more days of symptoms were three times as likely to experience infertility or ectopic pregnancy compared with women who sought prompt care.

Establishing a Therapeutic Relationship With an Adolescent Patient Seeking Care for PID

Confidentiality

Adolescent encounters should include a review of their rights, and the limitations, to confidential care, especially because confidentiality concerns are the leading barrier to care for adolescents.Generally, adolescents can consent to confidential STI testing and treatment in all 50 US states.Providers should be familiar with or refer to state law for more information.

The patient reported that she is open with her godmother, but that she cannot share sexual health information with her mother.

Strategies:

Encourage patient to keep an honest relationship with a trusted adult about their health;
Protect patient’s note (ie, make inaccessible via patient portal);
Obtain secure phone number to directly reach patient;
Maintain close, in-person follow-upto allow the patient to speak freely with the provider.

Acute salpingitis is an uncommon cause of an acute surgical abdomen, especially in an adolescent who is not sexually active. The following is a case of a 12-year-old girl who denied sexual activity, had a remote history of an appendectomy, and a recent diagnosis of a large, right-sided ovarian cyst, who presented with acute abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, and fever. The patient was ill-appearing and progressed to uncompensated septic shock in the emergency department despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and empiric antibiotics. She ultimately underwent an exploratory laparotomy and was diagnosed with acute bilateral salpingitis. This case highlights the diagnostic dilemmas facing those caring for an adolescent girl with abdominal pain and presents an extremely rare etiology for abdominal pain in a nonsexually active adolescent.

### Genitourinary emergencies in the nonpregnant woman [^2663dbe5]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Lower abdominal and pelvic pains are common symptoms in women who present to the emergency department (ED). Once pregnancy has been ruled out, attention should focus on other potential life or fertility threats. Ultrasound remains the most helpful initial diagnostic modality. Time-sensitive and serious conditions, such as large ovarian masses or abnormal vaginal bleeding, need gynecologic consultation. Because many patients do not have access to primary care, ED physicians should be familiar with the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. However, most nonpregnant women with pelvic complaints can safely be managed in the outpatient setting after ED evaluation.

### Updated French guidelines for diagnosis and management of pelvic inflammatory disease [^6713e724]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is commonly encountered in clinical practice.

Objectives

To provide up-to-date guidelines on management of PID.

Search Strategy

An initial search of the Cochrane database, PubMed, and Embase was performed using keywords related to PID to identify reports in any language published between January 1990 and January 2012, with an update in May 2015.

Selection Criteria

All identified reports relevant to the areas of focus were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

A level of evidence based on the quality of the data available was applied for each area of focus and used for the guidelines.

Main Results

PID must be suspected when spontaneous pelvic pain is associated with induced adnexal or uterine pain (grade C). Pelvic ultrasonography is necessary to exclude tubo-ovarian abscess (grade B). Microbiological diagnosis requires vaginal and endocervical sampling for molecular and bacteriological analysis (grade B). First-line treatment for uncomplicated PID combines ofloxacin and metronidazole for 14days (grade B). Treatment of tubo-ovarian abscess is based on drainage if the collection measures more than 3cm (grade B), with combined ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and doxycycline for 14-21days.

Conclusions

Current management of PID requires easily reproducible investigations and treatment, and thus can be applied worldwide.

### Complex clinical management of group apelvic inflammatory disease after bilateral tubal ligation in a small community hospital [^33578b29]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 43-year-old woman with a history of bilateral tubal ligation and bilateral ovarian cysts presented to our hospital with progressively worsening right lower quadrant pain and abdominal distension. Her exam findings of vaginal discharge and cervical motion tenderness, in combination with her marked leucocytosis, were suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PCR for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was negative, however, our patient's blood cultures grew group A Streptococcus This exceptionally severe presentation of PID, in combination with uncommon laboratory findings, led to complex multidisciplinary clinical decision making guided by extensive literature review. Here, we present a rare case of group A Streptococcus PID after bilateral tubal ligation, and highlight the role of a family medicine primary team in the medical and surgical management of a complex case at a community hospital.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)—oral administration and completion of therapy: Because of the pain associated with intravenous (IV) infusion, doxycycline should be administered orally when possible. Oral and IV administration of doxycycline and metronidazole provide similar bioavailability, and oral metronidazole is well absorbed and can be considered instead of IV for women without severe illness or tubo-ovarian abscess when possible. After clinical improvement with parenteral therapy, transition to oral therapy with doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day and metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day is recommended to complete 14 days of antimicrobial therapy.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) laboratory testing and diagnosis—PID refers to acute and subclinical infection of the upper genital tract in females involving any or all of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries and includes any single or combination of endometritis, tuboovarian abscess, and salpingitis. PID has the highest incidence in ages 15–25 years and can be sexually transmitted (85% of cases) or naturally occurring (15%). Clinical diagnosis remains the most important practical approach, but finding symptoms on physical exam such as cervical motion tenderness and other criteria (elevated temperature or mucopurulent discharge) increases the predictive value of laboratory tests. Testing for CT/NG and consideration for syphilis and HIV are recommended in patients with PID as is a pregnancy test to rule out ectopic pregnancy in those with pelvic pain. Bacterial culture tests from specimens collected in a non-sterile manner (endocervical or dilation and curettage [D and C]) have limited utility in diagnosing PID.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^f19caa48]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

PID treatment regimens should provide empiric, broad-spectrum coverage of likely pathogens. Multiple parenteral and oral antimicrobial regimens have been effective in achieving clinical and microbiologic cure in randomized clinical trials with short-term follow-up (–). However, only a limited number of studies have assessed and compared these regimens with regard to infection elimination in the endometrium and fallopian tubes or determined the incidence of long-term complications (e.g. tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy) after antimicrobial regimens. The optimal treatment regimen and long-term outcome of early treatment of women with subclinical PID are unknown. All regimens used to treat PID should also be effective against N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis because negative endocervical screening for these organisms does not rule out upper genital tract infection. Anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from the upper genital tract of women who have PID, and data from in vitro studies have revealed that some anaerobes (e.g. Bacteroides fragilis) can cause tubal and epithelial destruction. BV is often present among women who have PID. Addition of metronidazole to IM or oral PID regimens more effectively eradicates anaerobic organisms from the upper genital tract. Until treatment regimens that do not cover anaerobic microbes have been demonstrated to prevent long-term sequelae (e.g. infertility and ectopic pregnancy) as successfully as the regimens that are effective against these microbes, using regimens with anaerobic activity should be considered. Treatment should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made because prevention of long-term sequelae is dependent on early administration of recommended antimicrobials. For women with PID of mild or moderate clinical severity, parenteral and oral regimens appear to have similar efficacy. The decision of whether hospitalization is necessary should be based on provider judgment and whether the woman meets any of the following criteria:

Surgical emergencies (e.g. appendicitis) cannot be excluded
Tubo-ovarian abscess
Pregnancy
Severe illness, nausea and vomiting, or oral temperature >38.5°C (101°F)
Unable to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regimen
No clinical response to oral antimicrobial therapy

No evidence is available to indicate that adolescents have improved outcomes from hospitalization for treatment of PID, and the clinical response to outpatient treatment is similar among younger and older women. The decision to hospitalize adolescents with acute PID should be based on the same criteria used for older women.

A pregnancy test is advised when clinically indicated. Patients should be questioned about a latex allergy or a reaction to povidone-iodine or other topical antiseptic (2%-4% chlorhexidine gluconate is a safe alternative) before the use of these products. In patients with regular cycles, a sonohysterogram or HyCoSy should be performed in the early follicular phase, as close to the end of menstrual bleeding as possible. The presence of unusual pain, lesions, or purulent vaginal or cervical discharge may require rescheduling the procedure pending further evaluation or treatment.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease [^a966e224]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection that affects 4% to 12% of young women, and is one of the most common causes of morbidity in this age group. The main intervention for acute PID is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics which cover Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and anaerobic bacteria, administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally. In this review, we assessed the optimal treatment regimen for PID.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic regimens used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group's Specialized Register, which included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1944 to 2016, located through electronic searching and handsearching; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid platform (1991 to July 2016); MEDLINE (1946 to July 2016); Embase (1947 to July 2016); LILACS, iAHx interface (1982 to July 2016); World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (July 2016); Web of Science (2001 to July 2016); OpenGrey (1990, 1992, 1995, 1996, and 1997); and abstracts in selected publications.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing the use of antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics for the treatment of PID in women of reproductive age, either as inpatient or outpatient treatment. We limited our review to comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended for consideration by the 2015 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for treatment of PID.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted investigators to obtain missing information. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by consulting a fourth review author if necessary. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria, classifying it as high, moderate, low, or very low. We calculated Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RR), using either random-effects or fixed-effect models and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome or for an additional harmful outcome, with their 95% confidence interval (CI), to measure the effect of the treatments. We conducted sensitivity analyses limited to studies at low risk of bias, for comparisons where such studies were available.

Main Results

We included 37 RCTs (6348 women). The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency, and serious imprecision. Azithromycin versus doxycyclineThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two drugs in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.55, I 2 = 72%, 2 RCTs, 243 women, very low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05, 1 RCT, 309 women, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.34, 3 RCTs, 552 women, I 2 = 0%, low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to a single study at low risk of bias, azithromycin was superior to doxycycline in achieving cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.67, 133 women, moderate-quality evidence). Quinolone versus cephalosporinThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two drugs in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10, 3 RCTs, 459 women, I 2 = 5%, low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.23, 2 RCTs, 313 women, I 2 = 7%, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.52 to 9.72, 5 RCTs, 772 women, I 2 = 0%, very low-quality evidence). Nitroimidazole versus no use of nitroimidazoleThere was no conclusive evidence of a difference between the nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) group and the group receiving other drugs with activity over anaerobes (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate) in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.10, 5 RCTs, 2427 women, I 2 = 60%, moderate-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01, 11 RCTs, 1383 women, I 2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.59; participants = 3788; studies = 16; I 2 = 0% , low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to studies at low risk of bias, findings did not differ substantially from the main analysis (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.15, 2 RCTs, 1201 women, I 2 = 32%, high-quality evidence). Clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinoloneThere was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13, 1 RCT, 25 women, very low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19, 2 studies, 151 women, I 2 = 0%, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.72, 3 RCTs, 163 women, very low-quality evidence). Clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporinThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two groups in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09, 2 RCTs, 150 women, I 2 = 0%, low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06, 10 RCTs, 959 women, I 2 = 21%, moderate-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.42, 10 RCTs, 1172 women, I 2 = 0%, very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no conclusive evidence that one regimen of antibiotics was safer or more effective than any other for the cure of PID, and there was no clear evidence for the use of nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) compared to use of other drugs with activity over anaerobes. Moderate-quality evidence from a single study at low risk of bias suggested that a macrolide (azithromycin) may be more effective than a tetracycline (doxycycline) for curing mild-moderate PID. Our review considered only the drugs that are currently used and mentioned by the CDC.

### Concerns regarding the centers for disease control's published guidelines for pelvic inflammatory disease [^1243f662]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The International-Infectious Disease Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology-USA (I-IDSOG-USA) has concerns about the most recently published Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). I-IDSOG-USA advocates the following changes when the guidelines are revised. We recommend the use of the term "upper genital tract infection" (UGTI), followed by the designation of the etiologic agent, instead of the currently employed term, "pelvic inflammatory disease," or PID. In diagnoses, there should be greater emphasis on signs and symptoms related to subclinical or occult UGTI. Therapeutic recommendation for the treatment of UGTI should be documented for various stages of this diverse disease entity. There should be greater emphasis on hospitalization for infected nulligravida teenagers. This permits monitoring of antibiotic treatment and provides a site for medical educational efforts to teach this medically underserved segment of our society how to protect their future fertility, their health, and their lives.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a substantial cause of reproductive morbidity in young women. A systematic review of the literature related to PID management was performed in preparation for the 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines. This search was conducted using PubMed and was limited to articles written in English and published between 1 January 2002 and 31 January 2005 that were related to PID treatment. Studies were evaluated for new data on PID with regard to site, route, and timing of antimicrobial administration; regimen adherence; experience in adolescents and women >35 years of age; coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus; and management of sex partners. Strong evidence suggests that neither site nor route of treatment administration affects the short- or long-term major outcome of women with mild or moderate clinical presentations. Data on these outcomes in women with more severe clinical presentations are inadequate to provide guidance as to the preferred agents or route of administration. Important contributions to the literature that impact the 2006 guidelines are described in this article.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease in the adolescent: understanding diagnosis and treatment as a health care provider [^0ef43ac3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a common clinical syndrome with highest rates in adolescents, but no studies have singularly focused on this population in relationship to established guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. The study objective was to assess knowledge of diagnosis and treatment criteria for PID within an adolescent population and to compare factors associated with adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines in outpatient settings.

Methods

Data were collected as part of a retrospective chart review of evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of sexually transmitted infections in adolescent women in an outpatient setting. Participant charts were eligible for review if they were 12 to 21 years of age and were given an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision/chart diagnosis of PID. Two primary outcome variables were utilized: meeting PID diagnosis guidelines (no/yes) and correct treatment for subject meeting criteria with guidelines (no/yes). The study controlled for race, age, medical venue, and current/past infection with gonorrhea/chlamydia.

Results

Subjects (n = 150) were examined for the primary outcome variables; 78% (117/150) met at least 1 criterion for PID diagnosis. Nearly 75% (111/150) had cervical motion tenderness, 34% (51/150) adnexal tenderness, and 5% (7/150) had uterine tenderness; nearly 11% (16/150) were positive for all 3 criteria. Symptoms associated with PID were compared for subjects meeting diagnosis criteria versus subjects not meeting diagnosis criteria: abdominal pain and vomiting were significantly associated with PID diagnosis at P < 0.05.

Conclusions

Our findings show that PID diagnosis/treatment often does not follow guidelines in the adolescent population. Pelvic inflammatory disease and cervicitis appear to be confused by providers in the diagnosis process, and educational tools may be necessary to increase the knowledge base of practitioners in regard to PID.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^42477954]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)—alternative intramuscular or oral regimens can be considered if the patient has cephalosporin allergy, the community prevalence and individual risk for gonorrhea are low, and follow-up is likely; regimens that include a quinolone agent are not recommended for PID treatment. When used, options include levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days, or azithromycin 500 mg IV daily for 1–2 doses, followed by 250 mg orally daily in combination with metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 12–14 days; moxifloxacin is the preferred quinolone antimicrobial for M. genitalium infections; however, the importance of providing coverage for M. genitalium is unknown.

### Interventions in addition to broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy for the treatment of radiologically proven tubo-ovarian abscess [^25da831a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

2. The circumstances in which additional interventions should be offered and the short‐ and long‐term outcomes associated with their use, compared to medical treatment alone, are unclear

Determining whether there is benefit from additional interventions (beyond broad‐spectrum antibiotics) for a person with a TOA is important, because there is the potential for clinical deterioration (and therefore risk of harm) if additional interventions are not performed in a timely fashion, yet additional interventions carry risk and should not be used unless there is likely to be a benefit.

Current guidance from international groups suggests there is benefit to the use of additional interventions, but does not indicate for whom, or at which stage in the clinical course of TOA, these additional interventions should be used.

British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) guidance: "Laparoscopy may help early resolution by dividing adhesions and draining pelvic abscesses, but ultrasound‐guided aspiration of pelvic fluid collections is less invasive".
American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidance: "The role of image‐guided drainage versus surgical therapy depends on the clinical severity and patient's reproductive stage. Computed tomography and ultrasound‐guided aspiration have been used successfully. Women of reproductive age may benefit from tubo‐ovarian abscess drainage".
Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidance: "Surgical treatment should be considered in severe cases or where there is clear evidence of a pelvic abscess." This guideline was recently archived and directs users to the BASHH guideline.

Without clear guidance, the approach to treatment will be clinician‐dependent, leading to potential bias in care, inefficient or ineffective use of health resources, and has the potential to perpetuate socioeconomic, ethnic, and obesity‐related health inequities. We propose that synthesising the available evidence on the use of additional interventions in TOA will be a useful first step in informing clinical guidance, and identifying evidence gaps to be addressed by future research.

3. Inadequate treatment has short‐ and long‐term consequences for women

Inadequately treated TOAs are associated with longer hospital admissions (potentially increasing healthcare costs), increased short‐term morbidity and mortality, and significant long‐term morbidities such as infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Interventions in addition to antibiotics could reduce some of these risks. This may be particularly important for those with larger masses, bilateral masses, or high fever or inflammatory markers, as observational studies have shown these to be predictive of medical treatment failure.

### Missed abortion with negative biomarkers [^af4e8143]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

First-trimester bleeding and pregnancy loss are common reasons for presentation to emergency departments. Women of childbearing age frequently receive urine and serum pregnancy tests, which are thought to be reliable markers of pregnancy.

Case Presentation

We report a case of a 34-year-old woman who presented to an emergency department with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain and was found to have negative urine and serum markers of pregnancy. A transvaginal ultrasound detected non-viable fetal tissue and the patient underwent an uncomplicated spontaneous abortion.

Conclusions

Physicians should consider the use of ultrasonography to assess for pregnancy or retained fetal products in the appropriate patient, even with negative serum or urine markers of pregnancy.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^53f47f5f]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)—transition after clindamycin plus gentamicin regimen and coverage with tubo-ovarian abscess: When using the clindamycin and gentamicin alternative parenteral regimen, women with clinical improvement after 24–28 hours can be transitioned to clindamycin (450 mg orally 4 times/day) or doxycycline (100 mg orally 2 times/day) to complete the 14-day therapy. However, when tubo-ovarian abscess is present, clindamycin (450 mg orally 4 times/day) or metronidazole (500 mg orally 2 times/day) should be used to complete 14 days of therapy with oral doxycycline to provide more effective anaerobic coverage.

### Delayed diagnosis of iliac vein thrombus in a sexually-active adolescent with Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome [^6b9f5441]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Although iliac vein thrombus is uncommon in adolescents, it can present with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) symptoms.

Case

A 19-year-old sexually active female with Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome (KTS) presented with fever, abdominal and lower extremity pain. Physical findings included cervical motion tenderness and left lower extremity swelling and erythema. The patient was admitted for PID and cellulitis. Despite antimicrobial treatment her pain continued. Neisseriae gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis cultures were negative. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scans revealed a left internal iliac vein thrombus. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated; her pain improved. On hospital day 7 she developed pulmonary emboli.

Summary and Conclusion

In sexually active adolescents with known risk factors for thromboembolism such as KTS, symptoms and signs considered characteristic for PID can be present in association with an iliac vein thrombus.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^be1a9631]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper part of the female reproductive genital tract, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and adjacent pelvic structures and may spread to the abdomen causing peritonitis, caused by bacterial infection spreading from the vagina and cervix. Occasionally, right-upper quadrant pain suggestive of inflammation and adhesion formation in the liver capsule (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome) can accompany pelvic inflammatory disease.

The sexually transmitted Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are present in many cases; however, microorganisms including the endogenous vaginal and cervical flora may also cause PID. Genital tract mycoplasmas, most importantly Mycoplasma genitalium, have recently also been implicated as a cause of acute PID. The global epidemiologic profile of pelvic inflammatory disease has not been well defined. Due to financial and logistic reasons, pelvic inflammatory disease prevention programs that are based on screening are simply unavailable in most countries, where the burden of pelvic inflammatory disease may be the greatest.

Patients with tubo-ovarian abscess that does not respond to antibiotics should undergo surgical drainage (Recommendation 1C).

Tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOA) may be a complication of PID. In women of reproductive age, TOA is one of the most common types of pelvic abscess. TOA are classically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, if antibiotic therapy is not sufficient, surgical drainage should be performed.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease [^22460cf4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) affects 4% to 12% of women of reproductive age. The main intervention for acute PID is broad-spectrum antibiotics administered intravenously, intramuscularly or orally. We assessed the optimal treatment regimen for PID.  OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic regimens to treat PID.

Search Methods

In January 2020, we searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group's Specialized Register, which included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1944 to 2020, located through hand and electronic searching; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; four other databases; and abstracts in selected publications.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics for the treatment of PID in women of reproductive age, either as inpatient or outpatient treatment. We limited our review to a comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended by the 2015 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for treatment of PID.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and conducted GRADE assessments of the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included 39 RCTs (6894 women) in this review, adding two new RCTs at this update. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency, and serious imprecision. None of the studies reported quinolones and cephalosporins, or the outcomes laparoscopic evidence of resolution of PID based on physician opinion or fertility outcomes. Length of stay results were insufficiently reported for analysis. Regimens containing azithromycin versus regimens containing doxycycline We are uncertain whether there was a clinically relevant difference between azithromycin and doxycycline in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.55; 2 RCTs, 243 women; I 2 = 72%; very low-quality evidence). The analyses may result in little or no difference between azithromycin and doxycycline in rates of severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05; 1 RCT, 309 women; low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.34; 3 RCTs, 552 women; I 2 = 0%; low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to a single study at low risk of bias, azithromycin probably improves the rates of cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.67; 133 women; moderate-quality evidence), compared to doxycycline.  Regimens containing quinolone versus regimens containing cephalosporin The analysis shows there may be little or no clinically relevant difference between quinolones and cephalosporins in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.14; 4 RCTs, 772 women; I 2 = 15%; low-quality evidence), or severe PID (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.23; 2 RCTs, 313 women; I 2 = 7%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there was a difference between quinolones and cephalosporins in adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.52 to 9.72; 6 RCTs, 1085 women; I 2 =  0%; very low-quality evidence). Regimens with nitroimidazole versus regimens without nitroimidazole There was probably little or no difference between regimens with or without nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09; 6 RCTs, 2660 women; I 2 = 50%; moderate-quality evidence), or severe PID (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01; 11 RCTs, 1383 women; I 2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). The evidence suggests that there was little to no difference in in adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.61; 17 studies, 4021 women; I 2 = 0%; low-quality evidence). . In a sensitivity analysis limited to studies at low risk of bias, there was little or no difference for rates of cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12; 3 RCTs, 1434 women; I 2 = 0%; high-quality evidence). Regimens containing clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinolone We are uncertain whether quinolone have little to no effect in  rates of cure for mild-moderate PID compared to clindamycin plus aminoglycoside (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13; 1 RCT, 25 women; very low-quality evidence). The analysis may result in little or no difference between quinolone vs. clindamycin plus aminoglycoside in severe PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19; 2 studies, 151 women; I 2 =  0%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether quinolone reduces adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.72; 3 RCTs, 163 women; I 2 =  0%; very low-quality evidence). Regimens containing clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus regimens containing cephalosporin We are uncertain whether clindamycin plus aminoglycoside improves the rates of cure for mild-moderate PID compared to cephalosporin (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09; 2 RCTs, 150 women; I 2 =  0%; low-quality evidence). There was probably little or no difference in rates of cure in severe PID with clindamycin plus aminoglycoside compared to cephalosporin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; 10 RCTs, 959 women; I 2 = 21%; moderate-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether clindamycin plus aminoglycoside reduces adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment compared to cephalosporin (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.42; 10 RCTs, 1172 women; I 2 =  0%; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain whether one treatment was safer or more effective than any other for the cure of mild-moderate or severe PID Based on a single study at a low risk of bias, a macrolide (azithromycin) probably improves the rates of cure of mild-moderate PID, compared to tetracycline (doxycycline).

### Identification and treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and associated sequelae [^f04d5db6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an ascending polymicrobial infection of the upper female genital tract. The presentation of PID varies from asymptomatic cases to severe sepsis. The diagnosis of PID is often one of exclusion. Primary treatment for PID includes broad-spectrum antibiotics with coverage against gonorrhea, chlamydia, and common anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. If not clinically improved by antibiotics, percutaneous drain placement can promote efficient source control, as is often the case with large tubo-ovarian abscesses. Ultimately, even with treatment, PID can result in long-term morbidity, including chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)—alternative parenteral regimens and when to add anaerobic coverage: Only limited data support other parenteral second- or third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftizoxime or cefotaxime); because these cephalosporins are less active than cefotetan or cefoxitin against anaerobes, the addition of metronidazole should be considered. Ampicillin-sulbactam plus doxycycline has been investigated and is effective against C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and anaerobes for women with tubo-ovarian abscess. Dosed alternatives include: Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV every 6 hours plus Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours; or Clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours plus Gentamicin loading dose IV or IM (2 mg/kg body weight), followed by a maintenance dose (1.5 mg/kg body weight) every 8 hours; single daily dosing (3–5 mg/kg body weight) can be substituted.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^464ef88c]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

We used Cochrane methodology,following our published protocol.

Methods for identification of studies

We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group’s Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily Update, Embase, LILACS and Web of Science up to July 2016. The complete search strategy is available in the Cochrane review.We screened the reference lists of all identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and previous systematic reviews on similar topics for additional relevant articles. Furthermore, we searched trial registers, conference proceeding abstracts and grey literature. We contacted the authors of all RCTs identified by other methods, as well as pharmaceutical companies producing ‘antibiotic therapy’ for ‘pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)’.

Types of studies

We included RCTs, including those which did not describe their method of randomisation (ie, where the authors stated that treatment was randomised without providing further details). Trials were included irrespective of publication status, publication year or language. We excluded quasi-randomised trials because they produce effects estimates indicating more extreme benefits when compared with RCTs.We also excluded cross-over and cluster trials.

Selection of studies

Two review authors (DGF and RVD) performed an initial screen of titles and abstracts retrieved by the search, and we retrieved the full text of all potentially eligible studies. Two review authors (DGF and RVD) independently examined these studies for compliance with the inclusion criteria and selected studies that met these criteria. Disagreements regarding eligibility were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author (JR).

Inclusion criteria

RCTs were included in the review if the women participating in the trial were of reproductive age (14 years of age or older) diagnosed as having acute PID (symptoms for less than 6 weeks) based on clinical findings, laparoscopy, endometrial biopsy, or detectable N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis in the upper genital tract. We limited our review to comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended for consideration by the 2015 CDC guidelines for treatment of PID.

### Levonorgestrel (mirena) [^07b266f4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4 Pelvic Infection

Promptly examine users with complaints of lower abdominal or pelvic pain, odorous discharge, unexplained bleeding, fever, genital lesions or sores. Remove Mirena in cases of recurrent endometritis or PID, or if an acute pelvic infection is severe or does not respond to treatment.

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)

Mirena is contraindicated in the presence of known or suspected PID or in women with a history of PID unless there has been a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy [see Contraindications (4)]. IUDs have been associated with an increased risk of PID, most likely due to organisms being introduced into the uterus during insertion. In clinical trials, total combined upper genital infections were reported in 3.5% of Mirena users. More specifically, endometritis was reported in 2.1%, PID in 0.6%, and all other upper genital infections in ≤0.5% of women overall. These infections occurred more frequently within the first year. In a clinical trial with other IUDs1and a clinical trial with an IUD similar to Mirena, the highest rate occurred within the first month after insertion.

Women at increased risk for PID

PID is often associated with a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and Mirena does not protect against STI. The risk of PID is greater for women who have multiple sexual partners, and also for women whose sexual partner(s) have multiple sexual partners. Women who have had PID are at increased risk for a recurrence or re-infection. In particular, ascertain whether the woman is at increased risk of infection (for example, leukemia, acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS], intravenous drug abuse).

Subclinical PID

PID may be asymptomatic but still result in tubal damage and its sequelae.

Treatment of PID

Following a diagnosis of PID, or suspected PID, bacteriologic specimens should be obtained, and antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly. Removal of Mirena after initiation of antibiotic therapy is usually appropriate.1

Actinomycosis

Actinomycosis has been associated with IUDs. Remove Mirena from symptomatic women and treat with antibiotics. The significance of actinomyces-like organisms on Pap smear in an asymptomatic IUD user is unknown, and so this finding alone does not always require Mirena removal and treatment. When possible, confirm a Pap smear diagnosis with cultures.

Case Study

A 40-year-old woman, with no significant medical history, was seen at the emergency room because of worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain. The pain, which had started a few days previously, was constant, localized to the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, and described as dull and moderately to severely intense. The pain was not related to meals or bowel movements and was not accentuated or relieved by any specific position. The patient noted constipation but had no nausea or vomiting. No rectal bleed or melena occurred, and she reported no urinary symptoms or vaginal discharge. Her last normal menstrual period was 8 days before. She felt warm but did not check her temperature and did not experience chills. Her primary medical physician prescribed ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day for the presumptive diagnosis of colitis. She took the antibiotic for 2 days without improvement.

In the emergency room, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. The physical examination showed tenderness on palpation of the left lower quadrant of the abdomen with minimal rebound tenderness. The pelvic examination showed left adnexal tenderness with a possible mass. Results of urinalysis and a urine pregnancy test were negative. No leukocytosis was noted. A pelvic ultrasonograph showed a left ovarian complex mass measuring 14 cm x 9 cm x 6 cm as well as a moderate amount of free fluid in the cul-de-sac. The study suggested left ovarian mass torsion. A laparascopic resection was performed successfully. The patient received intravenous cefazolin perioperatively. The final pathology report showed a mature teratoma of the left ovary featuring dermoid cyst, respiratory anlaga, and struma ovarii. The patient improved and was discharged 2 days after surgery.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1ed7c963]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) treatment principles—PID treatment regimens should provide empiric, broad-spectrum coverage of likely pathogens, and multiple parenteral and oral antimicrobial regimens have been effective in achieving clinical and microbiologic cure in randomized clinical trials with short-term follow-up. However, only a limited number of studies have assessed and compared these regimens with regard to infection elimination in the endometrium and fallopian tubes or determined the incidence of long-term complications after antimicrobial regimens, and the optimal treatment regimen and long-term outcome of early treatment of women with subclinical PID are unknown. All regimens used to treat PID should also be effective against N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis because negative endocervical screening for these organisms does not rule out upper genital tract infection. Anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from the upper genital tract of women who have PID, some anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis can cause tubal and epithelial destruction, and BV is often present among women who have PID.

### Levonorgestrel (Liletta) [^55e427e6]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.4 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease or Endometritis

Insertion of LILETTA is contraindicated in the presence of known or suspected PID or endometritis. As well, it is contraindicated in patients with untreated acute cervicitis or vaginitis (including bacterial vaginosis), known chlamydial or gonococcal cervical infection, or other known lower genital tract infections, until the infection is controlled . IUSs have been associated with an increased risk of PID, most likely due to organisms being introduced into the uterus during insertion. Assess risk factors for infection accordingly.

Patients who use LILETTA should be counseled to promptly notify a healthcare professional if they develop lower abdominal or pelvic pain, fever, chills, unusual or malodorous discharge, unexplained bleeding, genital lesions or sores, or dyspareunia. In such circumstances, perform a pelvic examination promptly to evaluate for possible pelvic infection. Remove LILETTA in cases of recurrent PID or endometritis, or if an acute pelvic infection is severe or does not respond to treatment.

In the clinical study on contraception with LILETTA, pelvic infection was diagnosed in 0.8% of participants. Pelvic infection was diagnosed as PID in 0.5% of participants and as endometritis in 0.3% of participants. Infections occurred following variable duration-of-use. One participant diagnosed with PID and two participants diagnosed with endometritis developed the infection within a week of LILETTA insertion. One case of endometritis was diagnosed at 39 days after LILETTA insertion. The remaining 11 cases of PID and endometritis were diagnosed more than six months after insertion, including one at 30 days after IUS removal. In the clinical study on heavy menstrual bleeding with LILETTA, there was one participant diagnosed with PID approximately 5 months after LILETTA insertion.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: how should it be managed? [^cc0690d8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the published literature on pelvic inflammatory disease over the past year and put into context the major findings.

Recent Findings

remains the commonest identified cause of pelvic inflammatory disease, and yet our understanding of how it causes mucosal damage and the factors explaining why only a subgroup of women develop pelvic inflammatory disease are not known. The increasing evidence for a chlamydial toxin may help to explain how tissue damage occurs and the indolent nature of many chlamydial infections. The evidence for as an important sexually transmitted cause of pelvic inflammatory disease is growing, with implications for treatment regimens and diagnostic testing. Power Doppler ultrasound has been reported to be both sensitive and specific in diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease, although larger studies are needed to confirm these early results. Outpatient treatment with cefoxitin and doxycycline appears to be as effective when given in an outpatient setting compared with inpatient management with the same agents in a large randomized controlled trial with almost 3 years' follow-up.

Summary

There remain many gaps in our knowledge of pelvic inflammatory disease, but the reviewed studies increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of infection, and offer the possibility of better diagnosis and reassurance about the long-term success of antibiotic treatment.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease [^35eb42c9]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic inflammatory disease is caused by infection of the upper female genital tract and is often asymptomatic. Pelvic inflammatory disease is the most common gynaecological reason for admission to hospital in the USA and is diagnosed in almost 2% of women aged 16-45 years consulting their GP in England and Wales.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical treatment compared with treatment delayed until the results of microbiological investigations are known? How do different antimicrobial regimens compare? What are the effects of routine antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease before intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD)8 insertion? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 9 systematic reviews, RCTs or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (oral, parenteral, empirical treatment, treatment guided by test results, different durations, outpatient, inpatient), and routine antibiotic prophylaxis (before intrauterine device insertion in women at high risk or low risk).

Case presentation

A 25-year-old patient, gravida 1, para 0, first presented to the regional hospital at 16 weeks of gestation and with chief complaints of vaginal bloody discharge for 6 days, unable to urinate, and mild lower abdominal pain. The patient was diagnosed with lymphatic tuberculosis at 17 years of age, but had no history of sexually transmitted diseases, pelvic inflammatory diseases, endometriosis, uterine leiomyomas, deep sacral concavity, surgery, or congenital uterine malformations, such as uterus didelphys. The patient experienced infertility for two years caused by bilateral obstruction of the fallopian tubes with uterine retroversion, which was detected by hystero-salpingo-graphy in the regional hospital. She eventually became pregnant by follicular aspiration and IVF-ET, and had been treated with daily intramuscular progesterone since the procedure. Subsequent ultrasound scans revealed normal pregnancy progression.

### Levonorgestrel (kyleena) [^a9b14e4b]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.4 Pelvic Infection

Promptly examine users with complaints of lower abdominal or pelvic pain, odorous discharge, unexplained bleeding, fever, genital lesions or sores. Remove Kyleena in cases of recurrent endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease, or if an acute pelvic infection is severe or does not respond to treatment.

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)

Kyleena is contraindicated in the presence of known or suspected PID or in women with a history of PID unless there has been a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy [see Contraindications (4)] . IUDs have been associated with an increased risk of PID, most likely due to organisms being introduced into the uterus during insertion. In clinical trials, PID was observed in 0.5% of women overall and occurred more frequently within the first year and most often within the first month after insertion of Kyleena.

Women at increased risk for PID

PID is often associated with a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and Kyleena does not protect against STI. The risk of PID is greater for women who have multiple sexual partners, and also for women whose sexual partner(s) have multiple sexual partners. Women who have had PID are at increased risk for a recurrence or re-infection. In particular, ascertain whether the woman is at increased risk of infection (for example, leukemia, acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS], intravenous drug abuse).

Subclinical PID

PID may be asymptomatic but still result in tubal damage and its sequelae.

Treatment of PID

Following a diagnosis of PID, or suspected PID, bacteriologic specimens should be obtained, and antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly. Removal of Kyleena after initiation of antibiotic therapy is usually appropriate.1

Actinomycosis

Actinomycosis has been associated with IUDs. Remove Kyleena from symptomatic women and treat with antibiotics. The significance of actinomyces-like organisms on Pap smear in an asymptomatic IUD user is unknown, and so this finding alone does not always require Kyleena removal and treatment. When possible, confirm a Pap smear diagnosis with cultures.

We report the case of a 20-year-old female who presented to the ER with a 1-week history of worsening abdominal pain and intermittent vaginal bleeding for the previous 5 days. Physical exam was notable for bilateral adnexal tenderness and a closed cervix without motion tenderness or discharge. Laboratory data demonstrated a beta HCG level of 7,787 IU/L, and pelvic ultrasound with transvaginal imaging was subsequently performed. Neither an adnexal mass nor a normal intrauterine pregnancy was demonstrable; however, a focal right fundal 7-cm area of heterogeneous echogenicity was observed. Initial findings were felt indeterminate with considerations including potential degenerating leiomyoma coexistent with a nonvisualized intrauterine pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or recent spontaneous abortion versus atypical interstitial ectopic pregnancy. The patient, initially declining further clinical intervention, returned within 24 h with continued pain. A repeat ultrasound demonstrated a relatively static and unchanged appearance with only a minimal concurrent interval increase in beta HCG levels. MRI was performed for further elucidation and demonstrated a heterogeneously hypervascular right fundal interstitial 6-cm mass, which, in the clinical context, was most suspicious for an ectopic pregnancy. Confirmatory laparoscopic cornual wedge resection and salpingectomy was subsequently performed.

PID is a common infection in reproductive-age women that presents an enormous public health and economic burden. It is responsible for much short- and long-term morbidity that may necessitate interventions subsequent to the original infection. Mild PID seems to be much more common than severe or "classic" PID, and the importance of early recognition and treatment cannot be understated. Current treatment regimens seem to be effective in terms of immediate clinical efficacy. As we learn more about the frequency and importance of subclinical PID, the true burden of upper genital tract infection upon reproductive age women continues to be elucidated.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect young people, with more than half of the infections occurring in youth aged 15 to 25 years. (1)(2) This review, the second in a 2-part series on STIs, focuses on infections that may cause abnormal vaginal or penile discharge, including trichomonas, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Most infected persons, however, are asymptomatic. Nucleic acid amplification tests are the most sensitive and specific for the detection of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis, and they can be performed on provider- or patient-collected swabs. Providers should have a low threshold for diagnosing and treating PID because untreated PID can have serious long-term complications for young women. Indications for hospitalization for PID include the presence of a tubo-ovarian abscess, severe illness with systemic symptoms, pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and failure to respond to outpatient oral treatment (within 48-72 hours) or inability to tolerate the oral treatment.

A 22-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with right lower abdominal pain. A CT scan suggested potential appendicitis and perforation. She had no relevant medical or surgical history, and she last had vaginal sex 4 years prior to admission. During surgery, turbid fluid, secondary inflammatory changes, and dilated, fluid-filled fallopian tubes pointed to a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), so she was started on azithromycin, metronidazole and piperacillin/tazobactam. The following day, she continued to have abdominal pain and developed tachycardia, hypotension, a marked leukemoid response, haemoconcentration, third space fluid accumulation and acidosis. Culture results led to her being further diagnosed with Clostridium perfringens PID with peritonitis and toxic shock syndrome. A gynaecological infection of C. perfringens leading to toxic shock syndrome is both extremely rare and highly fatal. Her antibiotics were changed to meropenem and clindamycin, and she slowly made a full recovery.

### Leptotrichia amnionii and the female reproductive tract [^a4ddba9b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Detection of new bacteria, human complex microflora, by using 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing has been reported. 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing detected pyosalpinx, caused by Leptotrichia amnioni, in a patient whose samples were culture-negative.

This anaerobic gram-negative bacterium has been isolated only once before. A 41-year-old woman from the island of Comoros who had been having lower abdominal pain for 6 days was admitted to the emergency department of Hôpital Nord in Marseille. The patient's history included type 2 diabetes mellitus treated by metformin and laparoscopy to explore infertility. On examination, the patient had a pulse rate of 90 beats per min, a blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg, and a temperature of 38.5°C. Her abdomen was not distended, but diffused lower abdominal tenderness, especially at the right iliac fossa, was present. Blood testing showed a leukocyte count of 7.7x10 9 /L, hemoglobin of 13.1g/dL, and platelet count of 213x10 9 /L. The chemistry panel showed hyperglycemia (14.1 mmol/L) and elevated C-reactive protein (254 mg/L). Renal and liver function test results were all within normal limits. Serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed two septated adnexal masses, a 12x7x5 cm mass on the right and a 6x4x2 cm mass on the left; the patient was referred to the gynecologic surgery department. Gynecologic examination showed greenish, purulent vaginal discharge and a fluctuant mass in the pouch of Douglas. Uterine cervical motion caused pain to the patient. Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound scan showed a 10x7x5 cm homogeneous liquid mass in the pouch of Douglas.

Quality of the evidence

Most of the 37 included studies had unclear or high risk of bias in most domains, and only three were at low risk of bias in most domains.The overall quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency and serious imprecision. The only high-quality evidence was for the sensitivity analysis regarding the use (or not) of nitroimidazole. There was moderate-quality evidence in the sensitivity analysis regarding the use of azithromycin in mild-moderate cases of PID, in comparisons between the use or not of nitroimidazole for curing mild-moderate or severe PID, and in comparisons between clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporins for curing severe PID.

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The safety of Tri-Lo-Marzia was evaluated in 1,723 subjects who participated in a randomized, partially blinded, multicenter, active-controlled clinical trial of Tri-Lo-Marzia for contraception. This trial examined healthy, nonpregnant, volunteers aged 18 to 45 (nonsmoker if 35 to 45 years of age), who were sexually active with regular coitus. Subjects were followed for up to 13 28-day cycles.

Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects)

The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,723 women using the 28-day regimen were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (30.5%), nausea/vomiting (16.3%); breast issues (including tenderness, pain, enlargement, swelling, discharge, discomfort, cyst, and nipple pain) (10.3%), abdominal pain (9.2%), menstrual disorders (including dysmenorrhea, menstrual discomfort, menstrual disorder) (9.2%), mood disorders (including depression, mood altered, mood swings and depressed mood) (7.6%); acne (5.1%), vulvovaginal infection (3.5%), abdominal distension (2.8%), weight increased (2.4%), fatigue (2.1%).

Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation

In the clinical trial of Tri-Lo-Marzia 4% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache/migraine (1.2%), nausea/vomiting (0.7%), cervical dysplasia (0.7%), abdominal pain (0.4%), ovarian cyst (0.3%), acne (0.2%), flatulence (0.2%) and depression (0.2%).

Serious Adverse Reactions
