## Question

how to manage mixed growth on urine culture?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage mixed growth on urine culture. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient has symptoms or risk factors that make mixed growth more or less likely to be contamination. Then, I should verify the quality of the specimen and the pre-analytic handling. Next, I will interpret the culture details, including the number of species, colony counts, and presence of pyuria. After that, I need to decide whether to treat, repeat culture, or observe, integrating special populations and stewardship principles. Finally, I will outline documentation, follow-up, and when to escalate to advanced diagnostics or procedures, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because management hinges on whether the patient is symptomatic and what risk factors are present. In symptomatic patients, mixed growth may still reflect true infection, whereas in asymptomatic patients it is more often contamination or asymptomatic bacteriuria, and I should not jump to treatment without correlating with symptoms and urinalysis findings [^115U41GU] [^1168RwuQ] [^115cn9bG].

> Wait, let me verify the specimen quality and pre-analytic handling before interpreting any growth. I need to check the collection method, time to processing, and whether refrigeration or preservative was used, because delayed processing and poor technique increase contamination and mixed growth, and three or more species on a voided specimen typically signals contamination, especially if colony counts are low and epithelial cells are abundant [^115U41GU] [^1164EPRW] [^112sG6yq].

> Hold on, I should verify the culture details next. I will examine how many species are present, whether any recognized uropathogen predominates, and the quantitative colony counts, keeping in mind that standard thresholds vary by collection method and population, with many labs using 10⁵ CFU/mL for voided specimens but accepting 10²–10⁴ CFU/mL in symptomatic patients or with catheterized specimens, and I should also look for pyuria because its presence strengthens the case for true infection when mixed growth is present [^114vh2Xz] [^113b4o2G] [^115U41GU].

> I need to ensure I integrate urinalysis with the culture. Pyuria supports a true infection when mixed growth is seen, whereas its absence makes contamination or asymptomatic bacteriuria more likely, and I should double-check for squamous epithelial cells as a marker of contamination, though I must remember that urothelial shedding can occur in infection and complicate interpretation, so I should not overcall contamination solely based on epithelial cells [^115U41GU] [^1168RwuQ] [^1128r6XC].

> Let me consider the likely scenarios. If the patient is asymptomatic with mixed growth and no pyuria, I should avoid antibiotics and avoid repeating the culture unless new symptoms arise, because treating asymptomatic bacteriuria is harmful except in pregnancy or before urologic procedures, and I should document the rationale clearly to support stewardship [^115cn9bG] [^111gDBjm] [^115wpVNC].

> But wait, what if the patient is symptomatic with mixed growth and pyuria? In that case I should not dismiss the culture as contamination automatically, and I should obtain a repeat specimen using a catheterized technique to clarify the pathogen, because straight catheterization reduces mixed growth and contamination compared with midstream collection, and if symptoms are severe or systemic, I may start empiric therapy while awaiting repeat culture results, aligning with diagnostic stewardship and guideline pathways [^113jgBXL] [^1143hS1B] [^1168RwuQ].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations. In children, mixed growth is common with bag or poor-quality specimens, so I should repeat with catheterization or suprapubic aspiration when UTI is suspected, and in pregnancy, mixed growth may mask true bacteriuria, so a repeat culture is prudent if symptoms or risk factors are present, whereas in long-term catheterized patients, polymicrobial bacteriuria is expected and cultures should be obtained from a freshly replaced catheter before antibiotics to avoid overtreatment [^113GjHXA] [^116kZq4n] [^116gHYk5].

> I should double-check stewardship actions. If I suspect contamination, I will add a comment to the chart and communicate with the team to avoid reflex antibiotics, and if I obtain a repeat culture, I will request targeted identification of the predominant organism and susceptibilities rather than full workup of all species, and I will avoid treating based on mixed growth reports alone without supportive urinalysis or symptoms [^1164EPRW] [^112gzUrA] [^1168RwuQ].

> Let me reconsider the role of advanced diagnostics. If symptoms persist and cultures repeatedly show mixed growth or no growth despite pyuria, I should consider expanded quantitative urine culture or molecular methods in research or reference lab settings, recognizing that EQUC and sequencing can detect fastidious or low-abundance uropathogens but may also detect colonization, so results must be interpreted in clinical context and are not yet standard of care for routine diagnosis [^117K4eHt] [^113YVYB8] [^111oiwTz].

> Next, I should review follow-up. If I started empiric therapy based on strong clinical suspicion, I will narrow or stop therapy when the repeat culture clarifies the pathogen or shows no uropathogen, and if symptoms persist beyond 7 days, I will repeat cultures and reassess for alternative diagnoses or resistant organisms, documenting the decision points and rationale to support safe de-escalation or discontinuation of antibiotics [^113EKioz] [^112bPvv4] [^1168RwuQ].

> Finally, I need to ensure my documentation captures the clinical context, specimen quality, culture details, urinalysis correlation, decision rationale, and follow-up plan, and I should communicate clearly with nursing and the laboratory about collection technique and stewardship goals to reduce repeat contamination and unnecessary treatment, aligning with best practices for diagnostic stewardship and patient safety [^112gzUrA] [^1168RwuQ] [^115U41GU].

Mixed growth on urine culture most often reflects **contamination** from poor collection technique or delayed processing, especially with ≥ 3 organisms or low counts of skin/urogenital flora [^115U41GU] [^112X9ECx]. It can also indicate **true polymicrobial infection** in high-risk patients (e.g. elderly, diabetic, immunocompromised, neurogenic bladder, chronic catheters) or when a predominant pathogen is present with pyuria [^112BJtyx] [^115JBH9g]. Management should be guided by symptoms, urinalysis, and clinical context: **repeat a clean-catch or catheterized specimen** if contamination is suspected; treat only if symptoms and pyuria support infection, targeting the predominant pathogen; and avoid treating asymptomatic mixed growth or colonization to prevent overtreatment and resistance [^113jgBXL] [^111gDBjm].

---

## Clinical significance of mixed growth

Mixed growth can reflect **contamination** — most commonly from poor collection technique, delayed processing, or improper storage — or **true infection**, particularly in patients with risk factors such as diabetes, immunocompromise, neurogenic bladder, chronic indwelling catheters, or structural abnormalities [^115U41GU] [^115JBH9g].

---

## Differentiating contamination from true infection

Several factors help distinguish contamination from true infection:

| **Factor** | **Contamination** | **True infection** |
|-|-|-|
| Number of organisms | ≥ 3 different species | 1–2 predominant species |
| Colony count | Low (< 10⁴ CFU/mL) | High (> 10⁵ CFU/mL) |
| Organism identity | Skin/urogenital flora (e.g. Lactobacillus, Corynebacterium, coagulase-negative staphylococci) | Recognized uropathogens (e.g. E. coli, Proteus, Klebsiella, Enterococcus) |
| Clinical symptoms | Absent or nonspecific | Present (dysuria, frequency, urgency, fever, flank pain) |
| Urinalysis | No pyuria | Pyuria (WBCs ≥ 10/hpf) |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **clinical context** when interpreting mixed growth:

- **Contamination**: Suspect when ≥ 3 organisms are present, counts are low, or typical skin/urogenital flora are identified, especially in asymptomatic patients [^113jgBXL] [^112X9ECx].
- **True infection**: Consider when a predominant pathogen is present with pyuria and compatible symptoms, particularly in high-risk patients [^112BJtyx] [^114vh2Xz].
- **Repeat culture**: Obtain a repeat clean-catch or catheterized specimen if contamination is suspected, before initiating antibiotics [^113jgBXL] [^1143hS1B].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on **clinical context**:

- **Asymptomatic patients**: Do not treat; avoid antibiotics to prevent overtreatment and resistance [^111gDBjm] [^115cn9bG].
- **Symptomatic patients**: Treat if symptoms and pyuria are present, targeting the predominant pathogen based on susceptibilities [^1168RwuQ] [^112bPvv4].
- **High-risk patients**: Consider broader coverage for polymicrobial infections, then de-escalate based on cultures [^112bPvv4].
- **Catheterized patients**: Replace the catheter before culture; treat only if symptomatic or if the patient is high risk [^116gHYk5] [^115wpVNC].

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks

Inappropriately treating mixed growth can cause **unnecessary antibiotic exposure**, resistance, adverse effects, and C. difficile infection, whereas undertreating true polymicrobial infection can delay recovery, worsen illness, and increase complications [^111gDBjm] [^114NonCc].

---

## Preventive measures

To minimize mixed growth, use **proper collection technique** — midstream clean-catch or catheterized specimens with prompt processing — and provide **patient education** on correct collection methods [^115U41GU] [^1143hS1B].

---

Mixed growth on urine culture is common and often reflects contamination; **treat only when symptoms, pyuria, and a predominant pathogen align**, and repeat culture when contamination is suspected to avoid overtreatment and resistance [^113jgBXL] [^111gDBjm].

### Evaluation of an image analysis device (APAS) for screening urine cultures [^114bYGPB]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Culture and processing.

Urine cultures were prepared by inoculating 1 μl of well-mixed urine onto standard 90-mm plates of trypticase soy agar with sheep blood and MacConkey agar with crystal violet (Remel, Lenexa, KS, USA). The plates were incubated aerobically for 18 h at 35°C.

Following incubation, a reference panel of three experienced microbiologists independently and outside the routine workflow recorded the amount of growth and the colony morphologies found on the plates. The growth enumeration was estimated for the 1-μl inoculum and recorded in CFU per milliliter, while the colony morphologies present on each plate were reported as described in Table 1. A fourth microbiologist presented the plates to APAS for imaging and analysis.

The urine leukocyte counts obtained by the laboratory's standard method were electronically transferred to the device for use within the decision algorithm. A pyuria flag, defined as ≥ 50 × 10³ leukocytes/ml, was used by the device to indicate possible cases of sterile pyuria. These cases were then reported by APAS as requiring further review by a microbiologist if growth was not detected.

Results generated by the laboratory from the routine workflow for the urine samples enrolled in the study were filed for comparison with the APAS results.

Analysis.

An independent statistician (Emphron Informatics Pty Ltd. Brisbane, Australia) analyzed the results by comparing the APAS findings with the consensus results from the reference panel. Where differences in individual panel member reports were present, a majority finding was used.

Performance values for growth detection, enumeration, and the differentiation of colony morphologies using sensitivity and specificity calculations were obtained. Sensitivity was defined as the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus false negatives expressed as a percentage, and specificity was the number of true negatives divided by the number of true negatives plus false positives and expressed as a percentage.

APAS and the reference panel interpreted the results by the application of published guidelines.

An additional analysis was also performed to assess the ability of APAS to detect specific uropathogens. This was done by comparing the results from the device with the final reports issued by the laboratory.

Cystitis and pyelonephritis — quantitative urine culture thresholds and test utilization specify that the standardized threshold in symptomatic patients is > 100 000 CFU/mL for organisms identified as common pathogens, though many sites now use either 10 000 CFU/mL or 1000 CFU/mL based on the method of collection or patient population as a baseline for culture workup and clinical significance. Laboratories typically provide antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for potential pathogens recovered in significant gram numbers as part of standard laboratory protocol. The Gram stain is not routinely utilized for the diagnosis of uncomplicated urinary tract infection, but it may have limited utility in patients with febrile urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis, prostatitis, urosepsis) where high numbers of gram-negative bacilli may be present in urine screen. Because urine may be readily contaminated with urogenital microbiota, proper specimen collection is essential for urine culture and should be performed using a process that minimizes contamination from the perineal and superficial mucosal microbiota.

### Optimal urine culture diagnostic stewardship practice-results from an expert modified-Delphi procedure [^112gzUrA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Urine cultures are nonspecific and often lead to misdiagnosis of urinary tract infection and unnecessary antibiotics. Diagnostic stewardship is a set of procedures that modifies test ordering, processing, and reporting in order to optimize diagnosis and downstream treatment. In this study, we aimed to develop expert guidance on best practices for urine culture diagnostic stewardship.

Methods

A RAND-modified Delphi approach with a multidisciplinary expert panel was used to ascertain diagnostic stewardship best practices. Clinical questions to guide recommendations were grouped into three thematic areas (ordering, processing, reporting) in practice settings of emergency department, inpatient, ambulatory, and long-term care. Fifteen experts ranked recommendations on a 9-point Likert scale. Recommendations on which the panel did not reach agreement were discussed during a virtual meeting, then a second round of ranking by email was completed. After secondary review of results and panel discussion, a series of guidance statements was developed.

Results

One hundred and sixty-five questions were reviewed. The panel reaching agreement on 104, leading to 18 overarching guidance statements. The following strategies were recommended to optimize ordering urine cultures: requiring documentation of symptoms, sending alerts to discourage ordering in the absence of symptoms, and cancelling repeat cultures. For urine culture processing, conditional urine cultures and urine white blood cell count as criteria were supported. For urine culture reporting, appropriate practices included nudges to discourage treatment under specific conditions and selective reporting of antibiotics to guide therapy decisions.

Conclusions

These 18 guidance statements can optimize use of urine cultures for better patient outcomes.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^112bPvv4]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Selection of definitive antibiotic therapy for complicated UTI — In patients with confirmed complicated UTI, we suggest selecting a definitive effective antibiotic with a targeted spectrum based on the results of urine culture (identification and susceptibility) as soon as these are available, rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for the complete duration of treatment (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

KAS 15 — urine specimen collection and culture pathway: Clinicians Should Obtain Urine Specimen by Bag, Spontaneous Void, or Stimulated Void for Urinalysis and, If Urinalysis Result Is Positive, Obtain a Catheterization or SPA Specimen for Culture, or Obtain Urine Specimen by Catheterization or SPA of Bladder for Urinalysis and, if Result Is Positive, for Culture. Evidence Quality: A, Strong Recommendation. A positive urinalysis result prompts initiation of empirical antimicrobial therapy, whereas a negative urinalysis result signifies a low likelihood of a UTI and obviates catheterization or SPA (if not already performed). Parents opposed to catheterization should be offered a choice of SPA and informed about the higher rate of ambiguous or false-positive culture results obtained from bagged or voided specimens.

### Practical bench comparison of BBL CHROMagar orientation and standard two-plate media for urine cultures [^112FPfhU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

A total of 1023 urine samples sent for routine culture were plated onto sheep blood and MacConkey agars and a BBL CHROMagar Orientation (CO; Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) plate, and the results were compared. Of these, 250 urine samples (24%) grew > 10000 CFU of one or two putative pathogens/ml and 773 showed no growth (NG), mixed growth of < 10000 CFU/ml, or three or more strains (mixed). The CO and conventional medium results agreed completely for 595 cultures with NG or < 10000 CFU/ml. An additional 178 urine samples yielded clinically insignificant differences. Both medium sets essentially agreed on quantities and identification for 400 single-pathogen cultures and 9 mixed cultures. With the caveat that CO cannot differentiate Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Serratia spp., enteric pathogens were identified only by morphology and color on CO. Direct visual differentiation of group B streptococci from lactobacilli is not possible, but lactobacillus cells always exhibited easily recognizable morphology on Gram stain. Of 108 paired organism susceptibility results encompassing 2268 drug-pathogen combinations, there were 3% errors and only 1% very major errors. Use of CO allowed a > 50% reduction in inoculation time and a > 20% reduction in work-up time. For our laboratory, with 50% "no growth" and ca. 25% significant results (50% Escherichia coli), CO allowed time and workup cost savings for a majority of cultures. A cost analysis (time and supplies for our laboratory) showed that if CO is used alone, the break-even level for CO pricing is US dollars 1.78; if CO and blood agar are both used, the break-even pricing for CO is US dollars 1.53.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^113jmeZF]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

KAS 8 — Urine testing pathway — "Clinicians should obtain urine specimen by catheterization or SPA of bladder for urinalysis and, if urinalysis result is positive, for culture or should obtain urine specimen by bag, spontaneous void, or stimulated void for urinalysis and, if urinalysis is positive, obtain a catheterization or SPA specimen for culture. Evidence Quality: A; Strong Recommendation". Benefits include identification of UTIs, and risks include falsely positive culture results or misdiagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria leading to unnecessary or harmful treatment, plus discomfort from catheterization or SPA; the benefit–harm assessment is "Preponderance of benefit". Parents opposed to catheterization should be offered SPA and informed about higher rates of ambiguous or false-positive culture results from bagged or voided specimens, and that a false-positive urine culture can prolong antimicrobial administration and hospitalization.

### A performance comparison of the fully automated urine particle analyzer UF-5000 with UF-1000i and Gram staining in predicting bacterial growth patterns in women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^112zxHMN]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection is a common infectious disease that can cause a significant health care burden, although most cases are uncomplicated infections. It is estimated that 50–60% of women will go through one or more episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (uUTI) in their lifetime. uUTIs usually cause minor symptoms and are rarely life-threatening. However, uUTIs impair quality of life because of their irritative symptoms. uUTIs are diagnosed following the occurrence of positive clinical symptoms and positive urine cultures. The bacterial species that lead to urinary tract infections include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Enterobacter spp. Proteus spp. Pseudomonas spp. Enterococcus spp. Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. However, it takes 1–2 days to obtain the results of urine cultures and there is a high contamination rate (0.8–41.6%) during the collection process, which can make interpreting the results difficult or irrelevant. Some experts have suggested that mixed growth in a urine culture may occur among the elderly, the immunocompromised, and those with indwelling catheters, HIV, malignancy, and diabetes, but these findings are more commonly regarded as contamination. Manual gram staining of urine specimens has shown a 90% sensitivity when utilized to diagnose bacteriuria, however it is laborious and time consuming. Therefore, a rapid, automatic, reliable and cheaper screening test that can differentiate between gram positive, negative or mixed growth in urine specimens, is required to reduce labor, unnecessary medical costs and waiting time, which would help clinicians improve patient care. Previous studies have examined the efficacy of the UF-1000i (Sysmex UF-1000i; Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) in differentiating bacilli from cocci/mixed growth. However, the UF-1000i cannot differentiate cocci from mixed growth. Recently, a new model of urine particle analyzer was introduced, the UF-5000 (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan), where cocci are differentiated from mixed growth bacteria. Therefore, we performed a prospective study to compare the accuracy of gram staining, the UF-1000i and the UF-5000 in differentiating bacterial growth patterns (gram positive, negative or mixed growth) using midstream voided urine specimens from women visiting urological clinics for uUTIs.

### Microbial co-occurrences on catheters from long-term catheterized patients [^112udkwW]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

One limitation of this study is the use of a culture-based approach, wherein organisms that grow well under the selected laboratory conditions, namely in rich undefined media at 37 °C, will grow and be detected in subsequent 16 S sequencing whereas fastidious and anaerobic species will be lost due to their inability to grow under these conditions. Thus, a culture-based approach limits the species that can be included in the downstream co-occurrence analysis. While newer sequencing applications can be used to sequence directly from catheter and urine samples, circumventing the limitations noted above, we chose to use a culture-based approach as that is currently the gold standard in clinical microbiology laboratories. Future studies are necessary to bridge the gap between standard clinical techniques for microbial detection and newer sequencing-based approaches that are not currently used in the clinical setting. Also necessary are studies of the cytokines and host factors present in the urine of long-term catheterized patients, which will allow for better understanding of the immune responses associated with certain polymicrobial community compositions. The microbial positive associations detected in our study represent those present in human urinary tracts of long-term catheterized patients spanning many subsequent re-catheterization events, warranting further investigation to the molecular drivers of these interactions for insights to perturb the formation and stability of problematic polymicrobial communities.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^113fVDhK]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) algorithm — initial evaluation in febrile infants 2–24 months begins with "Infant 2–24 mo with fever ≥ 38°C" and asks whether the patient requires immediate antimicrobial therapy; if immediate therapy is needed, the algorithm directs to "Obtain urine by catheterization or SPA", "Perform urinalysis", and "Culture urine obtained by catheterization or SPA", and the notes state that "A urine sample suitable for culture should be obtained before initiating antimicrobials". Initial management is to "Treat with antimicrobials effective against common uropathogens according to local sensitivity patterns; oral or parenteral", and if "Urinalysis and culture positive?" is not satisfied, "Discontinue antimicrobials".

Regarding medical management for asymptomatic bacteriuria, more specifically with respect to indications for antibiotics, pregnant patients, USPSTF 2019 guidelines recommend to administer antibiotic therapy in pregnant patients with a urine culture showing > 10⁵ CFU/mL of a single uropathogen or > 10⁴ CFU/mL of group B streptococcus.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115wpVNC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Indwelling urinary catheter — management of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in long-term care: Benefit of antimicrobial therapy for ASB while a catheter remains in situ is stated as uncertain and there is high-quality evidence of harm with increased antimicrobial resistance, so screening with urine cultures in catheterized patients or obtaining urine cultures for nonspecific symptoms should be discouraged. A prospective cohort study of prophylaxis to prevent ASB and urinary tract infection (UTI) in patients with long-term indwelling catheters reported no benefits, and a randomized bundle intervention was associated with a substantial decrease in screening and treatment for ASB in long-term care patients without an increase in symptomatic UTI.

### Reassessment of routine midstream culture in diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^112BJtyx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The current quantitative MSU threshold is problematic for other reasons. First, bacterial strains are known to vary in virulence, meaning that some strains might generate disease even at lower concentrations. Second, the concentration of bacteria in urine can vary widely depending on fluid intake before MSU sampling; the concentration in a dilute specimen might fall below the diagnostic cutoff as a result. Third, recognized uropathogens, includingand, adhere to host cells and are also known to invade them to form intracellular colonies. Thus, urinary supernatant may be a poor substrate for recovering sequestered organisms. However, it is also known that an innate immune response to UTI exacerbates the shedding of urothelial cells into urine.

An additional problem associated with standard MSU interpretation in the United Kingdom is the dismissal of mixed-growth cultures by default. Conventionally, mixed-growth cultures are assumed to reflect contamination by organisms recognized to colonize the healthy periurethral, vaginal, and perianal regions. Although some laboratories electively consider the growth of up to three organisms each at > 10⁵ CFU/ml to suggest polymicrobial infection or may proceed with a repeat assessment, many disregard mixed cultures altogether. However, we and others have shown that polymicrobial infection is common in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). In addition, polymicrobial urosepsis has been reported in patients who demonstrated identical, mixed isolates from blood and urine specimens. Another study reported that, a predominant uropathogen, manifested greater invasive properties when isolated from a polymicrobial culture than when isolated as pure growth. This finding is supported by recent work showing thatcan bolsterby exporting the nutrient-ornithine.

### A lipidomics-based method to eliminate negative urine culture in general population [^114D8qLY]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample collection

In this study, 435 urine specimens were collected from outpatients suspected to have UTIs from Victoria General and Royal Jubilee Hospital, British Columbia. Maternity care and sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics were excluded. Urine samples were requested by clinicians as part of urinary tract infection investigations, either by (1) urinalysis (dipstick; Roche Diagnostics, 11063 Stn CV, Montreal, QC) and urine culture or (2) urinalysis with reflex to urine culture. The criteria for reflex to urine culture were established based on positive urinalysis results incorporating any single or combined indications, including positive hemoglobin (Hb), nitrites, and leukocyte esterase. Negative urine analysis without urine culture was excluded. Bacterial isolates from urine cultures were identified using the protein Biotyper (MBT Sirius; Bruker, Bremen, Germany). Based on the inclusion criteria, all urine samples were collected from morning midstream clean-catch urine, without considering age and gender of the patients. Urine culture was not performed on 33 of the 435 (7.5%) samples that did not pass inclusion criteria.

The remaining 402 urine samples were tested by urinalysis and urine culture as part of the VIHA standard of care. The urine samples were obtained in sterile BD Vacutainer urine C&S Preservative Tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Specifically, a 1 mL aliquot was allocated from each sample for FLAT analysis within 3 days of receipt of the UTI sample. FLAT results were compared with corresponding urinalysis and urine culture reports. In our study, we used a colony count threshold of ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL (colony-forming units per milliliter) to classify a culture as positive. This threshold aligns with standard clinical microbiology practices, particularly for urinary tract infections (UTIs). Conversely, a culture is considered negative if it is reported as "light or mixed growth (0.1–0.9 × 10⁵ CFU/mL)", "no growth (< 0.1–0.9 × 10⁵ CFU/mL)", and "no uropathogens isolated" (Table S1). The VIHA microbiology laboratory does not perform further UTI investigations in urine cultures reported as light or mixed growth since this may or may not indicate an infection, depending on the clinical context. Hence, all such reported outcomes were classified as negative urine cultures in this study.

### Principles of diagnostic stewardship: a practical guide from the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America diagnostic stewardship task force [^1168RwuQ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic stewardship — urine cultures — Avoid testing in nonspecific clinical syndromes (eg, leukocytosis, isolated fever, fatigue, and fall), do not order based on odor or smell, and educate on prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and lack of treatment benefit. For collection, do not collect from catheter bag and only culture urine if pyuria present on urinalysis. For reporting, use selective and cascade reporting to help tailor antibiotic choices and add comments to nudge toward only using antibiotics with true symptoms of UTI.

Microbiological assessment: enhanced sediment culture

Enhanced sediment cultures were processed within 2 h of sample collection. Samples were refrigerated at 4 °C until processed. Five millilitres of fresh unspun, unstained, urine was centrifuged at 627 g for 5 min in a Denley BR401 centrifuge (R MAX 140 mm) (Denley, Heckmondwike, UK). The supernatant was removed, leaving the urinary sediment, which was resuspended in 400 μl of 1% sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. Four 1:10 serial dilutions were performed for accurate quantitative bacterial counting. Chromogenic CPS3 agar plates (bioMérieux, Basingstoke, UK) were used for culture. All culture plates were incubated aerobically for 24 h at 37 °C in a CO₂ -dependant incubator.

Bacterial quantification

Each bacterial isolate was quantified. No threshold was used to discriminate positive or negative growth. The mean colony count from all sectors was calculated. The CPS3 chromogenic medium allows bacterial identification of uropathogens to genus or species level, dependent on the microbe. The growth of distinct bacteria is colour-specific to allow easy and fast enumeration. Colour identification was based on the manufacturer's standardised colour guide and supplemented with Gram staining and rapid biochemical tests for further characterisation. Analytical Profile Index (API) testing was used when these methods were unable to identify an isolate conclusively.

Microbiological assessment: routine culture

All routine microbiological cultures were undertaken in the hospital microbiology laboratory. Thirty millilitres of urine in a sterile universal specimen tube was cultured immediately upon receipt or after overnight refrigeration at 4 °C. Trained blinded biomedical scientists undertook all analyses. One microlitre of the urine sample was inoculated onto a CPS3 agar plate using a sterile 1-μl loop. The culture plate was then incubated aerobically for 24 h at 37 °C. Bacterial colonies were identified by colour and morphologic characteristics. Rapid reagent testing (spot testing) was employed to supplement colour-based bacterial identification. Bacterial growth was estimated by visual assessment of colony density. A positive culture was defined as the growth of a single recognised uropathogen at ≥ 10⁵ CFU mL⁻¹. Polymicrobial growth above this threshold was reported as mixed growth. Any bacterial growth < 10⁵ CFU mL⁻¹ was reported as no significant growth.

### Optimizing the yield of in-and-out urinary catheter cultures by applying a "Midstream-like" approach in pediatric patients [^113SRcJQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite appropriate disinfection, sample contamination during in-and-out urinary catheterization is not uncommon, yielding false-positive and "mixed-culture" interpretations. We implemented a "midstream-like" catheterization technique, and cultured both first- and second-voided urine fractions. Second-fraction cultures exhibited less contaminants and "mixed-culture" interpretations and were better aligned with pyuria, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy and minimizing the risk of clinical misdiagnosis and unwarranted antibiotic use.

### Building microbial communities to improve antimicrobial strategies [^112oTv4E]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

While the above-mentioned examples indicate that interactions between at least two microbes can impact infection severity, one could argue that using antimicrobials aimed at eradicating these pathogens simultaneously could result in positive disease outcomes. However, such a strategy does not seem to be as straightforward as one would think. For instance, in a retrospective study including > 900 children with CF who were positive for co-colonization with P. aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), combining antipseudomonal antibiotics with anti-MRSA therapy did not result in improved outcomes compared to monotherapy.

Other factors that can influence bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics and, in turn, affect the accuracy of AST include phenotypic and genotypic variations within species and environmental conditions to which bacteria are exposed to. As traditional AST is often performed in nutrient-rich media, an effective way of assessing the actual efficacy of a compound against a pathogen is through the development of growth culture media that reflect the conditions of the infection site. Growing knowledge on the nutritional composition found at various body sites has led to the development of multiple disease-mimicking media, such as the artificial urine medium (AUM), synthetic synovial fluid media and synthetic cystic fibrosis medium (SCFM2), which are commonly used to simulate in vitro the human urine, human joint fluid and CF environment, respectively –. Promoting bacterial aggregation, a synthetic synovial fluid medium modeling essential features of the periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) environment, induces a decreased susceptibility of various common PJI pathogens to antibiotics compared to traditional media.

Taken together, we posit that the emergence of community-intrinsic phenotypes in infection-relevant conditions may help elucidate why many promising compounds are effective at inhibiting growth when tested against a single bacterium but fail to do so when used in real clinical settings where the bacterium resides within a polymicrobial community. Furthermore, we suggest that it might be possible that some compounds lacking activity in monoculture become potent in a polymicrobial context. For example, chloroxylenol (an antiseptic) has poor activity against S. aureus monocultures, but is significantly more effective when S. aureus is exposed to P. aeruginosa metabolites. Norfloxacin, a quinolone antibiotic, also shows increased potency against biofilms of S. aureus in the presence of P. aeruginosa exoproducts. However, while such examples show exciting potential applications, we first need an improved and unbiased understanding of microbial heterogeneity and interactions observed during infection and, ultimately, a better-tailored approach for treating such infections.

### The effect of written posted instructions on collection of clean-catch urine specimens in the emergency department [^111nic8X]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Urinalysis testing is frequently ordered in the emergency department (ED), but contamination of urine specimens limits the interpretation of results. The mid-stream, clean-catch (MSCC) procedure for urine specimen collection is recommended to decrease contamination rates, but without instructions this procedure has poor compliance.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of written instructions alone, we analyzed the rate of specimen contamination, defined by presence of squamous epithelial cells (SECs) and culture results, in the ED after posting information on the MSCC procedure.

Methods

Instructions in simple English for the MSCC procedure were posted in all patient-accessible restrooms in the ED. Frequency of contamination, defined microscopically as > 5 SECs per high-powered field or through growth of mixed or non-pathologic flora on urine culture, was determined over a 3-month period for comparison to historical controls from the previous year.

Results

During the intervention period, 754 urinalyses were sent, with 392 contaminated specimens (51.98%), and 193 urine cultures were sent, with 77 contaminated results (39.8%). Historical controls from the previous year yielded 827 urinalyses sent, with 430 contaminated (51.99%), and 251 urine cultures, with 125 contaminated results (49.8%). The difference between groups was not significant for urinalysis (p = 0.99) or urine culture (p = 0.13).

Conclusions

A poster-based educational intervention with instructions on MSCC procedure failed to decrease contamination rates in this ED-based study. Possible explanations include poor compliance with MSCC technique in the ED, or poor efficacy of this technique at decreasing contamination rates. These results may indicate that other efforts are necessary to improve urine collection methods.

### A blinded observational cohort study of the microbiological ecology associated with pyuria and overactive bladder symptoms [^116kUu2b]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Most spun sediment cultures from patients and some from controls demonstrated polymicrobial growth. Whilst mixed-growth cultures historically have been blamed on contamination from poor sampling, this has been strongly challenged. Wolcott et al. suggested that coexistence of certain species of bacteria, resulting in polymicrobial cultures, may offer microbes a survival advantage. Our study did not address this hypothesis.

Urothelial clue-cell shedding has been described as an immune response to infection, with murine and human studies showing increased cell shedding in response to infection. This study found that the patient group showed increased proportions of urinary clue cells, which are urothelial cells manifesting adherent or intracellular microbes. The increased clue-cell proportions imply increased microbial colonisation of urothelial cells in OAB patients. This observation is in line with other reports.

In considering sources of error, the measurement of bacterial in spun urothelial cells deposits could have been affected by the sampling method. Bacteria from the lower genital tract could have contributed to this. However, the immediate refrigeration of urine and the processing of these samples within 1 h of collection reduced this risk. Whilst one could argue that the MSU sampling method could contribute to contamination, this would appear to be nominal given the low pyuria counts and urothelial cell counts in the control population.

We did not use a quantitative threshold to define significance in a spun sediment culture or apply the criterion of a single species. There are no data to guide such thresholds, so we report data without categorisation. There are quantitative differences in microbial isolates, but we are in no position to state what those mean. Analysis of urothelial and clue cells is novel, as is sediment culture, but these methods have been well validated and have a strong pathophysiological foundation. Fresh urine microscopy is not commonly adopted in clinical practice nowadays, nevertheless, it has been well validated in studies dating back to 1928 and is still unsurpassed as a surrogate marker of infection. DNA sequencing may be an alternative, although it still lacks quantitative specificity.

### The clinical impact of a urinary tract infection management bundle in a tertiary-care teaching hospital [^112KkTN7]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a urinary tract infection (UTI) management bundle to reduce the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) and to improve the management of symptomatic UTIs.

Design

Before-and-after intervention study. SettingsTertiary-care hospital. PatientsConsecutive sample of inpatients with positive single or mixed-predominant urine cultures collected and reported while admitted to the hospital.

Methods

The UTI management bundle consisted of nursing and prescriber education, modification of the reporting of positive urine cultures, and pharmacists' prospective audit and feedback. A retrospective chart review of consecutive inpatients with positive urinary cultures was performed before and after implementation of the management bundle.

Results

Prior to the implementation of the management bundle, 276 patients were eligible criteria for chart review. Of these 276 patients, 165 (59·8%) were found to have AB; of these 165 patients with AB, 111 (67·3%) were treated with antimicrobials. Moreover, 268 patients met eligibility criteria for postintervention review. Of these 268, 133 patients (49·6%) were found to have AB; of these 133 with AB, 22 (16·5%) were treated with antimicrobials. Thus, a 75·5% reduction of AB treatment was achieved. Educational components of the bundle resulted in a substantial decrease in nonphysician-directed urine sample submission. Adherence to a UTI management algorithm improved substantially in the intervention period, with a notable decrease in fluoroquinolone prescription for empiric UTI treatment.

Conclusions

A UTI management bundle resulted in a dramatic improvement in the management of urinary tract infection, particularly a reduction in the treatment of AB and improved management of symptomatic UTI.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113jgBXL]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) — contamination suspicion and contaminants management: Contamination should be suspected when a specimen shows growth of normal vaginal flora, mixed cultures containing more than one organism, or low quantities (i.e., < 10³ CFU/mL) of a pathogenic organism in an asymptomatic patient; growth of organisms thought to be contaminants generally do not require treatment, and when there is high suspicion for contamination, clinicians can consider obtaining a catheterized specimen for further evaluation prior to treatment.

### Reassessment of routine midstream culture in diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^1128r6XC]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our second key finding was that MSU culture grossly underestimated the amount of polymicrobial growth in patient urine. For example, 36.4% of new patient urine samples grew mixed growths; this number rose to 63.6% when more uncentrifuged urine was plated and to 84.8% in the case of centrifuged sediment cultures. Although it is now recognized that even healthy urine contains bacteria, which certainly complicates the diagnostic landscape, our enhanced culture and genomic analyses showed a clear difference between the taxa isolated from patients and those isolated from controls. Specifically, Enterobacteriaceae was the dominant family in new patients, whereas Streptococcus was foremost in the asymptomatic controls. These findings, taken together with other reports, suggest that automatically discounting polymicrobial cultures may dismiss symptomatic patients in need of treatment.

There is, of course, a formal possibility that the mixed growths reported here could simply be the result of contamination by skin bacteria during sample collection. In the United Kingdom, this possibility is addressed by the UK Standards for Microbiology Investigations, which recommends the counting of squamous epithelial cells in the urine as a marker for contamination. However, their utility for this purpose is complicated by the fact that exfoliation of urothelial cells as an innate immune response to UTI is a recognized phenomenon which is widely used as a surrogate marker of infection in both mice and humans. Indeed, using antibodies against uroplakin III, a highly specific marker for cells originating from the urinary tract, we previously demonstrated that the majority of epithelial cells shed in the urine of symptomatic patients originate from the bladder. Finally, were the presence of mixed growths merely the result of contamination, we would not expect their presence to cluster statistically with symptoms, as they did in this study.

### Rate of urine culture contamination with different methods of urine specimen collection [^1143hS1B]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Midstream urine (MSU) samples are commonly collected at the time of patient evaluation despite known high rates of contamination.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the rate of mixed flora results in urine specimens obtained by MSU compared to straight catheterization urine (SCU).

Study Design

This was a quality improvement project evaluating urine culture results of women who provided either an MSU or SCU sample for analysis. Adult women seen within urogynecology clinics at a tertiary care center between April and August 2023 who had urine cultures performed for any indication were included. Mixed flora was defined as the presence of ≥ 2 non-uropathogens or 1 uropathogen in low quantity (at least 10 times fewer) compared to the concentration of nonsignificant organisms.

Results

Three hundred forty women provided a urine specimen during the study period. SCU collection was performed for 171 (50.3%) women while 169 (49.7%) provided an MSU sample. Overall, 18.8% of urine cultures were reported as mixed flora (33.1% in MSU and 4.7% in SCU, p < 0.001). Mixed flora was more common with MSU specimens (87.5%, p < 0.001) and associated with a higher BMI compared to positive or negative cultures (mixed flora 29.8 kg/m² ± 16.3, positive or negative cultures 27.8 kg/m² ± 7.0, p = 0.04). MSU samples had increased odds of urine contamination compared to SCU collection (7.40 aOR, 95% CI 3.01–18.24).

Conclusion

The prevalence of mixed flora was reduced significantly when SCU samples were obtained. Clinicians should consider performing SCU collection when a urine specimen is required for patient evaluation.

### The clinical urine culture: enhanced techniques improve detection of clinically relevant microorganisms [^117K4eHt]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Enhanced quantitative urine culture (EQUC) detects live microorganisms in the vast majority of urine specimens reported as "no growth" by the standard urine culture protocol. Here, we evaluated an expanded set of EQUC conditions (expanded-spectrum EQUC) to identify an optimal version that provides a more complete description of uropathogens in women experiencing urinary tract infection (UTI)-like symptoms. One hundred fifty adult urogynecology patient-participants were characterized using a self-completed validated UTI symptom assessment (UTISA) questionnaire and asked "Do you feel you have a UTI?" Women responding negatively were recruited into the no-UTI cohort, while women responding affirmatively were recruited into the UTI cohort; the latter cohort was reassessed with the UTISA questionnaire 3 to 7 days later. Baseline catheterized urine samples were plated using both standard urine culture and expanded-spectrum EQUC protocols: standard urine culture inoculated at 1 μl onto 2 agars incubated aerobically; expanded-spectrum EQUC inoculated at three different volumes of urine onto 7 combinations of agars and environments. Compared to expanded-spectrum EQUC, standard urine culture missed 67% of uropathogens overall and 50% in participants with severe urinary symptoms. Thirty-six percent of participants with missed uropathogens reported no symptom resolution after treatment by standard urine culture results. Optimal detection of uropathogens could be achieved using the following: 100 μl of urine plated onto blood (blood agar plate [BAP]), colistin-nalidixic acid (CNA), and MacConkey agars in 5% CO₂ for 48 h. This streamlined EQUC protocol achieved 84% uropathogen detection relative to 33% detection by standard urine culture. The streamlined EQUC protocol improves detection of uropathogens that are likely relevant for symptomatic women, giving clinicians the opportunity to receive additional information not currently reported using standard urine culture techniques.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^116Hh85Z]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The symptomatic measurements pain, urgency, FLUTS and LUTSqol were concordant with the pyuria and culture data. It should be appreciated that CSU sampling missed a pathological signal in a significant proportion of patients with appropriate symptoms, pyuria and urothelial cell shedding. Compared with CSU, the MSU technique provided a more substantial sample of the inflammatory sediment. UTI involves colonisation of the urothelial cells by pathogenic microbes. The innate immune response to this microbial colonisation is increased urothelial cell shedding, which may be promoted by mast cells. The shed cells may be colonised or unaffected, but the proportion of parasitised cells in the face of infection would be expected to increase. This sediment, a mixture of white cells, epithelial cells and debris, is likely to collect under the influence of gravity at the bladder base, forming a sampling target that should not be influenced by dilution effects. This is made evident by the characteristic milky quality of the terminal flow when a catheter is used to drain an infected bladder. A catheter, as well as a suprapubic stab, samples urine above this collection at the bladder base (Fig. 1 a), and therefore contains fewer epithelial cells, white cells and microbes, a point reflected in the data reported here. Thus, a CSU sample may be an inferior option because it may miss a substantial amount of the pathology.

With the advent of more sensitive genomic technology, a number of groups have reported that the healthy bladder is not sterile, and that polymicrobial colonisation is the norm in both healthy and infected bladders. Polymicrobial growth in urine specimens has been associated with LUTS in a recent study of similar patients. Indeed, the sediment cultures carried out on urine samples collected by MSU and CSU in this study also demonstrated polymicrobial growth. In patients with symptoms of UTI, the species dispersion is much wider than in asymptomatic controls. At this time it is not known what species of these mixes are responsible for the disease. In this study, the data on the UP3-positive cells argued against the common assumption that polymicrobial results and/or epithelial cells are pointers to contamination. A recent study has shown the isolation of a different microbial population using the Peezy compared with one isolated from peri-urethral swabs, based on the assumption of peri-urethral contamination of MSU samples.

### Redefining urinary tract infections by bacterial colony counts [^113WJrpd]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the best urinary bacterial concentration to diagnose urine infections.

Methods

We studied a quantitative culture of paired urine samples from children that were promptly tested together after serial dilution. The initial diagnosis of urinary tract infection made from the result of the first urine culture and subsequently modified according to the second sample result, and then the ratio of their colony counts was considered. A total of 203 children (aged 2.0 weeks to 17.7 years) were screened for urine infection in a hospital setting.

Results

The 36 children who had a urinary tract infection, defined as having the same uropathogen in both urine samples at concentrations within 25-fold of each other, had a mean colony count of 1.7 × 10⁷ colony-forming units/mL. Among the 167 children who did not have a urinary tract infection, 12 (7.2%) would have had a false-positive diagnosis made on the first sample, which was revealed because the second sample result was different (n = 7) or had a ≥ 25-fold different colony count (n = 5). Raising the threshold from 10⁵ to 10⁶ colony-forming units/mL reduces the false-positive rate 4.8%. If 2 samples are cultured, the false-positive rates fall to 3.6% and 0.6%, respectively. All 9 children (5.4% of those without a urinary tract infection) who had a mixed culture with ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units/mL of a uropathogen (heavy mixed growth) in the first sample had a urine infection excluded by the second sample result.

Conclusion

The minimum urinary bacterial concentration that is used to diagnose a urine infection should be increased from ≥ 10⁵ to ≥ 10⁶ colony-forming units/mL, because that would reduce the false-positive rate from 7.2% to 4.8% if 1 sample was cultured and from 3.6% to 0.6% if 2 samples were cultured. Urine samples with heavy mixed growths should be considered contaminated.

### Microbial co-occurrences on catheters from long-term catheterized patients [^115JBH9g]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), a common cause of healthcare-associated infections, are caused by a diverse array of pathogens that are increasingly becoming antibiotic resistant. We analyze the microbial occurrences in catheter and urine samples from 55 human long-term catheterized patients collected over one year. Although most of these patients were prescribed antibiotics over several collection periods, their catheter samples remain colonized by one or more bacterial species. Examination of a total of 366 catheter and urine samples identify 13 positive and 13 negative genus co-occurrences over 12 collection periods, representing associations that occur more or less frequently than expected by chance. We find that for many patients, the microbial species composition between collection periods is similar. In a subset of patients, we find that the most frequently sampled bacteria, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, co-localize on catheter samples. Further, co-culture of paired isolates recovered from the same patients reveals that E. coli significantly augments E. faecalis growth in an artificial urine medium, where E. faecalis monoculture grows poorly. These findings suggest novel strategies to collapse polymicrobial CAUTI in long-term catheterized patients by targeting mechanisms that promote positive co-associations.

Patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens — prior urine culture results: In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest avoiding antibiotics to which the patient has had a resistant pathogen isolated from the urine previously (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^111oiwTz]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) — capabilities, trial findings, and practical constraints — EQUC uses more inoculum, varied media and atmospheric conditions, and extended culture times to enhance bacterial recovery and can detect anaerobic, microaerophilic, and fastidious organisms beyond standard culture, although growth of E. coli is similar on catheterized specimens. In a randomized controlled trial, treatment guided by standard culture versus EQUC produced similar symptom resolution and no statistically significant difference in symptomatic improvement for non–E. coli strains; specimens were obtained by catheterization, and voided samples analyzed by EQUC in women with rUTI yielded high false positives. While EQUC allows antimicrobial susceptibility determination, it remains vulnerable to handling issues, contamination, and delays, and the lack of demonstrable clinical outcome advantages plus limited availability, labor/time demands, and catheterization requirements limit its utility for routine diagnosis of localized UTI.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^116jXsmr]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

From a microbial perspective, each uropathogenic species may carry its own infection dynamics, such that employing universal thresholds across all species to define infection (e.g. ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL) is likely an oversimplification. Some patients may experience symptomatic infections with bacterial counts as low as 10² CFU/mL. Not only are these levels below the limit of detection of a standard 1 µL inoculum, but they overlap with potential levels of contamination. Unfortunately, in deciphering low-level pathogens from prominent contaminants, a laboratory cannot directly control for the variable quality of specimen collection, and a traditional culture cannot differentiate the active pathological process of a UTI from colonization/ASB.

Urinary tract infection is common, and it is not surprising that urine specimens make up a large proportion of those samples submitted to the routine diagnostic laboratory. Many of these specimens will show no evidence of infection and several methods can be used to screen out negative samples. Those that grow bacteria need to be carefully assessed to quantify the degree of bacteriuria and hence clinical relevance. To influence treatment, a final report should be produced within 24 hours of specimen receipt, with turnaround times continuously monitored. Much work needs to be done to determine the cost effectiveness involved in processing urine specimens and the evidence base for the final report provided.

### A comparison of the performance of commercially available chromogenic agars for the isolation and presumptive identification of organisms from urine [^113DWfKB]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare four media-UTI medium, BBL CHROMagar, CPS ID2, and Harlequin CLED-using a collection of fully characterised organisms and subsequent "field trial".

Methods

Seven hundred and eighty seven fully characterised isolates (730 Gram negative bacteria, 47 Gram positive bacteria, and 10 yeasts) were used to test for accuracy of organism identification. To assess isolation rates and ability to detect mixed cultures, 1435 urine samples were cultured in the three best performing chromogenic media (UTI medium, BBL CHROMagar, and CPS ID2) and CLED.

Results

The chromogenic agars differed in their accuracy of identification, with BBL CHROMagar performing best and Harlequin CLED performing least well. Similarly, BBL CHROMagar achieved a higher overall isolation rate than UTI medium and CPS ID2. When mixed growth was defined as greater than two organism types, BBL CHROMagar detected more mixed cultures than did UTI medium and CPS ID2, although the differences were not significant. When mixed growth was defined as greater than one organism type the increased number of mixed growths detected by BBL CHROMagar became significant, largely because of differences in enterococcal isolation rates.

Conclusion

The use of BBL CHROMagar, UTI medium, or CPS ID2 chromogenic agar as a replacement for CLED agar would improve the detection rate of contaminated urine samples. Enhanced identification helps to distinguish different species, facilitating the monitoring of bacterial resistance in support of the national antibiotic strategy. BBL CHROMagar gave the highest overall organism recovery rates, greatest ability to detect mixed cultures, and the most accurate identification of organisms.

### Urinary cell-free DNA is a versatile analyte for monitoring infections of the urinary tract [^115QLQn2]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Conventional bacterial culture, bacterial identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Ninety of the 141 samples in the study had a corresponding same day urine culture. Each of these clean-catch midstream culture urine samples was inoculated onto tryptic soy agar with sheep blood (Becton, Dickinson and Company [BD], Franklin Lakes, NJ) and MacConkey agar (BD) using a 1-μL inoculation loop and incubated in ambient air at 35 °C. Four urine samples were reported as mixed bacterial flora and were excluded because of lack of further identification and 86 samples were defined as either negative urine culture (n = 43) or positive urine culture (n = 43) for the cfDNA/bacterial correlation analyses and ROC analyses.

A positive urine culture was defined as a culture growing an organism identified to at least the genus level (almost all bacterial isolates were recovered at a colony count ≥ 10,000 cfu/mL, while three isolates were recovered at a colony count < 10,000 cfu/mL). A urine culture was defined as negative when either no organism was isolated in culture (35 cultures, < 1000 cfu/mL) or the organism was unidentified to either the genus or species level (i.e. unidentified) and the colony count was < 10,000 cfu/mL (8 cultures).

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^115U41GU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections — key laboratory diagnosis points state that in the absence of signs and symptoms consistent with urinary tract infection, a urine culture is typically not recommended, and urine collected for culture should not be kept at room temperature for more than 30 minutes, with specimens held at refrigerator temperatures or in a preservative tube if not processed within 30 minutes. Reflex to culture based on a positive pyuria screen may be considered, but if a reflex algorithm is implemented, it should be a locally approved policy guided by clinicians and laboratorians. Three or more species of bacteria in a urine specimen usually indicates contamination at the time of collection and interpretation remains challenging.

### Management of asymptomatic bacteriuria in Non-catheterized adults [^113fEjAS]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Understanding the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is important given the prevalence of the condition, associated risks in certain patient populations, and the risks associated with inappropriate antibiotic administration. Generally, screening and treatment is only recommended in pregnant women and in those undergoing urologic procedures that will violate the urothelium. Knowing the appropriate time to screen and treat ASB is critical for managing high-risk patients and preventing the growth of antibiotic resistance. Recent research into the protective nature of avirulent strains of Escherichia coli might offer a new approach to management of ASB.

### Uropathogens and pyuria in children with neurogenic bladders [^116VxVUw]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

media-1vid110.1542/5727212324001PEDS-VA_2017–3006 Video Abstract BACKGROUND: A recent study revealed that specific uropathogens are associated with lower odds of pyuria in a general pediatrics population. Children with neurogenic bladders who require clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) frequently have pyuria. Our objective with this study was to determine if an association exists between pyuria and type of uropathogen in CIC-dependent children.

Methods

We obtained urinalysis and urine culture results from electronic medical records from January 2008 through December 2014 for patients ≤ 18 years of age with neurogenic bladders managed at a single institution. Cultures without concurrent urinalyses were excluded from analysis, as were cultures that yielded no growth, fungal growth, or growth of unidentified mixed organisms. We used logistic regression to determine the association of pyuria and leukocyte esterase with specific uropathogens.

Results

We included 2420 cultures in this analysis. The growth of Enterococcus on urine culture was associated with lower odds of both pyuria and leukocyte esterase. In contrast, the growth of more than 100000 colony-forming units per milliliter of Proteus mirabilis was associated with increased odds of both pyuria and leukocyte esterase, and the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was associated with increased odds of leukocyte esterase but not pyuria. Certain etiologies of neurogenic bladder, such as bladder exstrophy and cloacal malformations, were also associated with increased odds of pyuria compared with neurogenic bladder due to myelomeningocele.

Conclusions

In children with neurogenic bladders who require CIC, Enterococcus may grow in urine culture without pyuria or positive leukocyte esterase. Accordingly, urine cultures should be obtained in symptomatic children, regardless of urinalysis results.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) guideline — definition and scope: ASB is defined as the presence of 1 or more species of bacteria in urine at specified counts (≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units [CFU]/mL or ≥ 10⁸ CFU/L), irrespective of pyuria, and without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). The 2005 IDSA guideline recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures, and treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The current guideline reviews and updates the 2005 guideline, and the recommendations also consider populations not addressed previously, such as children and patients with solid organ transplants or neutropenia, noting that antimicrobial stewardship programs have identified management of ASB as an important opportunity for decreasing inappropriate antimicrobial use.

### A lipidomics-based method to eliminate negative urine culture in general population [^114f38Ve]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Method comparison

The FLAT and culture results showed 93% concordance (Table 3). Overall, the FLAT assay had a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 99% with positive and negative predictive values of 93% and 99%, respectively (Table 3). Table 3 also indicates three false positives where FLAT identified a positive result, but the culture was negative. This discrepancy arises because our criterion for culture positivity was a threshold of ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL. Cases of light growth (10³–10⁵ CFU/mL) and mixed growth were often classified as negative if they did not meet this threshold. From our limit of detection (LoD) study, Fig. S2 to S4, FLAT detects pathogens even at 10³ CFU. For negative urine cultures, the FLAT assay was 99% in concordance whereas urinalysis was 37%. (Table 4). Additionally, the FLAT assay was 97% (n = 88) and 8% (n = 26) in ID agreement with Gram-negative and Gram-positive cultures, respectively (Table 5). An additional 70 known Gram-positive urines were obtained to increase the sample size. After adding a 10 min sonication step prior to FLAT, Gram-positive bacterial detection increased from 8% of the initial cohort of 402 to 51% of the new cohort of 70 samples (Table 6).

Specimen management tenets — community standards of care — state that specimens of poor quality must be rejected; full identification of multiple organisms (> 3) within a mixed culture is not recommended; background "noise" of commensal microbiota unrelated to the disease process must be avoided where possible during specimen collection; and the laboratory needs a specimen, not a swab of a specimen, with actual tissue, aspirates, and fluids always preferred over swabs.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnancy — screening and treatment recommendations: In pregnant women, we recommend screening for and treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). We suggest a urine culture collected at one of the initial visits early in pregnancy. In pregnant women with ASB, we suggest 4–7 days of antimicrobial treatment rather than a shorter duration (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Remarks note that the optimal duration of therapy will vary depending on the antimicrobial given; the shortest effective course should be used.

### Hierarchical AI enables global interpretation of culture plates in the era of digital microbiology [^112WLH1W]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Plate-level decision (DeepColony vs humans) on a large clinical dataset

Given the ability to perform these complex interpretations, DeepColony has been applied to a large clinical dataset of 5,051 urine cultures acquired in a large US laboratory. The plate-level clinical dataset, more details in "Methods" (Datasets), was acquired along with the technologists' interpretation in terms of no growth, contaminated (mixed) or positive culture, according to the laboratory reading guidelines (the same depicted in Fig. 5a and adopted for DeepColony -guided interpretation at level 4). In Fig. 5b, DeepColony interpretation is compared with that of the technologists on the entire set of cultures to determine both class-based and overall human-machine agreement. Despite the intrinsic task difficulty, a high overall agreement of 95.4% (unweighted Kappa of 0.920) between machine-based and manual presumptive identifications is reached, with a class-based peak of 99.2% for the negative "no-growth" cultures, and a high agreement of 95.6% also reached for positive cultures. Out-of-diagonal values in the confusion matrix of Fig. 5b remain noticeably low and can be considered marginal, with the exception of the 194 plates, the 7.4% of the 2623 cultures, interpreted as positive by DeepColony, that were instead manually interpreted as contaminated. This lead to a lower agreement of 77.1% for the mixed growth or "contaminated" cultures due to a deliberately precautionary behaviour, which is related to "safety by design" criteria: the upper bound of the estimated number of colonies identified within a species is considered, while additional qualitative considerations are limited to allow for technologist interpretation (who may deem a plate as non-significant despite some above-threshold CFU counting) aiming at reducing the risk of improperly discarding potentially positive cultures.

Taken together, this study shows that DeepColony can effectively classify and enumerate organisms to be combined with laboratory-based rule systems to augment the microbiologists' clinical decisions on the interpretation of clinically significant cultures.

### Reassessment of routine midstream culture in diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^11656nz9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Since the hospital laboratory did not report the microbial composites of mixed-growth and negative MSU cultures, we inspected the 1-µl-loop MSU cultures that were replicated in our own research laboratories, subjecting colonies grown on chromogenic agar to MALDI-TOF MS analysis for identification. The pooled percentage frequencies of organisms identified from the polymicrobial MSU cultures of new patients (n = 7), relapsed patients (n = 4), and controls (n = 5) are shown in Fig. S2. No colonies on the research laboratory MSU culture were observed for 17 (58.6%) controls, 12 (36.4%) new patients, and 13 (43.3%) relapsed patients. While 19 isolates were grown from 12 asymptomatic control MSU cultures, 39 isolates were identified from 21 new patient cultures and 25 isolates were grown from 17 relapsed patient cultures. With this replicated diagnostic culture, Enterococcus and Escherichia were predominantly cultured from new patients and relapsed patients, whereas Streptococcus and Staphylococcus were most frequently isolated from the controls. Within this sample size, Fisher's exact test confirmed a significantly higher frequency of Escherichia (χ² = 5.4, df = 1, P < 0.05) and Enterococcus (χ² = 8.9, df = 1, P < 0.05) isolated from cultures for new patients than from those for the controls. The relapsing patient group was also observed to produce a significantly higher number of Enterococcus isolates than the control group (χ² = 6.4, df = 1, P < 0.05). In summary, the quantitative MSU had no discriminatory diagnostic power, but the microbial communities isolated in the process showed some differences between the patients and the controls.

### Reassessment of routine midstream culture in diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^115CWj9W]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

This study underlines the potential weaknesses of the MSU culture for diagnosing UTI in patients affected by LUTS, which should now be assessed further in a larger, multicenter study. These patients appear to harbor chronic infection, missed by quantitative cultures and most effectively demonstrated by nonculture techniques. These methods shed light on the complexity of the bacterial communities within these patients, whose symptoms and urinary white blood cell count may be the best indicators of infection until the disease landscape is better understood. In the meantime, those responsible for UTI detection, diagnosis, and patient care, including clinicians and microbiologists, may wish to use caution when interpreting a negative or mixed-growth MSU culture result in symptomatic patients, as well as reassess reporting and treatment guidelines to arrive at a solution most appropriate for patients in a way that also preserves antibiotic stewardship efforts. Ultimately, a point-of-care test based on a sound understanding of the relevant microbiomes using emerging portable genomic technology would revolutionize the diagnostic landscape for this common affliction.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^113YVYB8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to clinical and analytic factors, new diagnostics must always be viewed through the broader lens of healthcare systems. The potential clinical value of new technologies are always weighed against their financial implications for the patient, provider, payer, and laboratory. This dynamic is already at play for syndromic molecular testing for respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens, which are generally only reimbursed for a narrow set of indications. Relative to traditional culture, multitarget molecular assays might entail more favorable reimbursement to the performing laboratory, but their appropriateness for different patient populations is a function of cost-benefit analyses across these stakeholders.

These considerations would certainly apply to any novel UTI diagnostics that achieve IVD status. At the same time, we must acknowledge the parallel growth in laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) offered through specialized reference laboratories, already in clinical use, for which such caveats may be further magnified. In the USA, for instance, Clinical and Laboratory Improvement Amendment-accredited laboratories have historically been given leeway to design, validate, and market in-lab-developed tests without direct review by the FDA (and subsequent IVD status) under a model of enforcement discretion. Accordingly, various commercial reference laboratories have developed and promoted LDTs for the evaluation of microbes in urine (see Table 5). These include assays that ostensibly identify and/or quantify numerous uropathogens through nucleic acid testing. In addition, at least two laboratories (Table 5) provide a "pooled" antimicrobial susceptibility assessment, whereby a mixture of microorganisms is subjected to proprietary AST in one test. A common anecdotal phenomenon, in some cases, is the direct marketing of these assays to providers (including the potential for direct third-party billing), bypassing institutions' clinical laboratory infrastructure. Admittedly, it is difficult to offer granular comments on all such LDTs, in some cases due to a paucity of peer-reviewed (or publicly available) data on their analytic characteristics, clinical performance, and underlying validation.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1172Rvx7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) diagnostic definitions and specimen requirements — In patients without indwelling catheters, ASB is defined as ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in a voided urine specimen without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). For women, 2 consecutive specimens obtained preferably within 2 weeks are used to confirm persistence, and between 10% and 60% of women do not have persistent bacteriuria on repeat screening after an initial positive specimen. For men, a single urine specimen meeting these quantitative criteria is sufficient for diagnosis. In patients with indwelling devices, ≥ 10³ CFU/mL remains the most appropriate diagnostic criteria for bladder bacteriuria, while lower quantitative counts (≥ 10² to < 10⁵ CFU/mL) from "in and out" catheterization or after insertion of a new indwelling catheter suggest true bacteriuria, although the clinical significance of these lower counts in asymptomatic people has not been evaluated.

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^111GhprH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study of pregnant women at term, we observed that MSU samples had greater bacterial growth and variety when compared to CSU samples. The majority of epithelial cells in both MSU and CSU samples were urothelial in origin, implying no difference in contamination rates. Furthermore, MSU samples had a higher proportion of clue cells to UP3+ cells, and may indicate a greater degree of bacterial invasion when compared to urine sampled directly from the bladder. This has implications for the correct interpretation of MSU findings in late pregnancy.

UK laboratories diagnose urinary tract infections using a threshold of ≥ 10⁵ total cfu/ml first described in 1957 by Kass et al. This standard persists despite having been shown to misdiagnose over 50% of women with lower urinary tract symptoms. A much lower count of ≥ 10² cfu/ml of a single isolate has been suggested as a more appropriate threshold for infection in acutely symptomatic women. In the event of mixed bacterial growth, the sample is considered to be contaminated by vulvo-vaginal bacterial flora. Within our term pregnant population, the majority of MSU sample sediment cultures had mixed growth and total cfu/ml > 10³. Our sediment culture appears to correlate with clinical presentation as most participants reported multiple lower urinary tract symptoms. However, they were classified as "no significant growth" or "mixed growth of uncertain significance" by routine laboratory culture. It is possible also that symptomatic pregnant women of term gestation with mixed growth and fewer bacterial colonies may not be appropriately treated when standard means are used.

### Multi-layered ecological interactions determine growth of clinical antibiotic-resistant strains within human microbiomes [^113b6nsu]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our findings also shed light on the relevance of different experimental conditions for explaining the variable success of resistant strains invading human microbiomes. We found good agreement between intrinsic growth capacities measured in sterilised microcosms produced with human stool samples and ecological success in live gut microcosms. This is encouraging, suggesting in vitro measurements in pure cultures can predict ecological success of individual strains in complex communities. However, this was not true of multivariate metabolic phenotypes measured across various single-carbon-source environments in Biolog EcoPlates. These and similar types of plates have been used previously to phenotype resistant strains. These data have relatively high resolution and revealed differences among strains' metabolic fingerprints, but these were not correlated with ecological success in live microcosms. Although the Biolog EcoPlates do not replicate the nutrient conditions of our microcosms, they provide a standardised view of metabolic variation that may be informative in contexts where resource-based competition plays a strong role, or where limiting nutrients can be more precisely identified. Furthermore, we did not see evidence of phages in experiments with filtered supernatant that could explain the differences in population growth in the microcosms, suggesting other factors, such as resource competition or bacterial interactions, are more likely driving the variability in strain performance. Together, these findings suggest that conclusions from experiments aiming to explain or predict the spread of resistant strains, such as assessing the cost of resistance through growth assays relative to susceptible genotypes, are most informative when carried out with growth media that come as close as possible to the natural environment of interest. Thus, our results support the employment of urine and faecal extracts in growth assays. In addition, the general agreement we saw between sterilised microcosms and results from relevant complex media (LB and basal medium) indicates appropriate synthetic alternatives, such as artificial urine medium, can also be informative.

INTRODUCTION

One of the main activities of a microbiology laboratory is the diagnosis of suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) by urine culture (UC). Urine culture requires seeding of urine on a culture plate by a technician, followed by visual inspection after overnight incubation. The possible results of visual inspection are no significant growth, contaminated sample, or positive growth. A UC with positive growth is further processed to identify the microorganism responsible for the infection and test antibiotic sensitivity. The whole process usually takes 24 to 48 hours. Typically, a large number of UCs are eventually deemed negative (no growth or contaminated, around 66% in our records), and thus screening methods to identify negative samples before UC are highly desirable to decrease the workload and cost of the laboratory while shortening the release time of negative samples.

Comparison of culture techniques.

We compared the discriminatory power of the hospital MSU culture with that of other methods, specifically, plating a larger volume of uncentrifuged urine and plating samples enriched by centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 2, microbial growth was categorized as "no growth", "one isolate", and "two or more isolates" for comparison. Of note, as the amount of bacterial input increased (from 1 µl supernatant to 50 µl supernatant of centrifuged sediment), regardless of the patient group, more polymicrobial growths were revealed. Using this alternative categorization, the MSU culture replicated within our research laboratories was still unable to discriminate between the three study groups (χ² = 4.6, df = 4, P = 0.326). Additionally, culturing more supernatant (50 µl) or the sediment did not improve differentiation across the three cohorts (χ² = 11.7, df = 4, P = 0.02 [no significant differences were identified with post hoc analysis] and χ² = 8.4, df = 4, P = 0.078, respectively), likely because, as we and others have reported, healthy bladders also harbor polymicrobial growths. These results suggest that quantitative microbiology is not an adequate diagnostic tool for patients experiencing LUTS.

URINE CULTURE AS A STANDARD OF CARE

Bacterial cultures have been the cornerstone to the diagnosis of UTIs since the 1950s. It is therefore important to understand the basis of these culture-based techniques, against which any new technologies are compared. Even before a urine specimen arrives in the lab, culture protocols are defined by pre-analytic steps that begin with collection. Into the early 1950s, urine specimens were more frequently collected via catheterization to reduce contamination, although the practice as conducted at the time not infrequently led to iatrogenic UTIs. Voided specimens have since become the norm, with a midstream clean catch required to minimize periurethral contamination. While first-morning specimens yield higher bacterial concentrations than samples collected later in the day, the impact on collection practices is likely minimal. If not processed within 30 minutes to 2 hours, urine must be kept refrigerated at 4°C to minimize changes in bacterial composition. Boric acid (20 g/L) is commonly used as a bacteriostatic agent to stabilize specimens for up to 48 hours.

Semi-quantitative urine culture is performed by most laboratories. For voided specimens, 1 µL of urine is plated onto a non-selective and Gram-negative-selective media which are incubated aerobically for a minimum of 12–18 hours, leading to growth of non-fastidious aerobes and facultative anaerobes. Over the years, various additional selective/differential media have been developed to aid in presumptive identification. Catheterized, cystoscopic, and aspirated suprapubic collections may be inoculated with 10 µL of specimen and plates held for up to 48 hours. The inoculation volume defines the lower limit of detection: 1,000 CFU/mL for 1 µL, 100 CFU/mL for 10 µL. Furthermore, the 1 µL–10 µL inoculum helps reduce potential co-isolation of periurethral contaminants, which rarely exceed 1,000 CFU/mL under proper clean-catch conditions. Plates are observed for the quantity and purity of microbial growth, which are both summarized in the reported result. Higher-abundance growth is more strongly associated with clinical significance, while multiple colony morphotypes (typically ≥ 3) are considered evidence of periurethral contaminant. At the same time, the latter phenomenon must be weighed alongside the possibility of polymicrobial UTIs in at-risk patients.

### Presentation, pattern, and natural course of severe symptoms, and role of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among patients presenting with suspected uncomplicated urinary tract infection in primary care: observational study [^112G278x]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Laboratory analysis

The urine samples were transported as in routine practice, and a 10 μl sample of urine was cultured on CLED (cysteine lactose electrolyte deficient) agar and incubated overnight at 37ºC. We used EU guidelines, which advocate reporting down to 10⁹ cfu (colony forming units) per l or pure growth of E coli but higher counts for more unusual organisms or mixed growths. When there was no growth or growth not consistent with infection (that is, probable contamination) patients were classified as having "urethral" syndrome. The use of lower colony counts is based on evidence of response to treatment, further evidence from validation studies, and consensus internationally; and the latest UK standards also include lower colony counts (pdf/bsop41.pdf).

Sample size

Calculation was done for α = 0.05, and β = 0.2 with the NQuery sample size program (Release 3, Statistical solutions). If 20% of individuals have a resistant organism, in a sample of 455 patients with complete outcomes we should be able to detect a difference in symptom resolution of 0.33 SD (1–2 days). There are no clearly established risk factors for prognosis, but we hypothesised that patients' perceptions of communication, indices of severity, comorbidity, previous operations, somatic symptoms, history, and marital status might be important. Based on this and assuming that five to eight variables in a model might explain about 20% of the variance in outcome, for 80% power and α of 0.01 (to minimise type I error), we needed 312 patients with complete datasets to detect an additional variable that explains a further 3% of the variance in outcome (and much smaller than 3% of the variance would probably not be an important variable).

There is insufficient evidence to inform a recommendation for or against repeat screening during the pregnancy after an initial negative culture or after treatment of an initial episode. In pregnant women with ASB, we suggest 4–7 days of antimicrobial treatment rather than a shorter duration (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

DISCUSSION

A recent commentary in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology emphasized how the diagnostic landscape for UTI is becoming increasingly challenging in the face of alternatives to standard culture. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the routine MSU culture performed in UK diagnostic laboratories. This evaluation is crucial, since culture is considered the gold standard diagnostic test for confirming or excluding UTI in symptomatic patients, although evidence suggests that it may be deficient. In the United Kingdom, symptom-based empirical antibiotic treatment for acute UTI is recommended. The evidence suggests that the diagnostic accuracy of acute symptoms in previously asymptomatic subjects outperforms routine culture-based diagnosis. In contrast, relapsing patients with LUTS are not as straightforward and may demonstrate a distinct microbiota under the influence of prescribed antimicrobials. The cohort of relapsing patients was consequently excluded from genomic analysis to aid in clarifying the differences in urinary microbial communities between first-visit patients with LUTS and health. Despite testing negative on routine MSU culture, such patients have been shown to harbor uropathogens when their urine is examined with more sensitive methods. Furthermore, symptomatic resolution has been observed following antibiotic treatment in this type of patient. Therefore, we questioned whether current routine MSU cultures with a > 10⁵ -CFU/ml threshold were sensitive enough to detect UTI in patients presenting with LUTS.

Following a symptomatic assessment of LUTS patients, we scrutinized the microbial composition of each patient and control MSU culture and compared these results to the results reported by the hospital diagnostic laboratory, as well as to the organisms identified using other alternative culture and molecular methods. Crucially, we found that the routine MSU culture results reported by the diagnostic laboratory failed to discriminate between the patient and control groups. Less than 10% of patients with a clinically suspected UTI had a positive MSU culture, with only 4 of 33 new patient cultures producing monomicrobial growth at 10 5 CFU/ml. In contrast, bacterial DNA sequencing revealed bacteria, including recognized uropathogens, in 32 new patients, including symptomatic patients who were reported to have a negative MSU culture. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was not applied as a diagnostic test, but rather, it was used to determine whether recognized uropathogens were missed with routine culture techniques and to characterize symptomatic and healthy urinary bacterial communities.

### Stopping routine urine screening studies for stroke rehabilitation inpatient admissions [^116K57CW]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Results

Post-PDSA#1, a chart audit was completed on 23 charts, and the primary outcome measure of 100% reduction of unnecessary admission urine tests was achieved. One patient had urine tests ordered appropriately on admission as the patient experienced new symptoms of urinary retention. Despite the urine culture being positive for mixed growth, this patient was asymptomatic, and antibiotics were not started. The overall cost of urine testing on admission was reduced to $C25.00. Also, 22 of 23 orders were crossed out by ordering providers, and 1 sticker applied by the unit clerk. Five patients required urine tests to investigate for UTIs during hospitalisation. Of those, three urine cultures returned positive for Escherichia coli, two patients required antibiotic treatment and cost of urine testing was $C150.00. Two in-person educational meetings, three pamphlets were placed on the unit and ten views of the online video resulted.

### Evaluation of an image analysis device (APAS) for screening urine cultures [^112nePVN]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

A total of 818 cases found to be positive by APAS were reported by the laboratory as having either contaminants or normal urogenital flora present where typically greater than three organisms were present. This false-positive rate was responsible for the low specificity of 66.9%. However, as each of these cases was referred by APAS to a microbiologist for careful review in line with the laboratory's interpretive criteria, patient safety was not compromised. Thus, as a screening device, where sensitivity is more important than specificity, the segmentation of these cases by APAS was favorable and as such was considered acceptable within the general workflow of a modern laboratory.

The urine leukocyte count was used within the APAS decision algorithm for each specimen within the study. This optional feature identified three cases with apparently sterile pyuria. Further assessment of these cases by the laboratory showed that clinically relevant growth was detected on cultures inoculated with 10 μl urine as opposed to the 1 μl used in the study. Associating leukocyte counts with the culture report can enhance the diagnostic value of urine cultures as the finding of pyuria may indicate the presence of low numbers of uropathogens, slow-growing organisms, or more complex urinary tract pathology.

The recent introduction of plate-imaging systems for reading cultures offers a number of quality improvements and an image archive facility for diagnostic and teaching purposes. Progressing from these imaging systems to fully automated culture plate readers will be challenging as there is a perception that machines cannot exercise the complex decision-making skills required to assess microbiological cultures. Additionally, little has been published regarding the accuracy and reproducibility of manual plate reading, so validating new technologies will require a better understanding of current manual reporting performances.

In conclusion, all cases of clinical infection were detected by APAS and its associated decision algorithm during the study. However, in a few cases, small colonies in low numbers were not detected, indicating the possibility that uropathogens in the early stage of growth or highly fastidious organisms may not be detected. To avoid this, specimen management and result validation strategies as described above may need to be implemented.

### Promoting appropriate urine culture management to improve health care outcomes and the accuracy of catheter-associated urinary tract infections [^114NonCc]. American Journal of Infection Control (2017). Low credibility.

Published literature indicates that the unjustified ordering or improper collection of urine for urinalysis or culture from either catheterized patients or those without indwelling devices, or misinterpretation of positive results, often leads to adverse health care events, including increased financial burdens, overreporting of mandated catheter-associated urinary tract infection events, overtreatment of patients with antimicrobial agents, selection of multidrug-resistant organisms, and Clostridium difficile infection. Moreover, national guidelines that provide evidence-based direction on core processes that form the basis for subsequent clinical therapy decisions or surveillance interpretations; that is, the appropriate ordering and collection of urine for laboratory testing and the treatment of patients with symptomatic urinary tract infection, are not widely known or lack adherence. This article provides published evidence on the influence of inappropriate ordering of urine specimens and subsequent treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and associated adverse effects; reviews research on bacterial contamination and preservation; and delineates best practices in the collection, handling, and testing of urine specimens for culture or for biochemical analysis in both catheterized and noncatheterized patients. The goal is to provide infection preventionists (IPs) with a cohesive evidence-based framework that will assist them in facilitating the implementation of a urine culture management program that reduces patient harms, enhances the accuracy of catheter-associated urinary tract infection surveillance, improves antibiotic stewardship, and reduces costs.

### Intracellular bacterial communities: a potential etiology for chronic lower urinary tract symptoms [^111hfoFD]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with persistent lower urinary tract symptoms and negative urine cultures are often difficult to treat. Infection may go undetected in these patients because the concentrations of bacteria in their urine are beneath the threshold of standard urine culture techniques. Empiric treatment may result in temporary relief, followed by recurrent symptoms. Occult and recurrent urinary tract infection may be due to both invasion of the bladder wall by uropathogenic Escherichia coli and the formation of biofilm-like intracellular bacterial communities. This review examines emerging evidence for a role of intracellular bacterial communities in human infection.

Approaches to diagnostic stewardship with the laboratory

Nursing homes, particularly those as part of a larger chain or in the same geographic region, may consider working with their contracted laboratory partners to implement aspects of diagnostic stewardship (similar to acute care hospitals), which include pre-analytic (test ordering), test processing, analytic, or post-analytic (test reporting). In the analytic or processing phase, prespecified criteria like presence of pyuria (i.e. white blood cells) on urinalysis may be used to determine whether a urine culture should be processed by the laboratory. In the post-analytic or reporting phase, the laboratory may report mixed urine cultures as possibly contaminated and use cascade reporting of antimicrobials to aid appropriate antimicrobial choices. Alternatively, the laboratory may use the high negative predictive value of a normal test result to stop unnecessary antimicrobials (e.g. stopping antimicrobials for UTI in residents without pyuria on urinalysis). The laboratory may also support the nursing home by alerting the facility about cultures growing antimicrobial-resistant organisms of interest, educating HCP about sample collection and transport procedures, describing types of diagnostic tests, developing facility-specific antibiograms, and providing periodic reports on specific diagnostic tests (e.g. number of urine cultures ordered, percent positives, organisms identified on cultures).

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113EKioz]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Follow-up evaluation in recurrent urinary tract infection — clinicians should repeat urine cultures to guide further management when UTI symptoms persist following antimicrobial therapy (Expert Opinion). After initiating antimicrobial therapy for UTI, clinical cure is expected within three to seven days, and it is reasonable to repeat microbiological assessment if UTI symptoms persist beyond seven days. Although a second antibiotic can be given empirically, this should only be done after a urine sample is obtained to minimize unnecessary treatment when laboratory data is inconsistent with persistent infection.

Limited data exist regarding SARS-CoV-2 cultures in nonrespiratory specimens. Viral culture was attempted in serum samples of PCR-positive patients without growth. Viral stool cultures have yielded mixed results. Wölfel et alperformed viral culture of 13 stool samples from 4 different patients with mild disease on days 6–12 without growth, despite RNA detected in the stool through day 21. Viable virus was detected in the stool of a critically ill patient on day 19 with negative cultures beyond this despite a positive NP/OP PCR through day 28. Of 7 studies that processed urine samples, 2 reported detecting viable virus by culture. Also, 2 studies of patients with positive respiratory PCR samples attempted to culture virus from tears, but they yielded no growth.

### Bacteriology and clinical outcomes of urine mixed bacterial growth in pregnancy [^116kZq4n]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

The objective was to analyse the risk of significant bacteriuria in repeat urine cultures from pregnant women, following initial mixed bacterial results.

Methods

This retrospective study examined maternal characteristics and clinical features of women who repeated urine cultures due to previous mixed cultures results.

Results

Of 262 women included, 80 (30.5%) had negative cultures and 125 (47.7%) had mixed bacterial growth in their repeat cultures. Positive results (≥ 10⁴ CFU/ml of a urinary pathogen) were obtained for 57 women (21.8% [95% CI 17.1–27.0]). For 37 (14.1%), the repeat specimen grew 10⁴–10⁵ CFU/ml of microorganisms; whereas for 20 women (7.6% [95% CI 4.9–11.3]), it grew ≥ 10⁵ CFU/ml. Among women with positive (> 10 4 CFU/ml) compared with those with negative or mixed growth, rates of urinary symptoms were higher (38.6% vs 23.4%, p = 0.028), abnormal dipstick results (49.1% vs 21.0%, p < 0.001) and hydronephrosis, as demonstrated by renal ultrasound (12.3% vs 2.0, p = 0.003). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, hydronephrosis was associated with the occurrence of a positive repeat culture (aOR = 10.65, 95% CI 2.07–54.90). The sensitivity and specificity for predicting a repeat urine culture with ≥ 10 5 CFU/ml were 12.9% and 94.3% respectively, for urinary symptoms; and 19.7% and 97.4% respectively, for abnormal dipstick results.

Conclusions

Mixed bacterial growth might represent a true urinary tract infection in a considerable proportion of women who are symptomatic and have an abnormal dipstick urinalysis.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^113665eK]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Diagnosis: culture

Laboratory culture is the gold standard for UTI diagnosis. Urine is sterile; therefore, the presence of bacteria in sufficient quantity, with concurrent evidence of active infection, suggests UTI. Urine is added to a growth medium, from which bacteria and antibiotic sensitivities are identified. Culture takes around 24 hours, then the presumptive diagnosis can be reviewed. All major UTI guidelines recommend culture is required for UTI diagnosis.

How many bacteria are needed to diagnose UTI in children? Thresholds vary between guidelines and collection methods. The commonly quoted threshold of 100 000 CFU/mL of a single organism is based on a seminal study in adult women by Kassfrom 1956. Does this threshold apply in children? American guidelines suggest a 50 000 CFU/mL threshold with concurrent pyuria for SPA and catheter specimens. More recent evidence suggests an even lower 10 000 CFU/mL threshold would slightly increase sensitivity without reducing diagnostic specificity. Many guidelines suggest that any growth on SPA is abnormal, as SPA has negligible contamination.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is the presence of bacteria in the urine without active infection. ASB prevalence is estimated at 1.4%–1.9% in childhood. Bacterial growth without evidence of active infection (eg, pyuria) does not suggest UTI.

In reality, these diagnostic thresholds are not binary. Low colony counts on culture may represent early infection, contamination or ASB. Pyuria may occasionally be absent in early infection or immunocompromise. Screening and culture results must always be considered in the clinical context.

Contamination

Contamination muddies the waters when evaluating UTI. Assuming a single uropathogen causes UTI, multiple organisms suggests sample contamination. Incidental flora colonise the perigenital skin and can get flushed into the urine sample on voiding. Missed diagnosis can occur if a true uropathogen is concealed in the mix or misdiagnosis if a single contaminant dominates the culture. Contamination can be minimised by cleaning the perigenital skin before sample collectionand avoiding touching inside the specimen jar or holding the jar against the child's skin.

What is on the horizon?

Current tests for UTI lack absolute sensitivity or specificity. Urinary biomarkers such as interleukin 6 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin have been proposed to differentiate between active infection and ASB. Real-time PCR has been proposed to identify common uropathogens such as E. coli. Further research is required to understand the clinical utility of these emerging tests.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in infancy — An important cause of bacteriuria without pyuria is asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can occur in infants. In a study of infants 2 to 24 months of age, 0.7% of afebrile girls had 3 successive urine cultures with 105 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen; this condition can be confused with true UTI but should be distinguished because studies suggest antimicrobial treatment may do more harm than good, and the key discriminator is the presence of pyuria.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112X9ECx]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — urine culture contamination is common and clinically consequential. Standard urine culture is susceptible to contamination with an average contamination rate of 15% across institutions; contamination is likely when there is low bacterial growth and/or growth of several species typical of urethral and vaginal commensals such as Lactobacilli, Corynebacteria, Gardnerella, alpha-hemolytic Streptococci, and aerobes. Contamination often arises in the pre-analytic phase (urine collection, storage, and transport), and false positives can lead to suboptimal or unnecessary treatment and added healthcare costs.

### Official American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America / centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^114XneaP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Extrapulmonary tuberculosis — mycobacterial culture (Question 17) states: We recommend that mycobacterial cultures be performed, rather than not performed, on specimens collected from sites of suspected extrapulmonary TB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Accuracy studies indicate that mycobacterial culture has a sensitivity of 23%–58%, 40%–58%, 80%–90%, 45%–70%, 45%–69%, and 50%–65% across pleural fluid, pleural tissue, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, and pericardial fluid, respectively, and the specificity of mycobacterial culture tends to be comparatively higher than the sensitivity (> 97%). A positive result can be used as evidence of extrapulmonary TB and guide decision making because false-positive results are unlikely; however, a negative result may not be used to exclude TB because false-negative results are exceedingly common. The estimated specificity of > 97% for mycobacterial cultures in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB indicates that false-positive results occur only < 3% of the time; thus, a positive mycobacterial culture is a reliable indicator that infection is present, yet even the specimen that provides the highest sensitivity (urine has an 80%–90% sensitivity for the diagnosis of urinary TB) provides false-negative results 10%–20% of the time. Importantly, positive mycobacterial cultures are the only way to obtain isolates for DST.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112z1xSU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in children — epidemiology and natural history — is characterized by low prevalence and mixed renal findings: ASB is rare in children with a normal urinary tract and does not appear to be associated with important harms; in a 1987 cohort using suprapubic aspiration, ASB was present in 2.5% of boys and 0.9% of girls, with 11% having grade 1–2 vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), 2 (4% [95% CI, 0.5%–13.7%]) of 50 children subsequently diagnosed with acute pyelonephritis, and no cases of renal scarring (95% CI, .7%–7.1%). In office-based U.S. infants, ASB occurred in 1.8% of females and 0.5% of males (aged 3–23 months), and in preschool children it was seen in 0.8% of girls and no boys (aged 2–5 years), with VUR present in 46% of infants and 9% of preschool children. Screening studies reported ASB in 1.8% of 1600 British schoolgirls (aged 5–12 years) followed for up to 13 years and in 1.6% of adolescent girls in Boston. A Virginia program enrolling 8872 school-aged girls and followed for 7 years found an ASB rate of 2.9% and 3% symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI); in a subset, renal scarring or caliectasis occurred in 16 cases and none of controls (risk difference [RD], 32.0% [95% CI, 18.7%–45.3%]) with higher hospitalization for UTI and pyelonephritis in ASB (15%) vs controls (2.6%; RD, 13.4% [95% CI, 2.0%–24.7%]) and a higher mean serum creatinine (0.88 vs 0.76 mg/dL) without exceeding normal. In a 3-year Swedish cohort of 116 schoolgirls, 12 (10%) had renal scarring, 11 (9%) had VUR without scarring, and 91 (78%) had no reflux or scarring; 47% remained bacteriuric after 3 years and renal growth and concentrating capacity remained normal.

In this first episode of the Microbiologist in the Clinic series, clinicians and laboratory scientists share their perspectives about a 30 y/o woman, who is seeking specialty consultation for frequent episodes of urinary urgency, frequency, and dysuria, which respond to short courses of antibiotics. Although her home dipsticks suggest that she has a UTI, and her urinalysis typically has a moderate number of white blood cells, her urine cultures are always negative. The challenges of this clinical presentation are discussed with evidence for evaluation and treatment.

### Contamination rates of three urine-sampling methods to assess bacteriuria in pregnant women [^115abkW4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate and compare contamination rates of three different urine-sampling methods in pregnant women to assess bacteriuria.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, 113 pregnant women collected three different midstream urine samples consecutively: morning (first void); midstream (void without further instructions); and clean-catch sample (void after cleaning). The following end points were considered contaminants: epithelial cells, Gram-positive rods or mixed bacteria in the Gram stain, and mixed growth or skin flora in the urine culture. Intraindividual variability in contaminants was quantified with Fleiss-Cohen's weighted κ statistic. Differences between samples were assessed using generalized estimating equations.

Results

Mainly low numbers of Gram-positive rods were more likely to be present in Gram stains of midstream samples compared with clean-catch samples (77.7% compared with 66.7%, P = 0.022). Morning samples showed more mixed growth compared with midstream samples (6.2% compared with 0.9%, P = 0.050). No consistency in quantity of contaminants was found in midstream samples compared with morning and clean-catch samples. No differences were found between the other end points in all three urine samples (P > .05). The study could detect an odds ratios of 2.0 for differences in urine-sampling methods with 80% power and 5% significance for most end points.

Conclusion

In pregnant women, the contamination rate of midstream samples is comparable with the contamination rates of morning and clean-catch samples. The quantity of contaminants varied among the three samples collected by one woman. These results show that more complex, unpractical, and time-consuming morning and clean-catch samples are not superior. Therefore, we recommend a midstream sample to assess bacteriuria in pregnant women.

Antimicrobial stewardship considerations in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) emphasize limiting unnecessary cultures and therapy; a positive urine culture often encourages antimicrobial use, and obtaining urine cultures when not clinically indicated promotes inappropriate antimicrobial use. Given the potential negative societal consequence of antimicrobial resistance, screening for bacteriuria and treatment of ASB should be discouraged unless there is evidence to support a benefit of treatment for a given population. Randomized studies across multiple groups found no benefit of antimicrobial treatment, while antimicrobials increased risks including antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and in some cases increased urinary tract infection shortly after therapy.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^1126FRvn]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis — urine culture thresholds and organism relevance: In infants and children, an appropriate threshold to consider bacteriuria significant is at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single urinary pathogen, and reducing the threshold from 100 000 CFUs per mL to 50 000 CFUs per mL may increase sensitivity but decrease specificity; laboratories that report categorical results (0 to 1000, 1000 to 10 000, 10 000 to 100 000, and more than 100 000 CFUs per mL) require contextual interpretation for results in the 10 000 to 100 000 CFUs per mL range, and organisms such as Lactobacillus spp, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Corynebacterium spp are not considered clinically relevant urine isolates for otherwise healthy, 2- to 24-month-old children; infants with positive culture alone are recognized as having asymptomatic bacteriuria rather than a true UTI when pyuria is absent.

### A prospective study comparing contamination rates between a novel mid-stream urine collection device (peezy) and a standard method in renal patients [^114wC5RB]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

It is imperative that laboratories receive uncontaminated urine samples to avoid giving false-positive results and reduce antimicrobial use.

Aim

The aim of the study was to investigate a novel urine collection device (Peezy) in a renal outpatient clinic to determine whether it reduced contamination of urine samples.

Methods

The novel device was used in 420 renal transplant recipients and the results were compared with 424 matched historical controls, who used the standard method of urine collection. High epithelial cell counts on microscopy and mixed urine cultures were used to identify contaminated samples.

Results

Peezy increased the rates of both epithelial cells and mixed growths in the urine samples when compared with the historical controls.

Conclusions

Further randomised studies in other more generalisable populations need to be performed.

Evaluation of culture results

All 118 urine samples were sent to the National Health Service (NHS) laboratory for routine culture (plating of 1 μl of urinary supernatant) and of these, 110 specimens were reported as "negative" (defined as below the 10⁵ cfu/ml threshold) or "mixed growth", which is commonly reported for chronic UTI patients. Thus, in addition to routine culture, we enriched infected cells by performing a spun sediment culture on the samples. Table 6 describes the occurrences of the top 90% of isolates across all patients cultured from the three different specimen collection methods. The data show that the spun sediment culture performed on MSU samples was the most productive method and the technique performed with CSU samples had significantly more negative results. The standard NHS culture method was far less productive whether it was from MSU or CSU; taken together, these results emphasise the insensitivities of both collection methods. The CSU seems to trade purity for sensitivity.

### Approach to a positive urine culture in a patient without urinary symptoms [^116EoXQ4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a condition in which bacteria are present in a noncontaminated urine sample collected from a patient without signs or symptoms related to the urinary tract. ASB must be distinguished from symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) by the absence of signs and symptoms compatible with UTI or by clinical determination that a nonurinary cause accounts for the patient's symptoms. The overall purpose of this review is to promote an awareness of ASB as a distinct condition from UTI and to empower clinicians to withhold antibiotics in situations in which antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria is not indicated.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria: when to screen and when to treat [^1135Vqiz]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common. Populations with structural or functional abnormalities of the genitourinary tract may have an exceedingly high prevalence of bacteriuria, but even healthy individuals frequently have positive urine cultures. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is seldom associated with adverse outcomes. Pregnant women and individuals who are to undergo traumatic genitourinary interventions are at risk for complications of bacteriuria and benefit from screening and treatment programs. Although screening is recommended for renal transplant recipients, the benefits for these patients are less clear. For other populations, including most bacteriuric individuals, negative outcomes attributable to asymptomatic bacteriuria have not been described. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in these patients is not beneficial and, in fact, may be associated with harmful outcomes, such as increased short-term frequency of symptomatic infection, adverse drug effects, and reinfection with organisms of increased antimicrobial resistance. Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria and treatment is recommended for only selected groups where benefit has been shown. Many research questions still need to be addressed. Different populations have unique risk factors, and the benefits and risks of different management approaches for asymptomatic bacteriuria must continue to be addressed systematically in appropriate clinical trials.

### Reducing unnecessary urine culture testing in residents of long term care facilities [^112iGFgv]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Additional system changes to support practice change

Beyond education and training, system changes are usually needed to support change in practice. In settings that utilise order sets, these should be updated to remove all non-evidence based urine testing outside of minimum accepted UTI symptoms. Removing access to urine dipsticks in long term care homes can reduce unnecessary urine cultures.

Decision support systems and requiring the input of clinical indication for each urine culture may have limited impact, possibly because prescribers select UTI for all cases, but a US intervention across 11 hospitals and 70 outpatient clinics showed a 20% reduction in urine cultures with this approach. Audit and feedback of urine culture ordering or prescriptions of antibiotics commonly used for UTI may also drive reductions and at minimum limit antibiotic duration. Finally, interventions within the laboratory to reject or modify reporting of urinary isolates that are likely to be ASB can markedly improve antibiotic prescribing practices while preserving prescriber autonomy, although these strategies require additional study in long term care settings. One example is increasing the threshold for defining significant growth in urine culture based on data suggesting that low colony counts are only rarely associated with infection in older adults admitted to hospital wards. Further research in long term care homes is needed before implementing this change more broadly.

Finally, a key lesson from the cluster randomised trial that implemented minimum criteria for UTI diagnosis is that although educational algorithms alone led to early practice changes, the reduction in urine culture ordering was not sustained. The combination of multiple process changes is likely necessary to enable a shift in the established culture of culturing across many long term care homes.

Strategies to reduce unnecessary urine cultures in long term care facilities

Education into practice

What investigations do you order for a resident in long term care who appears generally unwell or confused? Do they include urine culture?
How are urine specimens collected and submitted for culture at your institution? Are they collected by healthcare personnel, prior to an order being written by a physician?

### Reassessment of routine midstream culture in diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^114a2uM7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Few studies have analyzed the urinary microbial composition by laboratory outcome (i.e. negative, mixed, positive cultures), and the majority of such work has assessed culture techniques adopted in U.S. laboratories. Given the limitations of culture-based microbial detection, characterization of microbial communities in health and disease is now becoming increasingly dependent on approaches, such as DNA-based identification, which do not require growth under particular culture conditions. Using metagenomics, the urinary microbiota in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction, overactive bladder, urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), stress urinary incontinence (SUI), and uncomplicated UTI have been described. Some studies have also included comparisons to asymptomatic individuals.

A critical microbiological evaluation of the urine culture protocol adopted in the United Kingdom is long overdue. Here, we chose to study MSU culture performance in patients describing LUTS, including those who fall short of a positive culture and those demonstrating mixed growth, since these are generally deemed not to have a bona fide infection. This assertion hinges on standard culture-based diagnosis, and emerging data suggest that such patients harbor chronic infection. Our aim was to evaluate the MSU culture in symptomatic patients and asymptomatic controls and assess its performance using both culture and molecular approaches with and without specimen enrichment.
