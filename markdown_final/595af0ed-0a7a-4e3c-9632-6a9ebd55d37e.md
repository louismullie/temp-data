## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the multiple meanings of "SBL" across medicine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely clinical interpretations of "SBL" from the provided corpus. Then, I should verify each candidate meaning against the cited sources and assess its clinical relevance. Next, I will quantify where possible (e.g., normal ranges, outcomes) and note limitations. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized, clinically oriented summary with caveats and next steps for disambiguation [^1157FyFS].

> Let me first confirm the candidate meanings that recur in the corpus: Small Bowel Length, Secondary Breast Lymphoma, Sporadic Burkitt Lymphoma, Simulation-Based Learning, and a few device or brand uses such as the SBL-3 intraocular lens and an alcohol gel product from SBL LLC; I should also consider whether "SBL" appears as a generic acronym in other contexts like subchondral bone length or sample blood loss, but I need to check which of these are truly represented in the provided references before proceeding [^113GcJ8V] [^1111DgtJ] [^115yiM68] [^113eowKd] [^115iy1Kj] [^112up7Z1] [^1173R9NK] [^111QgmWe].

> I will now examine Small Bowel Length (SBL) because it appears most frequently and is clinically actionable in surgical and transplant contexts; wait, let me verify the normal ranges and measurement variability before drawing conclusions. In bariatric cohorts, mean SBL around 690–750 cm is typical, with wide individual variability and only modest correlation to height or weight, and measurement technique matters (fully stretched vs non-stretched vs laparoscopic) with differences of roughly 30–140 cm depending on method, which can materially affect surgical planning and nutritional risk assessment [^113GcJ8V] [^115q6TQU]. Hold on, I should also check pediatric and donor data; a donor cohort showed shorter mean SBL in smaller donors and a declining SBL-to-height ratio with growth, reinforcing that SBL does not scale linearly with body size, which is important for intestinal transplant and short bowel syndrome prognostication [^1118XBci]. Let me consider clinical implications: in short bowel syndrome, residual SBL strongly predicts survival and adaptation, with thresholds such as > 38 cm favoring adaptation and < 15 cm portending high mortality and low likelihood of weaning from parenteral nutrition, and in super-obesity, the proportion of bowel bypassed (BPL/SBL ratio) influences long-term weight loss after biliopancreatic diversion, underscoring why accurate SBL matters intraoperatively [^117CFy3U] [^111EVnZq].

> Next, I should review Secondary Breast Lymphoma (SBL); let me verify the epidemiology and imaging phenotype to avoid overcalling carcinoma. SBL represents the most common metastasis to the breast, accounting for about 17% of metastatic disease to the breast, and its imaging features often mimic primary breast carcinoma, so clinical history, multiplicity/bilaterality, and targeted biopsy with hematopathology are critical to distinguish SBL from PBL and carcinoma; clinically, multiple masses in older patients favor SBL, whereas a solitary lesion in a younger patient favors primary breast lymphoma, which guides diagnostic workup and staging [^1111DgtJ].

> Now, Sporadic Burkitt Lymphoma (sBL); I need to ensure I capture the molecular distinctions and therapeutic implications. sBL is a high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with MYC translocation and additional cooperating lesions; mechanistic work implicates E2F1 deregulation and, separately, E2F4 dysregulation, suggesting potential therapeutic targets beyond MYC, while integrated genomics underscores the centrality of MYC and the complex regulatory layers that sustain its activity; clinically, sBL requires aggressive, time-sensitive therapy, and pathobiology differs from endemic BL in terms of antigen drive and BCR signaling, which has implications for understanding cell of origin and treatment responsiveness [^114iiLk8] [^113vwhFT] [^115yiM68] [^117G8Kjf] [^116dHf6f].

> I will now examine Simulation-Based Learning (SBL); hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about educational impact without checking the evidence base. Multiple reports describe SBL as an effective modality, with SIMBA demonstrating improved trainee confidence and perceived applicability across acute care scenarios, and randomized simulation interventions showing gains in knowledge and skills for medication safety; these data support SBL's role in competency-based training, particularly when in-person opportunities are constrained, though transfer and retention require ongoing evaluation [^113eowKd] [^114reooc] [^115AnQgu] [^114dYRgF].

> But wait, what about device or brand uses of "SBL"? The SBL-3 multifocal intraocular lens is an FDA-cleared implant designed to improve near vision after cataract extraction, with randomized data showing better near acuity and reduced dependence on near correction compared with monofocal controls; I should confirm contraindications such as glaucoma, retinal detachment, and corneal decompensation before recommending it clinically [^115iy1Kj]. Separately, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer product is marketed under "SBL LLC", which is a brand rather than a medical acronym, so I need to ensure we don't conflate brand names with clinical entities in documentation [^112up7Z1].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "SBL" might also stand for subchondral bone length given its clinical relevance in knee osteoarthritis, but I should double-check the corpus; the OA paper indeed defines SBL as a deep learning–derived shape measure linked to joint space narrowing and future arthroplasty, yet this usage is not consistently adopted across the literature and may be context-specific, so I will flag it as a valid but less standardized meaning compared with the others above [^1173R9NK].

> I need to ensure I address terminology standardization because "SBL" is polysemous and can cause miscommunication; across domains, consensus efforts emphasize precise, harmonized nomenclature (e.g., cardiac CT, radiation oncology structures, genomic variant reporting), and pathology informatics literature catalogs thousands of abbreviations with polysemy and error potential, reinforcing the need to expand acronyms at first use and align with controlled vocabularies like UMLS or SNOMED CT whenever possible [^112KP8W5] [^1126oAQW] [^1146yu1h] [^114RL9F5] [^115MdKvv].

> Let me synthesize and prioritize by clinical salience: the most likely and impactful meanings in general medical discourse are Small Bowel Length, Secondary Breast Lymphoma, Sporadic Burkitt Lymphoma, and Simulation-Based Learning, with device/brand uses (SBL-3 IOL, SBL LLC sanitizer) as context-dependent; I should confirm that my ranking reflects frequency and clinical consequence in the cited corpus, and I will explicitly note that subchondral bone length is a valid but less standardized usage that may require local definition if used [^113GcJ8V] [^1111DgtJ] [^115yiM68] [^113eowKd] [^115iy1Kj] [^112up7Z1] [^1173R9NK].

> Finally, I should confirm practical disambiguation steps: in documentation, spell out "SBL" at first use with the intended expansion (e.g., "small bowel length (SBL)"), consider the clinical context to select among competing meanings, and, when relevant, cite the specific source that operationalizes the term (e.g., donor cohort for SBL ranges, ACR review for SBL imaging measure, SIMBA papers for SBL education); if uncertainty remains, ask the author or local experts to clarify, because precision in terminology reduces errors in care, research, and education [^1162WwWE] [^1118XBci] [^1173R9NK] [^113eowKd].

The acronym "SBL" in medicine has multiple meanings, including **small bowel length** [^113GcJ8V], **secondary breast lymphoma** [^1111DgtJ], and **simulation-based learning** [^113eowKd]. Small bowel length is a key anatomic measure in bariatric and transplant surgery, with a mean of ~690 cm and wide individual variability [^113GcJ8V]; it correlates weakly with height and sex, and is not reliably predicted by anthropometrics [^115q6TQU]. Secondary breast lymphoma denotes metastatic lymphoma to the breast, accounting for ~17% of breast metastases and often mimicking carcinoma on imaging [^1111DgtJ]. Simulation-based learning is an educational method widely used in medical training, including virtual platforms like SIMBA [^113eowKd], and has expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic [^114reooc]. The meaning of "SBL" is context-dependent; clinicians should clarify the intended term to avoid confusion [^1162WwWE].

## Small bowel length (SBL)

### Definition and clinical significance

Small bowel length (SBL) is the **total length of the small intestine**, typically measured from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal junction [^notfound]. It is a critical parameter in bariatric surgery, intestinal transplantation, and the management of short bowel syndrome [^117CFy3U].

---

### Normal range and variability

- **Mean SBL**: Approximately 690 cm (range 350–1049 cm) in adults [^113GcJ8V].
- **Variability**: Significant interindividual variation; weak correlation with height, weight, age, and sex [^115q6TQU].
- **Measurement methods**: Fully stretched bowel, non-stretched bowel, and laparoscopic measurements yield different lengths, with differences up to 137 cm [^113GcJ8V].

---

### Clinical implications

- **Bariatric surgery**: SBL influences surgical planning, particularly in procedures involving intestinal bypass or reconstruction [^113GcJ8V].
- **Short bowel syndrome**: Residual SBL is a major determinant of nutritional outcomes and adaptation [^117CFy3U].
- **Transplantation**: SBL assessment is essential in intestinal transplantation and donor-recipient matching [^notfound].

## Importance of context in interpreting SBL

Given the **multiple meanings** of "SBL", it is essential to consider the clinical context in which the acronym is used. Clear communication and documentation are necessary to avoid misunderstandings and ensure accurate patient care [^1156xoPj].

---

## Conclusion

"SBL" in medicine has distinct meanings — small bowel length, secondary breast lymphoma, and simulation-based learning — each with specific clinical implications. Accurate interpretation depends on **context**, and clinicians should clarify the intended meaning to ensure precise communication and patient care.

### What is the normal small bowel length in humans? first donor-based cohort analysis [^1118XBci]. American Journal of Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Normal small bowel length (SBL) has been reported within a wide range, but never studied in a cohort of either pediatric or adult deceased donors. Between 5/2006 and 2/2011, SBL was measured in all grafts procured for intestinal transplantation at a single center and used for either isolated intestinal transplant (15) or multiorgan transplants (5) employing a standardized method. SBL was the only not significantly different variable among pediatric and adult donors divided by age 16. Furthermore, donors were classified in 3 groups: group 1: Height < 70 cm, group 2: 71–150 cm and group 3: ≥ 151 cm. Mean age was: 0.58, 5.6, 22.01 years, respectively. Mean height and weight were 65.8, 123.2, 166.1 cm (p = 0.001) and 6.9, 23.8, 65.2 kg (p = 0.001), for each group. The SBL by group was: 283.0, 324.7, 356.0 cm, remaining as the only nonsignificant variable (p = 0.06), in contrast to BMI, BSA (p = 0.001). The SBL/height ratio: 4.24, 2.7, 2.12 (p = 0.001; rho: -0.623) or SBL/BSA ratio was 8.36, 3.7, and 2.03, respectively (p: 0.0001; rho: -0.9). SBL does not increase with growth like other anthropometric variables. The SBL/height ratio significantly decreases with growth; however, bowel diameter increases, which needs further evaluation.

### Small bowel obstruction [^113V7zqS]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on small bowel obstruction:

- **Definition**: SBO is a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms related to mechanical blockage of the small bowel.
- **Pathophysiology**: Common etiologies include adhesions (65%), hernias (10%), neoplasms (5%), and Crohn's disease (5%).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of SBO is approximately 100 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The distension of small bowel segments that are proximal to the obstruction may lead to clinical manifestations of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Bacterial translocation can result in bacteremia. Progressive, untreated obstruction may lead to bowel ischemia and perforation, with secondary fecal peritonitis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In patients with SBO due to postoperative adhesions, in-hospital mortality is estimated at 4.7%. In patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for SBO, 1-month mortality is estimated at 7.2%.

### Cancer stem cell definitions and terminology: the devil is in the details [^116NdU6a]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2012). Medium credibility.

The cancer stem cell (CSC) concept has important therapeutic implications, but its investigation has been hampered both by a lack of consistency in the terms used for these cells and by how they are defined. Evidence of their heterogeneous origins, frequencies and their genomic, as well as their phenotypic and functional, properties has added to the confusion and has fuelled new ideas and controversies. Participants in The Year 2011 Working Conference on CSCs met to review these issues and to propose a conceptual and practical framework for CSC terminology. More precise reporting of the parameters that are used to identify CSCs and to attribute responses to them is also recommended as key to accelerating an understanding of their biology and developing more effective methods for their eradication in patients.

### Primary and secondary breast lymphoma: clinical, pathologic, and multimodality imaging review [^1111DgtJ]. Radiographics (2019). Medium credibility.

Breast lymphoma is a rare hematologic neoplasm that originates in the breast lymphoid tissue and includes primary breast lymphoma (PBL) and secondary breast lymphoma (SBL). PBL involves the breast lymphoid tissue in the absence of previously identified extramammary lymphoma and widespread disease. SBL is the most common metastasis to the breast, accounting for 17% of metastatic disease to the breast. PBL and SBL usually demonstrate imaging phenotypes that overlap with those of primary breast carcinoma, which makes a prospective diagnosis of breast lymphoma challenging. These nonspecific imaging features include an iso- to hyperdense oval mass or masses at mammography, a hypoechoic or mixed-echogenicity hypervascular mass at US, an enhancing mass with type II kinetics at MRI, and high fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose avidity at PET. In cases of suspected lymphoma, reviewing the clinical history, using appropriate biopsy techniques, and evaluating for multiplicity, bilaterality, and distant disease are critical for diagnosis and management. A patient with PBL generally has an earlier clinical presentation with a palpable abnormality and a solitary imaging finding. In contrast, multiple masses in an older patient and an occult clinical presentation favor an SBL diagnosis. © RSNA, 2019.

### Laparoscopic small bowel length measurement: nonassociative nature of total small bowel length with anthropometric and clinical characteristics in patients undergoing bariatric surgery [^115q6TQU]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel length (SBL) may have an impact on the outcomes of bariatric surgeries, but it can be difficult to make a direct association between SBL and the safety and outcome of bariatric surgeries.

Objectives

To address this issue, we set out to devise a predictive model for SBL determination based on clinical and anthropometric variables.

Setting

An academic tertiary medical center.

Methods

Anthropometric and clinical data, including age, sex, height, weight, and past medical history, were collected upon enrollment. SBL was measured twice during the surgery using a marked grasper. In all cases, measurements were carried out by a single surgeon. To create a predictive model, a 2-step approach was employed. In the first step, linear regression was used to determine influential variables. In the second step, all variables with a P value < .2 were entered into a multivariate regression model.

Results

Overall, 961 bariatric candidates were enrolled. The mean age of the participants was 40.08 years, and 77.5% (n = 745) were female. The mean SBL was 748.90 centimeters. There was a weak but statistically significant positive correlation between SBL with both weight and height. Our univariate linear model determined only anthropometric parameters as a predictor of SBL. The multivariate model also yielded that none of the entered parameters were shown to be accurate predictors of SBL. Moreover, only 4.3% of variances were explainable by this model.

Conclusion

Although we found a weak positive association between height and SBL, this association lacked clinical practicality.

### Bowel length: measurement, predictors, and impact on bariatric and metabolic surgery [^113GcJ8V]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Small bowel length (SBL) determines the caloric absorptive capacity. The aim of this study was to evaluate SBL to identify patient-specific predictors and the interrelationships of SBL with anthropometric variables.

Methods

Sex, age, and weight were recorded at the time of surgery when SBL and the estimated jejunal length (JLe) were measured by 3 different methods.

Results

The mean SBL of 443 patients undergoing laparotomy (78% female) was 690 ± 93.7 cm (range 350–1049 cm). Sex was correlated with SBL, as men had a longer small bowel than women (729 ± 85 versus 678 ± 92, P < .0001) and were significantly taller (173 ± 8.2 versus 161 ± 6.9, P < .001). Age did not correlate with SBL. The differences in length between fully stretched small bowel and nonstretched small bowel and between fully stretched small bowel and laparoscopic bowel were 137 ± 19 cm and 32.4 ± 11.4 cm, respectively. In a multivariate linear regression analysis model that included sex, age, height, and weight, only height was significantly correlated with SBL (P < .00001) and explained 12% of the variance in SBL. Sex, age, height, and JLe, but not SBL, were statistically highly significant in predicting 75% of the variance of body weight.

Conclusions

A positive association between height and SBL was found. Sex, age, height, and JLe may be strong predictors of weight. Individual JLe may be of importance in determining the weight loss and resolution of metabolic co-morbidities. Measuring the SBL can prevent the risk of nutritional consequences in malabsorptive, revisional, and metabolic procedures.

### Recommendations for standardizing nuclear medicine terminology and data in the era of theranostics and artificial intelligence [^115MdKvv]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

STANDARDIZING TERMINOLOGY

In any knowledge domain, it is important for terms and definitions to be agreed upon. At a basic level, standardized terminology leads to conceptual clarity, meaning that those within the field share a common understanding of concepts. This has many downstream benefits. It facilitates the standardization of practices and protocols, supports the exchange of data and information, optimizes data usability, and leads to more coherent knowledge integration so that researchers can build on each other's research. This is especially critical in the emerging era of AI and large language models, where imaging and text datasets from different institutions must be combined and their metadata automatically scraped from electronic medical records (EMRs) to support algorithm development and testing.

History of Medical Coding

Efforts to standardize concepts and nomenclature in medicine have been ongoing for over a century. One of the earliest and most significant developments was the International Classification of Diseases. This aimed to enable international comparability in health data by providing codes to classify diseases, signs, and symptoms. Another crucial development came in 1966 with the introduction of the Current Procedural Terminology by the American Medical Association, which serves as a comprehensive, precoordinated coding scheme for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and interventions for the U.S. health care system. These medical coding initiatives have been pivotal in addressing inconsistencies and ambiguities in medical recordkeeping, billing, research, and communication.

### Evaluation of outcome following lithotripsy [^112NpzDX]. Current Opinion in Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) is considered as an initial option for a significant proportion of urinary tract stones. Despite efforts for standardized terminology and methodology, published studies on lithotripsy outcome are very different. This review will focus on a brief description of evidence-based medicine and recent literature results on SWL outcome.

Recent Findings

The introduction of hierarchy in scientific evidence is becoming more widespread. Various grading systems have attempted to rank recommendations according to type and amount of evidence. Different levels of evidence have been created for therapy, diagnosis and prognosis. Various authors have developed scoring systems and identified radiographic parameters to predict SWL outcome. The long-term safety of lithotripsy on renal function has been demonstrated. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis have shown that medical expulsive therapy and a slower shockwave rate will improve SWL outcome.

Summary

Evidence-based medicine is rapidly becoming an indispensable part of everyday medical practice. Common terminology is necessary for proper evaluation of SWL. Different types of studies are required to investigate efficacy, compare SWL to other options, complications and so on. Randomized clinical trials are of the highest value; matched-pair analyses and well designed controlled studies can offer significant help.

### 'Miscarriage or abortion?' understanding the medical language of pregnancy loss in britain; a historical perspective [^112S3edq]. Medical Humanities (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The clinical terminology applied to women's health experiences in Britain changed after the mid-1980s when doctors consciously began using the term 'miscarriage' instead of 'abortion' to refer to early pregnancy loss. In this essay I have sought to convey the meaning of this change in language: the factors behind it and its subsequent significance. Until now, Richard Beard's 1985 letter to the Lancet has tended to be perceived as an isolated stimulus to the shift in medical language and as a spontaneous response to women's feelings. However, evidence from medical journals and textbooks of the time reveals how Beard's letter and the change in medical language can be better understood in the context of certain historical developments that enabled and encouraged both the letter-writing and language shift.

From the late 1960s onwards, the changes in Britain's legislation allowing women greater access to abortion services also enabled them to discuss these issues with doctors without fear of being criminalised. In turn, doctors could engage in conversations with women without concern that they were being deceived: specifically, they could be confident that women describing symptoms of spontaneous pregnancy loss were not concealing a deliberate (and previously illegal) termination. Doctors' terminology for early pregnancy loss could now refer to something actually knowable. By the 1980s, developments in ultrasound technology enabled the content of a woman's uterus and any early pregnancy pathologies to be visualised in real time. Doctors were now able to apply their terminology diagnostically in the clinic.

For the first time in the medical history of early pregnancy loss, following the legal and technological developments described above, diagnostic language could be immediately coupled to a clinically knowable reality. For clinicians, this would have conferred greater significance upon the medical terminology and may have heightened consciousness of language in this context. Meanwhile, the need to define accurate and unambiguous terminology for describing diagnoses of fetal loss would have been given impetus by rapidly expanding medical knowledge of the fetus and the establishment of a new fetal-focused medical speciality. Consistent with this, the communication that sought to define the terminology came from a senior figure at the forefront of this burgeoning speciality.

### Risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113W4cxi]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

BRCA1/2 genetic testing terminology and panel availability — guidance and current options include that Guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, which were updated in 2015, recommend new standard terminology for reporting BRCA1/2 mutations identified by genetic tests, and these include a 5-tier terminology system using the terms "pathogenic", "likely pathogenic", "uncertain significance", "likely benign", and "benign". Since the ruling, the number of testing options has significantly increased, with more than 80 multigene panels that include BRCA1/2, as well as tests marketed directly to consumers.

### Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology [^1146yu1h]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association for Molecular Pathology sequence variant interpretation — the guideline recommends the use of specific standard terminology ("pathogenic"; "likely pathogenic"; "uncertain significance"; "likely benign"; and "benign") to describe variants in genes that cause Mendelian disorders, and describes a process for classifying variants into these five categories based on criteria using typical types of variant evidence (e.g., population data, computational data, functional data, segregation data); furthermore, because of the increased complexity of clinical sequencing analysis and interpretation, the ACMG strongly recommends that clinical molecular genetic testing should be performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–approved laboratory and interpreted by a board-certified laboratory geneticist or molecular genetic pathologist.

### Research pearls: the significance of statistics and perils of pooling. part 3: pearls and pitfalls of meta-analyses and systematic reviews [^113YRG7d]. Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Within the health care environment, there has been a recent and appropriate trend towards emphasizing the value of care provision. Reduced cost and higher quality improve the value of care. Quality is a challenging, heterogeneous, variably defined concept. At the core of quality is the patient's outcome, quantified by a vast assortment of subjective and objective outcome measures. There has been a recent evolution towards evidence-based medicine in health care, clearly elucidating the role of high-quality evidence across groups of patients and studies. Synthetic studies, such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses, are at the top of the evidence-based medicine hierarchy. Thus, these investigations may be the best potential source of guiding diagnostic, therapeutic, prognostic, and economic medical decision making. Systematic reviews critically appraise and synthesize the best available evidence to provide a conclusion statement (a "take-home point") in response to a specific answerable clinical question. A meta-analysis uses statistical methods to quantitatively combine data from single studies. Meta-analyses should be performed with high methodological quality homogenous studies (Level I or II) or evidence randomized studies, to minimize confounding variable bias. When it is known that the literature is inadequate or a recent systematic review has already been performed with a demonstration of insufficient data, then a new systematic review does not add anything meaningful to the literature. PROSPERO registration and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines assist authors in the design and conduct of systematic reviews and should always be used. Complete transparency of the conduct of the review permits reproducibility and improves fidelity of the conclusions. Pooling of data from overly dissimilar investigations should be avoided. This particularly applies to Level IV evidence, that is, noncomparative investigations. With proper technique, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have the potential to be powerful investigations that efficiently assist clinicians in decision making.

### Preoperative prediction of small bowel length using CT scan and tridimensional reconstructions: a new tool in bariatric surgery? [^111ykghv]. Obesity Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

During Roux-en-Y-gastric Bypass, the limb lengths are preoperatively determined regardless of individual small bowel length (SBL), which presents a great variability. Few studies highlighted anthropometric factors associated with SBL, and none attempted to predict SBL preoperatively.

Objective

The aim of this study is to evaluate factors correlated to SBL (anthropometric and radiologic) and to establish a preoperative SBL prediction.

Material and Methods

In this single-center prospective study, 30 adult patients who underwent laparotomy with a preoperative CT scan were included. Intraoperative SBL measurement was performed with an umbilical tape. Anthropometric parameters were age, gender, height, and BMI. 2D radiological measurements consisted of subcutaneous thickness, abdominal diameters, waist circumference, and mesenteric root length. 3D radiological volumetric reconstructions consisted of whole small bowel and mesentery (WSBM), lean small bowel and mesentery (LSBM), and fat small bowel and mesentery (FSBM).

Results

Mean intraoperative measurement of SBL was 531 ± 105 cm. Among the clinical and radiological measurements, the FSBM volume presented the greatest dispersion. Height (p < 0.02) and LSBM volume (p < 0.01) were significantly correlated to the SBL in univariate analysis. LSBM volume was the only measurement significantly associated with SBL in multivariate analysis (p < 0.006). From the multivariate model, a formula was created to predict SBL. The mean percentage difference between predicted and intraoperative SBL measurements for all patients was 13.7%, and 8.4% for obese patients.

Conclusion

LSBM volume is significantly correlated to the SBL. A preoperative SBL prediction with low percentage error could be performed with LSBM volume.

### E2F1 expression is deregulated and plays an oncogenic role in sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma [^114iiLk8]. Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

Current treatments of sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma (sBL) are associated with severe toxicities. A better understanding of sBL formation would facilitate development of less toxic therapies. The etiology of sBL remains, however, largely unknown, C-MYC up-regulation being the only lesion known to occur in all sBL cases. Several studies examining the role of C-MYC in the pathogenesis of BL have concluded that C-MYC translocation is not the only critical event and that additional unidentified factors are expected to be involved in the formation of this tumor. We herein report that a gene distinct from C-MYC, E2F1, is involved in the formation of all or most sBL tumors. We found that E2F1 is highly expressed in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and sBL lymphoma specimens. Our data indicate that its elevated expression is not merely the consequence of the presence of more cycling cells in this tumor relative to other cell lines or to other neoplasias. In fact, we show that reduction of its expression in sBL cells inhibits tumor formation and decreases their proliferation rate. We also provide data suggesting that E2F1 collaborates with C-MYC in sBL formation. E2F1 expression down-regulation did not affect, however, the proliferation of human primary diploid fibroblasts. Because E2F1 is not needed for cell proliferation of normal cells, our results reveal E2F1 as a promising therapeutic target for sBL.

### Standardized medical terminology for cardiac computed tomography: a report of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^115AroYA]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2011). Medium credibility.

Cardiac computed tomography (CT) acquisition terminology — Table 2 (continued) — standardizes key parameters and labels legacy synonyms as not recommended. Widened data acquisition window is defined as acquisition of additional axial CT data beyond the minimum needed for reconstruction to allow reconstruction of series using different phases, and previous terms and abbreviations (not recommended) include Padding, phase tolerance. Acquisition field of view is the diameter or width of the region within the scan plane exposed to x‑rays, expressed in units of mm (noting some units display mm or cm). Scan length is the distance between start and end of data acquisition along the z‑axis (direction of patient movement) for a single scan, expressed in mm. Scan time is the total time required to acquire raw data used to reconstruct all images over the entire scan length; in axial scan mode this includes the time required to increment the table between successive x‑ray exposures.

### Research pearls: how Do we establish the level of evidence? [^115Wv87U]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) guidelines were first introduced in 1986 and were defined as the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. The practice of EBM means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research. Level of evidence (LOE) stratifies publications from Level I to Level V and provides the foundation for EBM. Three questions should be asked when an LOE is assigned to a scientific article: (1) What is the research question? (2) What is the study type? and (3) What is the hierarchy of evidence? In cases in which LOE is not appropriate or relevant (basic science and laboratory-based investigations), a clinical relevance statement should be used. Unfortunately, study quality is not assessed by the assigned hierarchy level. LOE and EBM have increased the number of investigations published with better levels of evidence. As authors, reviewers, editors, and publishers, we desire a system that is consistent, effective, and reliable. Fortunately, the system has proven to have all of those attributes with good interobserver and intra-observer values. The increase in investigations with higher LOEs allows for more frequent use of EBM.

### Perspectives on the clinical significance of functional pain syndromes in children [^113EeqYH]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

What's in a name?

The label used for these diseases matters because it affects perception by patients, doctors, and the public alike. A cohort of CFS patients were asked to choose their three most preferred terms from a list of commonly used names for FPS. The most endorsed term was "persistent physical symptoms", followed by "complex physical symptoms" and "medically unexplained physical symptoms", reflecting a desire to stress the physical nature of these diseases. Another study surveyed 844 members of the general public on their most preferred clinical term for FPS, and the most commonly selected names were "persistent physical symptoms" (20%), "functional symptoms" (17%), and "medically unexplained symptoms" (15%). Even the name of each individual FPS disease matters. Medical trainees presented with CFS patients and prompted with either CFS, ME, or Florence Nightingale disease attributed different causes and prognoses to the patients depending on which name they were provided in the study. Another similar study on the labeling of CFS showed similar results. Terminology and diagnostic criteria for the condition also affect how people are diagnosed. For example, 2,674 adolescents were evaluated with DSM-III somatization disorder criteria. The prevalence was too low in the 4- to 11-year-old group for a reliable conclusion, but in the 12- to 16-year-old age group, 11% of girls and 4.5% of boys fit the criteria. A later study then used the DSM-IV somatization disorder criteria with a group of 14- to 24-year olds, and found that the prevalence was only 2.7%, but significantly more of the same respondents met criteria for clinically significant FPS, resulting in a prevalence rate of 12.6%. It is clear that the terminology of these diseases, both for the individual diseases and the overarching term for FPS, still need to be clarified and reworked.

### Summary of the national cancer institute 2023 virtual workshop on medical image De-identification-part 1: report of the MIDI task group-best practices and recommendations, tools for conventional approaches to De-identification, international approaches to De-identification, and industry panel on image De-identification [^111LST7Q]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The Flywheel Platform for Intelligent Image Anonymization

The work of Flywheel, a medical imaging data management and collaboration platform that supports getting data from modalities, was presented. De-identification is performed at multiple steps in the pipeline including during capture, curation, data collaboration, and data sharing initiatives. An overview of different applications and use cases was provided, both on-site and in the cloud, at various scales. The relationship to various open-source initiatives was described, including XNAT and various open data archives and data compute libraries. The existing de-identification capabilities of XNAT and Flywheel were referenced. The NCI SBIR Phase II "Intelligent Image Anonymization with XNAT" awarded to Radiologics, now operating under the Flywheel banner, was described. The problems to be addressed include text-based information in file metadata and the image pixels, facial features inherent in neuroimaging, and other features in the images. What has changed over the last 20 years include larger data sets, more available data, NIH data sharing requirements, and more creative computing approaches (e.g. federated learning). A lot of the tools that require manual review were really built for smaller datasets in the tens or maybe hundreds. As we work with data volumes that are larger by orders of magnitude, the automation needs to be substantially more efficient. A matrix illustrating the continuum of risk versus use case, tolerance, procedures, and technical requirements was presented (see Fig. 1). Existing script-based data element level and series-level configurations were shown. Tools for de-identification review at a large scale were discussed. Techniques for handling an enormous number of images were described, including those for well-known attributes (as in the DICOM PS3.15 profile), heuristics (such as, if an attribute has the same value across a large number of patients in a cohort, it is probably not identifying information), OCR and NLP. The latter was exemplified using an iPhone screenshot to extract text from a medical image and Chat GPT to determine whether or not it was identifying information. The challenges of recognizing unusual names were mentioned.

### The different epidemiologic subtypes of Burkitt lymphoma share a homogenous micro RNA profile distinct from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^113JCUNx]. Leukemia (2011). Low credibility.

Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (sBL) can be delineated from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by a very homogeneous mRNA expression signature. However, it remained unclear whether all three BL variants-sBL, endemic BL (eBL) and human immunodeficiency virus-associated BL (HIV-BL)-represent a uniform biological entity despite their differences in geographical occurrence, association with immunodeficiency and/or incidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. To address this issue, we generated micro RNA (miRNA) profiles from 18 eBL, 31 sBL and 15 HIV-BL cases. In addition, we analyzed the miRNA expression of 86 DLBCL to determine whether miRNA profiles recapitulate the molecular differences between BL and DLBCL evidenced by mRNA profiling. A signature of 38 miRNAs containing MYC regulated and nuclear factor-kB pathway-associated miRNAs was obtained that differentiated BL from DLBCL. The miRNA profiles of sBL and eBL displayed only six differentially expressed miRNAs, whereas HIV and EBV infection had no impact on the miRNA profile of BL. In conclusion, miRNA profiling confirms that BL and DLBCL represent distinct lymphoma categories and demonstrates that the three BL variants are representatives of the same biological entity with only marginal miRNA expression differences between eBL and sBL.

### Covarying structural alterations in laterality of the temporal lobe in schizophrenia: a case for source-based laterality [^117CEK4N]. NMR in Biomedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The human brain is asymmetrically lateralized for certain functions (such as language processing) to regions in one hemisphere relative to the other. Asymmetries are measured with a laterality index (LI). However, traditional LI measures are limited by a lack of consensus on metrics used for its calculation. To address this limitation, source-based laterality (SBL) leverages an independent component analysis for the identification of laterality-specific alterations, identifying covarying components between hemispheres across subjects. SBL is successfully implemented with simulated data with inherent differences in laterality. SBL is then compared with a voxel-wise analysis utilizing structural data from a sample of patients with schizophrenia and controls without schizophrenia. SBL group comparisons identified three distinct temporal regions and one cerebellar region with significantly altered laterality in patients with schizophrenia relative to controls. Previous work highlights reductions in laterality (ie, reduced left gray matter volume) in patients with schizophrenia compared with controls without schizophrenia. Results from this pilot SBL project are the first, to our knowledge, to identify covarying laterality differences within discrete temporal brain regions. The authors argue SBL provides a unique focus to detect covarying laterality differences in patients with schizophrenia, facilitating the discovery of laterality aspects undetected in previous work.

### From NAFLD to MAFLD: implications of a premature change in terminology [^114G4NQY]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the substantial gains in our understanding of NAFLD/NASH over the past 2 decades, there has been some dissatisfaction with the terminology "non-alcoholic" which overemphasizes "alcohol" and underemphasizes the root cause of this liver disease, namely, the predisposing metabolic risk factors. As a potential remedy, a name change from NAFLD to metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has been proposed. Although MAFLD reflects the relevant risk factors for this liver disease, this term is still suboptimal, leaving a great deal of ambiguity. Here, we caution that changing the name without understanding its broad implications can have a negative impact on the field. In this context, changing the terminology without new understanding of the molecular basis of the disease entity, new insights in risk stratification or other important aspect of this liver disease, can create unnecessary confusion which could negatively impact the field. At a time when the field is facing substantial challenges around disease awareness as well as clarity of acceptable endpoints for drug development and biomarker discovery, changing the terminology from one suboptimal name to another suboptimal name without full assessment is expected to deepen these challenges. In the context of this debate about terminology, we recommend the creation of a true international consensus group to include all the relevant scientific liver societies (AASLD, EASL, ALEH, APASL), patient advocacy organizations, bio-pharmaceutical industry, regulatory agencies and policy makers. A consensus meeting must assess the impact and consequences of changing the terminology based on the available evidence and make recommendations that will move the field forward. By this approach, a true collaborative international and inclusive consensus can be adopted by all stakeholders dealing with this important global liver disease.

### Consistent definitions of clinical practice guidelines, consensus statements, position statements, and practice alerts [^1156xoPj]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

An evidence-based approach to clinical decision-making for optimizing patient care is desirable because it promotes quality of care, improves patient safety, decreases medical errors, and reduces health care costs. Clinical practice recommendations are systematically developed documents regarding best practice for specific clinical management issues, which can assist care providers in their clinical decision-making. However, there is currently wide variation in the terminology used for such clinical practice recommendations. The aim of this article is to provide guidance to authors, reviewers, and editors on the definitions of terms commonly used for clinical practice recommendations. This is intended to improve transparency and clarity regarding the definitions of these terminologies.

### Developing a simulation-based learning model for acute medical education during COVID-19 pandemic with simulation via instant messaging-birmingham advance (SIMBA) [^113eowKd]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Background

Simulation-based learning (SBL) has been used increasingly within medical education, and its benefits are well-documented in the literature. SBL offers a realistic, immersive and experiential learning environment to develop health professional's knowledge, skills, attitudes and competence while learning in a realistic and safe environment, protecting patients from unnecessary risk.SBL has gained particular prominence and importance during the COVID-19 pandemic when traditional face-to-face teaching activities have been severely limited due to restrictions, such as social distancing requirements. This popularity is likely to continue and increase beyond the COVID-19 pandemic as we observe a paradigm shift in health professions education fuelled by the pandemic.

Simulation via Instant Messaging – Birmingham Advance (SIMBA) is an example of an SBL tool. SIMBA was initially conceptualised in July 2019 as a minimal-cost simulation-based programme delivered through WhatsApp, which has proved highly effective in improving learners' self-reported confidence in managing endocrinology and diabetes cases. It has since branched into other specialties, including gastroenterology, hepatology and paediatrics, with plans to expand further. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented disruptions to health professions education, we expanded SIMBA on an international scale as our response to the disruption to medical education and training in acute medicine. We aim to further develop SIMBA beyond the pandemic to complement existing traditional teaching methods in specialist training programmes.

Acute medicine is a fast-paced, versatile specialty which can be challenging but also reports high levels of job satisfaction. It presents as the gateway to General Internal Medicine, providing immediate and early specialist management of adult patients who present to or from within hospitals as urgencies or emergencies. Although most hospitals have developed their acute medical service in response to local clinical need, common characteristics are identifiable in the specialty across hospitals. As a junior doctor, acute medicine jobs can be highly demanding, requiring a broad skillset in a high-pressure environment. Therefore, the ability to work and make robust decisions efficiently is crucial. Literature reports that SBL tools are effective for teaching and learning in acute medicine to test and improve trainees' knowledge and skills. A survey reported that positive attitudes towards interactive learning tools outnumbered negative views.

### The spectrum of clinical utilities in molecular pathology testing procedures for inherited conditions and cancer: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^111NgQzj]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2016). Medium credibility.

Utility of molecular diagnostics — whole-exome sequencing (WES) in inherited disorders emphasizes that diagnostic yield for WES in this setting is approximately 25% but can be up to 50% depending on clinical presentation and/or availability of family studies, and that US clinical laboratories offer > 100 inherited disorder–specific multigene panels. Recognizing increased use of next-generation sequencing (NGS), the American Medical Association has established genomic sequencing current procedural terminology codes, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association Center for Clinical Effectiveness favorably assessed WES for suspected inherited disorders, defining clinical utility as the attainment of a diagnosis. Whole genome sequencing is currently more expensive than WES, requires greater analysis, and generates more variants of uncertain significance; WES is a plausible approach when a specific gene panel cannot affirm the clinical picture. American College of Medical Genetics guidelines include examining and reporting known pathogenic variants for cardiomyopathy genes even if not related to the patient's phenotype when WES is performed, and detection of such variants provides a preventative medicine opportunity for both the proband and at-risk family members.

### Maintenance of weight loss in patients with body mass index > 60 kg / m2: importance of length of small bowel bypassed [^111EVnZq]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

It is commonly believed that weight loss after biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch is inversely related to the length of the alimentary limb and the common channel. However, the effect of the biliopancreatic limb length (BPL) on weight loss has received little attention.

Methods

A total of 1001 patients after biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch (209 men and 792 women, mean age 42 ± 10 yr, mean body mass index [BMI] 52 ± 9 kg/m(2)) were divided into 2 groups according to the ratio of the BPL to the total small bowel length (SBL): a BPL ≤ 45% of the SBL versus a BPL > 45% of the SBL. The nutritional parameters and percentage of excess weight loss were compared between the 2 groups.

Results

In patients with a BMI of ≤ 60 kg/m(2), the percentage of excess weight loss at 1 year postoperatively was 66.8% for those with a BPL ≤ 45% of the SBL and 69.3% for those with a BPL > 45% of the SBL (P = NS). At 2 years, the corresponding percentages were 73.7% and 79.5% (P = NS) and, at 3 years, were 73.4% and 75.2% (P = NS). In patients with a BMI > 60 kg/m(2), the corresponding percentages of excess weight loss was 56.8% versus 61.4% (P = 0.07) at 1 year, 62.2% versus 77.5% (P = 0.04) at 2 years, and 59.8% versus 77.5% at 3 years (P = 0.05).

Conclusion

The results of our study have shown that amount of weight lost after biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch is directly related to the proportion of small bowel bypassed in patients with a BMI > 60 kg/m(2). Also, the effect increased with the duration of follow-up. In less heavy patients, the BPL/SBL ratio had a minimal effect on long-term weight loss and a more pronounced effect on nutritional parameters.

### Genomic and transcriptomic changes complement each other in the pathogenesis of sporadic Burkitt lymphoma [^115yiM68]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

In the present work, we used up-to-date integrated sequencing analyze to study the mechanisms underlying Burkitt lymphomagenesis. In depth characterization of IG- MYC breakpoint sequences, the MYC mutations, and MYC transcripts allowed us to reassess the mechanisms leading to generation of the IG- MYC translocations and to identify a complex interplay of mutational, regulatory, transcriptional, and possibly post-transcriptional mechanisms leading to enhanced MYC activity. This very much underscores the central role for MYC in BL pathogenesis and how pathogenetic alterations at various levels contribute to the deregulation of MYC activity. We also revealed a series of mechanisms cooperating with MYC in lymphomagenesis, caused by a wide variety of changes, including germline mutations, somatic mutations, and structural aberrations associated with enhancer hijacking and intron retention as well as alternative splicing.

We have shown, that IG- MYC translocations in sBL are generated mostly via aberrant CSR or less frequently by SHM, and that IGHA breakpoints were almost exclusive for BL in our large series of GCB-lymphomas. These findings extend previous targeted studies using Southern blot or PCR-techniques, showing recurrent MYC translocation breakpoints in IGHA in BL and suggesting that the cell of origin of sBL is a germinal center experienced B-cell primed to switch to and, thus, expressing IgA. This conclusion is also supported by the clinical observation that sBL frequently presents in lymphatic tissue of the ileocoecal region, i.e. one of the sites of the human body particularly important for IgA production.

The overlap of affected genes in pediatric sBL on the one hand and in other GCB-lymphomas occurring in children like pediatric DLBCLor pediatric-type FLon the other hand is small (Supplementary Fig. 9). In contrast, there is a considerable overlap with regard to genes affected in eBL despite some differences in mutation frequencies, (Supplementary Fig. 10). Thus, although sharing a development in young children and a derivation from germinal center B-cells, pediatric sBL, DLBCL and FL show highly distinct pathogenesis pathways. On the other hand, pediatric sBL and eBL, although developing in different continents and having distinct key co-factors for their pathogenesis (association with malaria infection of the children and much higher frequency of tumor cell infection with EBV in eBL) show a similar landscape of genetic lesions, and thus a closely related pathogenesis.

### Ontology-driven weak supervision for clinical entity classification in electronic health records [^116UZAQw]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Knowledge bases and ontologies provide a compelling foundation for building weakly supervised entity classifiers. Ontologies codify a vast amount of medical knowledge via taxonomies and example instances for millions of medical concepts. However, repurposing ontologies for weak supervision creates challenges when combining label information from multiple sources without access to ground-truth labels. The hundreds of terminologies found in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurusand other sourcestypify the highly redundant, conflicting, and imperfect entity definitions found across medical ontologies. Naively combining such conflicting label assignments can cause substantial performance drops in weakly supervised classification; therefore, a key challenge is correcting for labeling errors made by individual ontologies when combining label information.

Rule-based systems for NER and cue detection, are common in clinical text processing, where labeled corpora are difficult to share due to privacy concerns. Generating imperfect training labels from indirect sources (e.g. patient notes) is often used in analyzing medical images –. Recent work has explored learning the accuracies of sources to correct for label noise when using rule-based systems to generate training data for text classification. Weakly supervised clinical applications have explored document and relation classification using task-specific rules, or leveraging dependency parsing and compositional grammars to automate relation classification for standardizing clinical concepts. However, these largely focus on relation and document classification via task-specific labeling rules or sourcing supervision from a single ontology and do not explore NER or automating labeling via multiple ontologies.

Prior research on weakly supervised NER has required complex preprocessing to identify possible entity spans, generated labels from a single source rather than combining multiple sources, or relied on ad hoc rule engineering. High-impact application areas, such as clinical NER using weak supervision, are largely unstudied. Recent weak supervision frameworks such as Snorkelare domain- and task-agnostic, introducing barriers to quickly developing and deploying labeling heuristics in complex domains such as medicine. Key questions remain about the extent to which we can automate weak supervision using existing medical ontologies and how much additional task-specific rule engineering is required for state-of-the-art performance. It is also unclear whether, and by how much, pretrained language models such as BioBERTimprove the ability to generalize from weakly labeled data and reduce the need for task-specific labeling rules.

### A scoping review of self-supervised representation learning for clinical decision making using EHR categorical data [^111yk8pF]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We differentiate our work from the narrative review by Wornow et al.by specifically addressing SSRL using unlabeled categorical data from EHRs, regardless of the changing definitions and usages of the term "foundation models" to provide the reader a systematic analysis and comprehensive view of current SOTA in the field. Notably, while we overlap with only 12 of the same papers over a similar time period, we include an additional 34 studies, underscoring the broader scope of our review. We highlight several agreements with their claims and systematically clarify the areas of similarity.

This scoping review is intended for an audience comprising medical professionals, data scientists, and healthcare stakeholders such as decision-makers and hospital IT teams. By synthesizing studies from databases across these fields, we aim to bridge the gap between clinical expertise and advanced data science techniques. Considering the societal and economic impact of leveraging recent research advances in SSRL, our goal is to provide valuable insights that enhance clinical decision-making processes, encourage interdisciplinary collaboration in healthcare informatics, and assist decision-makers in effectively adapting their IT infrastructure and data management strategies.

### 'Golden day' is a myth: rethinking medical timelines and risk in large scale combat operations [^112Jxcuk]. BMJ Military Health (2024). High credibility.

The evolving landscape of battlefield medicine forces medical planners to prepare for large-scale combat operations (LSCO) against peer adversaries, requiring reassessment of recent medical strategies. Despite lacking medical backing, the term 'golden day' has been used by senior military leaders to link the resuscitative benefits of the 'golden hour' to prolonged medical care through similar nomenclature. Pseudomedical terminology can easily enter the lexicon of commanders as attractive soundbites. However, articulating the evidence-based factors influencing mortality on the battlefield is critical to effectively articulate risk to commanders. The challenges of LSCO will be significant with increased casualty numbers and treatment constraints. Realistic medical and operational planning is critical to maximising survival, with a clear understanding of what can and cannot be achieved. Recent improvements in trauma care, such as early haemorrhage control, advanced prehospital care and rapid evacuation to surgical care, have significantly reduced mortality rates. Given the predictability of when casualties die from significant injuries, the absence of timely clinical interventions will increase avoidable battlefield deaths. If evacuation to surgical care is extended to 24 hours, many more casualties will die from potentially survivable injuries. Medical planners must recognise the potential challenges associated with LSCO including contested, delayed evacuation which predicts a tripling of mortality rates from 10% to 30%. Leaders must appreciate the unchanging human physiologic response to injury and historical combat casualty statistics when preparing commanders and politicians for the excess in mortality during LSCO. Without candour, plans will be unrealistic, causing non-medical leaders and the public to be unprepared.

### E2F4 plays a key role in Burkitt lymphoma tumorigenesis [^113vwhFT]. Leukemia (2012). Low credibility.

Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (sBL) is a rapidly growing B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma whose treatment requires highly aggressive therapies that often result severely toxic. Identification of proteins whose expression or function is deregulated in sBL and play a role in its formation could facilitate development of less toxic therapies. We have previously shown that E2F1 expression is deregulated in sBL. We have now investigated the mechanisms underlying E2F1 deregulation and found that the E2F sites in its promoter fail to repress its transcriptional activity in BL cells and that the transcriptional repressor E2F4 barely interacts with these sites. We also have found that E2F4 protein levels, but not those of its mRNA, are reduced in sBL cell lines relative to immortal B-cell lines. E2F4 protein expression is also decreased in 24 of 26 sBL tumor samples from patients compared with control tissues. Our data demonstrate that enforced E2F4 expression in BL cells not only diminishes E2F1 levels, but also reduces selectively the tumorigenic properties and proliferation of BL cells, while increasing their accumulation in G(2)/M. Our results therefore point to E2F4 as a target for developing novel and less toxic treatments for sBL.

### Role of age, sex, and race on cardiac and total mortality associated with super bowl wins and losses [^116nZpCg]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Total and cardiac mortality rates in Los Angeles County, California, increased after the 1980 Super Bowl loss (SBL), but there was an overall reduction in total mortality after the 1984 Super Bowl win (SBW).

Hypothesis

We hypothesized that age, sex, and race may have played a role in the Super Bowl related differences in death rates.

Methods

We compared mortality rates for SB-related days with non-SB control days assessing differences in demographics. We ran regression models predicting daily death rates per 100,000 including SB variable versus non-SB control days for age, sex, race, and interactions for these covariates.

Results

After the SBL, daily death rates increased for both males and females. People aged ≥ 65 years had a larger absolute increase in all cause mortality during the SBL days compared with those aged < 65 years, with significant interaction between age and SBL-variable for all-cause and cardiac-related mortality. Whites and Hispanics had increased death rates on SBL days. There were trends suggesting less death in older patients and females associated with the SBW.

Conclusion

A SBL triggered increased deaths in both men and women and especially in older patients, whereas a SBW reduced death more in those aged ≥ 65 years and in women.

Guideline definitions for key action statements (Table 4) — a strong recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable", with the implication "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)", implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak", with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".

### Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology [^114og1uN]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

ACMG standards and guidelines — clinical report composition emphasizes that clinical reports are the final product of laboratory testing and often are integrated into a patient's electronic health record, that effective reports are concise and easy to understand, that reports should be written in clear language that avoids medical genetics jargon or defines such terms, that the report should contain essential elements including structured results, an interpretation addressing variant(s), appropriate disclaimers, and references used in formulating the classification, and that laboratory reports should follow the College of American Pathologists regulations and laboratory standards for next-generation sequencing clinical tests.

### Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology [^112tVjUK]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

ACMG standards and guidelines — methods and limitations reporting indicate that the methods and types of variants detected by the assay and those refractory to detection should be provided in the report and that limitations of the assay used to detect the variants also should be reported; methods should include those used to obtain nucleic acids and those to analyze the nucleic acids because this may provide the health-care provider with the necessary information to decide whether additional testing is required to follow up on the results; the methodology section should also give the official gene names approved by the Human Genome Organization Gene Nomenclature Committee, RefSeq accession numbers for transcripts, and genome build, including versions; for large panels, gene-level information may be posted and referenced by URL, and the laboratory may choose to add a disclaimer that addresses general pitfalls in laboratory testing such as sample quality and sample mix-up.

### Management of individuals with germline pathogenic / likely pathogenic variants in CHEK2: a clinical practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^116skHnT]. Genetics in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

CHEK2 variant interpretation — classification conflicts and reporting thresholds are outlined as follows: Interpretation of variants in CHEK2 poses challenges not only in determination of pathogenicity but also in terms of penetrance and clinical actionability, and classification terminology uses "Class 5 - pathogenic", "Class 4 - likely pathogenic", "Class 3 - uncertain significance", "Class 2 - likely benign", and "Class 1 - benign". Although most GPVs in CHEK2 in ClinVar are frameshift, nonsense, or splicing variants, a small minority (< 10%) are missense variants; in contrast, the majority (> 60%) with conflicting (pathogenic/likely pathogenic vs variant of uncertain significance (VUS)) or VUS interpretations are missense variants, such as p.(Ile157Thr). Reporting for p.(Ile157Thr) varies across laboratories, including labels such as "Special Interpretation", "moderate risk variant", "pathogenic (low penetrance) variant", or "variant of uncertain significance (VUS)", and most major laboratories agree that the p.(Ile157Thr) variant has reduced penetrance for BC compared with nonmissense CHEK2 GPV, particularly the c.1100del variant. Guidelines from the Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) group set forth a framework in which their recommended framework assumed that only variants with 2-fold or greater risk would be reported because those conferring less than a 2-fold relative risk (RR) are in isolation, likely to be of minimal clinical significance.

### Strength of clinical evidence supporting the United States food and drug administration accelerated approvals from 2015 to 2022 [^114yNjw6]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In theory, there exists a universal notion of the magnitude of effect. However, in practice, a one-size-fits-all metric for quantifying the magnitude of effect across diverse study designs and between dichotomous and continuous outcomes is elusive. Given that the majority (75%) of pre-approval studies in our study were single-arm trials with dichotomous outcomes, we have chosen to report the magnitude of effect specifically for this category of pre-approval studies. We define the magnitude of effect as the response rate — the proportion of patients who reached the criteria of "being considered effective" after treatment, as specified in the original trials.

We also collected information on the basic characteristics of the drug-indication pairs, including drugs class (small molecule or biological product), application type (New Drug Application/Biologic License Application, NDA/BLA or supplemental New Drug Application/Biologic License Application, sNDA/sBLA), novelty (novel or non-novel), therapeutic area (oncology or non-oncology), and orphan status (yes or no) from the product label and review documents. Biological products were defined according to the 21CFR 600.3 (h), while chemical drugs according to Drugs@FDA Glossary of Terms. The FDA-applied application designator was used to identify the application type. The Novel Drug Approvals Reports during 2015–2022 were used to identify the novelty status. Indications were grouped into oncology and non-oncology indications according to the World Health Organization's anatomic therapeutic classification system. The drug's orphan status was identified using the Orphan Products Designation Database.

Quality control

To ensure data completeness and consistency, two investigators (XFZ and WS) independently collected the original data twice and adjudicated inconsistencies. One investigator (XFZ) coded the original data according to pre-defined definitions. Uncertainties were resolved via consultation with the senior investigator (YFW), who randomly selected 10% of the observations to check the correctness of coding. Coded data were entered independently by two investigators (XB and WS), and a professional data manager (FZW) locked the database after data cleaning, and handed it over to the statisticians (SYC) for statistical analysis.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115pDXM6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — terminology and core concepts are defined for clinical use: Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytics include all prescription sleeping medications and most prescription antianxiety medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, Z-medications, and gabapentinoids) while excluding nonbenzodiazepine antianxiety medications such as buspirone and propranolol because they are not associated with significant misuse; sobriety is a state of sustained abstinence with a clear commitment to balanced health across biological, psychological, social, and spiritual domains; spontaneous withdrawal occurs when a physically dependent individual suddenly discontinues or markedly decreases opioid use; stabilization is attainment of a medical and medically stable, steady state with adequate support to prevent deterioration; substance use disorder is diagnosed by a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms with DSM-5 diagnostic criteria; tolerance means increased doses are required to achieve effects previously produced by lower doses; and withdrawal management describes services to assist a patient's withdrawal, emphasizing that the liver detoxifies but clinicians manage withdrawal.

### Consensus statement on effective communication of urgent diagnoses and significant, unexpected diagnoses in surgical pathology and cytopathology from the college of American pathologists and association of directors of anatomic and surgical pathology [^112aG5ip]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Anatomic pathology communication policy rationale and terminology — the comment notes that most institutions impose critical-result time frames "(eg, 30 minutes, 60 minutes)" and that most clinical laboratories communicate designated critical results "within 30 minutes", yet routine specimen processing "requires up to 24 hours, rendering meaningless a 30 or 60 minute window", so intraoperative consultation was excluded. Accordingly, "we propose using the term urgent diagnosis instead of critical diagnosis" and also propose that both terms be used, while distinguishing significant, unexpected diagnoses that "need not be communicated with the same level of urgency". The authors advocate departmental policies for urgent and significant, unexpected diagnoses that are "separate from institutional policies and procedures for critical results", that "each institution should determine its own list of urgent diagnoses", that pathologists "must use their medical judgment" when patient safety may be at risk, and that for significant, unexpected diagnoses, pathologists "should communicate… as soon as is practical" while using judgment on timing.

### An educational assessment of evidence used for variant classification: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^116Xvt5L]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2022). High credibility.

Variant classification criteria use — participants provided comments on criteria; overall, 33% of the participants applied the BS2 criterion due to the 38 homozygotes reported in population databases in 2016/2017. BS2 includes a statement of complete penetrance, but this is not known for all diseases, so a reviewer is considering a large number of unaffected.

### The visually estimated blood volume in scaled canisters based on a simulation study [^111QgmWe]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

For the experimental setup, expired or unusable whole blood donations (provided by the German Red Cross, Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany) were diluted with whole electrolyte solutions (Sterofundin ISO, B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) to generate predetermined volumes (188 ml–1267 ml) with defined hemoglobin (Hb) values (9.5–12.1 g/dl). The use of whole blood donations is a well-established method for the experimental determination of blood loss. The prepared mixture was set as the reference blood loss (RBL). The Hb level was measured by blood gas analysis (Radiometer ABL800 Flex, Radiometer GmbH, Krefeld, Germany) after each step. In order to simulate typical dilution effects by irrigation, ascites or liquid therapy with crystalloids, fully electrolytic solution was added to the RBL. This mixture was defined as sample blood loss volume (SBL) with varying hemoglobin concentrations (4.9–6.2 g/dl) (Fig. 1). Table 1 shows the breakdown of each scenario by RBL, Hb and Hematocrit (Hct) levels, dilution, and total volume in the canister.

Fig. 1
Illustration of the experimental setup and production of the reference blood loss (RBL)

Table 1
Breakdown of the different scenarios

The volumes, hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels of sample preparation are shown. The reference blood loss (RBL) was diluted with electrolyte solution to simulate dilution with rinsing liquids. The resulting sample blood loss volume (SBL) was then filled into the canisters and estimated by the anesthetists

At the blood donation center, the blood donations were treated beforehand routinely with CPD stabilizer solution to prevent blood clotting. The CPD solution consists of citrate buffer, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, glucose and adenine. For this reason, we have not added an additional anticoagulant to the RBL or SBL.

Each canister was prepared with a predefined volume (325 ml–1900 ml) of SBL. A different SBL was used in each scenario. The scenarios were presented in a randomized order to the participants.

### Towards generalist foundation model for radiology by leveraging web-scale 2D&3D medical data [^117WMMqx]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Report generation

Report generation is a crucial and prominent use case for generative medical foundational models. Unlike Medical VQA, this application generally requires the model to emphasize clinically significant observations based on the image. Considering that, current report generation benchmarks are all concentrated on X-ray; in RadBench, we focus more on testing the report generation ability for other imaging modalities. As shown in Table 2, RadFM shows significant improvement over existing models, across various metrics, particularly in relation to medical-specific terminology. For instance, RadFM improves UMLS_Precision from 9.61 to 22.49%, and UMLS_Recall from 3.66 to 12.07% in the zero-shot setting.

Rationale diagnosis

In addition to basic diagnosis, the ability to scrutinize diagnostic prediction outcomes is crucial, particularly in light of the stringent demands for precision and interpretability within medical contexts. Thus, on RadBench, we further evaluate the ability to generate diagnosis rationale sentences for different models. Much like report generation, this task also requires proficiency in generating supplementary paragraphs and a comprehensive understanding on medical knowledge.

As indicated in Table 2, RadFM is the only model that can effectively respond on this task, outperforming other models on BLEU and ROUGE scores by 16.50 and 12.87%, respectively, even comparing with the few-shot case. Moreover, it exhibits significant improvements in UMLS_Precision and UMLS_Recall scores, showcasing advancements of 21.91 and 16.18%, respectively.

### Subchondral bone length in knee osteoarthritis: a deep learning-derived imaging measure and its association with radiographic and clinical outcomes [^1173R9NK]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop a bone shape measure that reflects the extent of cartilage loss and bone flattening in knee osteoarthritis (OA) and test it against estimates of disease severity.

Methods

A fast region-based convolutional neural network was trained to crop the knee joints in sagittal dual-echo steady-state magnetic resonance imaging sequences obtained from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). Publicly available annotations of the cartilage and menisci were used as references to annotate the tibia and the femur in 61 knees. Another deep neural network (U-Net) was developed to learn these annotations. Model predictions were compared to radiologist-driven annotations on an independent test set (27 knees). The U-Net was applied to automatically extract the knee joint structures on the larger OAI data set (n = 9,434 knees). We defined subchondral bone length (SBL), a novel shape measure characterizing the extent of overlying cartilage and bone flattening, and examined its relationship with radiographic joint space narrowing (JSN), concurrent pain and disability (according to the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), as well as subsequent partial or total knee replacement. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for each outcome were estimated using relative changes in SBL from the OAI data set stratified into quartiles.

Results

The mean SBL values for knees with JSN were consistently different from knees without JSN. Greater changes of SBL from baseline were associated with greater pain and disability. For knees with medial or lateral JSN, the ORs for future knee replacement between the lowest and highest quartiles corresponding to SBL changes were 5.68 (95% CI 3.90–8.27) and 7.19 (95% CI 3.71–13.95), respectively.

Conclusion

SBL quantified OA status based on JSN severity and shows promise as an imaging marker in predicting clinical and structural OA outcomes.

### Borderline ovarian tumors: diverse contemporary viewpoints on terminology and diagnostic criteria with illustrative images [^111fZ6fc]. Human Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

The National Cancer Institute sponsored a Borderline Ovarian Tumor Workshop held in August 2003 in Bethesda, MD. This report was developed from discussions at the Workshop. The participants acknowledged several areas of disagreement on basic terminology issues and agreed that a glossary with example images would help clarify many commonly misunderstood issues. This report defines terminology used in the pathological description of borderline tumors and their variants, and illustrates examples of each of the most common entities. It also addresses controversial aspects of the definitions and issues involving specimen handling and reporting. For those issues where there is disagreement, the terminology and diagnostic approaches reflecting the differing views are presented.

### Developing a simulation-based learning model for acute medical education during COVID-19 pandemic with simulation via instant messaging-birmingham advance (SIMBA) [^114reooc]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Problem

The University Hospitals Birmingham acute medical unit (AMU) consists of medical trainees at various levels of training, all considered of equal rank during daily clinical practice. However, it is unknown if they are equally capable of handling similar clinical presentations and scenarios. Previously, acute medical teaching at this institution was mostly confined to the lecture theatre with few interactive learning opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these issues as teaching and training activities have been disrupted and service provision prioritised to combat the peaks in COVID-19 infection. This has resulted in a significant disruption to the continuous educational development of trainee doctors.

Aims

We conducted a study of SIMBA as an innovative SBL tool, with the following objectives based on Kirkpatrick's model for training evaluation:

To develop a minimal-cost virtual simulation tool which uses real-life clinical case scenarios to improve the confidence of trainee doctors when managing common acute medical presentations.
To evaluate the experiences of trainees and changes in self-reported confidence levels following the SIMBA acute medical sessions.
To study the impact of SBL across different grades/levels of training of trainee doctors.

We hypothesise that trainee doctors report increased confidence managing common acute medical presentations after participating in a SIMBA session and that this will be true across different levels of training. In addition, we hypothesise that participating in SIMBA will encourage positive changes to real clinical practice and is a preferable learning approach for trainee doctors over traditional teaching methods.

### Enabling web-scale data integration in biomedicine through linked open data [^1128V1TQ]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Accessibility and availability

As a part of a solution path to one of the main handicaps for further adoption, monitoring frameworks, such as SPARQLESor the Dynamic Linked Data Observatory, are essential to assess the parts of the LSLOD cloud that are still "alive". Preservation efforts, such as the LOD Laundromat project, are also good starting points to crawl and provide archives of existing datasets. There has been recent development on scalable off-the-shelf tools that can alleviate some of burden of the Linked Data publisher. In particular, a combination of (i) RDF graphs uploaded as HDT(Header-Description-Triples), a highly compressed and queryable RDF format, as well as (ii) Triple Pattern Fragments endpointsas the standard access method for LSLOD sources, significantly reduces both infrastructural and maintenance needs. Improving the availability of public SPARQL endpoints is also an area of active research (e.g. research on alternative query strategies for federated queriesand better load balancing between client and server.)

There are two main LSLOD sources that are exemptions related to the Web-based availability and "freshness" of biomedical semantic resources: the Gene Ontology (GO)and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). In our opinion, the success of the Gene Ontology is, in part, due to the following main factors: (1) A dedicated and a very active development team with continuous funding has maintained it over several years; (2) A strong community of domain users from different areas has been actively built around it, and their requirements serve as the main impetus the development process; (3) The ontology itself has an exemplary documentation on its usage in applications targeted to domain users, and on the processes for building and maintaining it; (4) A principled approach was used for developing the ontology; (5) Automated pipelines are used to check and ensure the quality of the ontology. This is also true for UMLS-based semantic resources (e.g. SNOMED CT terminology). Public SPARQL endpoints of DBPediaand Wikidatahave started registering ≈99% uptime, as monitored using the SPARQLES framework. The providers of other LSLOD resources can definitely learn from these projects.

### Understanding systematic reviews and meta-analyses [formula: see text] [^1157FyFS]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews should be distinguished from narrative reviews. In the latter, an editor asks an expert to sum up all of the information that is known about a particular topic. However, the expert is under no constraints regarding what he or she does, or does not, choose to include in the review. As a result, his or her bias can influence the final message. A systematic review, which may or may not be written by experts, typically asks a narrower question, and then answers it using the entirety of the medical literature. The systematic review process includes computer searches to identify the pertinent literature, a statement of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for identified studies, a list of items of interest to extract from each study, a method to assess the quality of each study, a summary of the evidence that has been found (which may or may not involve attempts to combine data), a discussion of the evidence and the limitations of the conclusions, and suggestions for future research efforts. If the data are combined, that process is called meta-analysis. In meta-analysis, an estimate of the reliability of each study is made, and those that appear to be more reliable are weighed more heavily when the data are combined. While systematic reviews depend on a more preplanned method and thus, unlike narrative reviews, contain sections on method, they can be easily read once the reader becomes familiar with the vocabulary.

### Concept-match medical data scrubbing. how pathology text can be used in research [^115V3fMN]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Context

In the normal course of activity, pathologists create and archive immense data sets of scientifically valuable information. Researchers need pathology-based data sets, annotated with clinical information and linked to archived tissues, to discover and validate new diagnostic tests and therapies. Pathology records can be used for research purposes (without obtaining informed patient consent for each use of each record), provided the data are rendered harmless. Large data sets can be made harmless through 3 computational steps: (1) deidentification, the removal or modification of data fields that can be used to identify a patient (name, social security number, etc); (2) rendering the data ambiguous, ensuring that every data record in a public data set has a nonunique set of characterizing data; and (3) data scrubbing, the removal or transformation of words in free text that can be used to identify persons or that contain information that is incriminating or otherwise private. This article addresses the problem of data scrubbing.

Objective

To design and implement a general algorithm that scrubs pathology free text, removing all identifying or private information.

Methods

The Concept-Match algorithm steps through confidential text. When a medical term matching a standard nomenclature term is encountered, the term is replaced by a nomenclature code and a synonym for the original term. When a high-frequency "stop" word, such as a, an, the, or for, is encountered, it is left in place. When any other word is encountered, it is blocked and replaced by asterisks. This produces a scrubbed text. An open-source implementation of the algorithm is freely available.

Results

The Concept-Match scrub method transformed pathology free text into scrubbed output that preserved the sense of the original sentences, while it blocked terms that did not match terms found in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The scrubbed product is safe, in the restricted sense that the output retains only standard medical terms. The software implementation scrubbed more than half a million surgical pathology report phrases in less than an hour.

Conclusions

Computerized scrubbing can render the textual portion of a pathology report harmless for research purposes. Scrubbing and deidentification methods allow pathologists to create and use large pathology databases to conduct medical research.

### Electronic health records and genomics: perspectives from the Association for Molecular Pathology electronic health record (EHR) interoperability for clinical genomics data working group [^114G9tHs]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2022). High credibility.

Electronic health records and genomics — transcript references in variant reporting: Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) c. and p. nomenclature depends on the reference transcript and annotation database, and transcript accession and version numbers (eg, NM_004333.6 for the BRAF gene) should be made available to providers and patients along with the variant(s). In the absence of consensus on which specific transcripts to use for clinical patient care, inclusion of transcript accession and version information is critical to prevent misinterpretation or medical error. An ongoing collaborative initiative, Matched Annotation from National Center for Biotechnology Information and EMBL-EBI (MANE), is aimed at harmonizing transcript definitions, yet the group recognizes the additional need for consensus and notes that comparison of different transcripts may need to be reported. The page additionally states the need for including information about a molecular test's performance characteristics and limits of detection and that the methods used in genomic testing are important to the scope of the types of variants detectable by the assay.

### American association of physicists in medicine task group 263: standardizing nomenclatures in radiation oncology [^1126oAQW]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Standardizations are important for supporting a wide range of data use goals for clinical practice, research, and safety. The primary objective in defining the nomenclature was to reduce variability in naming. Variation is the principle barrier to developing automated solutions for accurate extraction, exchange, and processing of data. Variation in naming occurs over time, between individuals and among institutions and vendors. The second objective for the nomenclature was straightforward adoption into current practice. Discussion of the issues, choices, and compromises involved in arriving at these recommendations can be found in the full version of the TG report.

The guiding principles for nontarget nomenclature are as follows:
All structure names are limited to ≤ 16 characters to ensure compatibility with most vended systems.
All structure names must resolve to unique values, independent of capitalization. This will ensure that systems with case-insensitive formats will not result in overlapping definitions.
Compound structures are identified using the plural (ie, the name ends with an "s" or "i" as appropriate to the root structure name [eg, lungs, kidneys, hippocampi, LNs (for all lymph nodes), Ribs_L]).
The first character of each structure category is capitalized (eg, Femur_Head, Ears_External).
No spaces are used.
An underscore character is used to separate categorizations (eg, Bowel_Bag).
Spatial categorizations for the primary name are always located at the end of the string following an underscore character (eg, Lung_L, Lung_LUL, Lung_RLL, OpticNrv_PRV03_L). L for left R for right A for anterior P for posterior I for inferior S for superior RUL, RLL, RML for right upper, lower, and middle lobe LUL, LLL for left upper and lower lobe NAdj for nonadjacent Dist for distal; Prox for proximal
A consistent root structure name is used for all substructures (eg, SeminalVes and SeminalVes_Dist have a consistent root structure name; SeminalVesicle and SemVes_Dist do not have a consistent root structure name).
Standard category roots are used for structures distributed throughout the body A for artery (eg, A_Aorta, A_Carotid) V for vein (eg, V_Portal, V_Pulmonary) LN for lymph node (eg, LN_Ax_L1, LN_IMN) CN for cranial nerve (eg, CN_IX_L, CN_XII_R) Glnd for glandular structure (eg, Glnd_Submand) Bone (eg, Bone_Hyoid, Bone_Pelvic) Musc for muscle (eg, Musc_Masseter, Musc_Sclmast_L) Spc for space (eg, Spc_Bowel, Spc_Retrophar_L) VB for vertebral body Sinus for sinus (eg, Sinus_Frontal, Sinus_Maxillary)
Planning OAR volumes (PRV) are indicated, with "PRV" following the main structure, separated by an underscore (eg, Brainstem_PRV). Optionally, the uniform expansion used to form the PRV from the main structure in millimeters is indicated with 2 numerals (eg, SpinalCord_PRV05, Brainstem_PRV03), unless the result exceeds the character limit. For example, OpticChiasm_PRV03 is 17 characters and can be truncated to OpticChiasm_PRV3.
Partial structures are designated by appending a tilde (" ⁓ ") character to the root name (eg, Brain ⁓, Lung ⁓ _L). This designator should be used to ensure a contoured structure is not misinterpreted as a whole organ when such a misinterpretation could have clinical implications (typically parallel organs). A use case example for a partial structure would be a CT scan not long enough to include the whole lung, for which "Lungs ⁓ " could be used to designate the contoured pair of lungs.
If a custom qualifier string is to be used, it should be placed at the end after the caret ("^") character (eg, Lungs^Ex).
Establish a primary and a reverse order name for each structure. Primary name–reading left to right, the structure categorization proceeds from general to specific, with laterality on the end. Thus, an alphabetical sort of structure names will result in a list grouped by organ (eg, Kidney_R, Kidney_Cortex_L, Kidney_Hilum_R). The primary name is recommended as the standard choice. Reverse order name–reverse order naming reverses the order of the primary name. Some vended systems allow longer strings but have displays that default to show < 16 characters. The reverse order name increases the likelihood that sufficient information can be displayed to safely identify the correct structure. For example, R_Hilum_Kidney would display as R_Hilum_Ki if the vendor's report only showed the first 10 characters. Reverse order name should be limited to situations in which vendor system constraints prevent safe use of the primary name order.
Camel case (a compound word in which each word starts with a capital letter and no space is present between words such as CamelCase) is only used when a structure name implies 2 concepts but the concepts do not appear as distinct categories in common usage (eg, CaudaEquina instead of Cauda_Equina) because several examples of Cauda_xxxxx do not exist. Camel case names for primary and reverse order names are identical.
Structures that are not used for dose evaluation (eg, optimization structures, high- and low-dose regions) should be prefixed with a "z" or underscore ("_") character such that an alphabetical sort will group them away from structures used for dose evaluation (eg, zPTVopt). The selection of "z" to designate dose evaluation structures is suggested.

### Outcomes of a refractive segmented bifocal intraocular lens with a lower near addition [^114bZb9o]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Segmented refractive bifocal IOLs with an inferior near addition have been successfully used in presbyopic patients undergoing cataract surgery. The first models to enter the market were the IOLs from the Lentis Mplus range, followed by the later release of the Lentis Comfort range (Teleon Surgical B.V. Spankeren, Netherlands; formerly manufactured by Oculentis GmbH, Berlin, Germany). These IOLs are available in near additions of 3.00D, 2.00D, and 1.50D. Despite some issues with the biocompatibility of these IOLs, the optical principle of rotational asymmetry has been well-tolerated in patients, and their advantages and shortcomings have been described in the literature in detail.

Lenstec (Lenstec, Inc. Christ Church, Barbados) is the second manufacturer to introduce an asymmetric segmented bifocal IOL into the market, and their current portfolio consists of the SBL-3 IOL (3.00D near addition) and SBL-2 IOL (2.00D near addition). Although the intraocular lenses of the two manufacturers seem to have a very similar optic design, there are some distinct differences. Intraocular lenses from the Lentis Mplus range have posterior sector-shaped near vision segment, while the SBL IOLs have the near-vision segment in the anterior optic of the IOL. The near vision segment of SBL IOLs extends closer to the periphery of the IOL optic, a feature that can, in theory, result in better near vision and less visual phenomena. The configuration of the near segment of SBL IOLs also seems to be different as the segment covers a larger surface of the IOL and extends closer to the central part of the optic.

### Long-term parenteral nutritional support and intestinal adaptation in children with short bowel syndrome: a 25-year experience [^117CFy3U]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the outcome of children with short bowel syndrome (SBS) who required long-term parenteral nutrition (PN).

Study Design

Retrospective analysis of children (n = 78) with SBS who required PN > 3 months from 1975 to 2000.

Statistics

univariate analysis, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional regression model were used.

Results

We identified 78 patients. Survival was better with small bowel length (SBL) > 38 cm, intact ileocecal valve (ICV), intact colon, takedown surgery after ostomy (all P < .01), and primary anastomosis (P < .001). PN-associated early persistent cholestatic jaundice (P < .001) and SBL of < 15 cm (P < .01) were associated with a higher mortality. Intestinal adaptation was less likely if SBL < 15 cm (P < .05), ICV was removed, colonic resection was done (both P < .001), > 50% of colon was resected (P < .05), and primary anastomosis could not be accomplished (P < .01). Survival was 73% (57), and 77% (44) of survivors had intestinal adaptation.

Conclusions

SBL, intact ICV, intestinal continuity, and preservation of the colon are important factors for survival and adaptation. Adaptation usually occurred within the first 3 years. Need for long-term PN does not preclude achieving productive adulthood. Patients with ICV even with < 15 cm of SBL and patients with SBL > 15 cm without ICV have a chance of intestinal adaptation.

### Refined diagnostic criteria and classification of mast cell leukemia (MCL) and myelomastocytic leukemia (MML): a consensus proposal [^114jR1pM]. Annals of Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Mast cell leukemia (MCL), the leukemic manifestation of systemic mastocytosis (SM), is characterized by leukemic expansion of immature mast cells (MCs) in the bone marrow (BM) and other internal organs; and a poor prognosis. In a subset of patients, circulating MCs are detectable. A major differential diagnosis to MCL is myelomastocytic leukemia (MML). Although criteria for both MCL and MML have been published, several questions remain concerning terminologies and subvariants. To discuss open issues, the EU/US-consensus group and the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM) launched a series of meetings and workshops in 2011–2013. Resulting discussions and outcomes are provided in this article. The group recommends that MML be recognized as a distinct condition defined by mastocytic differentiation in advanced myeloid neoplasms without evidence of SM. The group also proposes that MCL be divided into acute MCL and chronic MCL, based on the presence or absence of C-Findings. In addition, a primary (de novo) form of MCL should be separated from secondary MCL that typically develops in the presence of a known antecedent MC neoplasm, usually aggressive SM (ASM) or MC sarcoma. For MCL, an imminent prephase is also proposed. This prephase represents ASM with rapid progression and 5%-19% MCs in BM smears, which is generally accepted to be of prognostic significance. We recommend that this condition be termed ASM in transformation to MCL (ASM-t). The refined classification of MCL fits within and extends the current WHO classification; and should improve prognostication and patient selection in practice as well as in clinical trials.

### Demystifying the search button: a comprehensive PubMed search strategy for performing an exhaustive literature review [^116TXATz]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Key concept 2: Articles of known relevance

Often, it is helpful to search documents of known relevance to the search topic to assess which MeSH terms have been ascribed to that article. This may be done simply to make sure the users did not miss any terms, which may be helpful to their search, or because the non-MeSH term they searched did not successfully translate into a MeSH term. This is accomplished by clicking on the link located below the article's abstract. This link typically contains a string of names, which vary from article to article. Provided the article has been MEDLINE indexed, one of those names will be "MeSH Terms" (Figure 5). Clicking on this link provides the user with all the possible MeSH terms under which this article may be found. This list may then be searched for other synonymous or relevant MeSH terms that match the concepts being queried. It should be noted that some terms have an asterisk (*) after their names. This is used to signify a term that represents a main topic of the article. All other MeSH terms listed will have been discussion points in the article but were not the main thrust of the article.

### International consensus statement on nomenclature and classification of the congenital bicuspid aortic valve and its aortopathy, for clinical, surgical, interventional and research purposes [^114MTKVg]. European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Bicuspid aortic valve nomenclature/classification — An imaging-based, descriptive, simple-but-comprehensive nomenclature and classification system is presented that is based on the English language and not on numbers or letters and is based on important and available anatomical, clinical, surgical and pathological scientific data, representing the combined efforts of international BAV experts including clinicians, surgeons, interventionalists, pathologists, geneticists and imagers. It emphasizes that the clinician evaluating the patient with BAV must be able to communicate in a common language all specific morphological, functional and prognostic aspects of the condition to patients and multidisciplinary teams.

### Clonality analysis of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement by next-generation sequencing in endemic Burkitt lymphoma suggests antigen drive activation of BCR as opposed to sporadic Burkitt lymphoma [^117G8Kjf]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives: Recent studies using next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis disclosed the importance of the intrinsic activation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway in the pathogenesis of sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (sBL) due to mutations of TCF3/ID3 genes. Since no definitive data are available on the genetic landscape of endemic Burkitt (eBL), we first assessed the mutation frequency of TCF3/ID3 in eBL compared with sBL and subsequently the somatic hypermutation status of the BCR to answer whether an extrinsic activation of BCR signaling could also be demonstrated in Burkitt lymphoma.

Methods: We assessed the mutations of TCF3/ID3 by RNAseq and the BCR status by NGS analysis of the immunoglobulin genes (IGs).

Results: We detected mutations of TCF3/ID3 in about 30% of the eBL cases. This rate is significantly lower than that detected in sBL (64%). The NGS analysis of IGs revealed intraclonal diversity, suggesting an active targeted somatic hypermutation process in eBL compared with sBL.

Conclusions: These findings support the view that the antigenic pressure plays a key role in the pathogenetic pathways of eBL, which may be partially distinct from those driving sBL development.

### Large language models for structured reporting in radiology: past, present, and future [^114cN2GC]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Although there is great potential to apply LLMs for SR, the reviewed studies emphasized several limitations of LLMs tested, including hallucinations, i.e. the creation of entirely fictitious or false information that has no basis in the input provided or in reality, misinterpretation of (medical) information, shortcomings in technical terminology, varying performance depending on the task, and missing information.

Moreover, when looking at the broader literature on LLMs in medicine, several other limitations have been reported. For example, safety issues were identified, with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 incorrectly recommending advanced life support techniques in 13.6% of pediatric emergency cases. Likewise, several studies have noted the provision of outdated medical information. Readability was another challenge, with GPT-3.5's responses on uveitis being significantly above the recommended 6th-grade level for patient education materials. While less frequently reported, biases were also observed, such as biases related to underserved racial groups in cardiovascular disease information. Another increasingly recognized limitation of AI applications is the unexplainable nature of the decision-making process. Specifically, many authors argue that particularly in the medical domain, it is necessary to understand and agree with how an AI system reaches its conclusions in order to use it confidently and ethically in clinical decision-making. However, balancing the high accuracy of complex models with the need for interpretability remains a significant challenge in medical AI applications.

### Clonality analysis of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement by next-generation sequencing in endemic Burkitt lymphoma suggests antigen drive activation of BCR as opposed to sporadic Burkitt lymphoma [^116dHf6f]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Targeting of Somatic Hypermutation

All eBL cases carried IGHV genes of highly mutated status with a germline identity ranging from 79.81% to 97.26% (median, 90.54%); in sBL cases, the mutational variation compared with the germline ranged from 90.88% to 97.42% (median, 94.6%). The eBL specimens demonstrated the presence of somatic mutations in the range of five to 42 mutations. In contrast, in sBL, the range of mutations was from three to 19 (Table 4). Evaluation of the range of somatic mutations disclosed a significant difference between the two subgroups (eBL and sBL) (P < .0001).

Total mutations in eBL cases were 583 (mean, 22 mutations per case), with a significant prevalence of replacement mutations (417/583), which were more than twice that of the silent mutations (166/583) (P < .0001). The total number of mutations in sBL was 100 (mean, nine mutations/case), with a slight prevalence of replacement mutations (82/100) over silent mutations (18/100) (Table 4).

In most of the eBL cases, the majority of mutations occurred in FRs rather than CDRs, leading to a complementary-determining region (CDR)/FR ratio greater than 0.3, which would indicate antigen selection. In addition, significant accumulation of replacement as opposed to silent mutations was found in the CDRs, which form the antigen binding sites.

Our results showed that replacement mutations most often determine substitutions of amino acids with dissimilar/very dissimilar physicochemical properties rather than similar/very similar properties, according to the standardized IMGT amino acid classes (Table 4). Based on these results, it could be suggested that somatic hypermutation in BL induces conformational changes that allow the spatial structure of the antigen binding site to better contact antigens, thus improving affinity.

The pattern of amino acid substitutions was similar in both eBL and sBL, but in sBL, the low number of replacement mutations does not allow any significant conclusion.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^114XTUoM]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People, Version 8 — sexual health counseling on treatment effects — states: "We recommend health care professionals who provide care to transgender and gender diverse people discuss the impact of gender-affirming treatments on sexual function, pleasure, and satisfaction". Health care professionals (HCPs) "should be sufficiently informed about the possible effects on sexual function, pleasure, and satisfaction", and "If the sexuality-related effects of their treatment are unknown, HCPs should inform their patients accordingly". The guidance adds that "HCPs should apply greater importance to the terminology that the TGD person uses for their own body over more traditionally accepted or used medical terminology" and that "When talking about sexual practices, it is advisable to focus on body parts". It also emphasizes that "HCPs providing sexual health care must address sexual pleasure and satisfaction as a key factor within sexual health", noting that "Since clinical data indicate that TGD people score significantly lower in sexual pleasure compared to cisgender individuals, this is even more important".

### Developing a simulation-based learning model for acute medical education during COVID-19 pandemic with simulation via instant messaging-birmingham advance (SIMBA) [^115AnQgu]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Simulation-based learning (SBL) is well-established in medical education and has gained popularity, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person teaching is infeasible. SBL replicates real-life scenarios and provides a fully immersive yet safe learning environment to develop clinical competency. Simulation via Instant Messaging – Birmingham Advance (SIMBA) is an exemplar of SBL, which we previously showed to be effective in endocrinology and diabetes. Previous studies reported the efficacy of SBL in acute medicine. We studied SIMBA as a learning intervention for healthcare professionals interested in acute medicine and defined our aims using the Kirkpatrick model: (i) develop an SBL tool to improve case management; (ii) evaluate experiences and confidence before and after; and (iii) compare efficacy across training levels.

Three sessions were conducted, each representing a PDSA cycle (Plan-Do-Study-Act), consisting of four cases and advertised to healthcare professionals at our hospital and social media. Moderators facilitated progression through 25 min simulations and adopted patient and clinical roles as appropriate. Consultants chaired discussion sessions using relevant guidelines. Presimulation and postsimulation questionnaires evaluated self-reported confidence, feedback and intended changes to clinical practice.

Improvements were observed in self-reported confidence managing simulated cases across all sessions. Of participants, 93.3% found SIMBA applicable to clinical practice, while 89.3% and 88.0% felt SIMBA aided personal and professional development, respectively. Interestingly, 68.0% preferred SIMBA to traditional teaching methods. Following participant feedback, more challenging cases were included, and we extended the time for simulation and discussion. The transcripts were amended to facilitate more participant-moderator interaction representing clinical practice. In addition, we refined participant recruitment over the three sessions. In cycle 1, we advertised incentives: participation counted towards teaching requirements, certificates and feedback. To rectify the reduction in participants in cycle 2, we implemented new advertisement methods in cycle 3, including on-site posters, reminder emails and recruitment of the defence deanery cohort.

### Definitions of the phenotypic manifestations of sickle cell disease [^111nWLVF]. American Journal of Hematology (2010). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a pleiotropic genetic disorder of hemoglobin that has profound multiorgan effects. The low prevalence of SCD (approximately 100,000/US) has limited progress in clinical, basic, and translational research. Lack of a large, readily accessible population for clinical studies has contributed to the absence of standard definitions and diagnostic criteria for the numerous complications of SCD and inadequate understanding of SCD pathophysiology. In 2005, the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers initiated a project to establish consensus definitions of the most frequently occurring complications. A group of clinicians and scientists with extensive expertise in research and treatment of SCD gathered to identify and categorize the most common complications. From this group, a formal writing team was formed that further reviewed the literature, sought specialist input, and produced definitions in a standard format. This article provides an overview of the process and describes 12 body system categories and the most prevalent or severe complications within these categories. A detailed Appendix provides standardized definitions for all complications identified within each system. This report proposes use of these definitions for studies of SCD complications, so future studies can be comparably robust and treatment efficacy measured. Use of these definitions will support greater accuracy in genotype-phenotype studies, thereby achieving a better understanding of SCD pathophysiology. This should nevertheless be viewed as a dynamic rather than final document; phenotype descriptions should be reevaluated and revised periodically to provide the most current standard definitions as etiologic factors are better understood, and new diagnostic options are developed.

### Pathology abbreviated: a long review of short terms [^114RL9F5]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Context

Abbreviations are used frequently in pathology reports and medical records. Efforts to identify and organize free-text concepts must correctly interpret medical abbreviations. During the past decade, the author has collected more than 12 000 medical abbreviations, concentrating on terms used or interpreted by pathologists.

Objective

The purpose of the study is to provide readers with a listing of abbreviations. The listing of abbreviations is reviewed for the purpose of determining the variety of ways that long forms are shortened.

Design

Abbreviations fell into different classes. These classes seemed amenable to distinct algorithmic approaches to their correct expansions. A discussion of these abbreviation classes was included to assist informaticians who are searching for ways to write software that expands abbreviations found in medical text. Classes were separated by the algorithmic approaches that could be used to map abbreviations to their correct expansions. A Perl implementation was developed to automatically match expansions with Unified Medical Language System concepts.

Measurements

The abbreviation list contained 12 097 terms; 5772 abbreviations had unique expansions. There were 6325 polysemous abbreviation/expansion pairs. The expansions of 8599 abbreviations mapped to Unified Medical Language System concepts. Three hundred twenty-four abbreviations could be confused with unabbreviated words. Two hundred thirteen abbreviations had different expansions depending on whether the American or the British spellings were used. Nine hundred seventy abbreviations ended in the letter "s". Results.-There were 6 nonexclusive groups of abbreviations classed by expansion algorithm, as follows: (1) ephemeral; (2) hyponymous; (3) monosemous; (4) polysemous; (5) masqueraders of common words; and (6) fatal (abbreviations whose incorrect expansions could easily result in clinical errors).

Conclusion

Collecting and classifying abbreviations creates a logical approach to the development of class-specific algorithms designed to expand abbreviations. A large listing of medical abbreviations is placed into the public domain. The most current version is available at http://www.pathologyinformatics.org/downloads/abbtwo.htm.

### Deep reinforcement learning with automated label extraction from clinical reports accurately classifies 3D MRI brain volumes [^113QasNf]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Image classification is probably the most fundamental task in radiology artificial intelligence. To reduce the burden of acquiring and labeling data sets, we employed a two-pronged strategy. We automatically extracted labels from radiology reports in Part 1. In Part 2, we used the labels to train a data-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) classifier. We applied the approach to a small set of patient images and radiology reports from our institution. For Part 1, we trained sentence-BERT (SBERT) on 90 radiology reports. In Part 2, we used the labels from the trained SBERT to train an RL-based classifier. We trained the classifier on a training set of [Formula: see text] images. We tested on a separate collection of [Formula: see text] images. For comparison, we also trained and tested a supervised deep learning (SDL) classification network on the same set of training and testing images using the same labels. Part 1: The trained SBERT model improved from 82 to [Formula: see text] accuracy. Part 2: Using Part 1's computed labels, SDL quickly overfitted the small training set. Whereas SDL showed the worst possible testing set accuracy of 50%, RL achieved [Formula: see text] testing set accuracy, with a [Formula: see text]-value of [Formula: see text]. We have shown the proof-of-principle application of automated label extraction from radiological reports. Additionally, we have built on prior work applying RL to classification using these labels, extending from 2D slices to entire 3D image volumes. RL has again demonstrated a remarkable ability to train effectively, in a generalized manner, and based on small training sets.

### Developing an international standard for the classification of surface anatomic location for use in clinical practice and epidemiologic research [^113yDhcy]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There is currently no universally adopted terminology for defining human surface anatomic location. The lack of precision, accuracy, and reliability of terms used by health care providers, in particular dermatologic surgeons, is unsatisfactory both for epidemiologic research and for high-quality patient care.

Objective

We sought to create a clinically relevant yet concise surface anatomy terminology for international use including the International Classification of Diseases and to map it to existing disparate terminologies.

Methods

Widely used surface anatomy terminology data sets and diagrams were reviewed. A Delphi consensus convened to create a novel surface anatomy terminology. The new terminology was hierarchically mapped to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine terms and New York University numbers and physically mapped to 2-dimensional anatomic diagrams for clarity and reproducibility.

Results

The final terminology data set contains 519 discrete terms arranged in a 9-level hierarchy and has been adopted by the World Health Organization for the International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision.

Limitations

Specification of most locations requires linking to laterality qualifiers. Fine granularity for larger sites may require the use of additional qualifiers.

Conclusion

Consistent use of precise and accurate surface anatomy terms is crucial to the practice of dermatology, particularly procedural dermatology. The proposed terminology is designed to form the basis for evolution of a universally adoptable terminology set to improve patient care, interprovider communication, and epidemiologic tracking.

### Structural basis of metallo-β-lactamase, serine-β-lactamase and penicillin-binding protein inhibition by cyclic boronates [^116eAtov]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

SBLs and the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) targets of the β-lactams are evolutionarily and mechanistically related; as a consequence, several β-lactam classes, for example, carbapenems, can inhibit both SBLs and PBPs. MBLs, however, are mechanistically and structurally distinct, and constitute a heterogeneous group. The requirement for clinically useful inhibition of a broad spectrum of clinically relevant MBL subfamilies (NDM, IMP, VIM, SPM), which differ in the loops surrounding their active site, makes them challenging medicinal chemistry targets.

Since many bacteria have acquired both SBL- and MBL-mediated resistance, we are interested in identifying dual action MBL/SBL inhibitors. Very few potent inhibitors (IC 50 < 1 μM) targeting SBLs, MBLs and/or PBPs have been developed. Since transient oxyanionic species (for example the 'tetrahedral intermediate' of SBLs) produced by nucleophilic attack onto the β-lactam carbonyl are likely common to SBL- and MBL-catalysed β-lactam hydrolysis, we reasoned analogues of this intermediate may provide the desired dual action-BL activity. While such 'tetrahedral intermediate' analogues are well-characterized for nucleophilic enzymes, including PBPs and SBLs, they have not been widely described for metallo-hydrolases. The observation of MBL inhibition by trifluoromethyl ketonesis evidence that mimicking a tetrahedral intermediate may also be useful for the inhibition of MBLs. Since acyclic boronic acids, are established as SBL/PBP inhibitors(the SBL inhibitor, RPX7009 (ref.), is in clinical trials), we screened various boronic acids, including some reported to be SBL/PBP inhibitors, for inhibition of the NDM-1 MBL. Interestingly, cyclic boronates, but not the acyclic boronic acids, manifested potent MBL inhibition. We therefore synthesized and tested additional boronic acids, including compounds (2, 4 and 5) described in the patent literature as β-lactamase inhibitorsand novel derivatives 1 and 3 (designed using modeling).

We demonstrate through biochemical, biophysical and cellular evidence that cyclic boronates are potent inhibitors of both SBLs and MBLs. Interestingly, we also found that the cyclic boronates inhibit the PBP targets of the BLAs. High-resolution crystallographic analyses reveal the proposed mechanism of action. The cyclic boronates act as 'transition state analogues' for both 'serine' and 'metallo' enzymes and therefore represent a promising strategy for combating antibiotic resistance.

### PACES / HRS expert consensus statement on the use of catheter ablation in children and patients with congenital heart disease: developed in partnership with the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES) and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS). Endorsed by the governing bodies of PACES, HRS, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the association for European pediatric and congenital cardiology (AEPC) [^111JjfYQ]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Definitions and medical therapy prerequisites — pediatric supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) terminology and pre-ablation medical therapy expectations are specified as follows: intolerability of a beta-blocker alone might be adequate in larger patients but not in smaller patients, and in the smallest patients failure or intolerability of combinations from multiple drug classes would be required prior to ablation. Recurrent is defined as arrhythmias that have more than one symptomatic or significant paroxysm of tachycardia; persistent is defined as arrhythmias present continuously (incessant), incessantly intermittent, or incessantly non-sustained; and "usual complex" refers to a QRS in tachycardia identical to sinus rhythm regardless of QRS duration or morphology.

### A student-led introduction to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender health for first-year medical students [^1114vExM]. Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals face significant health disparities. This is in part because many physicians are not sensitive to, and/or are underprepared to address, LGBT-specific concerns. To help meet this need, we, a group of second- and fourth-year medical students with faculty oversight, organized a session on LGBT health for first-year medical students.

Methods

The three second-year and one fourth-year student authors designed a mandatory session for the 167 first-years at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, OH. The 2-hour session consisted of a student-delivered presentation, a patient panel, and a small-group session. Students' LGBT health knowledge and confidence in providing care were assessed anonymously before and after the session, and individuals' pre- and post-session assessments were paired using student-generated identifiers.

Results

A total of 73 complete, matched pre-/post-session assessments were received. Students' familiarity with LGBT terminology and demographics increased significantly after the session. Students' perceived preparedness and comfort in providing LGBT-specific care significantly improved in most areas as well. Students strongly praised the session, in particular the patient panel.

Conclusion

A student-led educational session on LGBT health can effectively improve first-year medical students' LGBT knowledge and confidence to provide care.

### Type 1 Brugada pattern ECG due to supra-therapeutic phenytoin level [^112DdSdF]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Brugada syndrome:

- **Definition**: BS is a genetic disorder characterized by a specific pattern on ECG and an increased risk of SCD due to ventricular arrhythmia.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of BS involves dysfunction of the cardiac sodium channels. Mutations in the SCN5A gene, which encodes the predominant cardiac sodium channel alpha subunit NaV1.5, have been identified in some patients with BS.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of BS in Japan is estimated at 14.2 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for BS include a family history of the syndrome and the presence of specific genetic mutations. The SCN5A gene is the most frequently mutated gene in BS.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of BS can vary, but common symptoms include recurrent syncope, VF, and SCD. Some patients may remain asymptomatic, while others may experience symptoms such as unheralded syncope and nocturnal agonal respiration.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of BS is variable and depends on several factors. Patients who have experienced aborted SCD or syncope have a higher risk of future cardiac events, with annual event rates of 7.7% and 1.9%, respectively.

### 38th international symposium on intensive care and emergency medicine: brussels, belgium. 20–23 March 2018 [^114dYRgF]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

1 Université de Liège, Liège, Belgium; 2 Université Laval, Québec, Canada; 3 Cégep de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Canada

Introduction: This randomized controlled study assessed the impact of a 3-hour intravenous medication safety simulation-based learning (SBL) on self-efficacy, stress, knowledge and skills of nursing students. Medication administration error is a worldwide concern [1], that has been linked with a lack of knowledge and skills in safe medication administration among new graduate and student nurses [2–4]. Preventing medication errors could therefore involve training through simulation.

Methods: Participants (n = 99) were randomly assigned either to the control group (CG, n = 50) or the experimental group (EG, n = 49). While CG and EG both had a traditional clinical internship, EG beneficiated in addition the 3-hour SBL, using standardized patients in the context of an intensive care unit. The two groups were assessed twice: at T0 and T1 (four weeks later), through an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) and questionnaires. Two blinded experts rated the students OSCE with an evaluation grid.

Results: Mean participants age was 21,2. There were no statistically differences between groups at T0. Compared to the CG (0%), the EG increased its self-efficacy (+19.35%) with a significantly difference (p < 0.001) at T1. The SBL conducted to a greater increase of knowledge and skills in the EG (respectively +150%, +128%) than in the CG (respectively +46% and +47%), with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions: Results reinforce the interest of a short SBL using standardized patients to improve medication administration. Clinical impact of these observations requires further evaluation to determine potential transfer in clinical settings and retention over time.

The Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process within the YCDL framework.

In the clinical data extraction stage, we developed an ETL process, which includes Natural Language Processing (NLP), for each feature. The DSC DB serves as a reservoir containing raw medical text, (semi-) unstructured data, imaging files, next-generation sequencing (NGS) results, and Extensible Markup Language (XML) formats. In the initial phase of data processing, we tailored the database corpus from the DSC DB, optimizing the extraction and management of medical terminology, abbreviations, and recurrent misspellings (e.g. within pathology reports). Subsequently, the procured data underwent transformation through a specialized ETL algorithm designed to harmonize terminology based on assertions and the interrelationships of medical concepts. NLP was instrumental in utilizing CT and MRI interpretation counts from follow-up visits as criteria for individual selection.

In the initial phase of data processing, we tailored the database corpus from the DSC DB, optimizing the extraction and management of medical terminology, abbreviations, and recurrent misspellings (e.g. within pathology reports). Subsequently, the procured data underwent transformation through a specialized ETL algorithm designed to harmonize terminology based on assertions and the interrelationships of medical concepts. To enhance user convenience in handling extensive cancer patient data, we developed a model based on imaging reports to determine the best responses and the timing of disease progression. Imaging reports from 6574 patients were gathered, amounting to 97,119 CT readings. Among these, 9000 CT reports corresponding to 2859 patients were randomly subjected to multilabel manual labeling by four radiology experts, based on the RECIST version 1.1 classification (CR/NED, PR, SD, PD). The pretrained BERT-base-uncased model was employed and fine-tuned for the downstream tasks of multilabel classification. 6765 reports were used for training, while the remaining 1000 reports were divided equally between the validation and test sets. The subsequent preprocessing phase employed tokenization techniques to structure the extracted data. SQL queries were harnessed to mine data from the primary DSC DB, facilitated by a DML management interface. For certain datasets requiring intricate extraction protocols, bespoke ETL strategies were devised using Python scripts crafted for each specific operation (Supplementary Fig. 10).

### Tiagabine hydrochloride [^113aCSD1]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials: Tiagabine HCl has been administered to 2531 patients during all phase 2/3 clinical trials, only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 2531 patients exposed to tiagabine HCl who experienced events of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving tiagabine HCl. All reported events are included except those already listed above, events seen only three times or fewer (unless potentially important), events very unlikely to be drug-related, and those too general to be informative. Events are included without regard to determination of a causal relationship to tiagabine.

Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

### LINS: a general medical Q&A framework for enhancing the quality and credibility of LLM-generated responses [^115tF9RF]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

From the patient evaluation results, an average of 87.72% of the 116 medical terms extracted by the Medical Terminology Extraction Agent (MTEA) from medical orders aligned with patient expectations (Fig. 4b), demonstrating that the majority of terms extracted were accurate and met patient needs. For medical terminology explanation, all five lay users reported that 99.14% of LINS-o1-preview's explanations were helpful, while o1-preview achieved a helpfulness score of 87.93% (Fig. 4c). Moreover, 94.66% of the evidence provided by LINS-o1-preview was valid, in stark contrast to 25.00% for o1-preview (Fig. 4c). In the credibility scoring (more reliable: no change: less reliable), patients rated LINS-o1-preview at 471: 105: 4, significantly outperforming o1-preview, which received a score of 94: 478: 8 (Fig. 4e left). Similarly, for the clinical Q&A task, LINS-o1-preview achieved scores of 90.09% for helpfulness, 71.21% for evidence validity, and a credibility rating of 313: 220: 2. In contrast, o1-preview scored 87.86% for helpfulness, 14.02% for evidence validity, and a credibility rating of 62: 459: 14 (Fig. 4d, e right). These findings suggest that clinical Q&A for medical order are more challenging than terminology explanation. Nonetheless, LINS-o1-preview outperformed o1-preview in both tasks, with a particularly significant advantage in credibility. By analyzing the correlation coefficients between evidence validity and credibility in both the term explanation task and the clinical Q&A task, we found that the Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.78 and 0.83, respectively. This result further supports our finding that evidence validity plays a critical role in the credibility of LLM-generated medical responses.

### New evaluation and management code level selection trends in hip and knee osteoarthritis patients [^1136fjUH]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

On January 1, 2021, the American Medical Association implemented changes regarding the outpatient Evaluation and Management (E/M) criteria dictating Current Procedural Terminology code level selection to help diminish administrative burden and emphasize medical decision-making as the primary determinant in E/M level of service (EML). The goal of this study was to describe EML coding trends in outpatient visits for hip and knee osteoarthritis after the 2021 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services changes to the E/M system.

Methods

All outpatient visits for primary hip and knee osteoarthritis within the divisions of Joint Replacement, Operative Sports Medicine, and Nonoperative Sports Medicine at a single orthopaedic practice were retrospectively analyzed during 2 separate 10-month timeframes in 2019 and 2021. The primary endpoint was the visit EML (1 through 5) based on Current Procedural Terminology E/M codes.

Results

In 2019, 7.8% of all visits were billed as level 2, 85.8% of all visits were billed as level 3, and 6.3% of all visits were billed as level 4. In 2021, 2.8% of visits were billed as level 2, 54% of visits were billed as level 3, and 41.3% of visits were billed as level 4. Level 1 and Level 5 visits did not exceed 2% in either year. Across all 3 divisions, level 2 and 3 visits decreased significantly (P < .05), while level 4 visits increased significantly (P < .05).

Conclusion

Since the E/M coding criteria overhaul in 2021, there has been a significant trend towards higher level of service code selection across multiple divisions in our orthopaedic practice.

### Getting started with search filters in primary care literature reviews [^111BpQWa]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary care researchers and clinicians are facing an ever-growing evidence base, more options to access research evidence, and increasingly limited time. Incorporating search filters into primary care systematic reviews can significantly improve the efficiency and confidence of the search process. Search filters, or hedges, are predeveloped search strategies that combine controlled vocabulary and free text terms using Boolean operators (words like "AND", "OR"). Search filters help to manage the diverse terminology in the literature, such as the various synonyms for primary care, and can be tailored to the specific needs of the review, whether it aims to be exhaustive or more focussed. Resources such as specialized librarians, databases such as PubMed, and repositories such as the InterTASC Information Specialists Sub-Group provide access to these valuable tools. However, as primary care terminology continues to evolve, regular updates to these filters are necessary to maintain their relevance and effectiveness. This method brief presents search filters and highlights their value for finding research literature in primary care.

### SBL-3 multifocal intraocular lens-P200020… [^115iy1Kj]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

What is it. The SBL-3 Multifocal Intraocular Lens is an artificial lens permanently implanted inside the eye. The lens is intended to provide vision correction after the eye's natural lens is removed because it has become cloudy. How does it work. The SBL-3 Multifocal IOL is intended to bend light rays to allow them to focus on the back surface of the eye. The SBL-3 lens is a multifocal intraocular lens with two zones that focus light — one from objects far away, and the other from objects close up. When is it used. The SBL-3 Multifocal IOL is used in adults who have cataracts, need eye surgery, and only have a small amount of abnormal curve to the cornea. What will it accomplish. The SBL-3 intraocular lens is used to replace the natural crystalline lens after that lens is removed due to cataracts. It improves near vision, which is important for tasks that require close up focus.

The safety and effectiveness of the SBL-3 intraocular lens was studied in a randomized, controlled clinical trial. In that study, 495 patients had at least one working eye implanted with an intraocular lens, either a conventional monofocal IOL or the SBL-3 Multifocal IOL. At 6 and 12 months after surgery, the SBL-3 lens was found to provide improved near visual acuity and also provided comparable intermediate and distance visual acuity. Based on a patient questionnaire given at 6 and 12 months after surgery, the SBL-3 recipients also reported less use of near vision correction glasses or contact lenses than people who received the monofocal lens. When should it not be used.

The SBL-3 Multifocal Intraocular Lens should not be used in patients who:

- Are not candidates for eye surgery
- **Have any of the following**:

- Glaucoma
- Microphthalmia
- Chronic severe uveitis
- Retinal detachment
- Corneal decompensation
- Diabetic retinopathy
- Iris atrophy
- A risk of complications during or after surgery
- Another condition identified by an ophthalmic surgeon based on their experience.
