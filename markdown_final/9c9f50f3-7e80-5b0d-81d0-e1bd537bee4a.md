## Question

patient has a systolic blood pressure of 290 what is this called

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to call a systolic blood pressure of 290 mmHg. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how contemporary guidelines classify blood pressure and whether any category reaches 290 mmHg. Then, I should verify the emergency medicine terminology for severely elevated blood pressure and whether 290 mmHg fits. Next, I will distinguish hypertensive urgency from hypertensive emergency and confirm the clinical implications. Finally, I will synthesize the most accurate terminology and note any measurement caveats that could affect classification.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework. Modern guidelines categorize hypertension into stages, with ACC/AHA 2025 and ESH 2023 defining stage 2 hypertension as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, and ESH 2023 further describing grade 3 hypertension as systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mmHg; none of these schemes include a category for 290 mmHg, which sits far beyond grade 3 or stage 2, underscoring that 290 mmHg is an extreme, life-threatening elevation rather than a routine stage label [^a54b6737] [^44cb8181].

> Wait, let me verify the emergency terminology. In emergency medicine and critical care, severe asymptomatic hypertension is typically defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mmHg in the absence of acute target-organ injury, and the term "hypertensive urgency" has historically been used for this scenario; however, more recent guidance has moved away from "urgency" and toward "severe hypertension" to reflect the lack of benefit from rapid BP reduction without injury, while still acknowledging the high risk and need for prompt, controlled management [^2ae3a846] [^6bfa708a] [^984425ac].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does 290 mmHg imply a hypertensive emergency by default? I should confirm the definition. A hypertensive emergency is a marked elevation in blood pressure accompanied by acute target-organ damage such as encephalopathy, acute heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, or acute kidney injury; the presence of organ damage, not the absolute number alone, determines the emergency designation, so 290 mmHg is not automatically an emergency without evidence of end-organ injury, though it carries an extremely high risk of such complications and mandates urgent evaluation and cautious, controlled lowering if severe asymptomatic hypertension is confirmed [^6958f478] [^2ae3a846].

> I need to ensure the terminology I choose is precise. Given that 290 mmHg exceeds the thresholds used to define severe hypertension and lies in a range where the risk of acute complications rises steeply, the most accurate general term is severe hypertension; if there is no acute target-organ damage, this aligns with severe asymptomatic hypertension, whereas if there is concurrent organ injury, it becomes a hypertensive emergency, which is a different clinical entity requiring ICU-level care and parenteral therapy rather than oral agents [^2ae3a846] [^6958f478].

> But wait, what if the reading is spurious? I should double-check measurement technique because cuff size errors, improper positioning, or single-occasion readings can grossly overestimate blood pressure; guidelines emphasize repeating measurements with validated devices and confirming with out-of-office readings when feasible, so before labeling 290 mmHg as true severe hypertension, I would repeat the measurement under proper conditions and, if possible, obtain ambulatory or home readings to verify persistence and magnitude of elevation [^20cb01b2] [^04f6c16b].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. A systolic blood pressure of 290 mmHg is called severe hypertension; if there is no acute target-organ damage, it is severe asymptomatic hypertension, and if there is acute organ injury, it is a hypertensive emergency. This degree of elevation is far beyond routine staging and constitutes a medical crisis that requires urgent, controlled evaluation and treatment rather than any routine outpatient approach [^2ae3a846] [^6958f478].

---

A systolic blood pressure of 290 mmHg is termed **severe hypertension** or **hypertensive crisis** [^984425ac]. This level is far beyond stage 2 hypertension (≥ 140 mmHg) [^a54b6737] and carries an **immediate risk of acute organ damage** (brain, heart, kidneys, eyes) [^6958f478]. It requires **urgent medical evaluation** and controlled blood pressure lowering to prevent catastrophic complications; rapid or excessive BP reduction can cause harm, so management must be cautious and supervised [^2ae3a846].

---

## Clinical terminology and classification

Current guidelines classify blood pressure into categories; **stage 2 hypertension** is defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg [^a54b6737]. A systolic blood pressure of 290 mmHg is **far beyond stage 2** and is considered severe hypertension or hypertensive crisis [^984425ac].

---

## Clinical significance and risks

A systolic blood pressure of 290 mmHg is **critically elevated** and poses an immediate risk of acute organ damage, including:

- **Neurological**: hypertensive encephalopathy, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke [^6958f478].
- **Cardiovascular**: acute coronary syndrome, acute heart failure, aortic dissection [^6958f478].
- **Renal**: acute kidney injury, renal failure [^6958f478].
- **Ophthalmological**: hypertensive retinopathy, vision loss [^6958f478].

---

## Immediate medical management

Patients with a systolic blood pressure of 290 mmHg require **urgent medical evaluation and management**. The goal is to **reduce blood pressure gradually** to prevent acute organ damage while avoiding rapid or excessive reduction that could cause cerebral or coronary hypoperfusion [^2ae3a846]. Management typically includes:

- **Monitoring**: continuous blood pressure monitoring and frequent clinical assessments [^6958f478].
- **Pharmacological therapy**: intravenous antihypertensive agents such as labetalol, nicardipine, or sodium nitroprusside may be used in monitored settings [^6958f478].
- **Oral therapy**: once stabilized, transition to oral antihypertensive medications with close follow-up [^2ae3a846].

---

## Prognosis and long-term implications

The prognosis for patients with a systolic blood pressure of 290 mmHg depends on the **promptness and effectiveness of medical intervention**. Without treatment, the risk of **mortality and permanent organ damage** is high. With appropriate management, prognosis can improve, but long-term complications may persist depending on the extent of organ damage sustained during the hypertensive crisis [^6958f478].

---

A systolic blood pressure of 290 mmHg is termed **severe hypertension** or **hypertensive crisis** [^984425ac]. It is a medical emergency requiring immediate evaluation and controlled blood pressure lowering to prevent acute organ damage and reduce mortality risk [^6958f478].

Key Points

Question

What are the safe and optimal diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranges among adults with treated systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 130 mm Hg?

Findings

In this cohort study of 7515 patients from 2 randomized clinical trials who had treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg, a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg was associated with increased cardiovascular risk and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg was associated with lower cardiovascular risk.

Meaning

The findings suggest that a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg may be harmful and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg is an optimal target for patients with treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg; this topic merits further study.

Definition — Asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure: JNC 7 classified stage 2 hypertension as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg, although many clinical studies use thresholds of systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg. This policy considers markedly elevated blood pressure to be consistent with the JNC 7 definition of stage 2 hypertension, and the term asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure is used where asymptomatic hypertension had previously been used in the published literature.

BP Classification

The most obvious difference between the 2 guidelines is their approach to BP classification and the BP cut points recommended for the identification of hypertension (Table 4). The ACC/AHA proposes categories for normal BP, elevated BP, and 2 stages of hypertension, with a cut point of systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 130 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 80 mm Hg for identification of hypertension. This is a change from the preceding 2003 Joint National Committee 7 CPG, which recommended use of an SBP and/or DBP cut point of 140 and/or 90 mm Hg, except in adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), where an SBP and/or DBP cut point of 130 and/or 80 mm Hg was recommended. The ESC/ESH classifies BP into optimal BP, normal BP, high normal BP, 3 grades of systolic/diastolic hypertension, and isolated systolic hypertension. It retains the same SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg cut points for diagnosis of hypertension recommended in the preceding 2013 ESH/ESC hypertension CPG.

Table 4
Blood Pressure Classification

The potential US population impact of the ACC/AHA guideline was estimated by an analysis of the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In this analysis, 24.1% of US adults ≥ 20 years of age reported that they were taking antihypertensive medication and were therefore considered to have hypertension. Of those not taking antihypertensive medication, 7.7% had an SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, and 13.7% had an SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg or DBP 80 to 89 mm Hg, yielding a 46% prevalence of hypertension for adults using the SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg cut points, or taking antihypertensive medication definition of hypertension compared with a prevalence of 32% using the SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or taking antihypertensive medication definition. Prevalence estimates using the 2 definitions of hypertension were more discrepant at younger age than at older age, and in men compared with women. Taken altogether, the ACC/AHA reclassification of BP resulted in an estimated population increase in hypertension prevalence of ≈14%. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey analyses, however, are likely to overestimate hypertension prevalence because participant BP was only measured on a single occasion and presumed hypertension was not confirmed by out-of-office BP readings.

Overall, the ACC/AHA categorization is simpler and captures more of the BP-related risk for CVD. However, it results in a larger challenge for health care professionals compared with the ESC/ESH or preceding Joint National Committee 7 Report because (1) it designates hypertension in a higher percentage of adults and (2) there is need to assess underlying atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk for treatment decisions, especially in adults with ACC/AHA stage 1 hypertension (outlined in the CVD risk assessment section). The ESC/ESH classification system has more BP categories but provides a simpler approach to decisions for the administration of antihypertensive drug therapy, unchanged from the previous European guideline recommendations.

### Debate on the 2025 guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: new blood pressure targets, lower is better-and possible [^f242ff75]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines has now released the long-awaited 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults. Since the previous version, which had been in place for 8 years, meta-analyses and several treat-to-target trials investigating lower versus standard blood pressure targets have been published. Based on these, the 2025 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommends in adults with confirmed hypertension, an office blood pressure goal of < 130/80 mmHg, with encouragement to further reduce systolic blood pressure to < 120 mmHg. Here, we set out why we support these lower blood pressure targets and outline strategies to achieve them.

### Hypertension management in 2002: where have we been? where might we be going? [^3f5e5e9c]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

The term "blood pressure" was coined almost 300 years ago by the man who first measured it, the Reverend Stephen Hales of England. However, our understanding of the pathogenesis and consequences of hypertension, as well as the available treatments for it, have remained greatly limited and inadequate until only the past 30 years. Starting in 1977, reports from the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC) have provided regular updates on developments in hypertension management, and have set guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. More than 20 years ago, the JNC stratified blood pressure (BP) levels into categories of mild, moderate, and severe (later renamed stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively). A stepped-care approach to hypertension therapy was originally recommended. With each revised JNC report, there was a reduction in target BP and a growing recognition of the importance of high-normal BP and isolated systolic hypertension. The sixth and most current report of the Joint National Committee, JNC VI, emphasizes treatment of comorbidities of hypertension, sets a lower BP goal (< 130/85 mm Hg) for high-risk patients-eg, those with diabetes or renal disease-than for those with uncomplicated hypertension (< 140/90 mm Hg), and places a greater emphasis on disease prevention. For the future, the current trend toward lower BP goals suggests that more effective and better tolerated antihypertensive therapies will be needed. Multiple antihypertensive agents used concomitantly will likely be needed to control elevated levels of BP in the majority of hypertensive patients.

### New high blood pressure guidelines: back on track with lower treatment goals, but implementation challenges abound [^ab13c7c8]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The recently released 2017 High Blood Pressure Guidelines depart from past guidelines in both their approach and recommendations. Developed by multiple health organizations, including the American College of Preventive Medicine, the guidelines continue to define normal blood pressure as < 120/80 mmHg, but now define hypertension as ≥ 130/80 mmHg (previously ≥ 140/90 mmHg). This change categorizes 101 million Americans (46% of adults) as hypertensive (compared to 32% previously). The guidelines rely heavily on findings from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). This clinical trial demonstrated substantial reductions in key adverse outcomes from intensive blood pressure management (goal systolic blood pressure < 120 mmHg) compared to standard treatment (< 140 mmHg). The guidelines emphasize non-drug strategies for blood pressure management, particularly healthy diet, several forms of physical activity, reduction in sodium intake, enhancement of potassium intake, reduction in alcohol use, and weight loss. A risk-based approach is recommended for drug therapy. Individuals with an elevated 10-year risk of future cardiovascular disease events should receive drug therapies for blood pressures ≥ 130/80 mmHg, whereas those at lower risk should receive antihypertensive medications for blood pressures ≥ 140/90 mmHg. Given that high blood pressure is poorly managed even with easier-to-reach goals, effective implementation of the guidelines will present significant challenges. The guidelines suggest that successful implementation requires the adoption of new models of chronic disease care, including team-based care, telehealth, a shift towards self-management, better approaches to patient adherence, and use of home blood pressure monitoring. Attention to systems level issues is much needed, including population-based management, aligned financial incentives, improved health literacy, community interventions, and improved access to primary care and medications.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^df44c228]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Classification and management of blood pressure for adults aged 18 years or older detail categories, lifestyle modification, and initial drug therapy. Normal is defined as systolic < 120 mm Hg and diastolic < 80 mm Hg with lifestyle modification to encourage. Prehypertension is 120–139 mm Hg systolic or 80–89 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications no antihypertensive drug is indicated. Stage 1 hypertension is 140–159 mm Hg systolic or 90–99 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications initial therapy is thiazide-type diuretics for most; may consider ACE inhibitor, ARB, β-blocker, CCB, or combination. Stage 2 hypertension is ≥ 160 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 100 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications initial therapy is a 2-drug combination for most (usually thiazide-type diuretic and ACE inhibitor or ARB or β-blocker or CCB). With compelling indications, use drug(s) for the compelling indications, with other antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, ACE inhibitor, ARB, β-blocker, CCB) as needed. Treatment is determined by highest BP category. Treat patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes to BP goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Initial combined therapy should be used cautiously in those at risk for orthostatic hypotension.

### Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension [^bf16a63f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors need to know what blood pressure (BP) target they should try to achieve. The standard of clinical practice for some time has been ≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this standard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard reduces mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine if lower BP targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard BP targets (≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (1966–2008), EMBASE (1980–2008), and CENTRAL (up to June 2008); references from review articles, clinical guidelines, and clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing patients randomized to lower or to standard BP targets and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (JAA, MIP) independently assessed the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; total cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

No trials comparing different systolic BP targets were found. Seven trials (22,089 subjects) comparing different diastolic BP targets were included. Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p < 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.25), congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59–1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81–1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating patients to lower than standard BP targets, ≤ 140–160/90–100 mmHg, does not reduce mortality or morbidity. Because guidelines are recommending even lower targets for diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, we are currently conducting systematic reviews in those groups of patients.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^1318e12d]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension clinical practice guidelines for management of high blood pressure/hypertension are influential documents. Both guidelines are comprehensive, were developed using rigorous processes, and underwent extensive peer review. The most notable difference between the 2 guidelines is the blood pressure cut points recommended for the diagnosis of hypertension. There are also differences in the timing and intensity of treatment, with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommending a somewhat more intensive approach. Overall, there is substantial concordance in the recommendations provided by the 2 guideline-writing committees, with greater congruity between them than their predecessors. Additional harmonization of future guidelines would help to underscore the commonality of their core recommendations and could serve to catalyze changes in practice that would lead to improved prevention, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, worldwide.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^c870bffa]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the 2017 Guideline, 68 million individuals had uncontrolled hypertension and were recommended for antihypertensive therapy; of these, 35 million were untreated, and 33 million were receiving treatment but had not attained target BP levels. We advocate for the application of risk stratification to guide priority interventions in both cohorts, informing optimal escalation strategies for those inadequately controlled, and prioritizing interventions to address nontreatment in the untreated population. Drawing a parallel with lipid-lowering therapy, it is both rational and evidence-based to ensure that individuals at the highest risk receive the most effective — and, where appropriate, more intensive — therapeutic regimens. We propose that BP-lowering interventions should be classified by intensity, analogous to lipid-lowering therapies: low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to reductions in systolic BP of < 10, 10 to 19, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively. Those at the highest absolute risk should generally be prioritized for high-intensity regimens, provided adverse effects do not preclude their use. Achieving a mean SBP of ≤ 120 mm Hg is essential to maintain the majority of BP readings below 130/80 mm Hg over time, given the natural intraindividual variability in BP. Thus, all patients with untreated mean SBP > 140 mm Hg will require high-intensity regimens to attain and sustain optimal BP control and minimize cardiovascular risk. The substantial expansion of high-intensity therapy should therefore be directed primarily towards individuals at the highest absolute risk and with the greatest gap to achieving optimal BP. Given the heightened urgency in patients with high predicted risk, immediate pharmacological intervention — potentially with dual therapy — should be considered as the default strategy. Naturally, this approach must be tailored to patient preferences and tolerability; nonetheless, the evidence increasingly supports early, decisive intervention in those most likely to benefit.

### Commentary on the 2014 BP guidelines from the panel appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^e9337161]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The recently published article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) has generated considerable controversy. In this commentary, we evaluate the document and compare the recommendations contained within it with those of the JNC 7 and other national and international guidelines. The evidence quality rating approach followed by the article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) disqualified nearly 98% of previous studies from review; as a result, some of the key recommendations were on the basis of expert opinion alone. We are especially concerned that the recommendation to raise the systolic/diastolic BP levels at which treatment is initiated to ≥ 150/ ≥ 90 mmHg in adults ≥ 60 years old may affect cardiovascular and renal health in these patients. Additionally, we recommend that hypertension guidelines should be updated every 3–4 years with a fresh approach to the definition of target BP levels, the use of modern technology in the diagnosis of hypertension, and the treatment of hypertension in special populations not addressed in earlier guidelines.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^8eb2328e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^b6eace0b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Definitions and measurement framework emphasize JNC 7 categories and scope. The definitions of hypertension used in this report are those developed by JNC 7 and include normal, prehypertension, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension, and acute hypertensive emergencies are not addressed by this policy. Classification is based on the average of 2 or more properly measured, seated blood pressure readings on each of 2 or more office visits. JNC 7 defined prehypertension as systolic blood pressure of 120 to 139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg, and patients with prehypertension are at increased risk for progression to hypertension; those in the 120–139 mm Hg systolic or 80–89 mm Hg diastolic range are at twice the risk to develop hypertension as those with lower values. The table applies to adults aged 18 years or older.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^49325468]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 203 — definition and diagnosis of chronic hypertension in pregnancy states that chronic hypertension in pregnancy is defined as hypertension diagnosed or present before pregnancy or before 20 weeks of gestation, and hypertension that is diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy and that does not resolve in the typical postpartum period also is classified as chronic hypertension; traditionally, criteria are a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more, a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more, or both; in general, it is recommended that a diagnosis of hypertension requires at least two determinations at least 4 hours apart, although on occasion the diagnosis can be confirmed within a shorter interval (even minutes) to facilitate timely therapy; recent ACC/AHA recommendations include classifying blood pressure into four categories — 1) normal (systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg), 2) elevated (systolic blood pressure of 120–129 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg), 3) stage 1 hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mm Hg), and 4) stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more); the recommendations now suggest beginning treatment in nonpregnant adults with risk factors for current or future cardiovascular disease in patients with stage 1 hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mm Hg).

### Blood pressure and the new ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^a6ddbd00]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines cover virtually all aspects of the diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring, secondary causes as well as drug and non-drug treatment of hypertension. Substantial and appropriate emphasis has been given to the strategies necessary for accurate measurement of blood pressure in any setting where valid blood pressure measurements are desired. Most "errors" made during blood pressure measurement bias readings upwards resulting in over-diagnosis of hypertension and, amongst those already on drug therapy, underestimating the true magnitude of blood pressure lowering resulting in over-treatment. Hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure is consistently ≥ 130 and/or ≥ 80 mm Hg. However, the majority of patients with hypertension between 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) do not qualify for immediate drug therapy. The guideline breaks new ground with some of its recommendations. Absolute cardiovascular risk is utilized, for the first time, to determine high-risk status when BP 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (Stage 1 hypertension) and high-risk patient characteristics/co-morbidities are absent including age 65 and older, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, known cardiovascular disease; high-risk individuals initiate drug therapy when BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. The exception amongst high-risk individuals is for secondary stroke prevention in drug naïve individuals as drug therapy is initiated when blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Non-high risk individuals will initiate drug therapy when BP is ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Irrespective of blood pressure threshold for initiation of drug therapy, the target BP is minimally < 130/80 mm Hg in most. However, target BP is < 130 systolic amongst those 65 and older as the committee made no recommendation for a DBP target. Treatment should be initiated with two drugs having complementary mechanisms of action when blood pressure is > 20/10 mm Hg above goal.

### Global burden of hypertension and systolic blood pressure of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg, 1990–2015 [^db8f922c]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Elevated systolic blood (SBP) pressure is a leading global health risk. Quantifying the levels of SBP is important to guide prevention policies and interventions.

Objective

To estimate the association between SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg and SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher and the burden of different causes of death and disability by age and sex for 195 countries and territories, 1990–2015.

Design

A comparative risk assessment of health loss related to SBP. Estimated distribution of SBP was based on 844 studies from 154 countries (published 1980–2015) of 8.69 million participants. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression was used to generate estimates of mean SBP and adjusted variance for each age, sex, country, and year. Diseases with sufficient evidence for a causal relationship with high SBP (eg, ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke) were included in the primary analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mean SBP level, cause-specific deaths, and health burden related to SBP (≥ 110–115 mm Hg and also ≥ 140 mm Hg) by age, sex, country, and year.

Results

Between 1990–2015, the rate of SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg increased from 73 119 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 67 949–78 241) to 81 373 (95% UI, 76 814–85 770) per 100 000, and SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher increased from 17 307 (95% UI, 17 117–17 492) to 20 526 (95% UI, 20 283–20 746) per 100 000. The estimated annual death rate per 100 000 associated with SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg increased from 135.6 (95% UI, 122.4–148.1) to 145.2 (95% UI 130.3–159.9) and the rate for SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher increased from 97.9 (95% UI, 87.5–108.1) to 106.3 (95% UI, 94.6–118.1). For loss of DALYs associated with systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher, the loss increased from 95.9 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 87.0–104.9 million) to 143.0 million (95% UI, 130.2–157.0 million), and for SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher, the loss increased from 5.2 million (95% UI, 4.6–5.7 million) to 7.8 million (95% UI, 7.0–8.7 million). The largest numbers of SBP-related deaths were caused by ischemic heart disease (4.9 million [95% UI, 4.0–5.7 million]; 54.5%), hemorrhagic stroke (2.0 million [95% UI, 1.6–2.3 million]; 58.3%), and ischemic stroke (1.5 million [95% UI, 1.2–1.8 million]; 50.0%). In 2015, China, India, Russia, Indonesia, and the United States accounted for more than half of the global DALYs related to SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg.

Conclusions and Relevance

In international surveys, although there is uncertainty in some estimates, the rate of elevated SBP (≥ 110–115 and ≥ 140 mm Hg) increased substantially between 1990 and 2015, and DALYs and deaths associated with elevated SBP also increased. Projections based on this sample suggest that in 2015, an estimated 3.5 billion adults had SBP of at least 110 to 115 mm Hg and 874 million adults had SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher.

### Optimizing observer performance of clinic blood pressure measurement: a position statement from the Lancet commission on hypertension group [^04f6c16b]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading modifiable risk factor for death and disability in the world, affecting an estimated 1.4 billion adults globally, and leading to over 10 million deaths per year. It is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and chronic kidney disease and a major contributor to escalating healthcare costs. With an overall global adult prevalence of 31%, high BP is highly prevalent in all major regions of the world. However, in absolute numbers, it is low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) that bear the highest burden of illness, having over one billion individuals affected, and possessing awareness, treatment and control proportions that lag high-income countries to a considerable degree. Accordingly, ongoing efforts to improve the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and control of hypertension globally must include tailored interventions that prioritize reductions in regional disparities.

Accurate and reliable BP measurement is essential for the proper diagnosis and management of hypertension. On a population-wide level, a 5-mmHg difference in SBP corresponds to an estimated 6% absolute and 30% relative change in hypertension prevalence. Accordingly, the effect of a 5-mmHg error in BP measurement, assuming a global prevalence of 1.4 billion, could lead to the incorrect classification of hypertension status in 84 million individuals worldwide. Therefore, the ramifications of inaccurate measurement on a global level are profound.

Blood pressure is a physiological parameter that changes constantly in response to endogenous factors and exogenous stimuli. This variability makes assessment of 'usual' BP, which is defined as an individual's true or genuine BP, challenging. BP measurement is perhaps the most commonly performed procedure in clinical medicine and, although, at first glance, it seems simple, in reality, many steps must be performed sequentially and optimally in order to produce a reproducible result reflective of usual BP. Accordingly, the individual responsible for measuring BP, herein referred to as the 'observer', must be meticulous in terms of following recommended techniques. The challenges posed by the variable nature of BP were recognized over a century ago by Riva-Rocci et al. who noted that taking multiple measurements and standardizing the measurement conditions could optimize use of the technique in clinical practice. He concludes, in his seminal paper written in 1896, that '… if the procedures are neglected, and the doctor is satisfied with a crude reading, the method will become useless and will be quickly abandoned as a scientists' indulgence'.

### Systolic blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes during treatment of hypertension [^130c1626]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Randomized controlled trials in hypertension demonstrate cardiovascular benefits when systolic blood pressures are reduced from higher values to < 160 mm Hg. The value of lower targets has not been fully defined, although major guidelines recommend achieving systolic blood pressures of < 140 mm Hg. This study was conducted to explore cardiovascular outcomes at differing on-treatment blood pressure levels.

Methods

On the basis of a prespecified plan to explore relationships between clinical outcomes and systolic blood pressures, the pooled cohort of high-risk hypertensive patients (N = 10,705) in the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension trial were divided into 4 strata of systolic blood pressure levels: > 140 mm Hg, 130 to < 140 mm Hg, 120 to < 130 mm Hg, and 110 to < 120 mm Hg. The primary end point was cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke. Outcomes comparisons between the blood pressure groups were by Cox regression.

Results

The mean patient age was 68 years, and the study duration was 35.7 months. The primary end point occurred in 171 of 3429 patients (5.0%) with systolic blood pressure in the 10 mm Hg range < 140 and in 179 of 2354 patients (7.6%) with systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50–0.77; P = 0.0001). Likewise, cardiovascular death decreased by 36% (P = 0.0147), total myocardial infarction (fatal+nonfatal) decreased by 37% (P = 0.0028), and stroke decreased by 47% (P = 0.0002). Cardiovascular event rates in those with systolic blood pressure < 130 mm Hg were not different from those with systolic blood pressure < 140 mm Hg. However, compared with systolic blood pressure < 130 mm Hg, stroke incidence in those with systolic blood pressure < 120 mm Hg was lower (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.35–1.01; P = 0.0529), but myocardial function was higher (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.00–2.29; P = 0.0437), as were composite coronary events (myocardial infarction, hospitalized angina, or sudden death) (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.18–2.24; P = 0.0023). The renal end point of a sustained > 50% increase in serum creatinine was significantly lower in those with systolic blood pressure < 140 mm Hg than in any of the other higher or lower blood pressure ranges.

Conclusions

In high-risk hypertensive patients, major cardiovascular events are significantly lower in those with systolic blood pressures < 140 mm Hg and < 130 mm Hg than in those with levels > 140 mm Hg. There are stroke benefits at levels < 120 mm Hg, but they are offset by increased coronary events. Renal function is best protected in the 130 to 139 mm Hg range.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^f54e01be]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA guideline provides 106 formal recommendations and the ESC/ESH provides 122. In both guidelines, each recommendation is characterized by a class of recommendation that specifies the strength or importance of the recommendation and by a level-of-evidence designation. Both the ESC/ESH and ACC/AHA guideline committees voted on the wording and grading of each recommendation. Both guidelines provide comprehensive advice for prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high BP/hypertension. As a result, the 2 full reports are relatively long (103 pages for the ACC/AHA and 84 pages for the ESC/ESH). For ease of reading, however, the documents are divided into sections and subsections that use a similar presentation format. In addition, a variety of shorter executive summaries and brief synopses have been published. Guideline authors have published articles that expand on individual guideline topics, provide perspective for the evidence underpinning selected recommendations, and furnish quantitative estimates of potential impact based on universal application of guideline recommendations in their target populations. Last, both guidelines are complemented by publicly available slide sets, CVD risk estimation calculators, and other educational tools.

Intrauterine devices (IUDs) — hypertension classifications and clarifications: Hypertension is introduced with the statement that "Systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg are associated with increased risk for adverse health events as a result of pregnancy (Box 3)". Listed strata include "i. Systolic 140–159 mm Hg or diastolic 90–99 mm Hg", "ii. Systolic ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 100 mm Hg", and "History of high blood pressure during pregnancy (when current blood pressure is measurable and normal)". Clarifications state that "For all categories of hypertension, classifications are based on the assumption that no other risk factors for cardiovascular disease exist. When multiple risk factors do exist, risk for cardiovascular disease might increase substantially. A single reading of blood pressure level is not sufficient to classify a person as hypertensive". A comment adds, "Theoretical concern exists about the effect of LNG on lipids. Use of Cu-IUDs has no restrictions".

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^b4e0a966]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hypertension definitions and treatment thresholds — VA/DoD CPG background summarizes evolving criteria and the Work Group definition. JNC 7 defined hypertension (HTN) as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, and prehypertension was classified as SBP 120–139 or DBP 80–89. The 2017 ACC/AHA defines HTN as an SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg, or both; it removed prehypertension and added elevated blood pressure defined as an SBP of 120–129 with a DBP < 80 mm Hg. For this CPG, the Work Group defines HTN as an SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or both, and also as SBP and/or DBP at or above 130/90 mm Hg, assuming proper measurement technique. The page notes that treatment benefit has not been proven for lowering slightly elevated blood pressures to a "normal" blood pressure of 115/75 mm Hg, and for those with a blood pressure above "normal" but not in the hypertensive range there is no evidence to date that there is a benefit from treatment.

Reflections

Although differences in guidelines are invariably highlighted, it is notable that the core advice in the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guidelines is remarkably similar in most important areas of practice (Table 9). Even for the area of greatest difference, the definition of hypertension, there is still considerable overlap. In both guidelines, adults with an average SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg are designated as having hypertension and treatment with a combination of lifestyle counseling and antihypertensive drug therapy is recommended. Those with an average SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg are designated as having stage 1 hypertension in the ACC/AHA and high normal BP in the ESC/ESH. However, both guidelines recommend lifestyle modification for most adults in this BP category, the addition of antihypertensive drugs only being recommended for the ≈30% of US adults with CVD or a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10% in the ACC/AHA guideline and only to be considered in very-high-risk patients, especially those with coronary artery disease, in the ESC/ESH CPG. For many other treatment differences, the 2 guidelines provide overall advice that is similar but sometimes discrepant in the specifics. For example, both guidelines recommend combination antihypertensive drug therapy but the specific application for this advice is somewhat different. The ESC/ESH places great emphasis on single-pill combination drug therapy, whereas the ACC/AHA encourages single-pill combinations when possible but notes that many of the combination pills available in the United States use hydrochlorothiazide rather than chlorthalidone and often use a diuretic dose that is lower than what has been used in the landmark treatment trials. Likewise, both guidelines recommend a lower BP target during treatment compared with what was advised in previous guidelines, including in older adults. Overall, the difference lies in the ESC/ESH taking a more stepped approach, first recommending achievement of an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg before targeting a lower BP, if tolerated, and identifying SBP 120 mm Hg and DBP 70 mm Hg as the lower safety boundary for BP reduction in adults 18 to 65 years of age (130 mm Hg in those with CKD). The ACC/AHA recommends a single SBP/DBP target of < 130/80 mm Hg in most adults but SBP < 130 mm Hg in older well adults, if tolerated.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^b6e89dbc]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

JNC 8 guideline limitations — scope and evidence base are described as follows: This evidence-based guideline for the management of high BP in adults is not a comprehensive guideline and is limited in scope because of the focused evidence review to address the 3 specific questions. The evidence review did not include observational studies, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses, and the panel did not conduct its own meta-analysis based on prespecified inclusion criteria, and the panel decided to focus only on RCTs. RCTs that enrolled prehypertensive or nonhypertensive individuals were excluded, and thus these recommendations do not apply to those without hypertension.

### Evaluation and treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension [^536bfb18]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Poorly controlled hypertension is a common finding in the outpatient setting. When patients present with severely elevated blood pressure (i.e., systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or greater, or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or greater), physicians need to differentiate hypertensive emergency from severely elevated blood pressure without signs or symptoms of end-organ damage (severe asymptomatic hypertension). Most patients who are asymptomatic but have poorly controlled hypertension do not have acute end-organ damage and, therefore, do not require immediate workup or treatment (within 24 hours). However, physicians should confirm blood pressure readings and appropriately classify the hypertensive state. A cardiovascular risk profile is important in guiding the treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension; higher risk patients may benefit from more urgent and aggressive evaluation and treatment. Oral agents may be initiated before discharge, but intravenous medications and fast-acting oral agents should be reserved for true hypertensive emergencies. High blood pressure should be treated gradually. Appropriate, repeated follow-up over weeks to months is needed to reach desired blood pressure goals.

### Pharmacological blood pressure lowering for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease across different levels of blood pressure: an individual participant-level data meta-analysis [^e2fe557a]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

The effects of pharmacological blood pressure lowering at normal or high-normal blood pressure ranges in people with or without pre-existing cardiovascular disease remains uncertain. We analysed individual participant data from randomised trials to investigate the effects of blood pressure lowering treatment on the risk of major cardiovascular events by baseline levels of systolic blood pressure.

Methods

We did a meta-analysis of individual participant-level data from 48 randomised trials of pharmacological blood pressure lowering medications versus placebo or other classes of blood pressure-lowering medications, or between more versus less intensive treatment regimens, which had at least 1000 persons-years of follow-up in each group. Trials exclusively done with participants with heart failure or short-term interventions in participants with acute myocardial infarction or other acute settings were excluded. Data from 51 studies published between 1972 and 2013 were obtained by the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (Oxford University, Oxford, UK). We pooled the data to investigate the stratified effects of blood pressure-lowering treatment in participants with and without prevalent cardiovascular disease (ie, any reports of stroke, myocardial infarction, or ischaemic heart disease before randomisation), overall and across seven systolic blood pressure categories (ranging from < 120 to ≥ 170 mm Hg). The primary outcome was a major cardiovascular event (defined as a composite of fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, or heart failure causing death or requiring admission to hospital), analysed as per intention to treat.

Findings

Data for 344716 participants from 48 randomised clinical trials were available for this analysis. Pre-randomisation mean systolic/diastolic blood pressures were 146/84 mm Hg in participants with previous cardiovascular disease (n = 157728) and 157/89 mm Hg in participants without previous cardiovascular disease (n = 186988). There was substantial spread in participants' blood pressure at baseline, with 31239 (19·8%) of participants with previous cardiovascular disease and 14928 (8·0%) of individuals without previous cardiovascular disease having a systolic blood pressure of less than 130 mm Hg. The relative effects of blood pressure-lowering treatment were proportional to the intensity of systolic blood pressure reduction. After a median 4·15 years' follow-up (Q1-Q3 2·97–4·96), 42324 participants (12·3%) had at least one major cardiovascular event. In participants without previous cardiovascular disease at baseline, the incidence rate for developing a major cardiovascular event per 1000 person-years was 31·9 (95% CI 31·3–32·5) in the comparator group and 25·9 (25·4–26·4) in the intervention group. In participants with previous cardiovascular disease at baseline, the corresponding rates were 39·7 (95% CI 39·0–40·5) and 36·0 (95% CI 35·3–36·7), in the comparator and intervention groups, respectively. Hazard ratios (HR) associated with a reduction of systolic blood pressure by 5 mm Hg for a major cardiovascular event were 0·91, 95% CI 0·89–0·94 for partipants without previous cardiovascular disease and 0·89, 0·86–0·92, for those with previous cardiovascular disease. In stratified analyses, there was no reliable evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effects on major cardiovascular events by baseline cardiovascular disease status or systolic blood pressure categories.

Interpretation

In this large-scale analysis of randomised trials, a 5 mm Hg reduction of systolic blood pressure reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by about 10%, irrespective of previous diagnoses of cardiovascular disease, and even at normal or high-normal blood pressure values. These findings suggest that a fixed degree of pharmacological blood pressure lowering is similarly effective for primary and secondary prevention of major cardiovascular disease, even at blood pressure levels currently not considered for treatment. Physicians communicating the indication for blood pressure lowering treatment to their patients should emphasise its importance on reducing cardiovascular risk rather than focusing on blood pressure reduction itself.

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^bbf9517c]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension, but currently systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each. Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. Data from trials clearly indicate that, for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of < 150 mm Hg and a DBP of < 90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower — SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg. As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy. Because controlling BP to < 140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

### The epidemiology and management of severe hypertension [^cdf955d7]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is among the most prevalent chronic conditions worldwide; with rates as high as 70% among adults in developed countries such as Poland. Although hypertension is usually asymptomatic, it may be associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The higher the blood pressure (BP), the greater the risk for adverse outcomes including development of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, stroke and kidney disease. Hypertension treatment has been clearly shown to reduce this risk.

Accordingly, the current World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Hypertension guidelines and the prior Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) guidelines classify BP into grades or stages based on the absolute BP level. Although absolute cardiovascular risk is based not only on BP levels, but associated cardiovascular risk factors or target organ damage, individuals with the highest levels, grade/stageor severe hypertension (that is, systolic BP⩾180 mm Hg or diastolic BP⩾110 mm Hg), have a 20–30% 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease, that increases to very high risk, > 30%, in the presence of any risk factors or target organ damage. Further, these subjects are also at high short-term risk for serious cardiovascular events, the risk increasing with the degree and speed of elevation. Because of this, guidelines also stress that such patients should have close follow-up with reassessment at most within 1 week, and will require multiple drugs to achieve control.

Although much has been written about the epidemiology and management of the general hypertension population, relatively little is known about these issues in those with severe hypertension. Limited cross-sectional data suggest a prevalence among those with hypertension in the 8–19% range. How long such patients are exposed to high BPs, or how they are being managed in actual practice is relatively unknown, with existing data based on small samples and select populations.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the following issues with respect to patients with severe hypertension: (1) what is the epidemiology of severe hypertension, in terms of prevalence, pattern of severe hypertension and duration of severe hypertension? (2) what patient characteristics are associated with severe hypertension? (3) how are patients with severe hypertension being managed in everyday practice, including time to next visit, percentage of visits with a medication increase and number of BP medications by final BP control?

### Association between baseline diastolic blood pressure and the efficacy of intensive vs standard blood pressure-lowering therapy [^760b4e0f]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an interaction between baseline diastolic blood pressure and intensification of blood pressure–lowering therapy for survival and cardiovascular outcomes?

Findings

In this cohort study of 14 094 patients from 2 large randomized clinical trials, baseline DBP of 80 and 90 mm Hg were associated with significant reductions in the risk of a composite cardiovascular end point that included cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The same was not true for the outcome of all-cause death.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that further work is needed to determine whether blood-pressure lowering therapy should be intensified in patients whose diastolic blood pressure is low.

Table 1.
Proposals for Ambulatory Blood Pressure Thresholds

In 2017, the new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline reclassified office BP and proposed new thresholds for the ambulatory BP, albeit without explicit justification. The rationale of the proposed thresholds was described in a later separate publication in 2019. Thresholds were, therefore, derived from the IDACO databasethat yielded risks equivalent to the new office BP categories. Among 11 152 participants representative of 13 populations, the thresholds indicating elevated 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime systolic/diastolic BPs were 120/75, 120/80, and 105/65 mm Hg, and for stages 1 and 2, ambulatory hypertension the thresholds were 125/75 and 130/80 mm Hg, 130/80 and 135/85 mm Hg, and 110/65 and 120/70 mm Hg, respectively (Table 1). In general, the thresholds proposed in the European and American guidelines closely approximated to the outcome-driven thresholds. The systolic thresholds derived in the Jackson Heart Study in relation to outcome were substantially higher compared with those proposed by European and American guidelines and those derived from the IDACO database. Ravenell et alproposed ethnic differences as a possible explanation.

### Blood pressure control | Million hearts ®-HHS.gov… [^894ec608]. millionhearts.hhs.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

Blood Pressure Control High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, affects men and women of all races, ethnicities, and age groups throughout the U. S. An estimated 47% of U. S. adults have high blood pressure, using criteria from the 2017 clinical guideline from the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and other organizations, which defines high blood pressure as systolic blood pressure. __ > __130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure __ > __80 mmHg. 1, 2 Of people with high blood pressure who are recommended to be on antihypertensive medications and make lifestyle modifications, 74% do not have their blood pressure under control. Uncontrolled blood pressure is a leading cause of heart attack, stroke, heart failure, dementia, and kidney disease. Moreover, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are increasing in prevalence.

National surveillance data suggest that millions of people are unaware of their high blood pressure and data from clinical settings reinforce this; there are non-trivial numbers of patients seen in clinical settings who have multiple abnormal blood pressure readings but have not been diagnosed with hypertension. These patients with potentially undiagnosed hypertension are "hiding in plain sight" and strategies exist for finding them so they can be appropriately diagnosed, treated, and brought to control. 10 The 2017 ACC/AHA blood pressure guideline recommends initial combination therapy with two or more antihypertensive medications for most people with hypertension. Despite this recommendation, surveillance data show that 40% of people with hypertension are on monotherapy. Another evidence-based strategy that has been shown to lower blood pressure and improve control in persons with hypertension is self-measured blood pressure monitoring.

When combined with additional clinical support, SMBP may also reduce therapeutic inertia and improve medication adherence. SMBP is also recommended to confirm new hypertension diagnoses, and many resources exist to support its use.

### Impact of single-occasion American vs. Canadian office blood pressure measurement recommendations on blood pressure classification [^f28d216d]. American Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2017 American hypertension guidelines [American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA)] define a blood pressure measurement (BPM) procedure that differs from the Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP) guidelines. We studied the impact of the BPM procedure on arterial hypertension (AHT) prevalence rate.

Methods

In 805 subjects, the mean of the first and second BPM (adapted ACC/AHA procedure) was compared with the mean of the second and third BPM (CHEP procedure). All BPMs were taken at a single occasion. According to ACC/AHA definition, office blood pressure (OBP) of < 120/80 mm Hg was classified as normal, 120–129/ < 80 mm Hg as elevated, and ≥ 130/80 mm Hg as hypertensive.

Results

Using the adapted ACC/AHA BPM procedure compared to the CHEP BPM procedure led to an increase in the AHT prevalence rate (≥ 130/80 mm Hg) of 4% (58% vs. 54%). Overall, 8.9% (72/805) of subjects were reclassified to a higher and 2.6% (21/805) to a lower blood pressure category when using the adapted ACC/AHA BPM procedure instead of the CHEP BPM procedure. In the group with elevated OBP (120–129/ < 80 mm Hg), 41.9% (36/86) of subjects were reclassified.

Conclusions

Minimal changes of BPM procedures lead to relevant changes of hypertension prevalence.

### Systolic vs diastolic blood pressure: community burden and impact on blood pressure staging [^79f808c7]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is a more frequent cardiovascular risk factor than diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and has a greater impact on blood pressure staging, though this can vary with age, sex and country. Therefore this paper compares SBP and DBP in terms of community burden and impact on blood pressure staging, among Spain's middle-aged population. Data were drawn from a cross-sectional study on a representative sample of the Spanish population aged 35–64 years. Blood pressure was determined under standardised conditions, and was classified as per WHO-ISH and JNC-VI criteria. Prevalence of SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg was 34.1%, and that of DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, 30.9%. A total of 12% of subjects had isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) and 8.7% had isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH). Of treated hypertensives, 31% had their SBP controlled and 34% their DBP controlled. Of subjects not undergoing antihypertensive drug therapy, 60.8% had congruent SBP and DBP levels, 22.5% were up-staged on the basis of their SBP, and 16.7% were up-staged on the basis of their DBP. SBP alone thus correctly classified JNC-VI staging in 83.3% of subjects vs 77.5% for DBP alone. It was solely among the population > 50 years of age, in both sexes, that systolic proved more frequent than diastolic hypertension, ISH greater than IDH prevalence, SBP worse than DBP control, and the percentage of SBP higher than that of DBP up-staged subjects. SBP constitutes a greater community burden than does DBP, and has a greater impact on blood pressure staging in Spain's middle-aged population. However, the differential impact of SBP and DBP upon blood pressure burden and staging is favourable to SBP only among subjects > 50 years old. These findings are in accordance with recent guidelines on hypertension management.

### Association of blood pressure classification in young adults using the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association blood pressure guideline with cardiovascular events later in life [^82bca13b]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Little is known regarding the association between level of blood pressure (BP) in young adulthood and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events by middle age.

Objective

To assess whether young adults who developed hypertension, defined by the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) BP guideline, before age 40 years have higher risk for CVD events compared with those who maintained normal BP.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Analyses were conducted in the prospective cohort Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, started in March 1985. CARDIA enrolled 5115 African American and white participants aged 18 to 30 years from 4 US field centers (Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Oakland, California). Outcomes were available through August 2015.

Exposures

Using the highest BP measured from the first examination to the examination closest to, but not after, age 40 years, each participant was categorized as having normal BP (untreated systolic BP [SBP] < 120 mm Hg and diastolic BP [DBP] < 80 mm Hg; n = 2574); elevated BP (untreated SBP 120–129 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg; n = 445); stage 1 hypertension (untreated SBP 130–139 mm Hg or DBP 80–89 mm Hg; n = 1194); or stage 2 hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg, DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or taking antihypertensive medication; n = 638).

Main Outcomes and Measures

CVD events: fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or intervention for peripheral artery disease (PAD).

Results

The final cohort included 4851 adults (mean age when follow-up for outcomes began, 35.7 years [SD, 3.6]; 2657 women [55%]; 2441 African American [50%]; 206 taking antihypertensive medication [4%]). Over a median follow-up of 18.8 years, 228 incident CVD events occurred (CHD, 109; stroke, 63; heart failure, 48; PAD, 8). CVD incidence rates for normal BP, elevated BP, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension were 1.37 (95% CI, 1.07–1.75), 2.74 (95% CI, 1.78–4.20), 3.15 (95% CI, 2.47–4.02), and 8.04 (95% CI, 6.45–10.03) per 1000 person-years, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, hazard ratios for CVD events for elevated BP, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension vs normal BP were 1.67 (95% CI, 1.01–2.77), 1.75 (95% CI, 1.22–2.53), and 3.49 (95% CI, 2.42–5.05), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among young adults, those with elevated blood pressure, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension before age 40 years, as defined by the blood pressure classification in the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, had significantly higher risk for subsequent cardiovascular disease events compared with those with normal blood pressure before age 40 years. The ACC/AHA blood pressure classification system may help identify young adults at higher risk for cardiovascular disease events.

### Hypertension: Joint National Committee on detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure guidelines [^4ad744ab]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypertension has been recognized for decades as a major factor for stroke, with observational epidemiologic studies clearly identifying the increased stroke risks with blood pressure (BP) levels and randomized controlled clinical trials providing evidence of stroke risk reduction with lower BPs. Hypertension treatment and management guidelines, the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) reports, have recognized the high impact of elevated BPs and influenced lower BPs with subsequent stroke risk reduction. In particular, the previous seven JNC reports included an evolution of SBP levels for treatment. This review addresses the influences of the JNC reports on stroke outcomes and describes the potential efforts of the upcoming guidelines.

Recent Findings

The recommendations of lower SBPs from the earlier reports were consistent with lower population BP shifts during the time period. The next JNC report will have a major focus on graded evidence from randomized clinical trials with detailed strategies and subsequent impact on stroke risks.

Summary

The impact of the evidence-based guidelines will be expected to have enhanced effects on stroke rates by providing clinicians with current treatment and management recommendations.

The new Joint National Committee 8 (JNC-8) blood pressure guidelines were recently published, and there are some major changes from JNC-7. There are also differences between JNC-8 and hypertension guidelines created by major organizations in North America and around the world published from 2013 to the present. In the face of conflicting evidence, it is difficult for practicing clinicians to reconcile these differences and to incorporate new guidance into their practice. This commentary will identify similarities and differences between guidelines, provide some literature context in the areas of differing recommendations, and then provide advice to enhance patient care.

We propose a consensus definition of "an exaggerated orthostatic pressor response" in subjects in whom systolic blood pressure increases ≥ 20mmHg when going from the supine to standing posture. This definition can be extended for seated to standing measurements. We reserve the term "orthostatic hypertension" if this pressor response leads to an upright systolic blood pressure ≥ 140mmHg. We believe this consensus definition will help in the study of the pathophysiology, clinical impact, and potential treatment of these entities, and the identification of patients that are at greater cardiovascular risk.

BP Measurement and Correspondence of Office and Out-of-Office Readings

Errors in BP measurement are a major source of BP misclassification. Both guidelines place strong emphasis on accurate measurement of BP by using validated devices and multiple readings for diagnosis and management of hypertension (Tables 1–3). The ACC/AHA recommends averaging office BP readings, using the same advice for ≥ 2 readings on ≥ 2 occasions provided in previous Joint National Committee reports, and recommends confirmation of office hypertension by means of out-of-office measurements. The ESC/ESH recommends 3 readings for office BP measurement, with additional readings when the first 2 differ by > 10 mm Hg or BP is unstable because of an arrhythmia, and advises confirmation of office hypertension by means of either repeated office readings at several visits or by out-of-office BP measurements. Both guidelines recommend out-of-office BP measurements to recognize masked and white coat hypertension. They provide only slightly different treatment guidance for white coat and masked hypertension, while mentioning the uncertainty of such recommendations. The ACC/AHA CPG provides corresponding values for office and out-of-office measurements (home blood pressure monitoring, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) in the range of 120/80 mm Hg to 160/100 mm Hg for office BP measurements, whereas the ESC/ESH provides only the corresponding cutoff values for the diagnosis of hypertension for home blood pressure monitoring and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring measurements. The latter are, however, concordant with the corresponding values in the ACC/AHA guideline (Tables 1–3).

For adolescents 13 years or older, thresholds follow adult guidelines regardless of sex and height: stage 1 hypertension is defined as a blood pressure measurement of 130/80 to 139/89 mm Hg, and stage 2 hypertension is defined as a blood pressure measurement above 140/90 mm Hg.

### Editors' commentary on the 2023 ESH management of arterial hypertension guidelines [^0b0b0009]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are ideally suited to the provision of advice on the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure (BP). The recently published European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2023 ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension is the latest in a long series of high BP clinical practice guidelines. It closely resembles the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH guidelines, with incremental rather than major changes. Although the ESH guidelines are primarily written for European clinicians and public health workers, there is a high degree of concordance between its recommendations and those in the other major BP guidelines. Despite the large number of national and international BP guidelines around the world, general population surveys demonstrate that BP guidelines are not being well implemented in any part of the world. The level of BP, which is the basis for diagnosis and management, continues to be poorly measured in routine clinical practice and control of hypertension remains suboptimal, even to a conservative BP target such as a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mmHg. BP guidelines need to focus much more on implementation of recommendations for accurate diagnosis and strategies for improved control in those being treated for hypertension. An evolving body of implementation science can assist in meeting this goal. Given the enormous health, social, and financial burden of high BP, better diagnosis and management should be an imperative for clinicians, government, and others responsible for the provision of health care services. Hopefully, the 2023 ESH will help enable this.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^7aa404b6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually try to achieve a blood pressure target. That target is the blood pressure value below which the optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. "The lower the better" approach that guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years was challenged during the last decade due to lack of evidence from randomised trials supporting that strategy. For that reason, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice during the last years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of trying to achieve lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to know whether the benefits outweigh harms when attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/ 90 mm Hg) for the treatment of patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were: to determine if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP associated with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension; and to determine if there is a change in withdrawals due to adverse events with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets", in patients with elevated blood pressure.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to May 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients allocated to lower or to standard blood pressure targets (see above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JAA, VL) independently assessed the included trials and extracted data. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, end stage renal disease, and other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean SBP and DBP, withdrawals due to adverse effects, and mean number of antihypertensive drugs used. We assessed the risk of bias of each trial using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: This update includes 11 RCTs involving 38,688 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. This represents 7 new RCTs compared with the original version. At baseline the mean weighted age was 63.1 years and the mean weighted blood pressure was 155/91 mm Hg. Lower targets do not reduce total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 11 trials, 38,688 participants; high-certainty evidence) and do not reduce total serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.08; 6 trials, 18,165 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that the benefits of lower targets do not outweigh the harms as compared to standard blood pressure targets. Lower targets may reduce myocardial infarction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96; 6 trials, 18,938 participants, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.4%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 250 over 3.7 years) and congestive heart failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92; 5 trials, 15,859 participants, ARR 0.6%, NNTB 167 over 3.7 years) (low-certainty for both outcomes). Reduction in myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure was not reflected in total serious adverse events. This may be due to an increase in other serious adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.59; 6 trials. 18,938 participants, absolute risk increase (ARI) 3%, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 33 over four years) (low-certainty evidence). Participants assigned to a "lower" target received one additional antihypertensive medication and achieved a significantly lower mean SBP (122.8 mm Hg versus 135.0 mm Hg, and a lower mean DBP (82.0 mm Hg versus 85.2 mm Hg, than those assigned to "standard target".

Authors' Conclusions

For the general population of persons with elevated blood pressure, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower blood pressure target rather than a standard target (≤ 140/90 mm Hg) do not outweigh the harms associated with that intervention. Further research is needed to see if some groups of patients would benefit or be harmed by lower targets. The results of this review are primarily applicable to older people with moderate to high cardiovascular risk. They may not be applicable to other populations.

JNC 8 — Recommendation 9 (treatment strategy and follow-up) — the main objective of hypertension treatment is to attain and maintain goal BP. If goal BP is not reached within a month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug from one of the classes in recommendation 6 (thiazide-type diuretic, CCB, ACEI, or ARB). The clinician should continue to assess BP and adjust the treatment regimen until goal BP is reached. Do not use an ACEI and an ARB together in the same patient. Referral to a hypertension specialist may be indicated for patients in whom goal BP cannot be attained using the above strategy or for the management of complicated patients for whom additional clinical consultation is needed (Expert Opinion - Grade E).

### Severe asymptomatic hypertension: evaluation and treatment [^2ae3a846]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects one-third of Americans and is a significant modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, renal disease, and death. Severe asymptomatic hypertension is defined as severely elevated blood pressure (180 mm Hg or more systolic, or 110 mm Hg or more diastolic) without symptoms of acute target organ injury. The short-term risks of acute target organ injury and major adverse cardiovascular events are low in this population, whereas hypertensive emergencies manifest as acute target organ injury requiring immediate hospitalization. Individuals with severe asymptomatic hypertension often have preexisting poorly controlled hypertension and usually can be managed in the outpatient setting. Immediate diagnostic testing rarely alters short-term management, and blood pressure control is best achieved with initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive therapy. Aggressive lowering of blood pressure should be avoided, and the use of parenteral medications is not indicated. Current recommendations are to gradually reduce blood pressure over several days to weeks. Patients with escalating blood pressure, manifestation of acute target organ injury, or lack of compliance with treatment should be considered for hospital admission.

HYPERTENSION GUIDELINE AND TREATMENT CONTROVERSIES

Hypertension care is complex. Multiple guidelines with different treatment thresholds, diagnostic criteria, and target goals introduce potential program, communication, and management complexity may have contributed to the decline in controlled BP. The 2017 AHA/ACC BP guidelineand the report from members initially appointed to the Joint National Committee (JNC-8)have been the subject of debate and inconsistent implementation by some professional organizations and clinicians. For example, the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommended that patients with hypertension who are 60 years and older should be treated to a systolic BP target of < 150 mm Hg, aligning with the JNC-8 writing group recommendation, but conflicting with JNC-7 and the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline. It is unclear whether these inconsistencies contribute to reduced BP control. Of note, hypertension control to < 140/ < 90 mm Hg declined more in adults 40–59 years than in those 60 years and older. This finding suggests that factors other than the JNC-8 report and ACP/AAFP recommendations for a higher systolic BP target may contribute to the broad-based decline in hypertension control.

### Higher blood pressure targets for hypertension in older adults [^7ea3e1fe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an update of the original Cochrane review, published in 2017. Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in adults, 65 years of age or older, attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) of < 160 mmHg. Collectively, these trials demonstrated cardiovascular benefit for treatment, compared to no treatment, for older adults with BP > 160 mmHg. However, an even lower BP target of < 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. Yet the risk and benefit of antihypertensive therapy can be expected to vary across populations, and some observational evidence suggests that older adults who are frail might have better health outcomes with less aggressive BP lowering. Current clinical practice guidelines are inconsistent in target BP recommendations for older adults, with systolic BP targets ranging from < 130 mmHg to < 150 mmHg. The 2017 review did not find compelling evidence of a reduction in any of the primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality, stroke, or total serious cardiovascular adverse events, comparing a lower BP target to a higher BP target in older adults with hypertension. It is important to update this review to explore if new evidence exists to determine whether older adults might do just as well, better, or worse with less aggressive pharmacotherapy for hypertension.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a less aggressive blood pressure target (in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg), compared to a conventional or more aggressive BP target (of < 140/90 mmHg or lower) in hypertensive adults, 65 years of age or older.

Search Methods

For this update, Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to June 2024: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid, and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also contacted authors of relevant papers requesting information on further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of hypertensive older adults (≥ 65 years) that spanned at least one year, and reported the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher or lower systolic or diastolic BP treatment target. Higher BP targets ranged from systolic BP < 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP < 95 to 105 mmHg; lower BP targets were 140/90 mmHg or lower, measured in an ambulatory, home, or office setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and certainty of the evidence, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and serious cardio-renal vascular adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved.

Main Results

With the addition of one new trial, we included four trials in this updated review (16,732 older adults with a mean age of 70.3 years). Of these, one trial used a combined systolic and diastolic BP target and compared a higher target of < 150/90 mmHg to a lower target of < 140/90 mmHg, and two trials utilised a purely systolic BP target, and compared a systolic BP < 150 mmHg (1 trial) and a systolic BP < 160 mmHg (1 trial), to a systolic BP < 140 mmHg. The fourth and newest trial also utilised a systolic BP target, but also introduced a lower limit for systolic BP. It compared systolic BP in the target range of 130 to 150 mmHg to a lower target range of 110 to 130 mmHg. The evidence shows that treatment to the lower BP target over two to four years may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.37; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; low-certainty evidence), but the lower BP target does reduce stroke (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.67; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; high-certainty evidence), and likely reduces total serious cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse effects were not available from all trials, but the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 3 studies, 16,008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

When comparing a higher BP target, in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg, to a lower BP target of 140/90 or lower, over two to four years of follow-up, there is high-certainty evidence that the lower BP target reduces stroke, and moderate-certainty evidence that the lower BP target likely reduces serious cardiovascular events. The effect on all-cause mortality is unclear (low-certainty evidence), and the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (moderate-certainty evidence). Although additional research is warranted in those who are 80 years of age and older, and those who are frail (in whom risks and benefits may differ), conventional BP targets may be appropriate for the majority of older adults.

Table 9
Similarities and Differences in the 2017 ACC/AHA and 2018 ESC/ESH Adult BP Guidelines

Some of the differences between the 2 guidelines reflect the CPG process requirements of the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH. For example, the composition of the 2 writing committees, the approach to management of potential conflicts of interest, and the ACC/AHA use of an independent evidence review committee are all a direct result of ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guideline process requirements. Other differences between the 2 guidelines reflect the fact that they were written for different populations/geographic regions. A good example of this is CVD/ASCVD risk estimation, where evidence suggests that risk-estimating tools that have been validated in 1 population may not perform as well in another practice setting. Some of the differences reflect different weighting and interpretation of the available research findings by the 2 writing committees. For example, the ESC/ESH placed less emphasis on the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) findings, and on meta-analysis (especially network meta-analysis). Last, some of the differences probably reflect variations in practice culture and organization of the health care systems in the United States and Europe.

### Association of elevated blood pressure in the emergency department with chronically elevated blood pressure [^638711fe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects more than one‐third of adults in the United States, and hypertension‐related emergency department (ED) visits are increasing. 1, 2 Although the spectrum of acuity for hypertension‐related ED visits ranges widely, true hypertensive emergencies, such as acute heart failure in which acute BP reduction (< 24 hours) is warranted, are rare. 3, 4 For the much more common ED visits with asymptomatic elevated BP, rapid BP reduction can cause significant harm by impairing cerebral blood flow and has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 The American College of Emergency Physicians' policy recommendation on asymptomatic elevated BP in the ED reflects current lack of evidence to guide evaluation and treatment; based on expert opinion or panel consensus (level C evidence), it states that although all patients with asymptomatic elevated BP should be referred for follow‐up, routine ED testing and treatment are not needed but can be considered for those with poor follow‐up. 10

The risk of elevated BP after an ED visit and thresholds for classifying BP in the ED were not addressed by the American College of Emergency Physicians policy recommendation. Recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines revising the threshold for hypertension to 130/80 mm Hg among high‐risk patients adds urgency to addressing this evidence gap, as many ED patients are likely to meet these new criteria for hypertension and also have insufficient access to other sources of care. 11

There are several long‐standing barriers to using BP measured in the ED as part of diagnosing and treating hypertension. One barrier is uncertainty regarding the validity of BP measured in the ED. Despite some evidence to the contrary, BP measured in the ED is often disregarded because of concerns about measurement accuracy or because BP elevations attributed to pain, anxiety, or illness are presumed to be temporary and clinically unimportant. 12, 13 Questions about whether the ED can or should serve as a location of care to manage chronic diseases, such as hypertension, contribute to variation in how elevated BP in the ED is evaluated and treated. 14, 15, 16 Such variations in practice patterns due to lack of evidence are likely to result in worse health outcomes overall. 17

### Hypertension: empirical evidence and implications in 2014 [^284e373b]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

High blood pressure (HBP) or hypertension (HTN) is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Despite this fact, there is widespread agreement that the treatment of HBP, over the last half century, has been a great achievement. However, after the release of the new Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure-8 (JNC-8) guidelines, there have been heated debates with regard to what are the most evidence-based blood pressure goals. While JNC-8 claims that the goal blood pressure for otherwise healthy patients with mild hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140–159 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90–99 mm Hg) should be < 140/90 mm Hg; a recent Cochrane meta-analysis is in direct conflict with these recommendations. Indeed, a 2012 Cochrane meta-analysis indicated that there is no evidence that treating otherwise healthy mild hypertension patients with antihypertensive therapy will reduce CV events or mortality. Additionally, the Cochrane meta-analysis showed that antihypertensive therapy was associated with a significant increase in withdrawal due to adverse events. Thus, the current evidence in the literature does not support the goals set by the JNC-8 guidelines. In this review we discussed the strengths and limitations of both lines of evidence and why it takes an evidence-based medication to reduce CV events/mortality (eg, how a goal blood pressure is achieved is more important than getting to the goal). As medications inherently cause side effects and come at a cost to the patient, the practice of evidence-based medicine becomes exceedingly important. Although the majority of HTN studies claim great advantages by lowering HBP, this review finds severe conflicts in the findings among the various HTN studies, as well as serious epistemological, methodological and statistical problems that cast doubt to such claims.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^c202a50b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the third update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (systolic/diastolic 135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 mmHg to 160mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, we used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 mmHg to 160 mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs that involved 9595 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Six of seven RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. We also considered other issues, such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined, to downgrade the certainty of the evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 7 studies, 9595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure (CHF)) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 3 studies, 801 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.77 mmHg, 95% CI -12.82 to -4.73; 7 studies, 8657 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets at one year were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.23; 7 studies, 8699 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^f5529cae]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension and blood pressure management — screening and diagnosis in diabetes states that blood pressure should be measured at every routine clinical visit, or at least every 6 months; individuals with elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure 120–129 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg) should have repeat measurements including on a separate day to diagnose hypertension; hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mmHg based on an average of two or more measurements on two or more occasions; individuals with blood pressure ≥ 180/110 mmHg and cardiovascular disease could be diagnosed with hypertension at a single visit.

### How well do clinic-based blood pressure measurements agree with the mercury standard? [^0f916a76]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Obtaining accurate blood pressure (BP) readings is a challenge faced by health professionals. Clinical trials implement strict protocols, whereas clinical practices and studies that assess quality of care utilize a less rigorous protocol for BP measurement.

Objective

To examine agreement between real-time clinic-based assessment of BP and the standard mercury assessment of BP.

Design

Prospective reliability study.

Patients

One hundred patients with an International Classification of Diseases-9th edition code for hypertension were enrolled.

Measures

Two BP measurements were obtained with the Hawksley random-zero mercury sphygmomanometer and averaged. The clinic-based BP was extracted from the computerized medical records.

Results

Agreement between the mercury and clinic-based systolic blood pressure (SBP) was good, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83 to 0.94); the agreement for the mercury and clinic-based diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was satisfactory, ICC = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62 to 0.86). Overall, clinic-based readings overestimated the mercury readings, with a mean overestimation of 8.3 mmHg for SBP and 7.1 mmHg for DBP. Based on the clinic-based measure, 21% of patients were misdiagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension.

Conclusions

Health professionals should be aware of this potential difference when utilizing clinic-based BP values for making treatment decisions and/or assessing quality of care.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^2d0920e1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) 2024 — progestin-only contraceptives (implants, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate [DMPA], and progestin-only pills [POP]) for hypertension: Adequately controlled hypertension — implant 1, DMPA 2, POP 1; elevated blood pressure (properly taken measurements) i. systolic 140–159 mm Hg or diastolic 90–99 mm Hg — implant 1, DMPA 2, POP 1; ii. systolic ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 100 mm Hg — implant 2, DMPA 3, POP 2; vascular disease — implant 2, DMPA 3, POP 2; and history of high blood pressure during pregnancy (when current blood pressure is measurable and normal) — implant 1, DMPA 1, POP 1. Clarifications state classifications are based on the assumption that no other risk factors exist for cardiovascular disease, that risk might increase when multiple risk factors exist, and that a single blood pressure reading is not sufficient to classify a person as hypertensive; they also note that persons adequately treated for hypertension are at lower risk for acute myocardial infarction and stroke than untreated persons. Evidence notes limited evidence suggests that among women with hypertension, those who used POPs or progestin-only injectables had a small increased risk for cardiovascular events compared with nonusers, and a comment highlights concern about hypoestrogenic effects and reduced HDL levels with DMPA, with little concern about these effects for POPs and that DMPA effects might persist after discontinuation. The table also states that systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg are associated with increased risk for adverse health events as a result of pregnancy.

Exposure and Covariate Assessment

Seated blood pressure measurements were taken after a 5‐minute rest using a random‐zero sphygmomanometer; the mean of the second and third readings from the baseline examination was used for analysis. We used the 2014 Guidelines for the Management of High Blood Pressure from the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) to identify participants with blood pressure above goal: for participants aged ≥ 60 years, SBP ≥ 150 mm Hg or a DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg; for participants aged < 60, SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or a DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg. 18 All study participants with blood pressure levels below goal were classified as unexposed, irrespective of medication use or history of hypertension, as they were ineligible for interventions targeted to populations with blood pressure above goal (Figure 1). Antihypertensive medication use, race, age, and gender were assessed at study baseline.

Contemporary race‐specific weighted proportions of unaware, untreated, and uncontrolled blood pressure above goal in whites (n = 1494, 11.9% blood pressure above goal: 40% unaware; 14% untreated; 46% uncontrolled) and African Americans (n = 1004, 26.4% blood pressure above goal: 20% unaware; 22% untreated; 58% uncontrolled) 45 to 64 years of age were estimated from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2009–12). Individuals with hypertension who were aware and treated to JNC 8 treatment goals were not included in the intervention group (Figure 1).

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in older adults [^63f63e9b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in older adults attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) less than 160 mmHg. Collectively these trials demonstrated benefit for treatment, as compared to no treatment, for an older adult with BP greater than 160 mmHg. However an even lower BP target of less than 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. At the present time it is not known whether a lower or higher BP target is associated with better cardiovascular outcomes in older adults.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a higher (less than 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg) BP target compared to the lower BP target of less than 140/90 mmHg in hypertensive adults 65 years of age or older.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials, of at least one year's duration, conducted on hypertensive adults aged 65 years or older, which report the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher systolic or diastolic BP treatment target (whether ambulatory, home, or office measurements) in the range of systolic BP less than 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP less than 95 to 105 mmHg as compared to a lower BP treatment target of less than 140/90 mmHg or lower.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and for continuous outcomes we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and cardiovascular serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved.

Main Results

We found and included three unblinded randomised trials in 8221 older adults (mean age 74.8 years), in which higher BP targets of less than 150/90 mmHg (two trials) and less than 160/90 mmHg (one trial) were compared to a lower target of less than 140/90 mmHg. Treatment to the two different BP targets over two to four years failed to produce a difference in any of our primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality (RR 1.24 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54), stroke (RR 1.25 95% CI 0.94 to 1.67) and total cardiovascular serious adverse events (RR 1.19 95% CI 0.98 to 1.45). However, the 95% confidence intervals of these outcomes suggest the lower BP target is probably not worse, and might offer a clinically important benefit. We judged all comparisons to be based on low-quality evidence. Data on adverse effects were not available from all trials and not different, including total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

At the present time there is insufficient evidence to know whether a higher BP target (less than150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg) or a lower BP target (less than 140/90 mmHg) is better for older adults with high BP. Additional good-quality trials assessing BP targets in this population are needed.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^2f831b3f]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 evidence characterization for targeting SBP < 120 mm Hg in CKD explains that this lower SBP target is based on cardiorenoprotective, survival, and potential cognitive benefits, yet there are no new data supporting renoprotective benefits and overall kidney-protection evidence at this level is almost non-existent. The guideline notes that evidence for the SBP target of < 120 mm Hg is less rigorous and risk–benefit ratios are less certain in subpopulations including those with diabetes, advanced CKD (G4 and G5), significant proteinuria, very low diastolic blood pressure, "white-coat" hypertension, and extreme ages, and states that management for these patients should be decided or tailored by treating practitioners.

### Current diagnosis and management of hypertensive emergency [^6958f478]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

The appropriate and timely evaluation and treatment of patients with severely elevated blood pressure is essential to avoid serious adverse outcomes. Most importantly, the distinction between a hypertensive emergency (crisis) and urgency needs to be made. A sudden elevation in systolic (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that is associated with acute end organ damage (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or renal) is defined as a hypertensive crisis or emergency. In contrast, acute elevation in SBP and/or DBP not associated with evidence of end organ damage is defined as hypertensive urgency. In patients with a hypertensive emergency, blood pressure control should be attained as expeditiously as possible with parenteral medications to prevent ongoing and potentially permanent end organ damage. In contrast, with hypertensive urgency, blood pressure control can be achieved with the use of oral medications within 24–48 hours. This paper reviews the management of hypertensive emergencies.

### Level of systolic blood pressure within the normal range and risk of recurrent stroke [^d963694a]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Context

Recurrent stroke prevention guidelines suggest that larger reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) are positively associated with a greater reduction in the risk of recurrent stroke and define an SBP level of less than 120 mm Hg as normal. However, the association of SBP maintained at such levels with risk of vascular events after a recent ischemic stroke is unclear.

Objective

To assess the association of maintaining low-normal vs high-normal SBP levels with risk of recurrent stroke.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Post hoc observational analysis of a multicenter trial involving 20,330 patients (age ≥ 50 years) with recent non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke; patients were recruited from 695 centers in 35 countries from September 2003 through July 2006 and followed up for 2.5 years (follow-up ended on February 8, 2008). Patients were categorized based on their mean SBP level: very low-normal (< 120 mm Hg), low-normal (120- < 130 mm Hg), high-normal (130- < 140 mm Hg), high (140- < 150 mm Hg), and very high (≥ 150 mm Hg).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was first recurrence of stroke of any type and the secondary outcome was a composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from vascular causes.

Results

The recurrent stroke rates were 8.0% (95% CI, 6.8%-9.2%) for the very low-normal SBP level group, 7.2% (95% CI, 6.4%-8.0%) for the low-normal SBP group, 6.8% (95% CI, 6.1%-7.4%) for the high-normal SBP group, 8.7% (95% CI, 7.9%-9.5%) for the high SBP group, and 14.1% (95% CI, 13.0%-15.2%) for the very high SBP group. Compared with patients in the high-normal SBP group, the risk of the primary outcome was higher for patients in the very low-normal SBP group (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.29; 95% CI, 1.07–1.56), in the high SBP group (AHR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07–1.41), and in the very high SBP group (AHR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.83–2.37). Compared with patients in the high-normal SBP group, the risk of secondary outcome was higher for patients in the very low-normal SBP group (AHR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.13–1.52), in the low-normal SBP group (AHR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03–1.31), in the high SBP group (AHR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.11–1.39), and in the very high SBP group (AHR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.74–2.16).

Conclusion

Among patients with recent non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke, SBP levels during follow-up in the very low-normal (< 120 mm Hg), high (140- < 150 mm Hg), or very high (≥ 150 mm Hg) range were associated with increased risk of recurrent stroke.

### Under pressure: treatment of acute severe hypertension (hypertensive crisis) [^c161b883]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute severe hypertension encompasses a spectrum of severe blood pressure elevations that can progress to end organ damage if left unmanaged. Understanding the presentations of various acute hypertensive scenarios can help guide interventional radiologists in recognizing clinical symptoms, signs, and selecting effective management strategies. The timely administration of antihypertensive agents is critical to prevent the detrimental effects associated with hypertensive emergencies. The preferred approach to achieve optimal blood pressure control and the desired target blood pressure range may vary based on the hypertensive scenario and patient-specific factors.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^a4680c5c]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^4f35fad6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

CDC U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria 2024 — combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC): For hypertension, adequately controlled hypertension is category 3; for elevated blood pressure levels, category 3 applies to systolic 140–159 mm Hg or diastolic 90–99 mm Hg, and category 4 applies to systolic ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 100 mm Hg; vascular disease is category 4. The section notes systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg are associated with increased pregnancy-related risk, classifications assume no other cardiovascular risk factors and a single reading is insufficient to classify hypertension; evidence indicates COC users with hypertension were at higher risk than nonusers for stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease, and discontinuation might improve blood pressure control.
