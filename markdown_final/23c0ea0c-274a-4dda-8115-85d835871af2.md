## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a KUB radiograph can show small bowel obstruction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a KUB can actually depict in SBO and the classic signs to look for. Then, I should verify its diagnostic accuracy and limitations compared with CT. Next, I will review contemporary guidelines to ensure current best practice. After that, I need to consider special roles for water-soluble contrast and when, if ever, KUB meaningfully contributes. Finally, I will synthesize a bottom-line recommendation that is clinically actionable and evidence-based.

> Let me first confirm what a KUB can show in suspected SBO. On plain abdominal radiography, classic signs include dilated small-bowel loops (typically > 3 cm), multiple air–fluid levels on upright or decubitus views, paucity of colonic gas, and the "string of pearls" sign representing small pockets of air trapped between valvulae in fluid-filled, dilated bowel; however, supine films alone can miss air–fluid levels and fluid-predominant loops, so obtaining an upright or decubitus view matters for sensitivity [^111rryqn] [^116ws9Fc] [^116xqD16].

> Wait, let me verify the test characteristics before I draw conclusions about usefulness. Contemporary position statements summarize that plain radiography for SBO has only about 60–70% sensitivity and specificity, meaning a substantial false-negative and false-positive rate; it is complementary at best and often nondiagnostic, especially when bowel is fluid-filled or when the obstruction is partial or intermittent [^116WAVtH] [^111rryqn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review guideline evolution because practice has shifted. High-credibility WSES 2018 guidance recommends avoiding routine abdominal X-rays in the SBO work-up given limited value and to proceed instead with CT, whereas older Bologna guidance (2011/2013) had advocated plain films as an initial step; EAST recommends obtaining CT for all patients with suspected SBO, and ACR Appropriateness Criteria similarly prioritize CT over plain radiography, even though real-world audits still show frequent pre-CT plain films [^114wNzTP] [^114oJRNW] [^11769Xvp] [^111PWk9T] [^112P1uUM].

> I need to check key limitations so I do not overstate what KUB can do. Plain films cannot reliably identify the cause of obstruction (adhesions versus hernia versus mass), cannot assess ischemia or strangulation, and may appear near normal when loops are fluid-filled or obstruction is low grade; in addition, while typically lower dose than CT, contemporary KUB series often involve multiple images with nontrivial cumulative radiation exposure, which further weakens the case for routine use when CT provides decisive information [^116WAVtH] [^116xqD16] [^111rryqn] [^114Eu6zU].

> Next, I should review the comparative strengths of CT so the management pathway is coherent. Multidetector CT confirms obstruction, localizes the transition point, suggests the etiology with high accuracy in modern series, and detects complications such as closed-loop obstruction and ischemia; WSES and EAST emphasize CT as the primary modality because it changes management by stratifying who needs urgent surgery versus a trial of nonoperative care, with modern data showing approximately 87–90% accuracy for etiology and high performance for predicting strangulation and need for urgent surgery [^114wqWzC] [^112mRChz] [^114oJRNW].

> But wait, what if CT is not immediately available or we are assessing nonoperative progress? Water-soluble contrast protocols have diagnostic and prognostic value: when contrast reaches the colon within 4–24 hours, nonoperative resolution is very likely, whereas failure to reach the colon strongly predicts failure of conservative management; EAST also supports a contrast challenge after 48 hours if no improvement to help triage ongoing nonoperative care versus surgery, acknowledging both the prognostic and potential therapeutic effects described in the literature [^116WAVtH] [^116U7Dsr] [^111GPdXD].

> Let me consider the practical niche for KUB so recommendations are balanced. While KUB can show classic SBO signs and can be used to track passage of water-soluble contrast at 12–24 hours in protocols where CT has already defined anatomy, it should not be relied upon to make or exclude the diagnosis or to risk-stratify for ischemia; in resource-limited settings or when CT is temporarily unavailable, an upright or decubitus KUB may provide supportive evidence, but definitive imaging should be obtained when feasible, especially given the radiation considerations even with multi-image KUB series [^111rryqn] [^116WAVtH] [^11769Xvp] [^114Eu6zU].

> In summary, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with guidelines and data. Yes, a KUB can show features of small bowel obstruction — dilated loops, air–fluid levels, and the "string of pearls" — but its diagnostic accuracy is modest and it cannot define etiology or complications; current evidence-based practice is to avoid routine KUB and to use contrast-enhanced CT as the modality of choice, reserving KUB for limited scenarios or as part of a water-soluble contrast protocol when CT is not immediately available or has already set the course of management [^116WAVtH] [^114wNzTP] [^112mRChz].

No, KUB cannot reliably diagnose small bowel obstruction (SBO) because it has **limited sensitivity and specificity** [^116WAVtH] and cannot identify the cause or complications [^114wNzTP]. KUB may show nonspecific findings such as dilated loops or air-fluid levels [^116ws9Fc], but these are often inconclusive or missed, especially in early or partial obstruction [^111rryqn]. CT is the **preferred imaging** [^114oJRNW] for suspected SBO because it accurately detects obstruction, localizes the transition point, identifies the cause [^114wqWzC], and detects complications like ischemia or perforation [^116xqD16]. KUB is not recommended as a first-line test for SBO and should only be used when CT is unavailable or contraindicated [^11769Xvp] [^114wNzTP].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of KUB for SBO

KUB has **limited diagnostic accuracy** for SBO, with sensitivity and specificity around 60–70% [^116WAVtH]. Nor can it reliably identify the cause, severity, or complications such as ischemia or perforation [^114wNzTP]. It may show dilated loops, air-fluid levels, or absence of colonic gas [^116ws9Fc], but these findings are nonspecific and can be missed, particularly in early or partial obstruction [^111rryqn].

---

## Limitations of KUB in diagnosing SBO

KUB has several **significant limitations** in diagnosing SBO:

- **Limited sensitivity and specificity**: Approximately 60–70%, leading to false negatives and positives [^116WAVtH] [^116QJvaG].
- **Inability to identify cause**: Cannot determine the underlying cause or severity of obstruction [^114wNzTP] [^114oJRNW].
- **Inability to detect complications**: Cannot reliably identify ischemia, perforation, or other complications [^114wNzTP] [^111kdrKV].
- **Radiation exposure**: Repeated KUBs increase radiation exposure, particularly concerning in children [^113ztGtS] [^114Eu6zU].

---

## Comparison with other imaging modalities

CT is the **preferred imaging modality** [^114oJRNW] for suspected SBO, with sensitivity and specificity of 90–95% [^11769Xvp]. It accurately identifies the presence, location, and cause of obstruction and detects complications such as ischemia or perforation [^113Ewzaq] [^111kdrKV]. Ultrasound and MRI are alternatives when CT is contraindicated, but they have logistical limitations and lower accuracy [^115y4Bkk] [^1125Pa6C].

| **Attribute** | **KUB** | **CT** | **Ultrasound** | **MRI** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Sensitivity | 60–70% | 90–95% | Variable | High |
| Specificity | 60–70% | 90–95% | Variable | High |
| Advantages | - Quick <br/> - Widely available | - High accuracy <br/> - Identifies cause and complications | - No radiation <br/> - Bedside | - No radiation <br/> - High soft-tissue contrast |
| Limitations | - Limited accuracy <br/> - Cannot identify cause or complications [^116WAVtH] [^114wNzTP] | - Radiation exposure <br/> - Contrast risks [^114oJRNW] [^11769Xvp] | - Operator-dependent <br/> - Limited by bowel gas [^115y4Bkk] | - Limited availability <br/> - Longer scan time [^115y4Bkk] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend CT as the **preferred imaging modality** for suspected SBO due to its high accuracy and ability to identify complications [^114oJRNW] [^113Ewzaq] [^11769Xvp]. KUB is not recommended as a first-line diagnostic tool for SBO, and its use should be limited to situations in which CT is unavailable or contraindicated [^114wNzTP] [^11769Xvp].

---

## Clinical scenarios where KUB may still be useful

Despite its limitations, KUB may still be useful in certain clinical scenarios:

- **Initial screening**: Rapid initial screening in resource-limited settings where CT is unavailable [^116ws9Fc].
- **Follow-up imaging**: Monitoring progression or resolution of obstruction in stable patients [^112mRChz].
- **Contraindications to CT**: Patients with severe contrast allergies or pregnancy [^115y4Bkk].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

KUB has **limited diagnostic accuracy** for SBO and cannot reliably identify the cause or complications. CT is the **preferred imaging modality** for suspected SBO because it is highly accurate and identifies complications [^111HsoMn] [^114oJRNW]. KUB should only be used when CT is unavailable or contraindicated [^11769Xvp].

### Diagnosis and management of small bowel obstruction in virgin abdomen: A WSES position paper [^116WAVtH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal plain radiography is still used as first-line imaging for a patient suspected of having a small bowel obstruction (SBO), though its diagnostic value specifically in patients with virgin abdomen (SBO-VA) has not been discussed in the literature. Despite its use, plain radiography has limited value and is mostly complementary to the initial clinical assessment, with a sensitivity and specificity for SBO of approximately 60–70%. Furthermore, plain X-rays do not provide additional information about the etiology of the obstruction or the necessity for emergency surgery.

Water-soluble contrast agents (WSCA) imaging has an established role in the management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) when a CT scan is not needed. WSCA has both prognostic and potential therapeutic value in managing patients with small bowel obstruction. Several studies have indicated promising results for ASBO management. The presence of contrast in the colon within 4–24 hours after administration had a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 98% for predicting resolution of SBO with conservative therapy. If contrast does not reach the colon on an abdominal X-ray taken 24 hours post-administration, it strongly indicates failure of non-operative management.

Only two studies have reported on the use of WSCA imaging in SBO-VA. Collom et al. found that WSCA was used less frequently in patients with SBO-VA (35.6%) compared to those with SBO after previous surgery (52.2%). This discrepancy might be explained by the inability to assume an adhesive etiology in SBO-VA, necessitating the use of a CT scan for further evaluation.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for small bowel obstruction, particularly in relation to abdominal CT, the EAST 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis for all patients with SBO. This is because a CT scan can provide additional information over abdominal X-rays, helping to differentiate the grade, severity, and etiology of SBO, which may subsequently lead to changes in management strategies.

### Small bowel obstruction: The role of computed tomography in its diagnosis and management with reference to other imaging modalities [^116xqD16]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a leading cause of acute surgical admissions for abdominal pain. There is an increasing tendency for initial conservative management rather than immediate operative intervention, as a proportion of cases will resolve spontaneously. This has resulted in a growing reliance on radiological investigations to reassure the surgeon that medical therapy can be safely instituted.

The onus therefore rests with radiologists to guide their surgical colleagues by correctly interpreting the plain abdominal radiograph and suggesting appropriate further investigation if warranted. Recently, computed tomography (CT) has been proposed as the test of choice to define the level and cause of acute small bowel obstruction and to identify complications such as ischaemia and perforation, which will prompt surgical intervention. This review will discuss the utility of early CT in the diagnosis of acute small bowel obstruction and outline its impact on patient management.

However, no randomized controlled trial comparing open to laparoscopic adhesiolysis exists at the time of writing, and both the precise indications and specific outcomes of laparoscopic adhesiolysis for adhesive SBO remain poorly understood. The only RCT on laparoscopic adhesiolysis assessed the incidence of chronic abdominal pain after randomization to laparoscopic adhesiolysis or no treatment during diagnostic laparoscopy, and it failed to demonstrate any significant differences in terms of pain or discomfort.

Data from a retrospective clinical controlled trial suggest that laparoscopy seems feasible and better in terms of hospital stay and mortality reduction.

- **Retrospective analysis by Grafen et al**: Compared the outcomes of laparoscopic management of ASBO to both exploratory laparotomy and secondary conversion to open surgery. 93 patients were divided into successful laparoscopy (71%), secondary conversion (26%), and primary laparotomy (3%). The first group had more simple adhesions, fewer prior operations, lower ASA score, shortest operative time, and shorter duration of both intensive care unit and hospital stay. Moreover, they were younger and had a shorter duration of SBO prior to their operation. Despite this, mortality was 6%, regardless of operative technique. The authors found that patients who had only undergone prior appendectomy or cholecystectomy could all be managed laparoscopically without the need for secondary conversion. On the other hand, a prolonged ileus (mean 4.3 days) with progressive abdominal distension and a higher number or more demanding previous operations were associated with a higher likelihood of conversion.

### A systematic review of outcomes reported in small bowel obstruction research [^117G2eah]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a condition commonly treated by general surgeons. The evidence base for treating this condition is limited in part by the variable reporting of outcomes in the literature. The aim of this study was to identify commonly used outcomes in research on SBO.

- **Methods**: This review was reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017065538). Searches were performed of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify prospective cohort or randomized trials reporting outcomes of interventions in SBO. Studies addressing diagnostics, pediatric populations, and SBO due to malignancy were excluded. Studies were screened for inclusion. Study and outcome characteristics were extracted into a predesigned pro forma and mapped onto the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) framework.

- **Results**: A total of 1222 studies were screened for eligibility, 74 full-text articles were retrieved, and 51 studies were included for synthesis. A total of 50 different outcomes were used. Duration of hospital stay was the most frequently reported outcome (n = 21 studies). Resolution of SBO was reported in 12 studies but only defined in eight studies, which used six different definitions. Patient-reported outcomes were reported in only four studies.

- **Conclusions**: There is a high degree of variation in the outcomes reported in SBO research. There is a clear need for a core outcome set and the development of a patient-reported outcome measure.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO Working Group [^112mRChz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Helical CT scans not only have good test characteristics for diagnosing small bowel obstruction but also have approximately 90% accuracy in predicting strangulation and the need for urgent surgery. The diagnostic value of the CT scan can be enhanced with the use of water-soluble contrast. As with water-soluble contrast studies, the progress of the contrast can be evaluated by X-ray at 24 hours after the CT scan.

Although adhesions are not directly visible even on a CT scan, it can accurately differentiate between different causes of bowel obstruction by excluding other causes. The working group, therefore, considers the CT scan to be the preferred imaging technique if there is any doubt about the diagnosis of ASBO and to assess the need for urgent surgery.

A CT scan should help to differentiate between a complete obstruction of the bowel and assist in the decision for a trial of non-operative management versus proceeding to surgery. It may also help to define the location of the obstruction (e.g. high in the jejunum or deep in the pelvis). Signs of a closed loop, bowel ischemia, and free fluid are indicators that suggest the need for surgery without delay. Additionally, radiological and clinical scores can be used to predict the need for surgery as described above.

- **Ultrasound and MRI**: Although the working group considered the CT scan to be the preferred technique for the diagnosis of ASBO, ultrasound and MRI might be useful in specific situations. Ultrasound is operator-dependent but, in experienced hands, can provide more information than plain X-rays.

### Predictive value of signs and symptoms for small bowel obstruction in patients with prior surgery [^117W2f66]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of various signs and symptoms for small bowel obstruction (SBO) in patients with prior abdominal surgery. This was a secondary analysis of a previously reported prospective study of ultrasonography for SBO. Patients with prior abdominal surgery were identified, and presenting signs and symptoms were compared to the CT diagnosis of SBO.

- **Results**: No signs or symptoms were predictive of SBO.

- **Conclusion**: No constellation of signs and symptoms can be used to reliably exclude an SBO in patients with prior abdominal surgery.

### Small bowel obstruction in the emergency department: MDCT features of common and uncommon causes [^113me3nM]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a common condition encountered by radiologists in the emergency department. While intestinal adhesions and obstructed hernias are the most common causes of acute small bowel obstruction, various uncommon and rare conditions can also cause acute and subacute bowel obstruction. Imaging plays a key role in the workup of bowel obstruction by identifying the cause, level, and degree of bowel obstruction. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of the multi-detector computed tomography features of common and uncommon causes of acute and subacute small bowel obstruction.

### Small bowel obstruction: Computed tomography features and pitfalls [^111kdrKV]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) has become established as an ideal form of imaging in small bowel obstruction (SBO), especially with modern-day multiplanar imaging that is now widely available. CT can confirm the presence of SBO, show the site, level, and cause of obstruction accurately, and detect strangulation. It is important to recognize the common and unusual causes, but also conditions that mimic SBO. This review illustrates a spectrum of causes and discusses conditions that mimic SBO, their differentiation, and the limitations of CT in the assessment of suspected SBO.

### Multidetector-row computed tomography diagnosis of small bowel obstruction: Can coronal reformations replace axial images [^1152UiFd]. Emergency Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The feasibility of diagnosing small bowel obstruction using multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) based solely on coronal reformations is evaluated. Three radiologists, all with subspecialty training in abdominal imaging, reviewed abdominopelvic CT scans of 67 patients in consensus. Of these, 34 patients had surgically proven small bowel obstruction, while the remaining 33 had CT scans for other reasons and exhibited no intestinal obstruction. The images were displayed in either axial or coronal planes and were reviewed on separate days. Each CT scan was evaluated for the presence of small bowel obstruction and its etiology when applicable.

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: Thirty-three (100%) of the 33 patients with no intestinal obstruction were correctly diagnosed using coronal images. Likewise, all 34 patients diagnosed with small bowel obstruction were correctly identified using both axial and coronal images.
- **Discrepancies in etiology**: In five patients, the final surgical diagnosis for the etiology of small bowel obstruction did not align with the interpretation from either coronal or axial images. However, interpretations of both sets of images were similar among these patients.
- **Ease of review**: Radiologists observed approximately 20% fewer images in the coronal reformation data set and found these images easier for localizing the zone of transition in small bowel obstruction.

In one case, the etiology of small bowel obstruction based on coronal images differed from both axial images and the surgical results, although the obstruction site was correctly identified. Overall, very high diagnostic accuracy was noted.

### Improving the management of acute adhesive small bowel obstruction with CT-scan and water-soluble contrast medium: a prospective study [^111Vsy3B]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2009). Low credibility.

Adhesive small bowel obstruction is usually managed non-operatively, but there is still debate over the optimal duration of non-operative management and the factors that predict the failure of medical treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate an algorithm using CT-scans and Gastrografin in the management of small bowel obstruction.

- **Methods**: In this prospective study, each patient admitted for small bowel obstruction underwent a physical examination, a plain film, and a CT-scan evaluation. Patients underwent emergency surgical exploration when bowel ischemia was suspected. Other patients received oral Gastrografin, and a second plain abdominal radiograph was done after 12 hours. In patients with clinical improvement, the nasogastric tube was removed, and an immediate liquid diet was resumed. Other patients were referred for surgery.

- **Results**: In total, 118 patients with 123 episodes of small bowel obstruction were included. Thirty-six (29%) required immediate surgery because they presented clinical characteristics of bowel ischemia (36/36; 100%) or a defect in vascularization of the small bowel on CT-scan (5/36; 14%). The 87 remaining patients were managed non-operatively, of which 28 deteriorated and were referred for surgery. The 59 other patients showed clinical improvement.

- **Conclusion**: This study demonstrated the diagnostic role of Gastrografin® in discriminating between partial and complete small bowel obstruction. CT-scans were disappointing in their ability to predict the necessity of emergent laparotomies. We therefore recommend the use of Gastrografin® in managing small bowel obstructions.

Based on the etiologic findings in the presented studies, fear of the previously assumed high rate of malignancies is not justified. As a consequence, the need to perform surgical exploration in every patient with SBO-VA can also be waived. Nevertheless, non-invasive diagnostics with high accuracy for detection of malignancy or follow-up is mandatory, as approximately one in ten cases of SBO-VA is still caused by malignancy.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO Working Group [^116ws9Fc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

After an accurate physical examination and the evaluation of WBC, lactate, electrolytes, and BUN/creat, the first step of the diagnostic workup for ASBO is a supine and erect plain abdominal X-ray. This can show multiple air-fluid levels, distension of small bowel loops, and the absence of gas in the colonic section. All patients being evaluated for small bowel obstruction should have plain films (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C).

- **Secondary evaluation**: A CT scan is highly diagnostic in SBO and holds great value for patients with inconclusive plain films for complete or high-grade SBO. However, CT scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process unless clinical history, physical examination, and plain films are inconclusive for a small bowel obstruction diagnosis (Level of Evidence 2b GoR B). CT scans often confirm the presence of a complete obstruction, help diagnose the cause of SBO, exclude non-adhesional pathology, and assess the occurrence of strangulation with a sensitivity and specificity higher than 90% and a NPV of nearly 100%. The association of CT scan signs of bowel ischemia should lead to a low threshold for surgical intervention (Level of Evidence 2a GoR B).

- **Ultrasound**: Ultrasound has limited value in bowel obstruction or in patients with a distended bowel, as air may obscure underlying findings. Usual US findings include distention, peristalsis (differential diagnosis of ileus vs. mechanical SBO), differences in mucosal folds around the transition point, and free fluid as a sign of ischemia.

MRI use should be restricted.

### Can radiographers be trained to triage CT colonography for extracolonic findings [^116rMfXj]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The learning curves for case sensitivity in E3 and E4 for individual radiographers and the combined group of eight radiographers are illustrated in Figure 2a–d. Specificity learning curves are depicted in Figure 2e, f, and reading time curves in Figure 2g, h. The ROC plot demonstrates that as the proportion of true positives (sensitivity) increases, the proportion of false positives also rises (Figure 3).

- **Learning curves for radiographers**:
	- a. Average sensitivity for E3 cases
	- b. Sensitivity for radiographers individually
	- c. Average sensitivity for E4 cases
	- d. Sensitivity for radiographers individually
	- e. Average specificity
	- f. Specificity for radiographers individually
	- g. Average reading time
	- h. Reading time for radiographers individually

- **ROC space**:
	- The ROC space for radiographers shows the average proportion of true positives (sensitivity) for E3 and E4 combined versus the average percentage of false-positive cases without E3 and E4 lesions. Each point in the ROC space corresponds to a time point in the learning curve, where 1 indicates the first time point and 12 the last.

In triaging E3 cases, a significant positive learning effect was observed in three radiographers. Additionally, for E3 and E4 cases combined, significant learning effects were noted in two radiographers. However, when identifying E4 cases only, none of the radiographers achieved a significant learning effect. Similarly, there was no significant learning effect evident in specificity for any of the radiographers.

Table 5 (not displayed) contains the results of binary logistic regression for sensitivity in individual radiographers (E3, E4, and combined cases).

### Clinical significance of small bowel manometry patterns suggestive of intestinal obstruction [^116Mpv4N]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of small bowel manometry patterns that suggest intestinal obstruction is an area of active research. The pursuit of understanding these patterns involves various stages, from data collection to analysis and interpretation, to study design and manuscript preparation.

The process encompasses several key areas:

- **Study design**: Initial stages require meticulous planning, ensuring the study is structured to yield meaningful and accurate data.

- **Data collection and interpretation**: Data collection serves as the backbone of research, with a focus on precise and systematic gathering methodologies. Subsequent data interpretation is critical, providing insights that can inform clinical practices and decisions.

- **Data analysis**: Analyzing collected data is vital for verifying hypotheses and drawing conclusions. This stage involves rigorous statistical assessments to ensure reliability and validity.

- **Manuscript preparation**: The final step is the synthesis of findings into a coherent manuscript that communicates the study's outcomes and significance to the broader scientific community.

This comprehensive process, with contributions from various researchers, ensures a thorough investigation of the relevance of small bowel manometry patterns in clinical practice.

### Correlation of ureteral stone measurements by CT and plain film radiography: Utility of the KUB [^113rr6dh]. Journal of Endourology (2003). Low credibility.

The practice of utilizing helical CT to evaluate patients suspected of renal colic is increasing. Little is known about the accuracy of CT in estimating stone size or the utility of an accompanying plain abdominal radiograph (KUB film). The purpose of our study was to compare ureteral stone size estimation by helical CT and plain film and determine whether a KUB film provides additional information useful in patient management.

- **Patients and methods**: Thirty consecutive patients (17 male, 13 female) having both a helical CT and a KUB study for evaluation of renal colic secondary to ureteral calculi comprised the study population. Calculus number, location, and dimensions were determined from these images. Stone dimensions were measured using electronic calipers on a picture archiving and communications system. Information found by KUB and CT was compared, and both sets of stone measurements were correlated with patient outcome.

- **Results**: The mean maximal stone transverse diameter and length were similar on CT and plain film: 5.8 mm v 5.8 mm and 9.5 mm v 8.9 mm, respectively (P = 0.57 and 0.29, respectively). The mean anteroposterior stone diameter on CT of 6.8 mm was statistically greater than the transverse diameter as measured by both CT and KUB, which were 5.8 mm and 5.8 mm (P = 0.0002 and 0.0007, respectively). Eleven patients spontaneously passed their stones, while 19 patients required intervention. Patient outcome, as predicted by transverse stone width, was similar for CT and KUB data.

Conclusions

### Computed tomography patterns in small bowel obstruction after open distal gastric bypass [^114fewyU]. Obesity Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Life-threatening small bowel obstruction (SBO) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can present with surprisingly minimal laboratory and plain x-ray findings. Based on a 10-year (1994–2003) experience of 1,409 open distal gastric bypasses, we present clinical and radiological findings in 29 patients with unusual forms of bowel obstruction.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was conducted. A radiologist, experienced in reviewing these cases in gastric bypass patients, examined all computed tomography (CT) scans.

- **Results**: CT findings revealed the normal appearance and seven recurring patterns of small bowel obstruction. These include: 1) intussusception, 2) internal hernia through Petersen's space, 3) hernia through Petersen's space and the mesenteric defect at enteroenterostomy, 4) hernia through the mesenteric defect from the entero-enterostomy, 5) isolated biliary limb obstruction, 6) segmental non-anastomotic ischemia, and 7) internal hernia through bands.

- **Clinical findings**: One patient had peritonitis, and another had free air on plain film. The white blood cell (WBC) count was normal in 20 out of 27 patients (74%), including 5 out of 6 (83%) who had dead bowel. Nine out of fourteen patients (62%) had "non-specific" findings on x-rays. Among these, seven had an internal hernia (two also had volvulus and two had dead bowel), one had biliopancreatic limb obstruction, and one had peritonitis.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with SBO after distal gastric bypass may present with vague complaints and confusing laboratory and non-specific findings on x-rays. Delayed diagnosis can have catastrophic consequences. CT imaging with oral and intravenous contrast can be life-saving.

### Applying deep-learning algorithm interpreting kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) X-rays to detect colon cancer [^115vWKEs]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Early screening is crucial in reducing the mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). Screening methods, including fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) and colonoscopy, are primarily limited by low patient compliance and the invasive nature of the procedures. Several advanced imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) and histological imaging, have been integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the detection of CRC. However, there are still limitations due to challenges associated with image acquisition and cost. Kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) radiographs, which are inexpensive and widely used for abdominal assessments in emergency settings, show potential for detecting CRC when enhanced using advanced techniques.

This study aimed to develop a deep learning model (DLM) to detect CRC using KUB radiographs. This retrospective study was conducted using data from the Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGH) between January 2011 and December 2020, including patients with at least one KUB radiograph. Patients were divided into development (n = 28,055), tuning (n = 11,234), and internal validation (n = 16,875) sets. An additional 15,876 patients were collected from a community hospital as the external validation set.

A 121-layer DenseNet convolutional network was trained to classify KUB images for CRC detection. The model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves, with sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) as metrics. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the DLM in the internal and external validation sets were measured.

### Multimodality imaging training curriculum - parts II and III [^116duRUH]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

The multimodality imaging training curriculum provides comprehensive insights into the application of various imaging techniques in diagnosing and managing diseases.

- **Biliary tract and parenchymal solid organ disease**: Understanding the role of ultrasound and identifying relevant ultrasound features is crucial in diagnosing biliary and parenchymal solid organ diseases (BK).

- **Primary and secondary tumours**: Identifying imaging features and the differential diagnosis of primary and secondary tumors affecting solid organs, as well as the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, colon, and rectum is vital (DK).

- **Stage and extent of tumors**: Recognizing imaging features that indicate the stage and extent of tumors, including features of unresectability, and understanding the role of endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound (US) is necessary (DK).

- **Inflammatory bowel diseases and malabsorption**: Recognizing the radiological manifestations of inflammatory bowel diseases, malabsorption syndrome, and infection is essential (BK).

- **Motility disorders and diverticula**: Recognition and understanding of motility disorders, hernias, and diverticula are key components (BK).

- **Vascular lesions**: Radiological identification of vascular lesions, including varices, ischemia, infarction, hemorrhage, and vascular malformations, is essential for comprehensive study (BK).

- **Introduction to CT colonoscopy**: Understanding the role of CT colonoscopy plays an important role in diagnostic imaging (BK).

- **Vascular imaging techniques**: Insight into angiography, vascular interventional techniques, stenting, and portosystemic decompression procedures is crucial for advanced practice (BK).

- **Liver diseases**: Addressing tumors, infectious, and degenerative lesions in the liver emphasizes diagnostic prowess (DK).

- **CT management and reporting**: Skills in managing and reporting CT of the abdomen are fundamental (CS).

- **Abdominal disease on MRI**: Experience with abdominal disease manifestations on MRI is advantageous for comprehensive training (CS).

- **Urogenital System**:

- **Renal function and diseases**: Understanding renal function, diagnosing renal parenchymal diseases including infection and renovascular disease, and managing renal failure are critical areas of study (BK).

- **Calculus disease**: Investigation of imaging features and appropriate measures for calculus disease plays a pivotal role (BK).

- **Urinary tract obstruction and reflux**: Knowledgeable investigation and recognition of urinary tract obstruction and reflux are required (BK).

- **Kidney and urinary tract tumors**: Identifying imaging features and differential diagnoses of tumors in the kidney and urinary tract is necessary (DK).

- **Retroperitoneum diseases**: Recognizing imaging features and differential diagnoses of diseases related to the retroperitoneum enriches the curriculum.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^114vy2ZH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). High credibility.

An algorithm for the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the patient with ASBO is presented in Fig. 2. The initial diagnosis of ASBO is of utmost importance; failure to diagnose or having a delayed diagnosis represents 70% of malpractice claims in ASBO.

- **Algorithm to diagnosis and treatment of ASBO**: The primary goals in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected adhesive small bowel obstruction are: differentiating between ASBO and other causes of bowel obstruction, assessing the need for urgent surgical exploration, and identifying and preventing complications from bowel obstruction.

- **History taking and physical examination**: History taking in a patient suspected of ASBO includes assessment of potential causes of bowel obstruction, such as previous operations or radiotherapy, and nutritional status. Signs of dehydration should also be assessed. Traditionally, ASBO is clinically diagnosed in a patient with intermittent colicky abdominal pain, distention, and nausea (with or without vomiting), with or without the absence of stools. Although the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction is fairly certain when all these symptoms are present, there are specific pitfalls that can result in delayed or misdiagnosis. In patients with incomplete obstruction, watery diarrhea may be present, which can lead to confusion with gastroenteritis. Stools might also be present in patients with a relatively high obstructive pattern.

### An apricot story: View through a keyhole [^113SXt64]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Very few cases of small bowel obstruction due to ingested fruits have been described in the literature, and most of these have been managed by laparotomy. Laparoscopic-assisted surgery can effectively deal with such impacted foreign bodies, thereby avoiding a formal laparotomy.

- **Case presentation**: A 75-year-old lady was admitted via the Accident and Emergency to the surgical ward with a three-day history of abdominal pain and vomiting. Investigations were suggestive of acute small bowel obstruction. On laparoscopy, there was an area of sudden change in calibre of the small bowel with a dilated proximal and collapsed distal segment in the distal jejunum. A foreign body, a dried undigested apricot, was extracted by mini-laparotomy.

- **Discussion**: Small bowel obstruction is a frequent cause of emergency surgery, and its aetiology may include food bolus obstruction. Diagnosis is usually confirmed intra-operatively. A foreign body impacted in the small bowel can be removed by open or laparoscopic methods.

- **Conclusion**: Generally, laparotomy is performed for diagnosis and management in acute bowel obstruction, but with increasing expertise, laparoscopy can be equally effective with all the other advantages of a minimal access approach.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: Systematic review [^117MtE7H]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Despite this work, no model has been widely implemented, and surgeons still rely on their clinical impression combined with imaging findings, suggesting that the models lack external validity or are difficult to implement in daily practice. We aimed to facilitate model development via meta-analysis, which allows the mathematical synthesis of potential predictor variables investigated across multiple studies and centers.

At the same time, it is statistically undesirable to meta-analyze a limited number of studies unless they are very large and have sufficient outcomes. This drove our a priori decision to limit meta-analysis to variables reported in five or more individual studies. For example, several small single-center studies have suggested that water-soluble contrast follow-through (WSCFT, usually "Gastrografin") may not only diagnose the presence and site of small bowel obstruction but also have both prognostic and therapeutic implications. A 2016 meta-analysis found that WSCFT significantly reduced subsequent surgery (OR 0.55) and was 92% sensitive and 93% specific for predicting non-operative management. We particularly wished to investigate this variable since it appears to be widely implemented by surgeons in daily practice. However, we were unable to identify sufficient primary research to allow meta-analysis.

Our review does have limitations. We selected articles that investigated potential imaging predictors of surgery and ischemia at surgery. While we also chose to analyze non-imaging variables, any research that investigated these in the absence of sufficient primary research remains limited in scope.

### Adult small bowel obstruction [^116QJvaG]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a clinical condition often initially diagnosed and managed in the emergency department (ED). The high rates of potential complications associated with an SBO make it essential for the emergency physician (EP) to make a timely and accurate diagnosis.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the history, physical examination, and imaging modalities associated with the diagnosis of SBO. The secondary objectives were to identify the prevalence of SBO in prospective ED-based studies of adult abdominal pain and to apply Pauker and Kassirer's threshold approach to clinical decision-making to the diagnosis and management of SBO.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, major emergency medicine (EM) textbooks, and the bibliographies of selected articles were scanned for studies that assessed one or more components of the history, physical examination, or diagnostic imaging modalities used for the diagnosis of SBO. The selected articles underwent a quality assessment by two of the authors using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Data used to compile sensitivities and specificities were obtained from these studies, and a meta-analysis was performed on those that examined the same historical component, physical examination technique, or diagnostic test. Separate information on the prevalence and management of SBO was used in conjunction with the meta-analysis findings of computed tomography (CT) to determine the test and treatment threshold.

Better-value treatments are defined as those that are equally effective but more cost-efficient, or superior at the same or reduced cost. In contrast, worse-value treatments are those that are equally effective but more expensive, or less effective and also equally or more expensive.

- **Validating studies**: These studies assess the quality of a specific diagnostic test based on previous evidence.
- **Exploratory studies**: These collect information and use data analysis techniques, such as regression analysis, to identify significant factors.
- **Poor quality prognostic cohort study**: This refers to a study where sampling is biased towards patients who already exhibit the target outcome, or where outcomes are measured in only 80% of cases. Additionally, there is adequate time for alternative diagnoses to emerge, which can range from 1–6 months for acute conditions and 1–5 years for chronic conditions.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: Systematic review [^1177pDDi]. European Radiology (2024). High credibility.

The PRISMA flowchart is presented in Fig. 1. The literature search identified 4530 potential articles. After the review of titles and abstracts, 39 underwent full-text evaluation, and 8 were excluded for the following reasons: one was a systematic review; two reported insufficient surgical data; three reported laboratory or imaging variables that failed to reach the five-article threshold; one did not differentiate small from large bowel obstruction; and one exhibited excessive selection bias. This left 31 studies for inclusion.

Table 1 describes the characteristics of the included studies. In total, 4638 patients were analyzed, with a median sample size of 128, ranging between 44 and 313. Mean patient age per study ranged from 52 to 73 years. The male-to-female ratio was approximately equal across most studies, except for one that reported 77% female participants. Most studies (29, 94%) were single-center, with one study conducted across three USA hospitals and one across four French hospitals. Most studies (23, 74%) gathered data retrospectively via case-note review. Seven were prospective cohort studies. Only one study was a randomized controlled trial.

### SBO action: Conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard contrast agents on outcomes [^112P1uUM]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

This study provides prospective multicenter 'real-life' data on the non-operative management (NOM) of patients presenting with acute small bowel obstruction (aSBO). The overall success of NOM was 81.6%. The use of water-soluble contrast agents (WSCA) was widespread despite a reported shortage, with 62.3% of patients receiving a contrast challenge. However, repeated contrast challenges showed diminishing resolution rates, suggesting limited therapeutic benefit beyond initial administration.

A comparison of this cohort to previous UK reports provides an interesting contrast. The National Audit of Small Bowel Obstruction (NASBO) report showed that 31.0% of patients with aSBO received WSCA compared to 62.3% in the present study, reflecting a broader adoption of WSCA in aSBO management. This finding underscores the pragmatic and adaptable nature of clinical practice, where hospitals and clinicians likely implemented local strategies to maintain access to contrast agents despite reported supply chain challenges. Although it is difficult to determine the precise impact of the perceived shortage on decision-making, this study highlights how real-world data collection can provide unexpected insights into resource utilization and the resilience of clinical workflows during periods of uncertainty. However, one finding that has remained constant is the high rate of plain abdominal radiography prior to CT, contrary to recommendations from the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death and the American College of Radiology, which advocate for early CT as the preferred diagnostic modality.

In terms of medical management for small bowel obstruction, particularly regarding supportive management, the WSES 2018 guidelines recommend selecting nonoperative management as the treatment strategy of choice. This approach is advised in the absence of signs that necessitate emergent surgical exploration, such as peritonitis, strangulation, or bowel ischemia.

### Non-traumatic abdominal emergencies: Imaging and intervention in acute urinary conditions [^112t4kA9]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Obstruction of the upper urinary tract is common and shows no signs of decreasing incidence. Investigating obstruction requires knowledge of how the upper tract functions and how, when normal function is compromised by obstruction, imaging findings will differ from normality. Radiologists need to define the extent of obstruction, its likely duration, and whether intervention is needed to relieve the obstruction and what form that intervention may take. Percutaneous nephrostomy is the most common interventional therapeutic technique performed and should be available in any acute hospital. It is not a procedure that is in the sole domain of uroradiologists. Close cooperation with urologists is essential.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: Systematic review [^116Wh8ao]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

In summary, a systematic review and meta-analysis of imaging, clinical, and laboratory variables of patients with small bowel obstruction identified six potential predictors strongly associated with the need for surgery (five positively and one negatively; three were derived from CT) and three strongly associated with ischemia at surgery (all positively; two were derived from CT). The development of future multivariable models to guide the management of small bowel obstruction should concentrate on variables that display strong evidence of potential utility. Factors that have not been sufficiently investigated in the primary literature but enjoy considerable clinical support should also be considered.

### Radiation from kidney-ureter-bladder radiographs is not trivial [^114Eu6zU]. Urology (2019). Low credibility.

To estimate the effective dose of kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) radiographs in a contemporary population of patients with urolithiasis, a retrospective review was performed to identify patients visiting a urology clinic for urolithiasis where a KUB was obtained and who had a recent computed tomography (CT) scan. The effective dose for KUBs was estimated using a Monte Carlo-based simulation program, and for CT, utilizing the reported dose-length-product. Age, gender, body mass index, and abdominal diameter were analyzed for association with effective dose. KUBs performed at outside facilities in referred patients were compared to those obtained locally when available.

Fifty-four patients were identified as meeting the criteria. The majority (92.6%) of KUBs contained multiple radiographs. The mean effective dose was 2.15 mSv ± 1.67 mSv. Only 26% of examinations had an effective dose under 1 mSv. Body mass index, abdominal thickness, and image count were all associated with an increase in dose (P < .01 each). Similar to local KUBs, 88% of outside examinations contained multiple images.

KUB examinations in this contemporary setting are associated with a 2-fold higher effective dose than is often referenced. Increased effective dose is associated with increased patient size and number of images acquired. Nearly 1 in 5 patients' KUB effective dose was similar to a low-dose CT. The role of KUBs should be re-examined, given its limited sensitivity, specificity, associated radiation, and other available imaging options.

### Small bowel obstruction [^111HsoMn]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). High credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a condition that can manifest through a variety of symptoms and associated conditions. These include fatigue, abdominal cramps, and small bowel dilatation. Patients may also experience nausea, peritoneal adhesions, abdominal distension, and tenderness to palpation. Further symptoms include dehydration, RUQ pain, fever, leukocytosis, and specific small bowel obstruction findings. Additional concerns are periumbilical and poorly localized abdominal pain, tachycardia, RLQ pain, and loss of appetite. Chronic lower abdominal pain, elevated WBC count, increased serum amylase, and bloating are common, as well as diffuse, epigastric, and hernia-related abdominal pain, alongside constipation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected small-bowel obstruction [^11769Xvp]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Small-bowel obstruction is a common cause of abdominal pain and accounts for a significant proportion of hospital admissions. Radiologic imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis and management of small-bowel obstruction, as neither patient presentation, clinical examination, nor laboratory testing are sufficiently sensitive or specific enough to diagnose or guide management.

This document focuses on the imaging evaluation of the two most commonly encountered clinical scenarios related to small-bowel obstruction: the acute presentation and the more indolent, low-grade, or intermittent presentation. It aims to clarify the appropriate utilization of the many imaging procedures that are available and commonly employed in these clinical settings.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Localized postinflammatory hyperpigmentation with abdominal wall protrusion [^1144uz67]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: What is the most sensitive diagnostic test to help confirm the diagnosis?

- **A. CT abdomen and pelvis**: Incorrect. A CT scan may be done to exclude a true abdominal hernia or other intra-abdominal pathology; however, it is not necessary and is not the most sensitive test. Our patient's imaging showed a small incidental umbilical hernia with no evidence of lateral wall defect (Fig 3).

- **B. Electromyography (EMG)**: Correct. Postherpetic pseudohernia is a motor complication of herpes zoster resulting from ventral nerve root denervation, leading to paralysis of the ipsilateral abdominal wall musculature. EMG is a highly sensitive diagnostic modality that can detect this acute denervation, supporting the clinical diagnosis. Nerve conduction studies can also be combined with EMG to rule out other neuropathies. In cases of pseudohernia, nerve conduction studies are often normal. In this case, electrodiagnostic studies were deemed unnecessary given the close temporal correlation between rash onset and abdominal protrusion.

- **C. Skin biopsy**: Incorrect. A biopsy would reveal patchy epidermal or dermal melanosis consistent with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and would not provide additional diagnostic information. Of note, a skin biopsy may be used to aid the diagnosis of a small fiber neuropathy; however, postherpetic pseudohernia is due to motor neuropathy.

- **D. Herpes serology**: Incorrect. Serologic testing is not reliable for diagnosing acute herpes zoster.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: A plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^11642J1j]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

This narrative review incorporates scoping aspects as a formal systematic review and meta-analysis was not feasible due to the paucity of studies on the topic of small bowel obstruction in elderly patients.

- **Search strategy**: PubMed, the Cochrane database, and EMBASE were searched from inception to January 2018. The search strategy was verified by a senior medical librarian for completeness. Studies in PubMed were identified using MeSH terms: 'intestinal obstruction', 'small intestine', 'ileum', 'jejunum', and 'aged', and free text terms: 'small bowel obstruction', 'elderly', 'old', 'eldest', and 'geriatric'. A similar search strategy was executed in EMBASE. Duplicates were identified and removed before searching the Cochrane database for reviews concerning small bowel obstruction, which yielded three studies focused on small bowel obstruction.

One hundred and twenty studies from EMBASE and PubMed were eligible for full-text screening, but only thirteen were included for qualitative analysis, of which two specifically targeted elderly patients. No relevant papers were identified in the Cochrane database. The main reasons for exclusion were studies not including elderly patients and studies not addressing small bowel obstruction. To ensure comprehensive coverage of important geriatric themes that affect diagnosis and treatment of small bowel obstruction, the search was expanded post-systematic review to include more general studies on elderly patients.

### Diagnosis and management of small bowel obstruction in virgin abdomen: a WSES position paper [^114wqWzC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The ability of computed tomography (CT) to provide information related to the underlying cause of small bowel obstruction (SBO), and predict the need for emergency surgery, makes CT the primary diagnostic tool of choice in patients with SBO. However, two of the included studies on SBO in a virgin abdomen (SBO-VA) reported that the accuracy of CT in establishing the exact cause of obstruction seems to be low, with 53% and 76% accuracy. A possible explanation for this finding is that cases of SBO-VA were included over many years and that parts of these cohorts were not recent. The introduction of multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) has improved the diagnostic accuracy, exhibiting high sensitivity and specificity for the etiology of SBO — 87% and 90%, respectively.

CT scans play a key role in the decision-making process regarding the management of patients with SBO. Its importance goes beyond confirming the diagnosis of SBO; CT scans also identify the underlying cause of obstruction and predict the need for emergency surgery. Moreover, CT scans can provide information about an alternative diagnosis if no signs of bowel obstruction are present.

Findings on CT scans help define the potential location of the obstruction, such as high in the jejunum or deep in the pelvis, the grade of the obstruction — whether partial or complete — and can identify a possible transition zone. The use of water-soluble contrast optimizes the diagnostic value of CT scans, and X-rays can evaluate the progress of the contrast 24 hours after the CT scan. Findings on the CT scan that predict the need for operative management include a closed-loop obstruction.

### The clothes maketh the SIGN [^111rryqn]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

In some instances of small bowel obstruction, little or no air is present, and the distended bowel loops are predominantly fluid-filled. Thus, supine abdominal radiographs may not demonstrate air distension of the bowel. However, upright or decubitus radiographs may demonstrate air-fluid levels or the "string of pearls" sign. The obliquely oriented row of air bubbles represents small amounts of air trapped between the valvulae conniventes along the superior wall of the predominately fluid-filled, dilated small bowel loops. The meniscal effect of the surrounding fluid gives the trapped air an ovoid or rounded appearance — a "string of pearls" appearance.

### Ultrasound of the abdominal wall: what lies beneath [^116r1mDX]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Clinically equivocal abdominal wall lesions often pose diagnostic dilemmas for clinicians. It can be equally challenging to appreciate the nature of abdominal wall lesions found incidentally on abdominal ultrasound examinations. Ultrasound is a non-ionizing, inexpensive, and easily accessible investigation for such lesions. It is widely used and has the added advantage of being a dynamic investigation. However, imaging with ultrasound is operator-dependent and relies on technical skills. Understanding the imaging of normal anatomy and being familiar with the imaging appearance of lesions is important. We present a review of various lesions seen during ultrasound examinations of the abdominal wall or as incidental findings on abdominal ultrasound.

Small bowel obstruction is a significant cause of acute surgical admissions. Surgeons are tending to favor an initial trial of conservative management. Due to the unreliability of clinical signs in accurately predicting patients requiring early intervention, there is an increasing tendency to utilize imaging investigations, particularly computed tomography (CT), to help define the severity, cause, and complications of acute small bowel obstruction. The aim of this pictorial review is to demonstrate the contribution CT can make to the management of these patients.

Patients with ASBO treated nonsurgically have shorter hospital stays; however, they have a higher recurrence rate and shorter time to re-admission, although the risk of new surgically treated episodes of ASBO remains the same (Level of Evidence 2b).

All patients being evaluated for small bowel obstruction should have plain films (Level of Evidence 2b, GoR C).

CT-scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process, except when clinical history, physical examination, and plain film are not conclusive for small bowel obstruction diagnosis (Level of Evidence 2b, GoR B).

The association of CT scan signs of bowel ischemia should lead to a low threshold for surgical intervention (Level of Evidence 2a, GoR B).

MRI and ultrasound are of limited value for ASBO and should be limited to patients with contraindications for CT scan/iodine contrast (Level of Evidence 2c, GoR C).

In patients undergoing initial non-operative conservative management, a water-soluble contrast follow-through should be performed to rule out complete ASBO and predict the need for surgery (Level of Evidence 1b, GoR A).

Adhesional postoperative small bowel obstruction is characterized by the presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, distention, and obstipation, in conjunction with confirmatory imaging.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) can be classified according to completeness as partial vs. complete (or high grade vs. low grade), according to etiology as adhesional vs. non-adhesional, and according to timing as early vs. late (> 30 days after surgery).

### Bowel obstruction: a narrative review for all physicians [^111GPdXD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

- **Water-soluble contrast administration in X-ray diagnosis**: A water-soluble contrast enema has 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity in diagnosing large bowel obstruction, but it cannot distinguish different causes of large bowel obstruction. A small bowel follow-through with water-soluble contrast is widely used in patients for the non-operative management of adhesive small bowel obstruction. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have established the utility of water-soluble contrast agents in the diagnostic work-up of adhesive small bowel obstruction. If the contrast has not reached the colon on an abdominal X-ray 24 hours after administration, then this is highly indicative of non-operative management failure. Multiple studies have shown that the use of water-soluble contrast agents accurately predicts the need for surgery and plays an active therapeutic role.

- **Safety and adverse effects**: The administration of water-soluble contrast agents in adhesive small bowel obstruction is considered safe in terms of morbidity and mortality. However, adverse effects have been reported. Potential life-threatening complications include aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema. To avoid these complications, the contrast medium should be administered only after adequate decompression of the stomach through a nasogastric tube. Another potential adverse effect is that due to their higher osmolarity, water-soluble contrast agents may further dehydrate a patient with small bowel obstruction by shifting fluids into the bowel lumen. In some children and elderly adults, this loss of plasma fluid can be sufficient to cause a shock-like state.

### ACR appropriateness criteria on suspected small-bowel obstruction [^116wWtZ6]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Currently, there is no universally accepted method to evaluate patients with suspected small-bowel obstruction (SBO). Standard CT has emerged as the leading imaging modality and should be considered the primary tool in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected high-grade SBO. In contrast, barium enemas and the small-bowel examination play less significant roles in the diagnosis of acute SBO.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute nonlocalized abdominal pain [^1174tgeC]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for intra-abdominal abscess, specifically concerning diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining a contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis. This is advised to evaluate atypical and opportunistic abdominal infections, visceral pathologies, and tumors in patients with abdominal pain and neutropenia.

In another recently developed model for predicting the risk of strangulated SBO, six variables correlated with small bowel resection: history of pain lasting 4 days or more, guarding, C-reactive protein level at least 75 mg/l, leukocyte count of 10 × 10⁹/l or greater, free intraperitoneal fluid volume of at least 500 mL on computed tomography (CT), and reduction of CT small bowel wall contrast enhancement.

A further multivariate predictive model of surgical operation in SBO showed free intraperitoneal fluid, mesenteric edema, lack of the "small bowel feces sign" at CT, and history of vomiting to be significant predictors of the need for operative exploration.

In a retrospective study of 53 patients with ASBO treated using a long nasointestinal tube (LT), complete SBO (no evidence of air within the large bowel) and increased serum creatine phosphokinase (≥ 130 IU/L) were independent predictive factors for LT decompression failure.

A recent prospective study aimed to evaluate an algorithm using CT scans and Gastrografin in the management of small bowel obstruction; severe abdominal pain (VAS > 4), abdominal guarding, raised WCC, and devascularized bowel at CT predicted the need for emergent laparotomy at the time of admission. Furthermore, this study demonstrated the diagnostic role of Gastrografin in discriminating between partial and complete small bowel obstruction, while CT scans were disappointing in their ability to predict the necessity of emergent laparotomies.

Again, two systematic reviews confirmed the value of water-soluble contrast medium in predicting the need for surgery.

### Unusual causes of small bowel obstruction: A review of the literature and revisited cross-sectional imaging checklist [^113Ww9Go]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Intestinal obstruction is a common surgical emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality. Patients presenting with features of small bowel obstruction require urgent evaluation to prevent complications such as bowel gangrene, perforation, or peritonitis. Imaging is crucial in most cases to make appropriate decisions for effective patient management.

- **Causes of small bowel obstruction**: Among the prevalent causes of small bowel obstruction are adhesions, external hernias, malignancies, and Crohn's disease. Imaging is critical for determining the presence of obstruction, the severity, the transition point, the cause, and associated complications such as strangulation, bowel gangrene, and peritonitis.

- **Study focus**: This review examines cases involving unusual causes of bowel obstruction encountered in our routine practice, supported by extensive literature searches through standard textbooks and electronic databases. We aim to equip readers with comprehensive knowledge of the imaging characteristics of these uncommon yet significant causes of bowel obstruction.

- **Structured checklist**: A revisited and structured checklist is provided to simplify the approach to reporting suspected cases of small bowel obstruction. Imaging is pivotal in diagnosing small bowel obstructions, determining the cause, and identifying associated complications. Apart from common causes, awareness of less common etiologies and their imaging characteristics is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective patient management.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO Working Group [^112QB3NV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is one of the leading causes of surgical emergencies, particularly those requiring emergent operations. In the UK, small bowel obstruction accounts for 51% of all emergency laparotomies. Scott et al. reported that seven emergency surgical procedures account for 80% of all general surgery emergency admissions, morbidity, deaths, and healthcare expenditures in the United States. ASBO was the most common diagnosis for both the top 2 (small bowel resection) and top 5 (adhesiolysis) procedures. Post-operative adhesions are the leading cause of small bowel obstructions, accounting for 60% of cases.

ASBO causes considerable harm, resulting in 8 days of hospitalization on average and an in-hospital mortality rate of 3% per episode. Between 20% and 30% of patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction require operative treatment. The length of hospitalization and morbidity depend on the need for surgical intervention. Average hospitalization after surgical treatment of ASBO is 16 days, compared to 5 days following non-operative treatment. Associated costs in a Dutch study in 2016 were estimated at €16,305 for surgical and €2,227 for non-operative treatment.

Although adhesive small bowel obstruction is a common condition, its prevention and treatment are often characterized by surgeons' personal preferences rather than standardized evidence-based protocols. There is a large amount of conflicting and low-quality evidence in publications regarding the treatment of adhesive small bowel obstruction.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: Systematic review [^116pKFgV]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Management of SBO remains problematic. A 2018 review stated that "there has been no reliable clinical method for predicting failure of nonoperative management for adhesive SBO". Accordingly, the primary aim of our review was to identify both imaging and non-imaging factors that should be investigated for the development and evaluation of a multi-variable model predicting treatment strategy for small bowel obstruction. Ideally, such a model would identify those patients unlikely to respond to conservative management and therefore at high risk of ischaemia. At the same time, an accurate model could identify those patients destined to resolve conservatively, and thus avoid surgery.

Unfortunately, the large majority of existing literature that investigates predictors of surgery and/or ischaemia is single-centre, and therefore potentially suffers from spectrum bias and/or insufficient power. A single-centre study by Scrima and colleagues sensibly included both imaging and non-imaging factors, but their model was not evaluated. Zielinski and co-workers developed a model based predominantly on CT scanning, finding vomiting, free intraperitoneal fluid, mesenteric oedema, and absent "small bowel faeces" sign, predictive of surgery. The authors then evaluated the model prospectively, adding more predictors and removing predictors initially found significant during development. The American Association for Surgery of Trauma has advocated an "anatomic severity schema" for small bowel obstruction that was validated subsequently in 351 patients.

### Primary angiosarcoma of the bladder in a young female [^113W4Q5z]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Our case report pertains to a 32-year-old woman initially presenting with left flank pain and gross haematuria throughout her urinary stream. A CT of her kidney/ureter/bladder (CT KUB) revealed ureteric dilatation to the level of the bladder without evidence of renal calculus, and subsequently, a stent was inserted. She represented a month later with contralateral flank pain, and a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed. The histopathological diagnosis was epithelioid angiosarcoma. Further imaging (MRI pelvis) revealed that the tumor arose from the posterior bladder wall with local invasion and regional lymph node metastasis. Ifosfamide and epirubicin chemotherapy with single-fraction radiotherapy induced a significant reduction in tumor bulk, although this initial response was followed by the development of symptoms suggestive of disease progression. She died 19 months after the initial diagnosis with persistent pulmonary and vertebral metastases, although no autopsy was performed.

### Determining the stone free rate of retrograde intrarenal surgery. Which radiological technique? RIRSearch Study Group [^114efcEQ]. Urology (2024). High credibility.

To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography (USG) and kidney ureter bladder radiography (KUB) for determining the stone-free status after retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) according to different definitions, a study was conducted. Patients who underwent RIRS between September 2021 and September 2022 were prospectively included. All patients had KUB radiography, urinary system USG, and noncontrast abdominal tomography in the first month post-surgery. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive factor, and positive predictive factor of USG and KUB in evaluating the stone-free rate were analyzed according to different stone-free status definitions.

A total of 178 patients participated in the study. The stone-free rates for definitions of residual stone < 4 mm, < 2 mm, and no residual stone were 79.2%, 64.0%, and 56.7%, respectively. With the residual stone defined as < 4 mm, USG had a sensitivity and specificity of 64.9% and 84.3%, respectively. Sensitivity of USG was 57.1% and 52.5% for residual stone definitions of < 2 mm and no residual stone, respectively. Adding KUB to USG slightly increased the sensitivity but did not change the specificity.

USG demonstrated high specificity but low sensitivity for evaluating stone-free status after RIRS. The addition of KUB did not enhance diagnostic efficacy. Although USG may be useful in daily practice, it may overestimate stone-free status and noncontrast abdominal tomography may be required for accurate assessment.

### Small bowel obstruction: What a gastroenterologist needs to know [^113PG3fg]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Intrabdominal adhesions and intestinal hernias are the most common causes of small bowel obstruction. Small bowel diseases that lead to obstruction are rarer and often pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to gastroenterologists. This review focuses on small bowel diseases that predispose to obstruction and their associated diagnostic and treatment challenges.

- **Recent findings**: The diagnosis of partial small bowel obstruction has improved with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) enterography. In cases of fibrostenotic Crohn's strictures and NSAID diaphragm disease, endoscopic balloon dilatation can delay the need for surgery if the lesion is short and accessible; however, surgery may still be inevitable for many patients. Biologic therapy may reduce the need for surgery in symptomatic small bowel Crohn's disease where the strictures are primarily inflammatory. For chronic radiation enteropathy, only refractory small bowel obstruction and cases with significant nutritional difficulties warrant surgery.

Small bowel diseases that cause bowel obstruction are often difficult to diagnose and require extensive investigations over time, often culminating in surgery. The use of biologics and endoscopic balloon dilatation can help delay and sometimes prevent surgery in certain cases.

### Does KUB play a role in the diagnosis of bladder bowel dysfunction [^113ztGtS]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2024). High credibility.

Kidney ureter bladder radiography (KUB) is widely used for the evaluation of constipation in children with bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD); however, there is varying evidence to support its routine diagnostic use. One drawback to KUB is radiation exposure. The dangers of radiation in children are well-documented, and, as per the As Low As Reasonably Achievable principle, non-beneficial radiation should be avoided. This risk is especially high in children who undergo repeated imaging in the follow-up of constipation treatment.

- **Objective**: We sought to assess the utility of KUB in diagnosing children with BBD by comparing it to four diagnostic tests and/or validated instruments: the Dysfunctional Voiding Symptom Score (DVSS), Rome IV criteria, rectal diameter on ultrasound (RD), and the Bristol Stool Form Score (BSFS).

- **Study design**: We prospectively enrolled a cohort of patients presenting to an academic pediatric urology practice with symptoms of BBD. The severity of stool burden on KUB (mild, moderate, or severe), RD on ultrasound (≥ 3.4 cm), DVSS, Rome IV, and BSFS were obtained for each patient. All imaging was interpreted by a pediatric radiologist and pediatric urologist. Primary outcomes were the association between the four diagnostic tests and KUB stool burden. Bivariate analysis of all individual variables versus KUB was performed, as well as multivariate regressions to determine if multiple measures were predictive of KUB stool burden when combined.

- **Results**: Between October 2020 and May 2022, 50 patients were enrolled. All children were under the age of 18, with a median…
