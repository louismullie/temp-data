## Question

Research on Sodium feruous gluconata is it safrty for pregnant women and the fetal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sodium ferric gluconate (Ferrlecit) is safe for pregnant women and the fetus, and under what circumstances it should be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact drug identity and formulation details. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about pregnancy risk, including hypersensitivity and benzyl alcohol. Next, I will review animal teratogenicity data and human pregnancy outcomes. After that, I need to balance maternal and fetal risks of untreated iron deficiency anemia against the risks of IV iron. Then, I should compare sodium ferric gluconate with alternative IV iron products and oral iron. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned recommendation with monitoring considerations and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the drug and formulation details so I don't conflate agents. Sodium ferric gluconate complex (Ferrlecit) is an intravenous iron preparation containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative; it is not the same as oral ferrous gluconate, which is a different product with different safety considerations in pregnancy, so I need to keep these distinct in the analysis [^112o2Dm5] [^113pCywN] [^117NgXwo].

> I will now examine the FDA pregnancy risk language. The Ferrlecit label states that parenteral iron can precipitate hypersensitivity reactions that may lead to serious fetal consequences, including fetal bradycardia, particularly in the second and third trimesters. Available human data are insufficient to assess major birth defects or miscarriage risk. And use should be reserved for situations where benefits outweigh potential risks, with counseling about fetal risk and benzyl alcohol content [^112o2Dm5] [^113pCywN] [^117NgXwo].

> Wait, let me verify the benzyl alcohol concern because I initially thought the preservative exposure would be a major fetal risk. Hold on, I should verify the pharmacokinetics. The label notes that benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by the mother, so fetal exposure is unlikely, but adverse reactions have been reported in premature neonates and low-birth-weight infants who received IV benzyl alcohol–containing drugs; thus, the concern is more about neonatal exposure rather than direct in utero toxicity, and the label advises considering benzyl alcohol–free alternatives when feasible during pregnancy [^113pCywN] [^117NgXwo].

> Next, I should review animal data to understand teratogenic potential. In mice and rats, sodium ferric gluconate was not teratogenic at clinically relevant exposures. Adverse embryofetal effects such as increased resorptions and decreased fetal weights occurred only at maternally toxic doses, supporting that non-teratogenic at therapeutic levels in the absence of maternal toxicity, which is reassuring mechanistically [^113pCywN] [^114oA6Zh].

> I need to check human pregnancy outcomes data. Postmarketing reports with Ferrlecit are insufficient to define risks of major birth defects or miscarriage, and there are no robust prospective pregnancy cohorts or registries establishing long-term safety. Case reports document fetal bradycardia temporally associated with maternal hypersensitivity to parenteral iron, including ferric gluconate, underscoring the plausibility of fetal compromise during maternal anaphylaxis or severe hypotension, especially later in gestation [^117NgXwo] [^114nSz4n].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without balancing risks. Untreated iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy is associated with increased risks of preterm delivery, low birth weight, and postpartum anemia; severe maternal anemia (for example, hemoglobin less than about 6 g/dL) can impair fetal oxygenation and is linked to abnormal fetal heart rate patterns and even fetal death, so failing to treat significant anemia also carries meaningful fetal risk that must be weighed against the rare but serious risk of maternal hypersensitivity with IV iron [^117NgXwo] [^113WDFw8] [^116if1iK].

> Let me consider comparative safety and efficacy so I can contextualize choices. Oral iron remains first-line for iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy due to established safety and cost-effectiveness. When oral iron is not tolerated, not absorbed, or insufficient (for example, severe anemia or approaching term), IV iron is reasonable, with iron sucrose having the most human pregnancy data and ferric carboxymaltose showing favorable RCT results in late pregnancy without excess serious adverse events. Sodium ferric gluconate is acceptable when alternatives are unavailable, but its benzyl alcohol content and relatively sparse pregnancy-specific data make iron sucrose or ferric carboxymaltose preferred when feasible [^116if1iK] [^111viHse] [^111XR8FE] [^113pCywN].

> I should double-check practical administration and monitoring guidance. Given documented cases of fetal bradycardia linked to maternal hypersensitivity reactions during IV iron, continuous fetal monitoring during infusion is reasonable in the second and third trimesters, along with maternal observation for infusion reactions. Premedication is not routinely required but a history of prior parenteral iron reactions should prompt heightened vigilance and consideration of benzyl alcohol–free alternatives [^114nSz4n] [^113pCywN].

> Let me synthesize a recommendation, and I will explicitly state uncertainties. Sodium ferric gluconate is not categorically contraindicated in pregnancy; it may be used when benefits clearly outweigh risks, typically for moderate-to-severe iron deficiency anemia in which oral therapy is ineffective, not tolerated, or insufficiently rapid, with counseling that rare maternal hypersensitivity can cause fetal bradycardia and that benzyl alcohol–free IV irons are preferred when available; routine use for mild anemia or prophylaxis is not appropriate, and oral iron should be optimized first whenever possible [^112o2Dm5] [^113pCywN] [^115ptE7u].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient counseling and documentation are addressed. Patients should be informed of the potential for hypersensitivity and fetal bradycardia, the rationale for IV iron over oral therapy in their specific case, and the plan for maternal and fetal monitoring during infusion. Clinicians should document the risk–benefit discussion, consider benzyl alcohol–free alternatives, and arrange follow-up to assess hematologic response and maternal–fetal status after treatment [^1168gEAP] [^114Qg5gQ] [^117NgXwo].

---

Sodium ferric gluconate (Ferrlecit) is **not first-line in pregnancy** [^116if1iK] because of limited human data and potential fetal risks from maternal hypersensitivity reactions, including fetal bradycardia [^112o2Dm5] [^113pCywN]. It should be reserved for **moderate-to-severe iron deficiency anemia** when oral iron is not tolerated or is ineffective, with close maternal-fetal monitoring during infusion [^115ptE7u] [^114nSz4n]. Animal studies show no teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses, but benzyl alcohol preservative may pose neonatal risk; consider benzyl alcohol–free alternatives when possible [^114oA6Zh] [^113pCywN]. Oral iron remains the preferred first-line therapy in pregnancy [^116if1iK] [^114wtGXx].

## Clinical evidence on safety during pregnancy

### Human data

- **Limited human data**: Available postmarketing data are insufficient to assess major birth defects or miscarriage risk with sodium ferric gluconate in pregnancy [^113pCywN] [^117NgXwo].

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Maternal hypersensitivity to parenteral iron, including sodium ferric gluconate, can cause fetal bradycardia, especially in the second and third trimesters [^112o2Dm5] [^114nSz4n].

- **Benzyl alcohol preservative**: The formulation contains benzyl alcohol; although maternal metabolism limits fetal exposure, adverse reactions have been reported in premature neonates receiving benzyl alcohol–containing drugs, prompting caution and consideration of preservative-free alternatives [^113pCywN] [^117NgXwo].

---

### Animal data

In animal studies, **teratogenicity** was not observed in mice or rats at clinically relevant exposures, but adverse embryofetal effects (resorptions, reduced fetal weight) occurred at maternally toxic doses [^114oA6Zh] [^113pCywN]. Overall, these findings suggest no teratogenic risk at therapeutic doses in the absence of maternal toxicity [^114oA6Zh].

---

## Potential risks to the fetus

- **Fetal bradycardia**: Maternal hypersensitivity reactions can cause fetal bradycardia, particularly in later trimesters [^112o2Dm5] [^114nSz4n].

- **Benzyl alcohol exposure**: Potential neonatal risk from preservative exposure, especially in premature infants [^113pCywN] [^117NgXwo].

- **Uncertain long-term effects**: Limited data preclude definitive assessment of long-term fetal outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ACOG recommends **oral iron as first-line therapy** for iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy; intravenous iron, including sodium ferric gluconate, is reserved for intolerance or failure of oral therapy [^116if1iK] [^115ptE7u]. FDA labeling advises that sodium ferric gluconate be used in pregnancy only if benefits outweigh potential risks, with counseling on hypersensitivity and fetal risks [^112o2Dm5] [^113pCywN].

---

## Comparison with other intravenous iron preparations

| **Attribute** | **Sodium ferric gluconate** | **Iron sucrose** | **Ferric carboxymaltose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Human pregnancy data | Limited; insufficient | More extensive; generally reassuring | Limited; emerging evidence |
| Benzyl alcohol preservative | Yes | No | No |
| Fetal bradycardia risk | Yes (hypersensitivity) | Yes (hypersensitivity) | Yes (hypersensitivity) |
| Clinical use | Second-line | Preferred IV option | Alternative IV option |

---

Iron sucrose has **more extensive pregnancy data** and is often preferred when IV iron is indicated; ferric carboxymaltose is an alternative with emerging evidence [^1123oGLp] [^111XR8FE].

---

## Clinical scenarios for use

Consider sodium ferric gluconate when **oral iron is not tolerated** due to gastrointestinal side effects or malabsorption, or when oral therapy fails to correct anemia in the setting of moderate-to-severe iron deficiency anemia requiring rapid correction, particularly late in pregnancy [^115ptE7u] [^116HGRXx].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

- **Maternal monitoring**: Continuous maternal vital sign monitoring during infusion; observe for hypersensitivity reactions [^112o2Dm5] [^114nSz4n].

- **Fetal monitoring**: Consider continuous fetal heart rate monitoring during infusion, especially in the second/third trimesters [^112o2Dm5] [^114nSz4n].

- **Post-infusion observation**: Monitor mother and fetus for at least 30 minutes after infusion [^112o2Dm5] [^116DudQb].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Sodium ferric gluconate is **not first-line in pregnancy** because of limited human data and potential fetal risks from maternal hypersensitivity; reserve its use for cases in which oral iron is not tolerated or is ineffective, with close maternal-fetal monitoring. Oral iron remains the preferred first-line therapy; when IV iron is needed, iron sucrose or ferric carboxymaltose are often preferred based on available evidence and safety profiles [^116if1iK] [^116QT5Cw] [^1123oGLp] [^111XR8FE].

### Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for anaemia in pregnancy [^114Rrkbt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency is a common nutritional deficiency amongst women of childbearing age. Peri-partum iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is associated with significant maternal, fetal and infant morbidity. Current options for treatment are limited: these include oral iron supplementation, which can be ineffective and poorly tolerated, and red blood cell transfusions, which carry an inherent risk and should be avoided. Ferric carboxymaltose is a new treatment option that may be better tolerated. The study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) correction with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose in pregnant women with mild, moderate and severe anaemia in the second and third trimester.

Methods

Prospective observational study; 65 anaemic pregnant women received ferric carboxymaltose up to 15 mg/kg between 24 and 40 weeks of pregnancy (median 35 weeks gestational age, SD 3.6). Treatment effectiveness was assessed by repeat haemoglobin (Hb) measurements and patient report of well-being in the postpartum period. Safety was assessed by analysis of adverse drug reactions and fetal heart rate monitoring during the infusion.

Results

Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose infusion significantly increased Hb values (p < 0.01) above baseline levels in all women. Increased Hb values were observed at 3 and 6 weeks post infusion and up to 8 weeks post-infusion. Ferritin values increased significantly after the infusion. Only 4 women had repeat ferritin values post-partum which remained above baseline levels. Fetal heart rate monitoring did not indicate a drug related negative impact on the fetus. Of the 29 (44.6%) women interviewed, 19 (65.5%) women reported an improvement in their well-being and 9 (31%) felt no different after the infusion. None of the women felt worse. No serious adverse effects were found and minor side effects occurred in 13 (20%) patients.

Conclusions

Our prospective data is consistent with existing observational reports of the safe and effective use of ferric carboxymaltose in the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy.

### Intravenous versus oral iron for treatment of anemia in pregnancy: a randomized trial [^113zALRF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of intravenous iron to oral iron in the treatment of anemia in pregnancy.

Methods

In this randomized open-label study, 90 women with hemoglobin levels between 8 and 10.5 g/dL and ferritin values less than 13 microg/L received either oral iron polymaltose complex (300 mg elemental iron per day) or intravenous iron sucrose. The iron sucrose dose was calculated from the following formula: weight before pregnancy (kg) x (110 g/L - actual hemoglobin [g/L]) x 0.24 + 500 mg. Treatment efficacy was assessed by measuring hemoglobin and ferritin on the 14th and 28th days and at delivery, and the hemoglobin on the first postpartum day. Adverse drug reactions, fetal weight, hospitalization time, and blood transfusions were also recorded.

Results

Hemoglobin values varied significantly with time between groups (interaction effect, P < .001). The change in hemoglobin from baseline was significantly higher in the intravenous group than the oral group at each measurement; the changes with respect to subsequent hemoglobin were significantly higher on the 14th (P = .004) and 28th (P = .031) days. Ferritin values were higher in patients receiving intravenous iron throughout pregnancy. No serious adverse drug reactions were observed. Fetal weight and hospitalization time were similar in the 2 groups. Blood transfusion was required for only one patient in the oral group.

Conclusion

Intravenous iron treated iron-deficiency anemia of pregnancy and restored iron stores faster and more effectively than oral iron, with no serious adverse reactions.

### Efficacy of daily versus intermittent oral iron supplementation for prevention of anaemia among pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11315PiH]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) represents a pressing global public health concern, primarily impacting vulnerable demographics such as children and pregnant women. Anaemia during pregnancy poses significant public health and economic challenges. Globally, approximately 32 million pregnant women suffer from iron deficiency anaemia, with 56% of cases occurring in developing nations. Pregnant women require supplemental iron and folic acid to fulfil both their nutritional requirements and those of the developing foetus. Inadequate intake of these essential nutrients during pregnancy can detrimentally affect maternal health, pregnancy outcomes, and foetal development. The repercussions of anaemia during pregnancy encompass a spectrum of serious adverse effects for both the mother and infant, including low birth weight, increased rates of caesarean section, postpartum haemorrhage necessitating blood transfusion, preterm birth, and neonatal anaemia. Consequently, the prevention of anaemia in pregnancy holds paramount importance in mitigating maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. Empirical evidence underscores the efficacy of iron supplementation in reducing the risk of IDA among pregnant women.

WHO recommends 30 mg–60 mg of daily oral elemental iron and 400 μg of folic acid for the prevention of maternal anaemia and newborn complications. Daily oral iron supplementation for pregnant women is a cost-effective intervention recommended in both public health and clinical settings. However, despite widespread iron supplementation initiatives over the past four decades, the prevalence of anaemia among pregnant women remains largely unchanged. Various potential factors and barriers may impede the success of iron supplementation programs. Firstly, existing healthcare systems in developing countries often distribute iron supplements to pregnant women ineffectively, leading to low utilization of services and poor compliance. Additionally, the daily consumption of iron supplements frequently results in adverse side effects such as nausea, constipation, or gastritis, further exacerbating compliance issues among pregnant women. Moreover, adherence to this supplementation remains problematic. National survey data from 46 countries spanning 2003–2009 reveal that nearly 25–50% of expectant mothers did not receive IFA during pregnancy. This might stem from underlying issues such as inadequate pill distribution, distressing side effects leading to poor compliance among women, or safety concerns surrounding routine iron supplement usage in regions where anaemia is not a prevailing public health issue or among non-anaemic women.

### Intravenous versus oral iron for anaemia among pregnant women in Nigeria (IVON): an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^116DudQb]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Our finding of an effect of intravenous iron on preterm birth in Lagos but not in Kano State, and not overall, might be partially explained by the lower proportion of women with formal education and the higher proportion of home delivery among our Kano participants. It is probable that these characteristics play a larger role in the incidence of preterm birth in Kano as opposed to anaemia. Low level of education and low antenatal clinic attendance have been associated with a higher risk for preterm births in Nepal. Low antenatal care also increased the odds of preterm births in a Nigerian study.

There were no marked differences in safety for ferric carboxymaltose and oral iron in this study. Other studies have found no difference or a lower incidence of adverse events with ferric carboxymaltose compared with oral iron. Similar to the two previous trials with ferric carboxymaltose in pregnant women, we found a higher incidence of transient hypophosphataemia in the intravenous group compared with the oral ferrous sulphate group, although this did not occur at any other timepoint after 4 weeks post-treatment. Our observation of no difference in the incidence of hypophosphataemia in cord blood is both original and reassuring and suggests a lack of persistent hypophosphataemia in the neonate, even if there had been an initial reduction in phosphate concentration. This finding affirms the safety of ferric carboxymaltose in the unborn fetus, an important consideration for any drug administered during pregnancy. Unlike in the study by Breymann and colleagues, we did not observe any hypersensitivity reactions. The finding of transient but non-clinically relevant mild hypotension in 4% of participants in the intravenous iron group is worthy of note to ensure monitoring for at least 30 min before discharge, as practised in our trial.

### Fetal bradycardia and acidosis during maternal parenteral iron: case reports and literature review [^114nSz4n]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is an important problem among pregnant women, and intravenous (IV) iron infusions have been increasingly used. Whether fetal monitoring is required during infusion has been debated, with a recent guideline by Hematologists recommending against such. We report two cases of fetal bradycardia after iron isomaltoside (IIM), in women with otherwise good maternal and fetal health. Both developed dyspnea with desaturation minutes from infusion, followed by persistent fetal bradycardia. Both underwent category 1 CS, with cord arterial pH of 7.08 and 6.94 respectively. Upon literature review, only three case reports on fetal bradycardia in IV iron were identified. For older IV iron formulations, a case was reported after IV dextran test dose, while two cases after ferric gluconate were reported. For the new formulation IIM, only one case was reported so far, but in a woman with Crohn's disease and intrauterine growth restriction. IV iron in pregnancy carries risk of anaphylactic or hypersensitivity reactions, even with the newest formulations and in women with good maternal and fetal health. While rarely reported so far, fetal bradycardia is a possible consequence, commonly preceded by respiratory symptoms. Fetal monitoring should therefore be considered during infusion.

In summary, the concern that antenatal iron supplementation leads to increased maternal P. falciparum infection is not supported by epidemiological evidence, at least with a daily supplemental dose of 60 mg as iron ferrous salts. This finding and the difference from the increased malaria rates in young children is most likely explained by greater levels of acquired immunity in adults than in young children in malaria‐endemic settings. More work is needed to evaluate effects on P. vivax, which often occurs at lower levels of endemicity, and has a stronger preference for reticulocytes than P. falciparum.

### The benefits and harms of oral iron supplementation in non-anaemic pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115hHBkb]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron requirements increase during pregnancy as a result of an expanding red blood cell mass. Without sufficient iron intake, iron reserves are depleted, red blood cell production is impaired and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) can develop. IDA affects up to 36.5% of pregnant women globally, making it the most common nutritional disorder worldwide. IDA poses substantial risks to both maternal health and foetal health and development, increasing the risk of premature birth, postpartum depression, and low infant birth weight, according to a meta-analysis of 117 studies globally. There is also emerging evidence of maternal and foetal harms even before iron deficiency (ID) progresses to IDA. Infants born of iron-deficient mothers are themselves at increased risk of ID, and may develop impaired cognitive, motor, and social–emotional function.

As a preventative measure, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other international guidelines advise that all pregnant women, regardless of iron status, receive iron supplementation alongside folic acid. In contrast, guidelines from other countries, including the UK, USA, and Australia, either recommend against or fail to address universal supplementation, highlighting clinical uncertainty with regard to its benefits for pregnant women who do not have anaemia.

Previous reviews have demonstrated significant benefits of iron supplementation, including a 2015 review which found that supplementation reduced maternal anaemia at term by 70% and improved foetal outcomes, such as birth weight. However, this review combined both anaemic and non-anaemic groups in their analysis. The benefits of iron supplementation are already well established for anaemic women, but the extent to which these benefits apply to non-anaemic women is unclear. A 2023 systematic review examined non-anaemic women, but specified that participants must also be iron-replete. While this is clinically applicable to some countries, it is less relevant in countries like the USA, UK, or Australia where iron studies are not included in routine antenatal screening.

Arguments against routine prophylactic iron supplementation in pregnancy suggest that the harms outweigh the benefits for non-anaemic women. Iron overload and high haemoglobin may be associated with adverse outcomes including preterm birth and foetal growth restriction. Oral iron supplements can also cause unwanted gastrointestinal side effects, however, these harms have not been clearly quantified in the context of pregnancy.

Given the clinical uncertainty, it is critical to reexamine whether universal iron supplementation would provide a net benefit to this population's health and wellbeing. Our systematic review explores both the benefits and harms of iron supplementation in non-anaemic pregnant women, a key population in the discussion surrounding routine iron supplementation guidelines globally.

### Efficacy and tolerability of low-dose iron supplements during pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial [^116PLF8E]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is common in pregnant women, but previous trials aimed at preventing IDA used high-dose iron supplements that are known to cause gastrointestinal side effects.

Objective

The objective was to assess the effect on maternal IDA and iron deficiency (ID, without anemia) of supplementing pregnant women with a low dosage (20 mg/d) of iron. Effects on iron status were assessed at the time of delivery and at 6 mo postpartum. Gastrointestinal side effects were assessed at 24 and 36 wk of gestation.

Design

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a 20-mg daily iron supplement (ferrous sulfate) given from 20 wk of gestation until delivery.

Results

A total of 430 women were enrolled, and 386 (89.7%) completed the follow-up to 6 mo postpartum. At delivery, fewer women from the iron-supplemented group than from the placebo group had IDA [6/198, or 3%, compared with 20/185, or 11%; relative risk (RR): 0.28; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.68; P < 0.005], and fewer women from the iron-supplemented group had ID (65/186, or 35%, compared with 102/176, or 58%; RR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.76; P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in gastrointestinal side effects between groups. At 6 mo postpartum, fewer women from the iron-supplemented group had ID (31/190, or 16%, compared with 51/177, or 29%; RR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.84; P < 0.005). The rate of IDA between the groups did not differ significantly at 6 mo postpartum.

Conclusion

Supplementing the diet of women with 20 mg Fe/d from week 20 of pregnancy until delivery is an effective strategy for preventing IDA and ID without side effects.

### A novel nano-iron supplement versus standard treatment for iron deficiency anaemia in children 6–35 months (IHAT-GUT trial): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled non-inferiority phase II trial in the Gambia [^111nwTkt]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

There are many forms of iron supplements and fortificants available for preventive and therapeutic intervention against iron deficiency and its consequent anaemia in children and pregnant women.

The more complex formulations, designed for improved tolerability and efficacy, are prohibitively expensive for mass administration in low-income countries and, anyway, their effectiveness is generally not known. Hence, national programmes supported by WHO and aid organisations such as UNICEF generally employ cheap ferrous salts (sulphate, gluconate, fumarate). Despite being relatively well absorbed these non-physiological 'chemical' forms of iron have limited efficacy in young children, may cause gut dysbiosis, are poorly tolerated in pregnancy, and have been associated with serious side effects in infancy.

IHAT, the compound tested in this trial, is a novel formulation engineered to mimic the iron form of natural plant ferritin. The novel aspects of IHAT are that it is not a soluble compound nor does it require solubilisation in the stomach prior to uptake: instead it is taken up as whole nanoparticles by the duodenal enterocytes via endocytosis, a natural absorption pathway for both dietary plant ferritin and digested ferric iron. This means that the unabsorbed fraction of the compound transiting to the lower gut, usually at least 70% of all ingested iron irrespective of the form, will remain nanoparticulate and insoluble, and as such should not be available to promote significant pathogen growth, tissue inflammation or other iron redox associated issues.

A crucial aspect of the IHAT nanostructure is that once it has entered the enterocyte it is sufficiently labile to break down inside the lysosomes/endosomes and deliver its iron because the native iron oxo-hydroxide structure (i.e. ferrihydrite) has been intentionally destabilised by the incorporation of tartaric and adipic acids, in much the same way as occurs with the ferritin iron core which interacts with phosphate and amino-acid residues of the ferritin protein shell. Our pre-clinical and early-clinical data indicate that IHAT is effectively absorbed in humans, corrects IDA in animal models, is not redox reactive and does not have a detrimental impact on the gut microbiome. Recently published results for the gut microbiome analysis (secondary endpoint) in the IHAT-GUT study have confirmed that IHAT does not impact negatively the microbiome.

### Comparison of ferric carboxymaltose and iron sucrose complex for treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy-randomised controlled trial [^117Nxf9D]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

FCM is a safe intravenous agent in pregnancy and is non-inferior to the current standard therapy (iron sucrose complex) for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. FCM has the advantage of a large dose administration per sitting, early rise in Hb level, lesser total number of required doses (convenient dosing), hence lesser number of hospital visits and total cost involved in transportation, equipment required for infusion and the discomfort caused to the patient due to multiple needle pricks. Improvement in fatigue scores were better with FCM over 12 weeks. Significantly shorter duration of treatment when considered in a community setting with the patient friendly dosing, may translate to better patient compliance to treatment.

### The benefits and harms of oral iron supplementation in non-anaemic pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115gmg3w]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency during pregnancy poses a significant risk to both maternal and foetal health. Current international guidelines provide discrepant advice on antenatal iron supplementation for non-anaemic women.

Objective

We aimed to quantify the benefits and harms of routine antenatal supplementation in non-anaemic women.

Methods

The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and clinical trial registries were searched for randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing oral iron supplementation with placebo or no supplement in non-anaemic pregnant women. Risk of bias was assessed for each study and the results were synthesized via meta-analysis.

Results

Twenty-three eligible studies were identified with 4492 non-anaemic pregnant women. Supplemented groups had higher haemoglobin [mean difference = 6.95 g/l, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.81–9.09, P < .001, moderate certainty, I2 = 91%] and ferritin (mean difference = 12.22 ng/ml, 95% CI: 6.92–17.52, P < .001, moderate certainty, I2 = 87%) and were at lower risk of anaemia (relative risk = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.34–0.74, P < .001, high certainty, I2 = 42%, number needed to treat (NNT) = 10). There was no difference in birth weight, preterm birth, and rate of caesarean section. Reporting on harms was inconsistent and there was insufficient evidence to determine an association between iron supplements and any negative outcome.

Discussion

Prophylactic iron supplementation likely results in a large reduction in maternal anaemia during pregnancy. Future research should qualify the impact of this benefit on women's quality of life and determine which subpopulations benefit most. Evidence surrounding the harms of iron supplementation in the non-anaemic population is poor quality and inconsistent. Randomized controlled trials quantifying the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) disturbance and iron overload are essential to inform iron supplement use and reduce unwarranted variations in international guidelines.

Abstract

Background

Iron deficiency during pregnancy poses a significant risk to both maternal and foetal health. Current international guidelines provide discrepant advice on antenatal iron supplementation for non-anaemic women.

Objective

We aimed to quantify the benefits and harms of routine antenatal supplementation in non-anaemic women.

Methods

The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and clinical trial registries were searched for randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing oral iron supplementation with placebo or no supplement in non-anaemic pregnant women. Risk of bias was assessed for each study and the results were synthesized via meta-analysis.

Results

Twenty-three eligible studies were identified with 4492 non-anaemic pregnant women. Supplemented groups had higher haemoglobin [mean difference = 6.95 g/l, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.81–9.09, P < .001, moderate certainty, I² = 91%] and ferritin (mean difference = 12.22 ng/ml, 95% CI: 6.92–17.52, P < .001, moderate certainty, I² = 87%) and were at lower risk of anaemia (relative risk = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.34–0.74, P < .001, high certainty, I² = 42%, number needed to treat (NNT) = 10). There was no difference in birth weight, preterm birth, and rate of caesarean section. Reporting on harms was inconsistent and there was insufficient evidence to determine an association between iron supplements and any negative outcome.

Discussion

Prophylactic iron supplementation likely results in a large reduction in maternal anaemia during pregnancy. Future research should qualify the impact of this benefit on women's quality of life and determine which subpopulations benefit most. Evidence surrounding the harms of iron supplementation in the non-anaemic population is poor quality and inconsistent. Randomized controlled trials quantifying the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) disturbance and iron overload are essential to inform iron supplement use and reduce unwarranted variations in international guidelines.

### Hypersensitivity from intravenous iron products [^111RnsJQ]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

In the last several years, intravenous therapy with iron products has been more widely used. Although it has been a standard procedure in dialysis-associated anemia since the early 1990s, its use is expanding to a host of conditions associated with iron deficiency, especially young women with heavy uterine bleeding and pregnancy. Free iron is associated with unacceptable high toxicity inducing severe, hemodynamically significant symptoms. Subsequently, formulations that contain the iron as an iron carbohydrate nanoparticle have been designed. With newer formulations, including low-molecular-weight iron dextran, iron sucrose, ferric gluconate, ferumoxytol, iron isomaltoside, and ferric carboxymaltose, serious adverse events are rare.

### Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy-opportunities to optimize perinatal health and health equity [^116j2MUD]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Third, oral iron is well-established as a safe and effective treatment for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. Because of the lack of studies of treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in a screen-detected population, the USPSTF, focused primarily on supplementation doses, with most included studies using doses between 20 and 50 mg of elemental iron. Given the high prevalence of iron deficiency during pregnancy, and the increased iron requirements, these doses are likely insufficient for adequate treatment and resulted in the lack of benefit observed. Future studies should evaluate the outcomes of iron supplementation in 3 distinct groups: participants who are iron replete, participants who are iron deficient without anemia, and participants with iron deficiency anemia. We recommend that future guidelines focused on the management of iron deficiency in pregnancy should include literature that differentiates between supplementation for prevention and treatment for diagnosed iron deficiency. In addition, future reviews should distinguish between supplemental and treatment doses of oral and intravenous iron and their impacts on outcomes. Guidance on appropriate supplementation (including formulation, dosage, and timing) is also necessary due to the lack of consensus and the variability in dosing strategies found in the literature.

As the rates of iron deficiency during pregnancy increase, so too may pregnancy morbidity. Given these significant implications for public health, it is critical to conduct additional studies to examine the advantages and disadvantages of screening for and treating subclinical iron deficiency. To harmonize future study findings, it is important to standardize the diagnostic cutoff values for iron deficiency across different populations and settings and clearly differentiate between indications for supplementation vs treatment. This will also help improve the identification and treatment of at-risk individuals, address disparities in care, and ultimately mitigate adverse pregnancy and offspring outcomes.

### Iron sucrose (Venofer) [^112n7YNz]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of iron sucrose IV (also known as Venofer, Venofer) in pregnant patients for second trimester: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Fetal adverse reactions, including fetal bradycardia, have been associated with maternal hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Data with intravenous iron sucrose use during human pregnancy have not shown adverse maternal or fetal outcomes; however, reports of intravenous iron sucrose use in pregnant women during the first trimester are insufficient to assess the risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Treat iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy because there are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy. The drug iron sucrose IV (also known as Venofer, Venofer) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Safety and benefits of antenatal oral iron supplementation in low-income countries: a review [^114RPPi5]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Safety of antenatal iron interventions in malaria‐endemic settings

In 2007, 54·7 million pregnancies occurred in areas with stable P. falciparum transmission and a further 70·5 million in areas with low malaria transmission or with P. vivax only (Dellicour et al, 2010). Even a small increase in malaria risk in pregnant women would probably have major public health implications, given the high prevalence of Plasmodium infection in many areas and the deleterious effects of infection on both maternal outcomes (severe anaemia, death) and birth outcomes (reduced birth weight, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, increased neonatal mortality).

In highly endemic areas, most pregnant women are in a state of premunition, whereby infection occurs without symptoms or signs other than a reduction in haemoglobin concentration by 10–20 g/l. The immunity resulting from frequent exposure to infectious mosquito bites is slowly acquired and it is sufficient to control but not prevent infection in adolescents and adults. In pregnancy, the acquired immunity is transiently reduced, particularly in primiparae and in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy (Brabin, 1983; Desai et al, 2007). Left untreated, asymptomatic Plasmodium infections may persist for months. The prevalence and density of parasitaemia, as well as the level of infection‐induced inflammation, are dependent on previous exposure to infection. To avoid being filtered through the spleen, where it would be cleared from the bloodstream and killed, P. falciparum adheres to chondroitin sulfate A in the placental intervillous space (Fried & Duffy, 1996), thus leading to the aggregation of parasitized erythrocytes or haemozoin that can be undetectable in peripheral blood smears. In conditions of low, seasonal transmission, a state of premunition is often not attained.

### The impact of recommending iron supplements to women with depleted iron stores in early pregnancy on use of supplements, and factors associated with changes in iron status from early pregnancy to postpartum in a multi-ethnic population-based cohort [^111sNHdM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

However, there are also weaknesses to report. We evaluated the impact of giving a simple recommendation of iron supplementation by self-reported use of supplements in GW 28 through a pre-post-test design, not a RCT. We do not know to which extent the women adhered to our recommendations. However, substantially more women reported use of iron supplements in GW 28 among women undergoing this 'simple intervention', compared to those not exposed to recommendation, suggesting an effect. In Norway ferrous gluconate, sulphate and fumarate can be bought in grocery stores or pharmacies without prescription. For the majority of women we lack information of the iron dose taken, the frequency and duration of intake, the type of iron supplements as well as of other variables affecting the iron uptake. We assessed the effect of recommending iron supplementation on the women's postpartum status only, and have not evaluated the effect of iron supplementation on the neonates. Further, the number of participants in some ethnic groups was low, and the presence of heterogeneity within relatively broad ethnic groups is possible. As in most studies, we had some loss to follow-up at the postpartum visit, partly due to logistic reasons, but we prioritized ethnic minority women for blood sampling. Further, the collected food-frequency data were used to identify dietary patterns, and we were therefore not able to calculate iron intake. Postpartum haemorrhage was not exactly measured, but based on clinical judgement. On average, the plasma volume increases from about 2.4 L to about 2.8 L from the time before pregnancy to week 19, and we cannot rule out that plasma volume can partly explain some of the differences found during pregnancy. There are no simple biomarkers that provide good estimates of changes in plasma volume, however we adjusted for gestational week in our regression models, as a proxy for plasma volume. Furthermore, we have no reason to believe that our explanatory variables of interest will systematically influence the blood volume, and hence affect our results, other than by reducing the precision of our estimates.

### Ferric maltol (Accrufer) [^116SwWsT]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

ACCRUFER is not absorbed systemically as an intact complex following oral administration, and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of ferric or ferrous compounds to gravid CD1-mice and Wistar-rats during organogenesis at doses 13 to 32 times the recommended human dose resulted in no adverse developmental outcomes. An overdose of iron in pregnant women may carry a risk for spontaneous abortion, gestational diabetes and fetal malformation.

In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of maltol to pregnant Crl: COBS-CD (SD) BR rats during organogenesis at doses 6 times the recommended human dose resulted in no adverse developmental outcomes.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk

Untreated iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes such as post-partum anemia. Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with IDA include increased risk for preterm delivery and low birth weight.

Data

Animal Data

In embryofetal development studies in mice and rats, pregnant animals received oral doses of ferric or ferrous compounds (ferrous sulfate or ferric sodium pyrophosphate) of up to 160 mg/kg/day in mice, or up to 200 mg/kg/day in rats, during the period of organogenesis. Administration of ferric or ferrous compounds at doses 13 times (in mice) or 32 times (in rats) the recommended human dose resulted in no maternal toxicity and no adverse developmental outcomes.

In a multigeneration reproductive and developmental study in rats, pregnant animals received oral doses of maltol of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day, during the period of organogenesis. Administration of maltol at doses 6 times the recommended human dose resulted in no maternal toxicity and no adverse developmental outcomes.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of ACCRUFER in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. ACCRUFER is not absorbed systemically as an intact complex by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to ACCRUFER.

### A prospective randomized, controlled trial of intravenous versus oral iron for moderate iron deficiency anaemia of pregnancy [^111Sbyxk]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common deficiency disorder in the world, affecting more than one billion people, with pregnant women at particular risk.

Objectives and Design

We conducted a single site, prospective, nonblinded randomized-controlled trial to compare the efficacy, safety, tolerability and compliance of standard oral daily iron versus intravenous iron.

Subjects

We prospectively screened 2654 pregnant women between March 2007 and January 2009 with a full blood count and iron studies, of which 461 (18%) had moderate IDA. Two hundred women matched for haemoglobin concentration and serum ferritin level were recruited.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to daily oral ferrous sulphate 250 mg (elemental iron 80 mg) with or without a single intravenous iron polymaltose infusion.

Results

Prior to delivery, the intravenous plus oral iron arm was superior to the oral iron only arm as measured by the increase in haemoglobin level (mean of 19.5 g/L vs. 12 g/L; P < 0.001); the increase in mean serum ferritin level (222 microg/L vs. 18 ug/L; P < 0.001); and the percentage of mothers with ferritin levels below 30 microg/L (4.5% vs. 79%; P < 0.001). A single dose of intravenous iron polymaltose was well tolerated without significant side effects.

Conclusions

Our data indicate that intravenous iron polymaltose is safe and leads to improved efficacy and iron stores compared to oral iron alone in pregnancy-related IDA.

### Ferric derisomaltose (Monoferric) [^113VYNmd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

There are no available data on Monoferric use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Published studies on the use of intravenous iron products in pregnant women have not reported an association with adverse developmental outcomes. However, these studies cannot establish or exclude the absence of any drug-related risk during pregnancy because the studies were not designed to assess for the risk of major birth defects (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in pregnancy as well as risks to the fetus associated with maternal severe hypersensitivity reactions (see Clinical Considerations). Iron complexes have been reported to be teratogenic and embryocidal in non-iron depleted pregnant animals. The findings in animals may be due to iron overload and may not be applicable to patients with iron deficiency. Animal reproduction studies of ferric derisomaltose administered to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including structural abnormalities and embryo-fetal mortality at doses approximately 0.09 and 0.4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1000 mg, respectively, based on body surface area (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Untreated iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes such as post-partum anemia. Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with IDA includes increased risk for preterm delivery and low birth weight.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions

Severe adverse reactions including circulatory failure (severe hypotension, shock including in the context of anaphylactic reaction) may occur in pregnant women with parenteral iron products (such as Monoferric) which may cause fetal bradycardia, especially during the second and third trimester.

### Iron dextran (Infed) [^113HNKHS]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Parenteral iron administration may be associated with hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], which may have serious consequences, such as fetal bradycardia (see Clinical Considerations). Advise pregnant persons of the potential risk to the fetus. Available data from postmarketing reports with iron dextran use in pregnancy are insufficient to assess the risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. There are risks to the pregnant person and fetus associated with untreated iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Iron dextran has been shown to be teratogenic and embryocidal in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys when given in doses of about 3 times the maximum human dose.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

### Adapting iron dose supplementation in pregnancy for greater effectiveness on mother and child health: protocol of the ECLIPSES randomized clinical trial [^114xvicz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Background and rationale

The prevalence of anemia during pregnancy is high (25%), even in economically developed industrialized countries. Also, there is a frequent risk of hemoconcentrations in about 15% of pregnancies.

Ferropenic anemia during pregnancy has been related to an increase in risk of low birth weight of the newborn, premature birth, or less cognitive development of the child.

On the other hand, hemoconcentration, defined in a recent Cochrane review as values of hemoglobin > 130 g/L at the 2nd trimester of gestation, has been associated with prejudicial effects in the mother and fetus. These include preeclampsia and oxidative stress in the mother, as well as an increase in premature birth, low birth weight, and small-for-gestational-age of the fetus.

Also, low birth weight and general poor neonatal health have also been associated with environmental factors such as tobacco consumption, toxic environment, low socio-economic status, and prenatal psychological status of the mother e.g. high levels of anxiety. These factors, and others related to the process of iron supplementation and the effects on mother and child, need to be controlled in studies investigating iron levels and pregnancy.

Prophylactic iron supplements are prescribed to avoid iron deficiency during pregnancy. The health authorities of Spain recommend an iron supplementation of 30 mg/d for non-anemic pregnant women. However, since this dose is not currently marketed, obstetricians recommend a dose of around 40 mg/d of iron.

However, there is still no consensus on the best dose, nor schedule of iron supplementation, to prevent its deficiency during pregnancy, without provoking hemoconcentration.

### Ferrous fumarate, ascorbic acid, folic acid, cyanocobalamin (hematogen FA) [^115WF6ef]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

EXCELLENT ORAL TOLERATION: Ferrous fumarate is used in Hematogen FA Capsules because it is less likely to cause the gastric disturbances so often associated with oral iron therapy. Ferrous fumarate has a low ionization constant and high solubility in the entire pH range of the gastrointestinal tract. It does not precipitate proteins or have the astringency of more ionizable forms of iron, and does not interfere with proteolytic or diastatic activities of the digestive system. Because of excellent oral toleration, Hematogen FA Capsules can usually be administered between meals when iron absorption is maximal.

FOLIC ACID SUPPLEMENTATION: The use of supplemental folic acid may be indicated in patients with increased requirements for this vitamin, such as iron deficiency anemia. Folic acid administration may 12 reduce the risk of neural tube defects in the developing fetus. Folic acid has also been shown to reduce circulating homocysteine leveIs in the blood. FoIate as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and B as methylcobalamin are involved in the remethylation reaction of homocysteine to methionine. Elevated homocysteine plasma levels are associated with increased risk of preeclampsia, neural tube defects, myocardial infarction and artherosclerosis.

TOXICITY: Ferrous fumarate was found to be the least toxic of three popular oral iron salts, with an oral LD of 630 mg/kg. In the same report, the LD of ferrous gluconate was reported to be 320 mg/kg and ferrous sulfate 230 mg/kg.

c Estimated gestational age (weeks) is dated either using first day of the last menstrual period or fundal height.

d Anemia based on venous Hb indicates Hb < 11.0 g dL −1 up to and including delivery and Hb < 12.0 g dL −1 postpartum. Moderate/severe anemia based on venous Hb indicates Hb < 10.0 g dL −1 up to and including delivery and Hb < 11.0 g dL −1 postpartum.

e The number needed to treat for anemia at 36 weeks' gestation or at delivery (whichever came first) is 6 (95% CI 4–13), meaning on average 6 women in their third trimester of pregnancy with moderate or severe anemia (capillary Hb < 10.0 g dL −1) would need to be treated with FCM in order for one additional woman to not have maternal anemia (venous Hb > 11.0 g dL −1) at 36 weeks' gestation or at delivery (whichever came first).

### Intravenous iron sucrose V / s oral ferrous fumarate for treatment of anemia in pregnancy. A randomized controlled trial [^112F2B1o]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of intravenous iron sucrose with that of oral ferrous fumarate in iron deficiency anemia during 14 to 34 weeks of pregnancy.

Methods

A randomized controlled trial was performed involving 112 patients attending the antenatal clinic at Shri B.M. Patil Medical college Hospital, Bijapur from October 2011 to August 2012, with hemoglobin levels between 70–110 g/L and serum ferritin of < 15 ng/ml.

In the intravenous group,200 mg of iron sucrose was administered in 100 mL 0.9% sodium chloride per day. Participants in the oral group were given 200 mg of ferrous fumarate per day. The primary outcome measures for the trial, haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels were measured after 4 weeks. Statistical significance was assessed using Student's t -test.

Results

The change in haemoglobin in women receiving intravenous iron was higher than with oral ferrous fumarate 22 ± 11.5 g/L vs 12 ± 9 g/L (p < 0.0001). Similarly the change of serum ferritin was significantly higher in women receiving intravenous iron compared to oral iron.

55% participants in the intravenous group had an improvement in haemoglobin more than 20 g/L compared to only 11% of the oral therapy group.48% of patients in I.V group showed increase in ferritin level between 51 to 100 ng/ml in comparison to only 3.5% in oral group.

Intravenous iron sucrose is an effective in correction of anemia in pregnancy or iron store depletion.

Conclusion

Intravenous iron sucrose is more effective than 200 mg a day ferrous fumarate in increasing maternal iron stores.

Trial registration

The trial registration number isregistered in Clinical Trial Registry India on 8/12/2016. It is a retrospectively registered trial.

### Effect and safety of intravenous iron compared to oral iron for treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy [^111viHse]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Intravenous iron is increasingly used to treat iron-deficient anaemia (IDA) in pregnancy. A previous network meta-analysis suggested that intravenous irons have a greater effect on haematological parameters than oral irons; however, the impact on serious pregnancy complications such as postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) or the need for blood transfusion was unclear. Since then, several new randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect and safety of intravenous versus oral iron preparations for treating IDA in pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP) for eligible studies. The latest search was performed on 19 March 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included RCTs in pregnant women with confirmed IDA (haemoglobin (Hb) level < 11 g/dL as per World Health Organization (WHO) criteria) comparing intravenous (iron sucrose, ferric carboxymaltose, ferric derisomaltose, ferumoxytol) and oral (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate) iron preparations.

Outcomes

Our outcomes were antenatal and postnatal Hb levels, antenatal and postnatal anaemia status, PPH, blood transfusion, maternal satisfaction, maternal well-being, breastfeeding, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, and adverse events (AEs).

We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess risk of bias in the included RCTs.

Synthesis Methods

We followed standard Cochrane methods. Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and scientific rigour, evaluated the risk of bias of included studies, and extracted data. Where appropriate, we pooled data using a fixed-effect model in the first instance. We reported dichotomous data as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Included Studies

We included 13 RCTs (3939 participants) mainly conducted in India and Africa (8/13). Gestational age at baseline ranged from 13 to 37 weeks, and Hb levels ranged from 5.0 to just below 11.0 g/dL. The most frequently compared preparations were intravenous iron sucrose versus oral ferrous sulfate (5/13). Most RCTs were at low risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, mainly due to concerns over attrition bias, imprecision, and inconsistency.

Synthesis Of Results

Antenatal outcomes Compared with oral iron, intravenous iron likely slightly increases Hb level three to six weeks after treatment start (MD 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.69; 11 RCTs; 2935 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and likely reduces anaemia status three to six weeks after treatment start (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.86; 5 RCTs; 2189 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared with oral iron, intravenous iron likely slightly increases Hb level around birth (MD 0.55, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.77; 6 RCTs; 1574 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and likely reduces anaemia status around birth (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.93; 4 RCTs; 1240 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Postpartum outcomes Compared with oral iron, intravenous iron may slightly increase Hb level postpartum (MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.68; 3 RCTs; 1950 participants; low-certainty evidence). It may also reduce anaemia status (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.73; 3 RCTs; 1950 participants; low-certainty evidence) and severe anaemia postpartum (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.84; 2 RCTs; 1581 participants; very low-certainty evidence), although the evidence for the latter outcome is very uncertain. Compared with oral iron, intravenous iron may result in little to no difference in PPH (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.20; 3 RCTs; 2251 participants; low-certainty evidence) and likely results in little to no difference in the need for blood transfusion (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.60; 6 RCTs; 2592 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or rates of breastfeeding (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.12; 1 RCT; 404 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No trials reported on maternal satisfaction or maternal well-being. Adverse outcomes Compared with oral iron, intravenous iron may have little to no effect on maternal mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.13 to 6.39; 4 RCTs; 2152 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Compared with oral iron, intravenous iron likely does not increase maternal morbidity: severe infections (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.18; 1 RCT; 1881 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and prolonged hospital stay (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.21; 1 RCT; 1764 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may not increase admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) (RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.87; 2 RCTs; 2069 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared with oral iron, intravenous iron likely does not increase AEs (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.35; 1 RCT; 349 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may not increase serious AEs (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.59; 1 RCT; 1934 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, individual AEs were inconsistently reported across trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Intravenous iron likely slightly increases Hb levels and likely reduces anaemia in pregnancy compared to oral iron. Hb levels postpartum may be slightly increased with intravenous iron, but the effect on postpartum severe anaemia status is very uncertain. Intravenous iron may result in little to no difference in PPH, and blood transfusion rates are likely unaffected by route of administration. Synthesis of adverse outcomes proved challenging due to their rarity and suboptimal reporting. The effects of intravenous iron on maternal mortality and admissions to the ICU are very uncertain, and there is likely little to no difference between groups in severe infections and prolonged hospital stay. Intravenous iron likely does not increase AEs and may not increase serious AEs; however, the 95% CIs in both cases include potential harm. Furthermore, this finding should be treated cautiously due to the varied adverse event profiles of both types of iron preparations. Data from the ongoing multicentre trials may address some of the identified evidence gaps. However, there is a clear need to strengthen the co-ordination of research efforts around clinically important time points of outcome measure, homogeneity of their definition, and safety reporting.

Regarding the use of ferric pyrophosphate citrate IV (also known as Triferic Avnu, Triferic) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor for maternal hypersensitivity reactions and fetal bradycardia. Sodium ferric gluconate complex injection contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received IV administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs. Consider alternative iron replacement therapies without benzyl alcohol during pregnancy. Fetal adverse reactions, including fetal bradycardia, have been associated with maternal hypersensitivity reactions to parenteral iron products, especially during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus.

Fetal adverse reactions, including fetal bradycardia, have been associated with maternal hypersensitivity reactions to parenteral iron products, especially during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Iron dextran has been shown to be teratogenic and embryocidal in animals (mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys) when given in doses approximately 3 times the maximum human dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of iron dextran in pregnant women.

### Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose [^114oA6Zh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk

Untreated iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes such as postpartum anemia. Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with IDA include increased risk for preterm delivery and low-birth-weight.

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Severe adverse reactions including circulatory failure (severe hypotension, shock including in the context of anaphylactic reaction) may occur in pregnant women with intravenous iron administration, which may have serious consequences on the fetus such as fetal bradycardia, especially during the second and third trimesters.

Data

Animal Data

Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection was administered intravenously to pregnant mice during gestation days 6 to 15 at doses of 5, 30, and 100 mg Fe/kg/day to assess embryofetal development. No teratogenic effects were seen in offspring at the highest dose, representing maternal exposure of approximately 4 times maximum human exposure based on body surface area. There were increased fetal resorptions and decreased fetal weights at doses that caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased body-weight gain and decreased food consumption.

Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection was administered intravenously to pregnant rats during gestation days 6 to 15 at doses of 4 and 20 mg Fe/kg/day to assess embryofetal development. No teratogenic effects were seen in offspring at the highest dose, representing maternal exposure of approximately 1.5 times maximum human exposure based on body surface area. There were decreases in gestation index and litter size, increased fetal resorptions, and decreased fetal weights at doses that caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased body-weight gain and decreased food consumption.

8.2. Lactation

Risk Summary

Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection contains benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a lactating woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the breastfed infant is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low-birth-weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Consider alternative iron replacement therapies without benzyl alcohol for use during lactation.

There are no available data on the presence of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection in human or animal milk, the effects on milk production, or the effects on the breastfed child.

### Ferric carboxymaltose for anemia in late pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial [^114om7Df]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In Malawian women in the third trimester of pregnancy with moderate or severe anemia detected by capillary hemoglobin measurement, treatment with a single dose of FCM was superior to SOC in reducing the prevalence of anemia prior to childbirth. In this population, treatment of six women with moderate or severe anemia with FCM would be needed to alleviate one case of anemia. FCM also reduced the prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia at each follow-up timepoint (including 1 month postpartum). FCM did not influence infant birthweight or infant hemoglobin concentration. Administration of FCM to women in health centers with limited resources appeared safe.

Our results complement the findings of our previous trial (REVAMP) that recruited Malawian women in the second trimester of pregnancy with otherwise similar eligibility criteria, and did not identify a benefit from FCM on anemia prevalence at 36 weeks' gestation or delivery, although it did indicate a benefit from FCM on anemia prevalence 4 weeks after infusion. Our findings highlight the faster response from intravenous iron compared to oral iron in raising hemoglobin concentration, as previously suggested in a network meta-analysis of trials of intravenous iron in pregnancy, and emphasize the role of intravenous iron when a rapid response is needed. FCM induced marked increases in ferritin; although the clinical significance of early post-treatment increases are uncertain, the sustained elevation 4 weeks postpartum indicates superiority of FCM on iron stores.

### Intravenous iron sucrose V / s oral ferrous fumarate for treatment of anemia in pregnancy. A randomized controlled trial [^1118b1Sx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia the world over and also the most common nutritional disorder in the world. The overall mean global figure for the incidence of gestational anemia is 25%. WHO (World Health Organisation) has estimated that prevalence of anemia in developed and developing countries in pregnant women is 14% in developed and 51% in developing countries and 65 to 75% in India. It is a direct cause of 20% of maternal mortality in India and indirect cause in 20 to 40% of maternal deaths.

Anemia interferes with the normal intrauterine growth leading to fetal loss and perinatal deaths. It is associated with increased preterm labor (28%), preeclampsia (31%) and maternal sepsis.

Over the past years, various oral, intramuscular and intravenous preparations of iron have been used for correction of IDA (Iron Deficiency Anemia) in pregnant patients. The first choice in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia for almost all patients is oral iron replacement because of its effectiveness, safety, and lower cost.

The major problem with oral iron therapy in its classic ferrous form is poor tolerability and up to 40% adverse reaction rate. The most common complaints are nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea and constipation.

Severe systemic adverse effects associated with iron dextran and iron gluconate limited the use of intravenous iron. Iron sucrose complex (ISC) is a relatively new drug, which is used intravenously for the correction of IDA. Iron sucrose complex is a widely used and safe molecule, which has become major interest to prevent iron deficiency anemia. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of intravenous iron sucrose with that of oral ferrous fumarate in iron deficiency anemia during 14 to 34 weeks of pregnancy.

### Comparison of ferric carboxymaltose and iron sucrose complex for treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy-randomised controlled trial [^111W4aUa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous Ferric Carboxymaltose. (FCM) in comparison with intravenous Iron sucrose complex (ISC) for treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy.

Methods

A randomized clinical trial was conducted from (January 2016–August 2017). at a tertiary hospital. Pregnant women diagnosed with moderate to severe iron deficiency anaemia were screened for the study. One hundred patients were randomized to receive either intravenous FCM or ISC. Primary outcome was rise in hemoglobin (Hb) from baseline after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were change in RBC indices, serum iron studies, improvement in fatigue scores, number of visits and perinatal outcome.

Results

Mean rise in Hb at 12 weeks was significantly higher in FCM group (29 g/L vs 22 g/L; p value < 0.01). FCM was associated with greater improvement in fatigue scores. Number of visits were significantly less in FCM group. No serious adverse events were noted in either group.

Conclusion

Treatment with FCM resulted in rapid replenishment of iron stores in pregnant women with significantly higher Hb rise over a 12 week period. The convenient dosing with lesser number of total doses to complete the treatment will lead to better compliance in community setting.

### Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for anaemia in pregnancy [^115C8fvP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first prospective study reporting on ferric carboxymaltose infusions in pregnancy. The key finding of our study is that in women presenting with IDA relatively late in pregnancy, a ferric carboxymaltose infusion prior to delivery significantly increased haemoglobin levels and improved iron stores. Further, we demonstrate that ferric carboxymaltose appears to be a safe and effective treatment modality for the correction of IDA, as no serious adverse events and only few minor adverse events reported. Reassuringly, patient satisfaction rating and improvement in perceived wellbeing assessed in the postnatal period was high

Many women develop iron deficiency during pregnancy, a condition that can have serious maternal and fetal implications. In our cohort, first trimester booking bloods showed only discrete anaemia with mean Hb of 113.4 g/L, but all women studied developed moderate to severe IDA. The low mean ferritin at booking of 17 μg/L represent profound iron deficiency and reiterates the importance of ferritin as a screening tool. This finding should generally result in the initiation of iron supplementation. For some women oral iron supplementation appears to be sufficient to maintain adequate iron stores. However many women develop moderate to severe IDA despite oral iron supplementation (as demonstrated in the current study where 48% of women were on oral iron), or due to drug intolerance (15% in the current study), non-adherence or pre-disposing pathology such as malabsorption or inflammatory bowel disorders. For those women intravenous iron administration may be a more effective treatment modality.

To date no prospective, controlled clinical study has been performed using ferric carboxymaltose in pregnant women. A recent Cochrane review concluded that large, good quality trials, assessing clinical outcomes (including adverse effects) as well as the effects of treatment by severity of anaemia are required. In the absence of these studies, observational safety and efficacy data may help identify potential benefits and risks. Two recent retrospective observational studies comparing ferric carboxymaltose to different intravenous iron preparations highlighted the safety and efficacy of ferric carboxymaltose.

The rapid delivery option of a large single dose of ferric carboxymaltose offers a promising treatment modality for pregnant women who need correction of iron deficiency and anaemia, over other IV iron formulations that have low dosage limits, such as iron sucrose (200 mg). The properties of ferric carboxymaltose may also reduce the burden on the patient and the health care system.

### The impact of different doses of oral iron supplementation during pregnancy: a pilot randomized trial [^113PW9kA]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Oral iron is first-line medication for iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. We conducted a pilot randomized trial to investigate the impact of different doses of oral iron supplementation started early in pregnancy on women without anemia for 4 main outcomes: recruitment and protocol compliance, adherence, maintenance of maternal hemoglobin, and side effects. At antenatal clinic visits, participants were allocated to 1 of 3 trial arms in a 1:1:1 ratio: 200 mg ferrous sulfate daily, alternate days, or 3 times per week. The participants were followed to delivery. Baseline characteristics of 300 recruited participants were well matched between trial arms. The mean proportion of tablets taken as expected per participant was 82.5% overall (72.3%, 89.6%, and 84.5% for the daily, alternate days, and 3 times a week arm, respectively). There was a lower overall adherence rate in the daily arm (47%) than in the alternate days (62%) and the 3 times per week (61%) arms. A reduction in hemoglobin between randomization and 28 weeks' gestation seemed smaller for the daily arm. A range of side effects were commonly reported at baseline before starting interventions and at later antenatal visits. Many side effects of iron overlapped with normal pregnancy symptoms. A daily iron dosing schedule might give the best opportunity for delivering an adequate iron load during pregnancy in women without anemia. Further randomized trials powered on clinical outcomes are needed to establish the clinical effectiveness of oral iron supplementation to prevent iron deficiency anemia. This study was registered (#ISRCTN12911644).

### The benefits and harms of oral iron supplementation in non-anaemic pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112DJXiC]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Findings in the context of current literature

A 2015 systematic review found that iron supplementation greatly increased maternal haemoglobin. However, the review did not differentiate participants based on initial haemoglobin status and it is unclear whether this benefit was confined only to anaemic women. Given the well-established benefit of iron supplementation for anaemic women, it is unsurprising that the average effect of supplementation across the whole pregnant population was positive. We have shown that the benefits of iron supplementation also extend to non-anaemic women. This benefit may be explained by a subpopulation of women who are iron deficient at the start of pregnancy but are not yet anaemic. For these women, iron supplementation could prevent progression to anaemia by treating the underlying deficiency. If this is the case, these women represent a clinically important population who are currently undetected and untreated in countries where antenatal iron status is not routinely assessed. Many women do not receive sufficient dietary iron to meet the increased requirements of pregnancy and ID can arise even among initially iron-replete women. A 2023 systematic review found iron supplements reduce anaemia even for women who are not iron deficient at the start of their pregnancy. Therefore, antenatal screening of iron status may be insufficient to identify all women who could benefit from iron supplements. One solution is to stratify patients by risk factors for ID, such as multiple pregnancies, diet, and age when recommending iron supplements. However, there is no evidence to suggest this strategy maximizes the benefits of iron supplementation.

A 2015 systematic review found a clear relationship between iron supplementation and GI-specific side effects in non-pregnant populations. However, these findings may not translate to pregnant populations due to the increased iron requirement and altered physiology of pregnancy. An RCT studying non-anaemic pregnant women found the prevalence of GI disturbance did not differ when taking iron supplements. The authors suggested that any perceived side effects of iron supplements may instead be due to physiological changes in pregnancy. Our findings, based on the current evidence base, are inadequate to conclude whether or not an association exists between iron supplementation and GI disturbance in pregnancy.

Other proposed side effects of iron supplementation, such as preeclampsia, prematurity, and foetal growth restriction, could result from iron overload. Conditions such as hereditary haemochromatosis may increase the risk of iron overload due to excessive iron absorption. For people without haemochromatosis, it is unclear how iron supplementation could cause iron overload in the context of normal homeostatic regulation of enteral iron absorption. The studies included in our review were inconsistent in their reporting of side effects, thus there is limited evidence to conclude on this topic.

### Safety and benefits of antenatal oral iron supplementation in low-income countries: a review [^116PTJ65]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

With normal pregnancy, maternal plasma volume expands between 6 and 34 weeks of gestation. This plasma volume expansion is followed by an increase in erythrocyte mass, which starts at 8 weeks of pregnancy and continues in the second and third trimesters. Plasma expansion exceeds erythrocyte mass, and the resulting haemodilution is believed to be a physiological adaptation to pregnancy, allowing delivery of nutrients to the foetus, protection of the mother from hypotension, and a reduction of the risks associated with haemorrhage at delivery (Gaiser, 2014).

The amount of iron needed for the expansion of erythrocyte mass is contentious. Iron supplementation will boost this expansion, and thus increase haemoglobin concentrations in the second and third trimester. As a consequence, the estimated iron needs are directly dependent on the cut‐off value for haemoglobin concentration (Trumbo et al, 2001). Reference values for haemoglobin concentration in pregnancy are not defined by functional criteria, but have been derived from samples of iron‐supplemented pregnant women in the developed countries (WHO, 1968). Against this background, it is perhaps not surprising that many studies have found that antenatal iron supplementation produces increased maternal haemoglobin concentrations and a reduced risk of anaemia at term. However, the functional significance of this haematological response has long been questioned (Beaton, 2000; Rush, 2000; Rioux & LeBlanc, 2007). It is notable that optimal pregnancy outcomes in terms of birth weight and pre‐term labour occur at a mid‐pregnancy haemoglobin of between 95 and 105 g/l (Steer, 2000), which is actually lower than the current definition of anaemia. The issue is even further complicated when considering that the distribution of haemoglobin concentration is known to vary independently of iron status in association with residential altitude, smoking, ethnicity and genetic factors (WHO, 2011; New & Wirth, 2015).

### Intermittent oral iron supplementation during pregnancy [^117E4iu3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Anaemia is a frequent condition during pregnancy, particularly among women in low- and middle-income countries. Traditionally, gestational anaemia has been prevented with daily iron supplements throughout pregnancy, but adherence to this regimen due to side effects, interrupted supply of the supplements, and concerns about safety among women with an adequate iron intake, have limited the use of this intervention. Intermittent (i.e. two or three times a week on non-consecutive days) supplementation has been proposed as an alternative to daily supplementation.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of intermittent supplementation with iron alone or in combination with folic acid or other vitamins and minerals to pregnant women on neonatal and pregnancy outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2015), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (31 July 2015) and contacted relevant organisations for the identification of ongoing and unpublished studies (31 July 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed the methodological quality of trials using standard Cochrane criteria. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and conducted checks for accuracy.

Main Results

This review includes 27 trials from 15 countries, but only 21 trials (with 5490 women) contributed data to the review. All studies compared daily versus intermittent iron supplementation. The methodological quality of included studies was mixed and most had high levels of attrition. The overall assessment of the quality of the evidence for primary infant outcomes was low and for maternal outcomes very low. Of the 21 trials contributing data, three studies provided intermittent iron alone, 14 intermittent iron + folic acid and four intermittent iron plus multiple vitamins and minerals in comparison with the same composition of supplements provided in a daily regimen. Overall, for women receiving any intermittent iron regimen (with or without other vitamins and minerals) compared with a daily regimen there was no clear evidence of differences between groups for any infant primary outcomes: low birthweight (average risk ratio (RR) 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.22; participants = 1898; studies = eight; low quality evidence), infant birthweight (mean difference (MD) 5.13 g; 95% CI -29.46 to 39.72; participants = 1939; studies = nine; low quality evidence), premature birth (average RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.39; participants = 1177; studies = five; low quality evidence), or neonatal death (average RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.04 to 5.42; participants = 795; studies = one; very low quality). None of the studies reported congenital anomalies. For maternal outcomes, there was no clear evidence of differences between groups for anaemia at term (average RR 1.22; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.80; participants = 676; studies = four; I² = 10%; very low quality). Women receiving intermittent supplementation had fewer side effects (average RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.84; participants = 1777; studies = 11; I² = 87%; very low quality) and were at lower risk of having high haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations (greater than 130 g/L) during the second or third trimester of pregnancy (average RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74; participants = 2616; studies = 15; I² = 52%; (this was not a primary outcome)) compared with women receiving daily supplements. There were no significant differences in iron-deficiency anaemia at term between women receiving intermittent or daily iron + folic acid supplementation (average RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.08 to 6.63; participants = 156; studies = one). There were no maternal deaths (six studies) or women with severe anaemia in pregnancy (six studies). None of the studies reported on iron deficiency at term or infections during pregnancy. Most of the studies included in the review (14/21 contributing data) compared intermittent oral iron + folic acid supplementation compared with daily oral iron + folic acid supplementation (4653 women) and findings for this comparison broadly reflect findings for the main comparison (any intermittent versus any daily regimen). Three studies with 464 women examined supplementation with intermittent oral iron alone compared with daily oral iron alone. There were no clear differences between groups for mean birthweight, preterm birth, maternal anaemia or maternal side effects. Other primary outcomes were not reported. Four studies with a combined sample size of 412 women compared intermittent oral iron + vitamins and minerals supplementation with daily oral iron + vitamins and minerals supplementation. Results were not reported for any of the review's infant primary outcomes. One study reported fewer maternal side effects in the intermittent iron group, and two studies that more women were anaemic at term compared with those receiving daily supplementation. Where sufficient data were available for primary outcomes, we set up subgroups to look for possible differences between studies in terms of earlier or later supplementation; women's anaemia status at the start of supplementation; higher and lower weekly doses of iron; and the malarial status of the region in which the trials were conducted. There was no clear effect of these variables on results.

Authors' Conclusions

This review is the most comprehensive summary of the evidence assessing the benefits and harms of intermittent iron supplementation in pregnant women on haematological and pregnancy outcomes. Findings suggest that intermittent regimens produced similar maternal and infant outcomes as daily supplementation but were associated with fewer side effects and reduced the risk of high levels of Hb in mid and late pregnancy, although the risk of mild anaemia near term was increased. While the quality of the evidence was assessed as low or very low, intermittent may be a feasible alternative to daily iron supplementation among those pregnant women who are not anaemic and have adequate antenatal care.

### Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose [^113pCywN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Parenteral iron administration may be associated with hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], which may have serious consequences, such as fetal bradycardia (see Clinical Considerations). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Available data from postmarketing reports with sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection use in pregnancy are insufficient to assess the risk of major birth defects and miscarriage.

Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low-birth-weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Consider alternative iron replacement therapies without benzyl alcohol.

There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations).

In the absence of maternal toxicity, sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection was not teratogenic to offspring of pregnant mice or rats at clinically relevant exposures (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively.

### Iron supplementation in singleton pregnancy: is there a benefit to doubling the dose of elemental iron in iron-deficient pregnant women? a randomized controlled trial [^117Tt9KB]. Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of doubling the 30mg dose of iron in women with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in singleton pregnancies.

Study Design

Prospective randomized controlled trial. Iron-deficient women were randomized during the second trimester to receive one or two capsules of daily iron supplement, containing 34mg of ferrous sulfate, from 17 weeks until 6 weeks postpartum. The primary outcome was hemoglobin (Hgb) at 35 weeks. Secondary outcomes included ferritin at 35 weeks, Hgb during pregnancy and postpartum, birth weights, preterm birth rate, gastrointestinal side effects, intravenous iron administration and compliance.

Results

In all, 160 women were randomized to receive one capsule and 164 received two capsules. Both groups had similar Hgb (10.1gdl -1) and ferritin (9.3 and 9.4ngl -1) at allocation. Hgb concentration in both groups was similar at 35 weeks (10.8gdl -1). There were no significant differences in any of the secondary outcomes.

Conclusion

In IDA pregnant women, a single dose of iron is as effective as a double dose.

### The benefits and harms of oral iron supplementation in non-anaemic pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1146TZrY]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Key messages

International guidelines on antenatal iron supplements for non-anaemic women vary.
We found iron supplements are likely to lower the risk of anaemia.
Evidence on the harms of iron supplements in this population is currently inconsistent.
Future research should quantify harms and determine the impact on quality of life.

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111gy53h]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — routine iron supplementation in pregnancy: In asymptomatic pregnant adolescents and adults, the USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine iron supplementation for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant persons to prevent adverse maternal and infant health outcomes (I statement).

### Iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy [^117Vr9jF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Anemia is defined as a low red blood cell count, a low hematocrit, or a low hemoglobin concentration. In pregnancy, a hemoglobin concentration of less than 11.0 g/dL in the first trimester and less than 10.5 or 11.0 g/dL in the second or third trimester (depending on the guideline used) is considered anemia. Anemia is the most common hematologic abnormality in pregnancy. Maternal anemia is associated with adverse fetal, neonatal and childhood outcomes, but causality is not established. Maternal anemia increases the likelihood of transfusion at delivery. Besides hemodilution, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for anemia with a complete blood count in the first trimester and again at 24 0/7 to 28 6/7 weeks of gestation. Mild anemia, with a hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL or higher and a mildly low or normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is likely iron deficiency anemia. A trial of oral iron can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Mild anemia with a very low MCV, macrocytic anemia, moderate anemia (hemoglobin 7.0–9.9 g/dL) or severe anemia (hemoglobin 4.0–6.9 g/dL) requires further investigation. Once a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed, first-line treatment is oral iron. New evidence suggests that intermittent dosing is as effective as daily or twice-daily dosing with fewer side effects. For patients with iron deficiency anemia who cannot tolerate, cannot absorb, or do not respond to oral iron, intravenous iron is preferred. With contemporary formulations, allergic reactions are rare.

### Blood transfusion in obstetrics [^116HGRXx]. RCOG (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, iron supplementation, RCOG 2015 guidelines recommend to initiate parenteral iron when oral iron is not tolerated or absorbed, patient compliance is in doubt, or if the patient is approaching term and there is insufficient time for oral supplementation to be effective.

### Calcium gluconate [^117Qc852]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of calcium gluconate IV in pregnant patients for all trimesters: insufficient evidence. The limited data on use in pregnant women is insufficient to know this drug's risks, including the risk of fetal harm or reproductive effects. Hypocalcemia carries risks to the mother and fetus, including increased spontaneous abortion, dysfunctional or premature labor, and preeclampsia. Infants of mothers with hypocalcemia may have neonatal hyperparathyroidism, which may lead to fetal and neonatal skeletal demineralization, subperiosteal bone resorption, osteitis fibrosa cystica, and seizures. Carefully monitor infants of hypocalcemic mothers for abnormal calcium levels; signs include neuromuscular irritability, apnea, cyanosis, and cardiac arrhythmias.

### Ferric carboxymaltose for anemia in late pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial [^111XR8FE]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Over 46% of African pregnant women are anemic. Oral iron is recommended but often suboptimal, particularly late in pregnancy. Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) could treat anemia in women in the third trimester in sub-Saharan Africa. In an open-label, individually randomized trial in antenatal clinics in southern Malawi, we randomized 590 women at 27–35 weeks of gestation with capillary hemoglobin < 10.0g dL -1 to FCM (20mg kg -1 up to 1,000mg, once at enrollment) or standard of care (60mg elemental iron, twice daily for 90 days). Participants and their infants were followed to 4 weeks postpartum. Primary outcomes were maternal anemia at 36 weeks' gestation or delivery (whichever occurred first) and neonatal birthweight. At the primary timepoint, 126 of 270 (46.7%) of women in the FCM group were anemic, compared to 170 of 271 (67.3%) women in the standard-of-care group (PR, 0.74 (95% CI 0.64, 0.87); P = 0.0002). There was no difference between groups in birthweight (mean difference 10.9g (-65.7, 87.5g); P = 0.78). No serious infusion-related reactions occurred, and there were no differences in adverse events between groups. In Malawian women in late pregnancy, FCM effectively and safely reduced anemia before childbirth. Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial registration: ANZCTR12621001239853.

### Nutrition care for chronic kidney disease during pregnancy: an updated review [^116DbLyo]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

CKD and pregnancy

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines anemia during pregnancy as Hb < 11 g/dL or hematocrit < 33% at any time during the pregnancy. Physiologic anemia of pregnancy reflects an expansion of plasma volume of 50%. Globally, the most common cause for anemia of pregnancy is iron deficiency and is related to increased iron requirements. Iron-deficiency anemia is associated with higher rates of preterm birth, LBW, and SGA newborns.

Inadequate intake of folic acid is associated with a higher risk of neural tube defects, LBW, and SGA. Maternal vitamin B12 status affects fetal growth and development, and its low levels are associated with some metabolic alterations and impaired neurodevelopment. In CKD pregnant women, anemia might also be related to a higher risk of prematurity, LBW, and adverse perinatal outcomes. Table 3 shows the reference values for iron status markers in CKD and during a healthy pregnancy.

The WHO recommends supplementing 30–60 mg/day of elemental iron daily and 400 µg/day of folic acid starting 3 months before pregnancy. In the case of anemia, 120 mg/day of oral iron is recommended. Iron IV supplementation is considered when oral iron intolerance is reported in severe anemia (< 8 g/dL). Cobalamin supplementation is not routinely recommended except for vegetarian/vegan women or those with a very low intake of animal products.

Oral iron supplementation is safe in CKD pregnancies under HD. IV iron might be used in dialysis during pregnancy with caution. Cabiddu suggests to use 20–30 mg/day of IV elemental iron (iron gluconate) until transferrin saturation reaches 30% and serum ferritin 200–300 ng/mL. Folic acid needs are higher in CKD pregnancies; supplementation has been recommended with doses ranging between 1 and 5 mg/day, considering the higher doses for pregnant women receiving HD.

### Daily oral iron supplementation during pregnancy [^115tQfKn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Iron and folic acid supplementation has been the preferred intervention to improve iron stores and prevent anaemia among pregnant women, and it is thought to improve other maternal and birth outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effects of daily oral iron supplements for pregnant women, either alone or in conjunction with folic acid, or with other vitamins and minerals as a public health intervention in antenatal care.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (10 January 2015). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (26 February 2015) and contacted relevant organisations for the identification of ongoing and unpublished studies (26 February 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effects of oral preventive supplementation with daily iron, iron + folic acid or iron + other vitamins and minerals during pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed the methodological quality of trials using standard Cochrane criteria. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and conducted checks for accuracy. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence for primary outcomes. We anticipated high heterogeneity among trials and we pooled trial results using a random-effects model and were cautious in our interpretation of the pooled results: the random-effects model gives the average treatment effect.

Main Results

We included 61 trials. Forty-four trials, involving 43,274 women, contributed data and compared the effects of daily oral supplements containing iron versus no iron or placebo. Preventive iron supplementation reduced maternal anaemia at term by 70% (risk ratio (RR) 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.46, 14 trials, 2199 women, low quality evidence), iron-deficiency anaemia at term (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.69, six trials, 1088 women), and iron deficiency at term by 57% (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.66, seven trials, 1256 women, low quality evidence). There were no clear differences between groups for severe anaemia in the second or third trimester, or maternal infection during pregnancy (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.01 to 3.20, nine trials, 2125 women, very low quality evidence; and, RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.33 to 4.46; one trial, 727 women, low quality evidence, respectively), or maternal mortality (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.01 to 8.19, two trials, 12,560 women, very low quality evidence), or reporting of side effects (RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.83 to 2.02, 11 trials, 2423 women, very low quality evidence). Women receiving iron were on average more likely to have higher haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations at term and in the postpartum period, but were at increased risk of Hb concentrations greater than 130 g/L during pregnancy, and at term. Compared with controls, women taking iron supplements less frequently had low birthweight newborns (8.4% versus 10.3%, average RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.03, 11 trials, 17,613 women, low quality evidence), and preterm babies (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.03, 13 trials, 19,286 women, moderate quality evidence). They appeared to also deliver slightly heavier babies (mean difference (MD) 23.75; 95% CI -3.02 to 50.51, 15 trials, 18,590 women, moderate quality evidence). None of these results were statistically significant. There were no clear differences between groups for neonatal death (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.18, four trials, 16,603 infants, low quality evidence), or congenital anomalies (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.33, four trials, 14,636 infants, low quality evidence). Twenty-three studies were conducted in countries that in 2011 had some malaria risk in parts of the country. In some of these countries/territories, malaria is present only in certain areas or up to a particular altitude. Only two of these studies reported malaria outcomes. There is no evidence that iron supplementation increases placental malaria. For some outcomes heterogeneity was higher than 50%.

Authors' Conclusions

Supplementation reduces the risk of maternal anaemia and iron deficiency in pregnancy but the positive effect on other maternal and infant outcomes is less clear. Implementation of iron supplementation recommendations may produce heterogeneous results depending on the populations' background risk for low birthweight and anaemia, as well as the level of adherence to the intervention.

### Venofer (iron sucrose) [^1123oGLp]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Published studies on intravenous iron sucrose treatment after the first trimester of pregnancy have not shown adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Available reports of intravenous iron sucrose use in pregnant women during the first trimester are insufficient to assess the risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated IDA in pregnancy as well as risks to the fetus associated with maternal severe hypersensitivity reactions (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies of iron sucrose administered to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at elemental iron doses equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically-recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy should be treated. Untreated IDA in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes such as post-partum anemia. Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with IDA include increased risk for preterm delivery and low birth weight.

### Sodium ferric gluconate complex (Ferrlecit) [^112o2Dm5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of sodium ferric gluconate complex IV (also known as Ferrlecit) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor for maternal hypersensitivity reactions and fetal bradycardia. Sodium ferric gluconate complex injection contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received IV administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs. Consider alternative iron replacement therapies without benzyl alcohol during pregnancy. Fetal adverse reactions, including fetal bradycardia, have been associated with maternal hypersensitivity reactions to parenteral iron products, especially during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus.

### The impact of response to iron therapy on maternal and neonatal outcomes among pregnant women with anemia [^114WEvAC]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

Selection criteria for study patients

The use of the PeriBank database for this study was approved by the Baylor College of Medicine IRB (H-45877). All women with singleton pregnancies and sufficient prenatal care from August 2011 to November 2019 were included. For women with ≥ 2 pregnancies within this time frame, the first delivery in the PeriBank database was chosen for inclusion for the overall analysis. Sufficient prenatal care was defined by the Kotelchuck Adequacy of Prenatal Care Index. This model has been previously validated and took into account the number of prenatal visits and gestational age at initiation of prenatal care and delivery. Sufficient prenatal care was defined as beginning prenatal care before 20 weeks of gestation and attending 50% to 100% of recommended prenatal visits based on gestational age at delivery. Patients enrolled in PeriBank receive prenatal care at several clinics before delivering at our 2 enrollment and collection sites, where they were recruited at the time of delivery. Their prenatal care followed the ACOG recommendations and institutional guidelines for prenatal care. At our institution, patients were initially treated with supplemental iron therapy if their hemoglobin is below the ACOG cutoffs for anemia. If iron studies were performed at a later time and indicated iron deficiency, they were continued on iron supplementation for the remainder of the pregnancy. Moreover, most clinics performed hemoglobin electrophoresis to rule out hemoglobinopathies in all patients.

Patients with another known cause of anemia, such as vitamin B12 deficiency, thalassemia, or sickle cell disease, and those who were actively bleeding on admission to labor and delivery were excluded from the study. Furthermore, patients with an antenatal diagnosis of known or suspected placenta accreta spectrum disorder (including previa, accreta, increta, and percreta) were excluded as they often received iron prophylactically at our institution. Maternal demographics, diagnoses, medications, and outcomes were uniformly abstracted for patients.

Those patients who received iron therapy other than that included in a prenatal vitamin were considered to have a diagnosis of iron deficiency. Supplements included the brand names and generic forms of ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous glycinate. The administration of intravenous (IV) iron was not reported consistently and so was not included in this analysis. The sample size for this analysis was exhaustive for the number of participants meeting the criteria in the database.

### Safety and benefits of antenatal oral iron supplementation in low-income countries: a review [^114kSojo]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Safety of antenatal iron interventions in women with high haemoglobin concentration

There are concerns that antenatal iron supplementation in women with high haemoglobin concentration (above 130–135 g/l) in the second and third trimesters can lead to an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, such as premature delivery and low birth weight (Peña‐Rosas & Viteri, 2009). Most reports on this association concerned observational studies e.g. (Murphy et al, 1986; Zhou et al, 1998; Steer, 2000; Xiong et al, 2000; Casanueva & Viteri, 2003), which may be confounded because high haemoglobin concentrations may also be due to other pregnancy complications (e.g. a failure of the normal pregnancy‐induced physiological plasma volume expansion, pre‐eclampsia, hypertension) that can cause maternal and perinatal deaths.

In a randomised trial in Iran, antenatal supplementation with iron (50 mg as ferrous sulphate) in women with haemoglobin concentration ≥ 132 g/l in the early stage of the second trimester resulted in an increased risk of women with hypertension disorder [2·7% vs. 0·8%, difference: 1·9% (95% CI: −0·2% to 4·1%)] and small‐for‐gestational age neonates [15·4% vs. 10·1%, difference: 5·3% (95% CI: 0·5–10·2%)] (Ziaei et al, 2007). However, in a recent large trial among Chinese pregnant women with haemoglobin concentration > 145 g/l at enrolment (gestational age < 20 weeks), supplementation with iron (30 mg as ferrous fumarate) increased birth weight by 91 g (95% CI: 3–180 g) (Wang et al, 2016). It should also be noted that in most low‐income countries, women with haemoglobin concentrations > 130 g/l constitute a small proportion of the total number of pregnancies.

### Ferric carboxymaltose for anemia in late pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial [^1167cnE9]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Study interventions and procedures

The trial operated in government-run primary health care facilities using local infrastructure. In all clinics, government staff (for example, nurses) received training and were trained by study staff to eventually administer the study intervention. The rooms were equipped with medications, fluids and oxygen. Women in the intervention group received a single dose of FCM (CSL-Vifor, purchased commercially), 20 mg kg −1 up to 1,000 mg, diluted in 250 mL saline, given intravenously over 15 min. Women were clinically monitored post infusion and fetal heartbeat monitored by fetoscope. Women in the SOC group were provided oral iron (60 mg elemental iron as ferrous sulfate, twice daily for 90 days, aligned to Malawian government policy) accompanied by the standardized educational message aligned with local practice (for example, frequency of use, safe storage, common side effects). In addition, all participants received intermittent preventive treatment of malaria (IPTp) with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine as recommended in national guidelines: 1,500 mg sulfadoxine and 75 mg pyrimethamine (SP, 3 tablets of SP strength at 500 mg/25 mg). Following enrollment and treatment, participants were followed up at 36 weeks' estimated gestation, delivery and 1 month postpartum.

Eligibility assessments and informed consent procedures were undertaken by study staff. The study staff also provided all the initial interventions until government health workers were sufficiently trained, after which government health staff administered the interventions. All outcome assessments were undertaken by study staff.

Data were recorded in digital form with REDCap, using electronic tablets, and backed up daily to a local backup server at TRUE, Blantyre, Malawi, with a deidentified fortnightly backup to WEHI, Melbourne, Australia.

### The benefits and harms of oral iron supplementation in non-anaemic pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11323CVK]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Iron supplements likely benefit non-anaemic pregnant women. The size of this benefit will vary based on individual context, and the impact on quality of life remains to be quantified. However, we estimate for every ten women taking iron, one fewer will develop anaemia. In contrast, there is insufficient evidence to quantify the harms of iron supplements in the same population. Therefore, this review highlights four important avenues for future research; quantification of harms, optimization of dosing regimens, determining the clinical relevance of any benefit, and identifying subpopulations with disparate outcomes. Exploring these areas will enable women, clinicians and guideline developers to make informed decisions regarding prophylactic iron supplementation.

### Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose for anaemia in pregnancy [^112i9QSd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Iron Sucrose and Ferric Carboxymaltose are dextran free intravenous iron alternatives. When compared to oral iron in pregnancy iron sucrose is superior with respect to the rate of both haemoglobin increase and iron store replenishment, combined with a good safety profile. Serious adverse effects are rare with iron sucrose, however minor side effects occur in up to 18% of patients which may in part be attributed to its non-physiological physical properties (high pH and high osmolarity). Ferric carboxymaltose is a newer dextran-free iron formulation with a near neutral pH, physiological osmolarity and increased bioavailability which allows for single dose, short 15 minute infusion time and higher dosing (up to 1000 mg). These properties make ferric carboxymaltose an attractive alternative to iron sucrose in terms of risk profile, efficacy, patient comfort and convenience, staff and institutional resource utilization.

To date, there are few clinical studies using ferric carboxymaltose in pregnant women. The primary aim of this study was to assess the use of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose in the correction of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnant women. The secondary aims were to determine the extent and severity of adverse effects of ferric carboxymaltose, and to evaluate the perceived quality of life of women in the post-partum period.

### Anemia in pregnancy: ACOG practice bulletin, number 233 [^116if1iK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of ferrous sulfate PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters: generally acceptable for use. Maternal anemia increases the risk of low birth weight, premature delivery, and impaired cognitive and behavioral development. The ACOG recommends screening all pregnant women for anemia with a CBC in the first trimester and again at 24–28 weeks of gestation. The ACOG recommends low-dose iron supplementation starting in the first trimester to reduce the prevalence of maternal anemia at delivery. Oral iron preparations are the preferred first-line treatment for iron deficiency in pregancy.

### Intermittent oral iron supplementation during pregnancy [^113o32cK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Anaemia is a frequent condition during pregnancy, particularly among women from developing countries who have insufficient iron intake to meet increased iron needs of both the mother and the fetus. Traditionally, gestational anaemia has been prevented with the provision of daily iron supplements throughout pregnancy, but adherence to this regimen due to side effects, interrupted supply of the supplements, and concerns about safety among women with an adequate iron intake, have limited the use of this intervention. Intermittent (i.e. one, two or three times a week on non-consecutive days) supplementation with iron alone or in combination with folic acid or other vitamins and minerals has recently been proposed as an alternative to daily supplementation.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of intermittent supplementation with iron alone or in combination with folic acid or other vitamins and minerals to pregnant women on neonatal and pregnancy outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (23 March 2012). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for ongoing studies and contacted relevant organisations for the identification of ongoing and unpublished studies (23 March 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed the methodological quality of trials using standard Cochrane criteria. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and conducted checks for accuracy.

Main Results

This review includes 21 trials from 13 different countries, but only 18 trials (with 4072 women) reported on our outcomes of interest and contributed data to the review. All of these studies compared daily versus intermittent iron supplementation. Three studies provided iron alone, 12 iron+folic acid and three more iron plus multiple vitamins and minerals. Their methodological quality was mixed and most had high levels of attrition. Overall, there was no clear evidence of differences between groups for infant primary outcomes: low birthweight (average risk ratio (RR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.52, seven studies), infant birthweight (mean difference MD -8.62 g; 95% CI -52.76 g to 35.52 g, eight studies), premature birth (average RR 1.82; 95% CI 0.75 to 4.40, four studies). None of the studies reported neonatal deaths or congenital anomalies. For maternal outcomes, there was no clear evidence of differences between groups for anaemia at term (average RR 1.22; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.80, four studies) and women receiving intermittent supplementation had less side effects (average RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.84, 11 studies) than those receiving daily supplements. Women receiving intermittent supplements were also at lower risk of having high haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations (greater than 130 g/L) during the second or third trimester of pregnancy (average RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.67, 13 studies). There were no significant differences in iron-deficiency anaemia between women receiving intermittent or daily iron+folic acid supplementation (average RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.08 to 6.63, 1 study). There were no maternal deaths (six studies) or women with severe anaemia in pregnancy (six studies). None of the studies reported on iron deficiency at term or infections during pregnancy. Where sufficient data were available for primary outcomes, we set up subgroups to look for possible differences between studies in terms of earlier or later supplementation; women's anaemia status at the start of supplementation; higher and lower weekly doses of iron; and the malarial status of the region in which the trials were conducted. There was no clear effect of these variables on the results of the review.

Authors' Conclusions

The present systematic review is the most comprehensive summary of the evidence assessing the benefits and harms of intermittent iron supplementation regimens in pregnant women on haematological and pregnancy outcomes. The findings suggest that intermittent iron+folic acid regimens produce similar maternal and infant outcomes at birth as daily supplementation but are associated with fewer side effects. Women receiving daily supplements had increased risk of developing high levels of Hb in mid and late pregnancy but were less likely to present mild anaemia near term. Although the evidence is limited and the quality of the trials was low or very low, intermittent may be a feasible alternative to daily iron supplementation among those pregnant women who are not anaemic and have adequate antenatal care.

### Sodium ferric gluconate complex (Ferrlecit) [^117NgXwo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Parenteral iron administration may be associated with hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], which may have serious consequences, such as fetal bradycardia (see Clinical Considerations). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Available data from postmarketing reports with Ferrlecit use in pregnancy are insufficient to assess the risk of major birth defects and miscarriage.

Ferrlecit contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low-birth-weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol–containing drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Consider alternative iron replacement therapies without benzyl alcohol.

There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations).

In the absence of maternal toxicity, Ferrlecit was not teratogenic to offspring of pregnant mice or rats at clinically relevant exposures (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%–4% and 15%–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Untreated iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes such as postpartum anemia. Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with IDA include increased risk for preterm delivery and low birth weight.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions

Severe adverse reactions including circulatory failure (severe hypotension, shock including in the context of anaphylactic reaction) may occur in pregnant women with intravenous iron administration, which may have serious consequences on the fetus such as fetal bradycardia, especially during the second and third trimesters.

### Iron preparations for women of reproductive age with iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy (FRIDA): a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116QT5Cw]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Numerous iron preparations are available for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy. We aimed to provide a summary of the effectiveness and safety of iron preparations used in this setting.

Methods

We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, trial registers, and grey literature for trials published in any language from Jan 1, 2011, to Feb 28, 2021. We included trials including pregnant women with iron deficiency anaemia and evaluating iron preparations, irrespective of administration route, with at least 60 mg of elemental iron, in comparison with another iron or non-iron preparation. Three authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and did a risk of bias assessment using the Cochrane tool (version 1.0). The primary outcome was the effectiveness of iron preparations, evaluated by changes in haemoglobin concentration at 4 weeks from baseline. The secondary outcomes were change in serum ferritin concentration at 4 weeks from baseline and treatment-related severe and non-severe adverse events. We did random-effects pairwise and network meta-analyses. Side-effects were reported descriptively for each trial. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018100822.

Findings

Among 3037 records screened, 128 full-text articles were further assessed for eligibility. Of the 53 eligible trials (reporting on 9145 women), 30 (15 interventions; 3243 women) contributed data to the network meta-analysis for haemoglobin and 15 (nine interventions; 1396 women) for serum ferritin. The risk of bias varied across the trials contributing to network meta-analysis, with 22 of 30 trials in the network meta-analysis for haemoglobin judged to have a high or medium global risk of bias. Compared with oral ferrous sulfate, intravenous iron sucrose improved both haemoglobin (mean difference 7·17 g/L, 95% CI 2·62–11·73; seven trials) and serum ferritin (mean difference 49·66 μg/L, 13·63–85·69; four trials), and intravenous ferric carboxymaltose improved haemoglobin (mean difference 8·52 g/L, 0·51–16·53; one trial). The evidence for other interventions compared with ferrous sulfate was insufficient. The most common side-effects with oral iron preparations were gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, and altered bowel movements). Side-effects were less common with parenteral iron preparations, although these included local pain, skin irratation, and, on rare occasions, allergic reactions.

Interpretation

Iron preparations for treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy vary in effectiveness, with good evidence of benefit for intravenous iron sucrose and some evidence for intravenous ferric carboxymaltose. Clinicians and policy makers should consider the effectiveness of individual preparations before administration, to ensure effective treatment.

Funding

### Iron sucrose (Venofer) [^111EUtYR]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of iron sucrose IV (also known as Venofer, Venofer) in pregnant patients for third trimester: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Fetal adverse reactions, including fetal bradycardia, have been associated with maternal hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Data with intravenous iron sucrose use during human pregnancy have not shown adverse maternal or fetal outcomes; however, reports of intravenous iron sucrose use in pregnant women during the first trimester are insufficient to assess the risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Treat iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy because there are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy. The drug iron sucrose IV (also known as Venofer, Venofer) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^117MppWx]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Types of oral iron supplements

There are various types of oral iron supplements (Table 1). The two major classes are ferrous (Fe 2+) salts and ferric (Fe 3+) complexes. Other types include carbonyl iron and heme iron polypeptide.

Ferrous salts

The most common oral iron supplements are ferrous salts with sulfate, fumarate or gluconate. Others include ferrous glycine sulfate, bisglycinate, ascorbate, carbonate, tartrate, iodine, chloride, sodium citrate, aspartate or succinate.

Ferrous salts are available as tablets or syrup. Because dissolved Fe 2+ is readily oxidized to insoluble Fe 3+, a main challenge for liquid supplements is to maintain Fe 2+ reduced; this is done with the addition of excipients such as sodium bisulfite. Slow-release (enteric-coated) ferrous salt formulations have also been designed with the aim of reducing gastrointestinal adverse effects, while preserving iron absorption.

### Comparison of ferric carboxymaltose and iron sucrose complex for treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy-randomised controlled trial [^112FyREr]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia is one of the major health issues worldwide. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of nutritional deficiency affecting both developed and developing countries. An estimate by WHO attributes about 591,000 perinatal deaths and 115,000 maternal deaths globally to iron deficiency anemia directly or indirectly. Prevalence of anemia in South Asian countries is the highest in the world. About half of the global maternal deaths due to anemia occur in South Asian countries and India contributes to about 80% of it. Anemia affects all age groups starting from puberty and adolescence to perimenopausal age. The reasons for high incidence of anemia in India include low dietary intake of iron, poor bio-availability of iron, phytate-rich Indian diet, faulty food habits, chronic blood loss during menses and high prevalence of infections like malaria and hookworm infestations. The condition gets aggravated in pregnancy due to increased demand of the growing fetus.

Prophylactic oral iron is recommended during pregnancy to meet the increased requirement during the antenatal period. The main issue with oral iron therapy is compliance due to associated gastrointestinal side effects like bloating, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, constipation, and dark stools.

Also, oral therapy is not sufficient for treatment of moderate to severe anemia, especially in the late second and third trimester. Parenteral therapy promises a better response in these patients and can obviate the need for blood transfusions in the antenatal and postpartum period. The most commonly used iron preparation for anemia in pregnancy is iron sucrose complex (ISC). It has negligible safety issues and no test dose is required. The only disadvantage with iron sucrose is limited dose per sitting. The maximum permissible dose is 300 mg per sitting or 600 mg per week. This adds to the total cost of therapy as it requires multiple visits.

The latest addition in i.v. iron preparations is Ferric Carboxymaltose (FCM), which is a dextran free type I iron complex. A lot of studies have been published on the use of FCM for treatment of anemia in the postpartum period and other diseases with associated anemia. But, there is limited literature on the use of FCM in pregnancy. There are very few prospective studies on FCM in pregnancy and no randomized controlled studies comparing FCM and Iron sucrose complex in pregnancy. The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, cost effectivity of FCM compared with ISC for treatment of moderate to severe iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy.

### Effect of high-dose iron supplements on fractional zinc absorption and status in pregnant women [^114uvNy4]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Women have an increased risk of iron deficiency during pregnancy because of the demands of the developing fetus. Iron supplements are commonly advocated as a prophylactic treatment and are generally taken with meals to reduce side effects, but iron can interfere with the absorption of zinc.

Objective

The aim was to determine the effect of consuming an iron supplement (100 mg Fe/d as ferrous gluconate) with meals from 16 wk gestation to term on zinc status and absorption.

Design

Stable-isotope techniques were used to measure zinc status (exchangeable zinc pool, EZP) and fractional zinc absorption (FZA) in early and late pregnancy from a meal consumed at a different time from that of iron supplement or placebo consumption in 6 women given iron supplements and 7 given a placebo.

Results

FZA increased during pregnancy, independent of iron supplementation. FZA was significantly higher (P < 0.001) at week 34 than at weeks 16 and 24, and urinary zinc excretion was higher at week 34 than at week 16 (P = 0.02). The size of the EZP remained unchanged throughout pregnancy and was unaffected by iron supplementation. The iron status of iron-supplemented women was higher than that of the placebo group.

Conclusions

In iron-replete pregnant women who consumed a Western diet, no detectable adverse effects on zinc metabolism were observed after ingestion of 100 mg Fe/d. An increase in the efficiency of zinc absorption was observed during late pregnancy.

### Efficacy and safety of ferric carboxymaltose versus ferrous sulfate for iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: subgroup analysis of Korean women [^115zGm6r]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

According to worldwide estimates, 30% of women of reproductive age are anemic and at least half of these cases are attributed to iron deficiency (ID). The prevalence of anemia is 14–52% in women without iron supplementation and 25% even with supplementation, depending on iron dosage. Throughout pregnancy, total iron requirements increase to meet the major hematologic changes of the mother and the increasing demands of the growing fetus. This increased demand for iron puts the mother and offspring at risk of developing iron-deficiency anemia (IDA). IDA during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, fetal growth restriction, and increased newborn and maternal mortality. Furthermore, ID may predispose a person to postpartum IDA, peripartum blood transfusion, infections, and precipitate heart failure.

IDA during pregnancy is often treated with oral iron supplement. However, due to gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation, compliance is often poor and results in subsequent discontinuation. As such, intravenous iron administration are increasingly being recommended for women who are non-compliant with oral iron, have severe IDA, or those who require rapid intervention. Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM; Ferinject ®) is a dextran-free parenteral iron preparation that allows rapid administration of weekly high single doses of iron and had been approved for the treatment of IDA by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in 2007, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013, and Korea FDA in 2010.

In the FER-ASAP (FERrric carboxymaltose-Assessment of SAfety and efficacy in Pregnancy) study, pregnant women (gestational weeks 16–33) with IDA were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to FCM or ferrous sulfate (FS) for 12 weeks. Hemoglobin (Hb) levels improved at comparable rates in both treatments; however, significantly higher number of women achieved anemia correction within a shorter time frame with FCM (84%) than with FS (70%; P = 0.031). FCM treatment significantly improved the quality of life (QoL) from baseline up to delivery, and there were markedly fewer gastrointestinal treatment-related adverse events (AEs) with FCM (11%) than with FS (15%).
