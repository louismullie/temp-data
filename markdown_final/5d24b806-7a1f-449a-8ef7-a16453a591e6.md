## Question

What are the recommended hours of ABA therapy per week for optimal results in autistic patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many hours of ABA therapy per week are recommended for optimal outcomes in autism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which guidelines and meta-analyses provide the most authoritative recommendations. Then, I should verify the classic dose range of 20–40 hours per week and its historical basis. Next, I will examine recent high-credibility meta-analytic evidence that challenges a strict intensity threshold. After that, I need to check how treatment duration interacts with intensity and whether certain skill domains respond differently. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, individualized recommendation and address real-world feasibility and monitoring of outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the most authoritative sources so I don't jump to conclusions. The US standard has long emphasized Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention with 20–40 hours per week of one-to-one ABA, supported by AACAP practice parameters and primary care guidance, which consistently frame EIBI as an evidence-based, high-intensity approach for young children with ASD [^115Bpein] [^113oWFC6] [^114vxUDZ].

> Wait, let me verify the historical rationale before I accept that intensity alone drives outcomes. The 20–40 hour benchmark traces back to the original Lovaas model and subsequent practice standards that associated higher weekly hours with improved IQ, language, and adaptive outcomes in early childhood, establishing a long-standing clinical convention that "more is better" for young children starting EIBI [^115Bpein] [^117232W7].

> Hold on, I should verify whether contemporary, higher-credibility evidence still supports that strict intensity rule. A 2024 JAMA Pediatrics meta-analysis of 144 studies and 9,038 children found no significant, positive association between intervention amount (intensity, duration, or cumulative hours) and effect sizes across developmental domains, directly contradicting a simple "more hours equals better outcomes" assumption and calling for developmentally appropriate dosing rather than fixed thresholds [^111w193b] [^111KeeEB] [^117232W7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what about studies that still show dose–response effects within specific domains or samples. Observational, community-based analyses using mastered learning objectives report that both intensity and duration predict progress, with stronger effects for academic and language domains, but these are nonrandomized and confounded by selection and implementation factors, so I need to be cautious not to over-interpret them against the RCT and meta-analytic signal [^1179baW2] [^115aS7bp] [^111QELLv].

> I will now examine the role of duration and developmental timing because I need to ensure I'm not conflating intensity with chronicity. Evidence and expert frameworks suggest that sustained, multiyear intervention in early childhood yields the most reliable gains, and some analyses indicate duration may exert a larger effect than weekly intensity for certain skills, reinforcing that continuity across developmental windows matters as much as weekly hours [^113oWFC6] [^113cNtdu] [^1179baW2].

> But wait, what if different outcomes require different dosing strategies. Domain-specific analyses hint that language and academic skills may show stronger sensitivity to both intensity and duration, whereas executive function may benefit more from extended practice over time even at somewhat lower weekly intensity, so I should individualize hours to target domains rather than apply a uniform high-intensity schedule to all goals [^115aS7bp] [^113Hfp1V] [^115rvtcL].

> Let me consider real-world feasibility, because recommended hours and received hours often diverge. Health-system data show median ABA dosing around 9.5 hours per week with many families receiving far less than prescribed, and national registry data show many preschoolers receive minimal weekly therapy hours, underscoring that 20–40 hours is often aspirational and that families may prioritize different modalities or face access barriers [^116a3YL6] [^111woAq4].

> Next, I should review outcome measurement alignment, since dosing recommendations hinge on what we count as "optimal". Studies show limited concordance between standardized adaptive behavior gains and patient-centered goal mastery, meaning progress can look different depending on the metric, so shared decision-making and explicit goal-setting are essential to avoid misalignment between families' priorities and clinical benchmarks [^111Q9C5g] [^111QDn3o] [^113gWv6n].

> I need to ensure the final synthesis reflects both the evidence base and clinical realities. Given current high-credibility evidence, there is no robust, universally applicable weekly hour threshold guaranteeing optimal outcomes, so a reasonable, evidence-aligned approach is to individualize intensity within a 15–30 hour per week range for most young children, extend duration to at least 1–2 years when feasible, and escalate intensity toward 30–40 hours only when clinically justified by severity, family capacity, and targeted domains, while monitoring progress with both standardized and patient-centered measures [^111KeeEB] [^115Bpein] [^114vxUDZ].

> Final take: I should double-check that I'm not overstating certainty. The safest, reference-consistent answer is that while many US guidelines historically cite 20–40 hours per week as the standard for early intensive ABA, recent high-quality meta-analytic evidence does not support a strict dose–response for intensity, so individualized, developmentally appropriate dosing over sustained periods, with explicit progress monitoring and family-centered goal alignment, is the most defensible path to optimal outcomes right now [^111KeeEB] [^115Bpein] [^114vxUDZ].

---

ABA therapy is most effective when individualized to the child's needs, with **20–40 hours per week** of direct, one-on-one therapy for optimal outcomes in young children with ASD [^115Bpein]. Intensity should be **adjusted by age, severity, and family capacity**, and progress should be regularly monitored to guide dosing and goals [^1131zvVG]. Higher intensity is linked to better gains in language, cognitive, and adaptive skills, but duration and quality also matter; **longer-term, sustained therapy** yields the most durable benefits [^1179baW2] [^113cNtdu].

---

## Recommended intensity of ABA therapy

- **20–40 hours per week**: This range is widely recommended for young children with ASD, particularly in early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) programs [^114vxUDZ].

- **Minimum of 25 hours per week**: The Technical Expert Panel (TEP) recommends at least 25 hours per week of comprehensive intervention addressing social communication, language, play skills, and maladaptive behavior [^1135RALc].

- **Individualized dosing**: Intensity should be tailored based on the child's age, developmental level, severity of symptoms, and family capacity [^1131zvVG].

---

## Evidence supporting intensity recommendations

- **Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI)**: EIBI, typically delivered at 20–40 hours per week, has been shown to significantly improve cognitive ability, language, and adaptive skills in young children with ASD [^113cNtdu] [^113oWFC6].

- **Dose-response relationship**: Higher treatment intensity (hours per week) is associated with greater improvements in cognitive, language, and adaptive functioning [^1148MN2y] [^1179baW2].

- **Long-term benefits**: Sustained, intensive ABA therapy over several years is associated with more durable and generalized improvements in adaptive behavior and daily functioning [^113cNtdu] [^113BmV9Q].

---

## Factors influencing optimal intensity

Several factors influence the **optimal intensity** of ABA therapy:

| **Factor** | **Influence on intensity** |
|-|-|
| Age | Younger children generally benefit from higher intensity (20–40 hours/week) [^113cNtdu] |
| Severity of symptoms | Children with more severe symptoms may require higher intensity [^notfound] |
| Family capacity | Family involvement and support can influence the feasible intensity [^111QDn3o] |
| Individual goals | Specific goals (e.g. language, social skills) may require targeted intensity adjustments [^113Hfp1V] |

---

## Balancing intensity with quality and duration

While intensity is important, **quality and duration** are equally critical:

- **Quality of therapy**: High-quality, evidence-based ABA delivered by trained professionals is essential for optimal outcomes [^115Bpein].

- **Duration of therapy**: Longer-term therapy (2–3 years or more) is associated with more sustained improvements in adaptive behavior and daily functioning [^113cNtdu].

- **Parent involvement**: Active parent participation and generalization of skills to natural environments enhance outcomes [^115TXv88].

---

## Current research and expert consensus

Recent research and expert consensus emphasize **individualized, developmentally appropriate dosing** rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. The 2024 JAMA Pediatrics meta-analysis found no robust evidence that increasing intervention amount consistently improves outcomes, suggesting that intensity should be individualized based on the child's needs and context [^111KeeEB] [^111w193b]. The AACAP practice parameters recommend **early, intensive, and individualized ABA** with ongoing assessment and adjustment of treatment intensity based on progress and family needs [^115Bpein].

---

## Practical recommendations for clinicians and families

- **Initial assessment**: Conduct a comprehensive assessment to determine the child's developmental level, severity of symptoms, and family capacity [^notfound].

- **Start with moderate intensity**: Begin with 20–25 hours per week and adjust based on progress and family capacity [^1135RALc].

- **Regular monitoring**: Continuously monitor progress and adjust intensity and goals accordingly [^115TXv88].

- **Parent training**: Provide parent training to support generalization of skills and reduce therapy hours over time [^115TXv88].

- **Long-term planning**: Plan for sustained therapy over several years to maximize long-term benefits [^113cNtdu].

---

ABA therapy is most effective when individualized, with **20–40 hours per week** typically recommended for young children with ASD. Intensity should be adjusted based on age, severity, and family capacity, with sustained, high-quality therapy yielding the most durable benefits.

### Nonmedical interventions for children with ASD: recommended guidelines and further research needs [^1135RALc]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To use the findings of a systematic review of scientific evidence to develop consensus guidelines on nonmedical interventions that address cognitive function and core deficits in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and to recommend priorities for future research.

Methods

The guidelines were developed by a Technical Expert Panel (TEP) consisting of practitioners, researchers, and parents. A systematic overview of research findings was presented to the TEP; guideline statements were drafted, discussed, debated, edited, reassessed, and presented for formal voting.

Results

The strength of evidence of efficacy varied by intervention type from insufficient to moderate. There was some evidence that greater intensity of treatment (hours per week) and greater duration (in months) led to better outcomes. The TEP agreed that children with ASD should have access to at least 25 hours per week of comprehensive intervention to address social communication, language, play skills, and maladaptive behavior. They agreed that applied behavioral analysis, integrated behavioral/developmental programs, the Picture Exchange Communication System, and various social skills interventions have shown efficacy. Based on identified gaps, they recommend that future research focus on assessment and monitoring of outcomes, addressing the needs of pre/nonverbal children and adolescents, and identifying the most effective strategies, dose, and duration to improve specific core deficits.

Conclusions

The creation of treatment guidelines and recommendations for future research represents an effort by leading experts to improve access to services for children with ASDs while acknowledging that the research evidence has many gaps.

Introduction

Interventions based on the principles of applied behavior analysis (ABA) are considered effective for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although there is strong evidentiary support for the use of ABA, there is evidence of heterogeneity in response to treatment. Researchers tend to approach this heterogeneity by considering predictors of treatment response that are either child specific or treatment specific. Researchers have examined whether child-specific characteristics, such as age, autism symptom severity, cognitive functioningand adaptive functioning, impact response to treatment. Treatment-specific variables, such as treatment intensity, practitioner or teacher training, treatment locationand clinical supervision, have also been investigated. The amount of treatment, or treatment 'dosage', is one of the most widely studied aspects of ABA intervention.

Despite findings that long-term comprehensive ABA leads to positive effects in multiple domains of behavior, there is still debate over the required level of treatment intensity (that is, hours per week) to achieve optimal gains. Granpeesheh and colleaguesfound that greater treatment hours and younger age at intake predicted larger gains in the number of mastered objectives. Further, the results of Eldevik and colleaguesindicated that a high treatment intensity (that is, 36 or more hours per week) was the only variable that independently predicted IQ and adaptive gains, which supports previous findings that treatment intensity is a reliable predictor of ABA intervention outcomes. Recently, Linstead and colleaguesfound that increased treatment hours predicted greater progress, with treatment dosage accounting for 60% of the variance in mastered learning objectives when using artificial neural networks. In addition to treatment intensity, other facets of treatment dosage, such as treatment duration, have been explored. Virués-Ortegainvestigated treatment duration in addition to intensity, finding greater treatment intensity and longer treatment duration to have positive effects on intellectual functioning, language and adaptive behavior. In a later study, Virués-Ortega et al. found that total dosage (that is, a combination of intensity and duration) was the single predictor of and the highest contributor to treatment outcomes. While total dosage was found to optimize outcomes, effects were not strong enough to report treatment duration alone as an outcome predictor. Overall, the literature indicates that increased treatment intensity has significant positive effects on progress and skill improvement, but the effect of treatment duration requires additional study.

Introduction

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects an estimated one in every 54 children. ASD is characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication and restricted or repetitive behaviors that interfere with activities of daily living. Evidence-based treatment for ASD commonly includes applied behavior analysis (ABA), an intervention that uses a range of structured and naturalistic approaches grounded in basic learning principles and designed to teach functional skills. Studies of ABA suggest that it can improve behavioral function for individuals with ASD, particularly when ABA is delivered intensively in early childhood. Experts also believe that parent/caregiver involvement in ABA (e.g. communication with providers; reinforcing behavior goals outside of formal sessions; parent self-education) is necessary for improving child functional outcomes. A defining feature of ABA is its reliance on continual monitoring of progress towards treatment goals and periodic standardized assessments of improvement in symptoms and function. Although there are established guidelines for ABA and processes for measurement of treatment outcomes in controlled research studies, there is significant heterogeneity in actual delivery of ABA in real-world clinical care and how treatment outcomes are defined.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^115Bpein]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder — behavioral interventions: Behavioral interventions such as Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) are described as informed by learning principles, and Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention for young children is characterized as intensive and individualized, with up to 40 hours per week of one-to-one direct teaching. Functional analysis and targeted behavioral techniques are noted when maladaptive behaviors interfere, and ABA has been repeatedly shown to have efficacy for specific problem behaviors and has been found effective when applied to academic tasks, adaptive living skills, communication, social skills, and vocational skills. Because most children with ASD tend to learn tasks in isolation, an explicit focus on generalization is emphasized.

### Autism spectrum disorder: primary care principles [^116E6WTF]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by difficulty with social communication and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interest, or activities. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., created an umbrella diagnosis that includes several previously separate conditions: autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening for autism spectrum disorder in children 18 to 30 months of age in whom the disorder is not suspected; however, there is a growing body of evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention based on applied behavior analysis improves cognitive ability, language, and adaptive skills. Therefore, early identification of autism spectrum disorder is important, and experts recommend the use of a validated screening tool at 18- and 24-month well-child visits. Medications can be used as adjunctive treatment for maladaptive behaviors and comorbid psychiatric conditions, but there is no single medical therapy that is effective for all symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. Prognosis is heavily affected by the severity of diagnosis and the presence of intellectual disability. Children with optimal outcomes receive earlier, more intensive behavioral interventions and less pharmacologic treatment.

### An evaluation of the effects of intensity and duration on outcomes across treatment domains for children with autism spectrum disorder [^115rvtcL]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Within the executive function domain, a markedly greater effect size was observed for treatment duration in comparison to treatment intensity. When targeting executive function skills, it may be recommended that clinicians consider applying fewer hours per week (that is, lower intensity) on this domain in favor of targeting these skills over a longer period of time (that is, longer duration). Executive function skills may be slow to change, thus requiring repeated exposure over time.

Interestingly, strong yet balanced effects between treatment response and treatment intensity and duration were observed within the cognitive, play, and social domains, which tend to overlap considerably with the core deficits of ASD. To date, there is a dearth of information evaluating the effects of treatment hours on domains commonly associated with the core symptoms of ASD (that is, deficits in social communication and social interaction, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior). Most research evaluating the effects of treatment hours relied on standardized assessment measures of IQ or cognitive functioning, language, and adaptive skills. While overall mastery of learning objectives has also been used to explore the effects of treatment intensity, it too has limitations when considering change to the core symptoms of ASD. The current study improves upon these limitations by measuring mastery of exemplars in specific treatment domains; however, it should be noted that the current study did not include evaluations of restricted, repetitive behavior, a diagnostic symptom of ASD. Nevertheless, using mastery of learning objectives across domains as a measure of treatment response is a more representative evaluation of ABA treatment programs and can provide more insight than standardized assessment measures.

### An evaluation of the effects of intensity and duration on outcomes across treatment domains for children with autism spectrum disorder [^117WvZyu]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is considered an effective treatment for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and many researchers have further investigated factors associated with treatment outcomes. However, few studies have focused on whether treatment intensity and duration have differential influences on separate skills. The aim of the current study was to investigate how treatment intensity and duration impact learning across different treatment domains, including academic, adaptive, cognitive, executive function, language, motor, play, and social. Separate multiple linear regression analyses were used to evaluate these relationships. Participants included 1468 children with ASD, ages 18 months to 12 years old, M = 7.57 years, s.d. = 2.37, who were receiving individualized ABA services. The results indicated that treatment intensity and duration were both significant predictors of mastered learning objectives across all eight treatment domains. The academic and language domains showed the strongest response, with effect sizes of 1.68 and 1.85 for treatment intensity and 4.70 and 9.02 for treatment duration, respectively. These findings are consistent with previous research that total dosage of treatment positively influences outcomes. The current study also expands on extant literature by providing a better understanding of the differential impact that these treatment variables have across various treatment domains.

### Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) for young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [^113cNtdu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The rising prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) increases the need for evidence-based behavioral treatments to lessen the impact of symptoms on children's functioning. At present, there are no curative or psychopharmacological therapies to effectively treat all symptoms of the disorders. Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) is a treatment based on the principles of applied behavior analysis. Delivered for multiple years at an intensity of 20 to 40 hours per week, it is one of the more well-established treatments for ASD. This is an update of a Cochrane review last published in 2012.

Objectives

To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of EIBI in increasing functional behaviors and skills, decreasing autism severity, and improving intelligence and communication skills for young children with ASD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 12 additional electronic databases and two trials registers in August 2017. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized control trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) in which EIBI was compared to a no-treatment or treatment-as-usual control condition. Participants must have been less than six years of age at treatment onset and assigned to their study condition prior to commencing treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We synthesized the results of the five studies using a random-effects model of meta-analysis, with a mean difference (MD) effect size for outcomes assessed on identical scales, and a standardized mean difference (SMD) effect size (Hedges' g) with small sample correction for outcomes measured on different scales. We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included five studies (one RCT and four CCTs) with a total of 219 children: 116 children in the EIBI groups and 103 children in the generic, special education services groups. The age of the children ranged between 30.2 months and 42.5 months. Three of the five studies were conducted in the United States and two in the UK, with a treatment duration of 24 months to 36 months. All studies used a treatment-as-usual comparison group. Primary outcomesThere is low quality-evidence at post-treatment that EIBI improves adaptive behaviour (MD 9.58 (assessed using Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) Composite; normative mean = 100, normative SD = 15), 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.57 to 13.60, P < 0.0001; 5 studies, 202 participants), and reduces autism symptom severity (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.79 to 0.11, P = 0.14; 2 studies, 81 participants; lower values indicate positive effects) compared to treatment as usual. No adverse effects were reported across studies. Secondary outcomesThere is low-quality evidence at post-treatment that EIBI improves IQ (MD 15.44 (assessed using standardized IQ tests; scale 0 to 100, normative SD = 15), 95% CI 9.29 to 21.59, P < 0.001; 5 studies, 202 participants); expressive (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.90, P = 0.01; 4 studies, 165 participants) and receptive (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.87, P = 0.001; 4 studies, 164 participants) language skills; and problem behaviour (SMD -0.58, 95% CI -1.24 to 0.07, P = 0.08; 2 studies, 67 participants) compared to treatment as usual.

Authors' Conclusions

There is weak evidence that EIBI may be an effective behavioral treatment for some children with ASD; the strength of the evidence in this review is limited because it mostly comes from small studies that are not of the optimum design. Due to the inclusion of non-randomized studies, there is a high risk of bias and we rated the overall quality of evidence as 'low' or 'very low' using the GRADE system, meaning further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. It is important that providers of EIBI are aware of the current evidence and use clinical decision-making guidelines, such as seeking the family's input and drawing upon prior clinical experience, when making recommendations to clients on the use EIBI. Additional studies using rigorous research designs are needed to make stronger conclusions about the effects of EIBI for children with ASD.

### Biological principles for music and mental health [^114FgcM9]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Operationally, social functioning is targeted by interactive approaches to music therapy designed to support interpersonal responding, coordination, and synchrony. A large body of evidence supports the benefits of such approaches in autism spectrum disorders. Some of this evidence is summarized in a 2022 meta-analysis of 26 controlled studies including 1,165 children with diagnoses of an autism spectrum disorder (ranging from mild to severe). This analysis compared music therapy to non-musical standard care or a "placebo" therapy over an average duration of 2.5 months (SD = 2.0), with session frequency varying from daily to weekly in shorter and longer studies respectively. Directly after the intervention, significant benefits associated with music therapy included improvement in clinical global impression (risk ratio = 1.22, 8 studies, 583 patients), reduced total autism symptom severity (SMD = 0.83, 9 studies, 575 patients), and better quality of life for clients and/or their families (SMD = 0.28, 3 studies, 340 patients). During the intervention, music therapy was also associated with significant improvements in non-verbal communication (SMD = 1.06, 3 studies, 50 patients) and behavioral adaptation (SMD = 1.19, 4 studies, 52 patients); in the 1–5 months following the intervention, music therapy was associated with reduced total autism symptom severity (SMD = 0.93, 2 studies, 69 patients) and improved self-esteem (SMD = 0.86, 1 study, 35 patients). For context, the overall SMD for autism interventions based on Applied Behavior Analysis (a common non-musical behavioral therapy) has been estimated at 0.36 for treating general autism symptoms (based on 14 studies with 555 patients).

### An evaluation of the effects of intensity and duration on outcomes across treatment domains for children with autism spectrum disorder [^114VQW7z]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Using mastered learning objectives as the dependent variable may be seen as a strength of this study because it provides a socially significant, fine-grained analysis of treatment progress. However, it also brings with it limitations. For example, some learning objectives may be more complex than others and consequently would require more time to master than others. Further, definitions of behavioral objectives can vary across participants. However, using a standard treatment tracking system, such as Skills, can help to mitigate these limitations. Future research should be conducted to evaluate the degree to which mastery of learning objectives reflects change in more broad or global measures such as standardized assessments.

Using big data analytics to predict future learning rates based on child-specific and treatment-specific variables can provide clinicians, educators, policy makers, and parents with insight on how children with ASD will respond to ABA treatment. The current findings are among the first to evaluate treatment dosage relationships across these eight treatment domains and to identify that treatment dosage relationships are stronger for particular curricular domains than for others. In order for programs to be fully individualized for children with ASD, clinicians must consider the skill deficits of the individual and distribute treatment hours accordingly in order to yield optimal treatment results. Future research should evaluate other covariate factors in treatment dosage and learning rates. The identification of areas that respond more robustly to increased treatment intensity and duration has the potential to help inform treatment decisions, such as what percentage of therapy hours to spend on different skills. In addition, researchers should identify other child-specific factors (for example, age, gender and so on) and treatment-specific factors (for example, supervision, parent training and so on) that predict positive treatment outcomes. On the basis of these predictors, clinicians may be able to design more efficient individualized treatment programs that yield greater treatment outcomes.

### Determining associations between intervention amount and outcomes for young autistic children: a meta-analysis [^111w193b]. JAMA Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Health professionals routinely recommend intensive interventions (ie, 20–40 hours per week) for autistic children. However, primary research backing this recommendation is sparse and plagued by methodological flaws.

Objective

To examine whether different metrics of intervention amount are associated with intervention effects on any developmental domain for young autistic children.

Data Sources

A large corpus of studies taken from a recent meta-analysis (with a search date of November 2021) of early interventions for autistic children.

Study Selection

Studies were eligible if they reported a quasi-experimental or randomized clinical trial testing the effects of a nonpharmacological intervention on any outcome in participant samples comprising more than 50% autistic children 8 years or younger.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were independently extracted by multiple coders. Meta-regression models were constructed to determine whether each index of intervention amount was associated with effect sizes for each intervention type, while controlling for outcome domain, outcome proximity, age of participants, study design, and risk of detection bias. Data were analyzed from June 2023 to February 2024. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary predictor of interest was intervention amount, quantified using 3 different metrics (daily intensity, duration, and cumulative intensity). The primary outcomes of interest were gains in any developmental domain, quantified by Hedges g effect sizes.

Results

A total of 144 studies including 9038 children (mean [SD] age, 49.3 [17.2] months; mean [SD] percent males, 82.6% [12.7%]) were included in this analysis. None of the meta-regression models evidenced a significant, positive association between any index of intervention amount and intervention effect size when considered within intervention type.

Conclusions and Relevance

Findings of this meta-analysis do not support the assertion that intervention effects increase with increasing amounts of intervention. Health professionals recommending interventions should be advised that there is little robust evidence supporting the provision of intensive intervention.

### An evaluation of the effects of intensity and duration on outcomes across treatment domains for children with autism spectrum disorder [^111QELLv]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

A limitation of this study is that treatment hours were not randomly assigned. There are a number of reasons why some participants had more treatment hours than others. These include the participant's geographical location, the clinician's treatment intensity recommendation, the participant's availability, the availability of therapists to implement treatment, and the participant's funding source. Since these data are not readily available, the assignment of treatment hours were not included as covariates in the current analysis. In addition, the number of hours spent on each domain were not differentially recorded, so the hours were distributed proportionally based upon the number of learning objectives targeted in each domain. Although this was the most objective procedure for estimating the treatment intensity for each domain, future studies should track the amount of time spent on each skill domain explicitly. Finally, data on other services that participants may have been receiving was not available and therefore were not included as a variable in this study. It is possible that some participants were receiving additional services, such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, and/or behavioral intervention through the school system. However, given that all participants received a minimum of 20 h of therapy per month, it is unlikely that participants were receiving any other concurrent intensive ABA services.

### Behavioral interventions for children with autism spectrum disorders [^117WsaS4]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Early intensive behavioral intervention is the only well-established treatment for young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Less intensive behavioral interventions are also effective for targeted concerns with older children and adolescents. This article describes the core features of behavioral treatments, summarizes the evidence base for effectiveness, and provides recommendations to facilitate family understanding of these interventions and identification of qualified providers. Recommendations are also provided for collaboration between pediatric providers and behavior analysts who are serving families of individuals with ASDs.

### An evaluation of the effects of intensity and duration on outcomes across treatment domains for children with autism spectrum disorder [^1151sMZH]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Behavioral intervention services

All participants received behavioral intervention services from a community-based service provider, operating multiple treatment centers. Treatment programs followed the Center for Autism and Related Disorders Model of ASD service deliveryand were customized to address the individual strengths and deficits of the child. Local and regional variables influenced treatment location, which included home, school, clinic or a combination of settings. Clinical recommendations for treatment hours were subject to funding source (for example, insurance, public and so on) determinations, among other variables. Despite the individualization of each participant's treatment program, these elements were common to all: (a) treatment was delivered on a one-to-one basis by trained behavioral therapists; (b) treatment included both more-structured (that is, discrete trial training) and less-structured (that is, natural environment training) behavioral teaching strategies; (c) language intervention took a verbal behavior approach; (d) both errorless and least-to-most prompting strategies were used; (e) all major empirically validated behavioral principles and procedures were used (that is, reinforcement, extinction, stimulus control, generalization training, chaining and shaping), as appropriate; (f) assessment and treatment of challenging behaviors followed a function-based approach; (g) parents were included in all treatment decisions and received training on a regular basis; (h) direct supervision was provided frequently (for example, biweekly) by an expert in behavioral intervention for children with ASD; and (i) treatment content was based upon the Center for Autism and Related Disorders Curriculum.

### Concordance between patient-centered and adaptive behavior outcome measures after applied behavior analysis for autism [^111q5EKv]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

While there is a sizable literature on standardized ASD outcome measures (e.g. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales), real-world measures of ABA treatment have received less study. There is substantial focus on setting individualized treatment goals in real-world ABA, but limited evidence about how to optimally measure progress on such individualized goals and what constitutes treatment "success". Because there is a growing emphasis on patient-centered approaches to care and measurement of patient-centered outcomes in health service delivery, it is important to understand whether these real-world patient goal measures of progress agree with other validated measures of treatment outcomes.

Patient-centered outcomes are defined as treatment outcomes that are meaningful and important to patients, their caregivers, and their families, or striving to achieve "the best possible outcome based on each child's personal characteristics and available supports". Tracking and improving patient-centered outcomes is a high priority in healthcare, and there is a growing focus in research on measuring patient-centered outcomes rather than only clinician- or healthcare-defined outcomes. This movement to address patient-centered outcomes in research and practice is a needed change and has great potential to improve health services for individuals with autism. ABA emphasizes the importance of patient-centered outcomes when considering intervention goals; however, evidence of success after ASD treatment has historically been defined as improved verbal, social, and intellectual abilities (e.g. IQ scores) and decrease or elimination of ASD symptoms rather than progress on patient-centered goals. The number of individualized treatment goals that a child masters is widely used in practice as a patient-centered outcome measure, and these goals may be more likely to reflect treatment gains that are meaningful to patients and families.

### Autism spectrum disorder: characteristics, associated behaviors, and early intervention [^116mJM9d]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and the presence of restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Currently, ASD affects 1 in 59 individuals and can be a costly disorder across one's lifetime. Because of the prevalence, costs, and range of behavioral needs, early intervention is vital to teach skills across a variety of domains and prevent the development or exacerbation of behavioral deficits and excesses. Interventions based on applied behavior analysis have the most empirical support; several strategies to teach social skills, communication, and adaptive skills are discussed.

### An evaluation of the effects of intensity and duration on outcomes across treatment domains for children with autism spectrum disorder [^113Hfp1V]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Another important implication is that dose–response relationships were stronger for some curricular domains than for others. The current findings provide a fine-grained analysis of treatment dosage relationships across particular treatment domains and further insight into how clinicians can monitor and set treatment expectations. For example, clinicians should pay particular attention to the impact that duration has on the academic and language domains. While treatment intensity had a significant effect on these two domains in the present study, treatment duration had a much stronger relative impact on these outcomes. To achieve greater treatment outcomes, clinicians should target academic and language skills at a high intensity, over a long period of time.

Moreover, the greatest percentages of treatment response variance accounted for by treatment intensity and duration were found in the motor and adaptive domains. This suggests that within these domains individuals tend to respond to treatment intensity and duration in a more uniform fashion (that is, with less influence from other child-specific or treatment-specific variables). While both intensity and duration had a significant effect on treatment response in the motor and adaptive domains, these domains had the lowest effect sizes (that is, learning occurred at a slower rate). Given this, clinicians should expect fewer targets to be mastered overall if the adaptive and motor domains are the sole focuses of treatment. This is consistent with findings by previous researchers who have reported that measures of adaptive behavior tend to have a weak treatment response.

The treatment of individuals with autism is associated with fad, controversial, unsupported, disproven, and unvalidated treatments. Eclecticism is not the best approach for treating and educating children and adolescents who have autism. Applied behavior analysis (ABA) uses methods derived from scientifically established principles of behavior and incorporates all of the factors identified by the US National Research Council as characteristic of effective interventions in educational and treatment programs for children who have autism. ABA is a primary method of treating aberrant behavior in individuals who have autism. The only interventions that have been shown to produce comprehensive, lasting results in autism have been based on the principles of ABA.

Effectiveness of interventions targeting young children with ASD in short- and long-term outcomes

At present, there is no cure for ASD. However, different interventions are available for children with ASD, such as behavioural, medical, educational, speech/language, and occupational therapy and complementary and alternative medicine approaches. These interventions are orientated to teach skills for daily life, reduce repetitive and obsessive behaviours, improve adaptive behaviours, and facilitate the acquisition of receptive and expressive language.

'Treatments for young children in the target age group for routine screening for ASD are primarily behavioural interventions, particularly early intensive behavioural and developmental interventions'. These interventions may incorporate a commonly used modality called applied behaviour analysis (ABA), which consists of modifying inappropriate or undesirable behaviours, and promoting and reinforcing those that are most appropriate. This modality can be administered by trained clinicians or by the parents after a training period.

### Autism intervention meta-analysis of early childhood studies (project AIM): updated systematic review and secondary analysis [^114vxUDZ]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Autism is a relatively common diagnosis, with current estimates suggesting approximately 1–4% of the population is affected. Early childhood interventions are often strongly recommended for young autistic children to promote skill gain in areas that might contribute to positive long term outcomes. Pediatricians and other physicians are often the first line of care directing families of autistic children to early childhood interventions to support their development. Therefore, physicians should be familiar with the available interventions and the landscape of evidence supporting them to make practice recommendations. However, the types of early childhood interventions recommended for this population vary widely in terms of approach and intensity, and current best practice guidelines differ across countries. For example, in the United States, the most commonly recommended treatment is early intensive behavioral intervention, an approach that incorporates operant conditioning, targets functional skills, and is characterized by a recommended intensity of 20–40 hours per week. In contrast, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England concluded that only two intervention approaches have sufficient evidence to support their use. These relatively low intensity interventions are pediatric autism communication therapy, and joint attention, symbolic play, engagement and regulation (JASPER), which target early social communication in the context of natural interactions. Previous attempts to synthesize intervention evidence to generate consistent clinical guidelines have been hindered by a number of factors: heterogenous intervention approaches that prevented aggregation of evidence; low standards of evidence for designating practices as evidence based; limited evaluation of intervention outcomes; overreliance on vote counting over quantitative synthesis; and a rapidly transforming evidence base. Consequently, doctors, clinicians, and families have to navigate confusing and often conflicting guidance on which supports are the most likely to be efficacious for autistic children.

Results

Sample description

Characteristics of the analytic subsample with comparison to the original sample are shown in Table 1. The analytic sample was 75.3% boys (N = 116) and 50.6% Hispanic (N = 78, Table 1), most of whom were commercially insured (65.6%, N = 101). The sample was comprised of 16.9% children ages 12–17 years (N = 26), 40.4% children ages 7–11 years (N = 63), and 42.2% children ages 3–6 years (N = 65). Many participants had received services for ASD in the past, including special education (56.5% of the sample, N = 87), ABA (22.7%, N = 35), occupational therapy (47.4%, N = 73), and speech therapy (68.8%, N = 106). Full ABA dosing was relatively low, with 27.9% of the sample (N = 43) receiving at least 80% of prescribed ABA. There were 136 children (88.3%) who received at least 50% of prescribed ABA. The average number of hours of ABA actually received per week received ranged from 6 to 20 hours (M = 9.5, SD = 7). The percentage of patients who made clinically meaningful adaptive behavior gains decreased between 12 and 24 months of ABA, while the percentage of patients who had meaningful gains on patient-centered goals and parent/caregiver treatment participation goals increased during the same time period (Fig. 2). Comparing differences in achieving clinically meaningful change across outcomes between the 12-month and 24-month time points, three of the six outcomes were statistically significant: ABC difference scores (P = 0.04), percentage of pragmatic communication goals met (P < .01), and percentage of expressive/receptive communication goals met (P < .01).

### Clinical outcomes of interactive, intensive and individual (3i) play therapy for children with ASD: a two-year follow-up study [^115GyxiH]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a life-long neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by early impairments in socio-communicative skills that are associated with a set of restricted interests and/or repetitive stereotypical behaviour. Recently, the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM V) added sensory impairments to the diagnostic criteria of the behavioural manifestations of ASD. Many research efforts have been made to identify precursors of ASD, leading to a significant decrease in the age of diagnosis, which enables earlier treatment. The existing treatments are mainly symptomatic.

Behavioural methods, which aim to develop certain expected behaviours through child reinforcement, have been proposed to treat ASD with significant scientific support. Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) is a one-to-one intensive approach based on behavioural strategies and targets specific symptoms using reinforcement of adaptive, expected skills. After criticisms regarding the lack of spontaneity in this early approach, Pivotal Response Training was subsequently developed and uses children's own choice of games and activities to reinforce the correct answers expected by the professional; this type of training also favours providing complete or incomplete forms of attempts to respond, alternating between acquisition and maintenance, and using intrinsic reinforcers. Additionally, the Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication handicapped CHildren (TEACCH) program emphasizes a close working relationship between parents and practitioners, adapts the intervention to the characteristics of the child and uses structured teaching educational techniques.

Behavioural and environmental interventions

Following psychoeducational and parenting programmes, and depending on the individual's needs and presenting difficulties, specific therapeutic interventions may be offered. Depending on the level of ability, these are often behavioural and environmental interventions that are specifically tailored to the child's needs and modified to account for their unique presentation, comorbid and associated problems. Most commonly those around the child (parents, carers, teachers) are the agents of change in addition to physical environmental modifications being made in order to optimise outcomes.

For both children and adults with ASD and challenging behaviour, environmental interventions are often preceded by a Functional Behavioural Analysis. This is an observational technique that systematically records the Antecedents, Behaviours and Consequences of behaviour (known as an ABC chart). Typically, an individual is observed in a specific setting (or if appropriate across settings) for a period of time and interacting with different people. The antecedents to behaviour are noted in a chart (i.e. what was happening immediately before the behaviour occurred, what makes it worse, what makes it better), and the behaviour itself is described in detail and its consequences (i.e. what happened afterwards, how the individual and those around him/her responded). The recording and analysing of behaviour using this method provide insight into the triggers and motivations of challenging behaviour and factors that may maintain the behaviour. In turn, this informs the method and goals of treatment. For example, in the case of a functional analysis being conducted to identify triggers of severe emotional outbursts, it is determined that these are precipitated by 'spinning noises' such as a washing machine or dishwasher. The interventions may include making parents/carers aware of the trigger, removing the child from the environment before the items are turned on, changing the times they are in use (if possible) and/or moving the child to a calming environment to help them reduce feelings of distress in reaction to the noise. Some behavioural interventions have been specifically developed for toddlers with ASD drawing on this approach, probably the most common being the Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA).

But what is the optimal amount of intervention? In this Viewpoint, we review current guidelines and consider evidence from an umbrella review of non-pharmacological interventions for autistic children aged up to 12 years. We show the lack of consensus on the issue, identify factors that might be relevant to consider, and present an evidence-based framework for determining the optimal amount of intervention for each child, along with recommendations for future research.

Design and data

Data used for this investigation were part of a larger observational study designed to evaluate receipt of ABA by children with ASD receiving care in a large integrated health system. Referrals for ABA originated within the health system, and ABA was then administered by a contracted external provider who returned reports about patient progress on goals every 6 months and ABA outcomes measured with the Vineland-II every 12 months to the patient's electronic health record. The Vineland-II was required for insurance reimbursement. Patient demographic data from an ASD registry maintained by the health system were linked to patient ABA outcome data and service use characteristics from these records at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months of ABA treatment. The study was approved by appropriate Institutional Review Boards of investigators.

### Concordance between patient-centered and adaptive behavior outcome measures after applied behavior analysis for autism [^111Q9C5g]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is an evidence-based approach to autism spectrum disorder that has been shown in clinical trials to improve child functional status. There is substantial focus in ABA on setting and tracking individualized goals that are patient-centered, but limited research on how to measure progress on such patient-centered outcomes.

Purpose

The purpose of this investigation was to assess concordance between patient-centered and standard outcome measures of treatment progress in a real-world clinical sample of children receiving ABA for autism spectrum disorder.

Methods

This observational study used a clinical sample of children ages 3 to 16years (N = 154) who received 24months of ABA from an integrated health system. Concordance between three outcome measures after ABA was assessed using a correlation matrix: (1) patient-centered measures of progress on individualized treatment goals, (2) caregiver-centered measure of progress on treatment participation goals, and (3) the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales adaptive behavior composite.

Results

There was limited concordance among measures at both 12 and 24months of ABA. None of the patient-centered measures showed significant positive correlation with adaptive behavior composite difference scores at either 12 or 24months, nor did the caregiver measure. The percentage of children achieving clinically meaningful gain on patient-centered goal measures increased between 12 and 24months of ABA, while the percentage of children achieving clinically meaningful gains in adaptive behavior declined during the same time period.

Conclusions

In a health system implementation of ABA, there was limited concordance between patient-centered and standard measures of clinically meaningful treatment progress for children with ASD. Clinicians should have ongoing dialogue with patients and parents/caregivers to ensure that interventions for ASD are resulting in progress towards outcomes that are meaningful to patients and families.

Discussion

In this investigation of concordance between patient-centered measures of clinical progress in a single health system, caregiver education and participation in treatment goals, and a standard measure of adaptive behavior (i.e. Vineland-II ABC 12-month difference score) used in routine practice for children receiving ABA, we found limited concordance among measures. Our data showed medium concordance in two of nine measures at 12 months and medium concordance in two of nine measures at 24 months. The percentage of children achieving clinically meaningful gain on patient-centered goal measures increased between 12 and 24 months of ABA, while the percentage of children achieving clinically meaningful gains in adaptive behavior declined during the same time period. Limited convergent validity was found among the measures at both 12 and 24 months. This investigation used a clinical sample rather than a research sample, and as such, our findings point to the challenges of measuring and improving meaningful patient outcomes when ABA is delivered in real-world settings.

Our findings suggest that measure concordance may be limited during real-world implementation of ABA, due to the confluence of limited research on measurement of patient goals, sub-optimal ABA dosing, and patient heterogeneity. In other community and health system implementations of ABA, sub-optimal dosing is common due to barriers such as time demands on families, difficulty affording co-pays, or preferences for other services. It is important for researchers and clinicians to this context (i.e. that full dosing may be unlikely in real-world settings) when selecting measures of treatment progress. Current clinical practice guidelines for ABA place a strong emphasis on setting and tracking individualized, measurable patient goals with input from parents, caregivers, patients, or other stakeholders. These goals can have implications for treatment continuation and funding. At the same time, standard measures like the Vineland-II may also be required for insurance reimbursement. The divergence between patient-centered and standard measures found in this study suggests a need to reconsider how to best measure treatment progress in in real-world healthcare and community settings, from the perspective of both clinicians and payers. The Vineland-II has limitations for detecting small treatment gains or capturing patient-centered outcomes, and as such, there might be missed opportunities to meet patient and family needs if relying on the Vineland-II alone.

Materials and methods

Participants and data collection

Retrospective data from the Skills database were used in the present study. Skills includes a well-validated assessment that evaluates functioning across eight treatment domains, and tracks ongoing treatment progress. Table 1 provides several examples of target lessons and their respective learning objectives, as reported in Skills. Operational data (for example, treatment hours) were collected by the participants' treatment centers. The data set used in the present study is similar to that described in additional detail by Linstead and colleagues.

To be included in the present study, participants were required to meet the following criteria: were between 18 months and 12 years old, received a minimum of 20 h of ABA treatment per month, and completed at least one full month of treatment. Given that all treatment programs are individualized to target skills based on the participant's current abilities, the initial intake period often involves probe sessions to identify skills to target during treatment. Therefore, participants who had received less than one month of treatment were excluded, as their data may not be representative of a typical treatment period. These criteria were applied to a pool of 2471 children and resulted in a sample size of 1468 participants. Participants included in the study had a diagnosis of ASD, autistic disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)by an independent licensed clinician (for example, psychologist, pediatrician and so on). The mean age of participants was 7.57 years, s.d. = 2.37, with a range from 1.83 to 12 years. The average number of hours received per month was 58.80, s.d. = 29.54, with a range from 20.08 to 210.36. The mean treatment duration in months was 13.96, s.d. = 10.04, with a range from 2 to 36. Of the 1468 included patients, 1156 were male and 312 were female. Participants resided and received behavioral intervention services in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, New York, Texas and Virginia.

### Concordance between patient-centered and adaptive behavior outcome measures after applied behavior analysis for autism [^113gWv6n]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the lack research on patient-centered outcomes after ABA, like skills for daily living or other individualized functional goals, there is a need to consider whether widely used individualized patient goal measures are concordant with traditional outcome measures used in ASD treatment research, such as adaptive behavior (e.g. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales), maladaptive behavior (e.g. Child Behavior Checklist), and cognitive abilities (e, g. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children®). Studies have suggested that ABA intervention hours have a positive association to both mastering a greater number of patient goals and behavior improvements on standard measures of adaptive or maladaptive behavior. However, there are no studies that have directly compared outcomes across standardized assessments and patient-centered outcomes for patients who have spent a sufficient length of time of ABA to expect outcomes to show clinically meaningful progress, generally considered to be at least 12 to 24 months of ABA. The purpose of this study was to assess concordance between three outcome measures for children who received 24 months of ABA: (1) A patient-centered outcome measure of progress on individualized treatment goals, (2) a caregiver-centered outcome measure of treatment participation goals, and (3) the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (Vineland-II) adaptive behavior composite (ABC), a standard measure of child adaptive behavior. These project aims arose from the theoretical framework for ABA which targets multiple domains of patient behavior and function and evidence suggesting that ABA improves multiple domains of outcomes simultaneously.

### An evaluation of the effects of intensity and duration on outcomes across treatment domains for children with autism spectrum disorder [^114SuQV6]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Data analysis

To examine the impact of treatment intensity and duration on skill acquisition across domains (that is, academic, adaptive, cognitive, executive function, language, motor, play and social), separate regression analyses were conducted. The data set included mastered learning objectives across each domain within a 36-month period (from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016). Learning objective mastery criteria were defined as a demonstration of greater than 70% accuracy over at least two treatment sessions conducted across separate days.

Treatment duration was defined as the number of months, within the 36-month period, that the participant received treatment for each treatment domain. A month was counted if at least one learning objective was targeted in a domain. Duration data may not reflect a participant's total lifetime duration spent on a specific domain. That is, some participants may have been receiving treatment before the 36-month period analyzed in the present study, while other participants may have initiated services during this timeframe.

Unlike the treatment duration data, treatment intensity data required a transformation from its originally recorded state in order to be evaluated across each domain. Total treatment hours for each participant were recorded for all treatment sessions; however, recorded treatment hours were not broken down by subject matter. Using the participant's overall intensity to evaluate each domain would have been problematic, specifically in the domains that the participant practiced infrequently. If these values were left unadjusted, unnecessary noise and variance would have been introduced when including participants whose treatment did not focus on a particular domain. To remedy these issues, a participant's total treatment hours for each month were distributed proportionally to the number of learning objectives that were targeted in treatment across each domain relative to the total number of objectives targeted across all domains. Once calculated for each month, the adjusted monthly treatment hours for each domain were averaged to determine the intensity variable. The mean adjusted monthly treatment hours for each domain were as follows: academic, M = 10.55; adaptive, M = 5.95; cognitive, M = 6.38; executive function, M = 7.13; language, M = 24.94; motor, M = 6.01; play, M = 7.28; social, M = 11.95.

After preparing the data above, a multiple linear regression model was fit to each domain, with duration and treatment intensity serving as the independent variables, and mastered learning objectives serving as the dependent variable. No additional covariates were included. Regression parameters were estimated via least squares using the R statistical computing environment.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^112EUCm2]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by patterns of delay and deviance in the development of social, communicative, and cognitive skills that arise in the first years of life. Although frequently associated with intellectual disability, this condition is distinctive in its course, impact, and treatment. Autism spectrum disorder has a wide range of syndrome expression and its management presents particular challenges for clinicians. Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder can present for clinical care at any point in development. The multiple developmental and behavioral problems associated with this condition necessitate multidisciplinary care, coordination of services, and advocacy for individuals and their families. Early, sustained intervention and the use of multiple treatment modalities are indicated.

### Concordance between patient-centered and adaptive behavior outcome measures after applied behavior analysis for autism [^111psxTW]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Adaptive behavior

Child adaptive behavior was measured by the Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC) on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Second Edition (Vineland-II). Vineland-II responses were reported by parents or caregivers to the contracted behavioral interventionist, who then returned the scores within annual progress reports. This measure was selected because as an insurance reimbursement requirement, it was the only consistently measured, validated indicator of patient outcomes available in reports. The Vineland-II measures adaptive behavior that allow function in everyday life for individuals with developmental disabilities. The ABC is an overall composite measure of adaptive behavior based on Vineland-II subscales for communication, daily living skills, and socialization. An age-normed ABC mean score is 100 with a standard deviation of 15. We examined 12-month ABC difference scores as well as whether or not the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in Vineland-II ABC was met. The Vineland-II MCID is estimated to be 2.0–3.75 points, and such, we examined whether or not patients achieved at least a 2.0-point increase in ABC at each 12-month interval.

Descriptive variables

To characterize the sample, we examined therapeutic service history and family demographic variables. The therapeutic service variables were ABA dose and service history (past receipt of ABA, special education, speech therapy, occupational therapy). The family demographic variables were primary language spoken (recorded into English or Other) and parent marital/partnership status (married or partnered versus single, divorced, or widowed). ABA dose was examined as the percentage of hours or sessions prescribed that were actually received, with a full ABA dose considered to be receipt of at least 80% of prescribed hours or sessions. Demographic variables were patient age (years), gender, and race/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity categories were White, Hispanic, and Other; the 'other' category included racial/ethnic groups that had too few participants for individual analysis.

### An evaluation of the effects of intensity and duration on outcomes across treatment domains for children with autism spectrum disorder [^115aS7bp]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of treatment intensity and duration on the number of learning objectives mastered by children with ASD across eight curricular domains (that is, academic, adaptive, cognitive, executive function, language, motor, play and social). The results of the present study revealed that treatment intensity (for example, hours per week) and treatment duration (for example, months of treatment) had significant effects on all eight domains. Further, the current study found dose–response relationships to be stronger for some domains than for others, with relatively stronger impacts observed in the academic and language domains.

The current study was an expansion on the findings of Virues-Ortega. The results of the present study are consistent with those reported by Virues-Ortega, which demonstrated that long-term, intensive ABA intervention produces large, positive effects on language-related outcomes (that is, IQ, receptive and expressive language and communication) and moderate, positive effects on non-verbal IQ, social functioning, and daily living skills in children with ASD. The current study improved on some of the limitations noted by Virues-Ortega, namely small sample sizes, variability in samples across the three reported domains, and heterogeneity in tools used to measure treatment outcome. The overall sample size of the current study is among the largest published in ASD treatment literature (N = 1468). Further, all participants in the study were measured according to the same criteria, using a valid, reliable assessment and treatment-tracking tool (that is, Skills).

### Predictive modeling of adaptive behavior trajectories in autism: insights from a clinical cohort study [^111sCxMa]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Moreover, we were able develop machine learning models to predict which patients were more likely to show improvements in adaptive behavior. Cross-fold validation for our final model had an observed AUC-ROC of 0.73 and an accuracy of 74.0%, and performance in the external validation set showed an AUC-ROC of 0.77 and an accuracy of 77.5%. Our models appear to improve on the accuracy of previous machine learning models designed to predict autism developmental courses. For example, Préfontaine et al. used machine learning to predict adaptive behavior change during behavioral intervention based on demographic information, IQ, and baseline autism severity features. Their best fitting model showed an accuracy of 68%. Thus, our study extends the literature by applying a comprehensive workflow of machine learning development to predict adaptive behavior outcomes as defined from data-driven latent class approaches.

Although very few studies have employed machine learning, other researchers have used inferential statistics to identify predictors of adaptive behavior development. This more traditional statistical approach has demonstrated that cognitive and language skills, presence of epilepsy, and severity of autism are risk factors for low growth trajectories. These results overlap with our findings that autism symptom severity and parent concerns about development are the most robust predictors of outcome trajectory.

Interestingly, when therapy intensity - operationalized as cumulative hours of ABA or DT - was added to our model, predictive accuracy did not improve. This would seem to offer counter evidence to research proposing a linear relation between duration and intensity of therapy with behavioral improvement. On the other hand, these findings add to growing literature suggesting the high total treatment duration of ABA therapy does not lead to improvement in treatment gains above average dosage levels. It may in fact be the case, as demonstrated here, that increasing therapeutic hours is not necessarily effective or cost-efficient in improving real-world outcomes for all children.

### Taurine supplementation in children with autism spectrum disorders: a study protocol for an exploratory randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111p1aKg]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Intervention description

Experimental group: Taurine Supplement + Behavioral therapy. The experimental supplementation will be taurine (Hubei Yuanda Life Science and Technology Co. LTD) mixed with corn starch and white sugar (Taurine 0.4 g + Corn starch 0.1 g + White sugar 0.1 g) in 1 bag, taken orally. Subjects will be instructed to have supplementations with specified dosages and frequency: 1 bag each time for 1–2 years old, 3 times a day;1.5 bags each time for 3–5 years old, 3 times a day;2 bags each time for 6–8 years old, 3 times a day;2.5–3.5 bags each time for 9–13 years old; 3 to 4 bags each time for children over 14 years old, 3 times a day. The dosage for different age groups is approximately 100–200 mg/kg.d. According to the previous studies, such dosage range of taurine can reach the effective plasma concentration of taurine, with mild treatment-related adverse events. The use of taurine is strictly in accordance with the specifications of Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China. The supplementations will be taken for 3 months since enrollment Behavioral therapy is structured courses with the Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), which emphasizes play, social interaction, and communicative initiation on the part of the child, and natural consequences as opposed to rewards such as food. The treatment is generally undertaken by a therapist working one-to-one with a child, using principles of learning to teach a child developmental skills such as language, imitation, or cognitive tasks such as matching or sorting. The treatment is usually intended to be given intensively in periods of 3–4 h daily, sum up with 15–20 h weekly.

### An evaluation of the effects of intensity and duration on outcomes across treatment domains for children with autism spectrum disorder [^1179baW2]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

As reported in other studies, the current data indicate a positive linear relationship between treatment intensity and the number of mastered learning objectives. That is, an increase in treatment hours predicted a higher number of mastered learning objectives in children with ASD receiving community-based ABA intervention. Although there were positive relationships across all domains, the highest effect sizes were observed in the language, cognitive, and academic domains. Increased treatment duration also predicted a higher number of mastered learning objectives with the greatest impacts observed in the academic and language domains.

These findings have a number of implications. First, these data indicate that both treatment intensity and treatment duration predict mastery of learning objectives. Although the effect of total dosage (that is, interaction between treatment intensity and duration) was not measured in the model, the current study did estimate the percentage of variance in treatment response that was accounted for by treatment intensity and duration together. Treatment intensity and duration alone accounted for a large percentage of the variance found in the mastery of learning objectives within each domain (ranging from 50 to 67%), which supports the findings of Linstead and colleaguesthat total dosage accounted for a large percentage of variance in treatment response (R² = 60%). In addition, treatment duration had a stronger impact than intensity on treatment outcomes across all domains. This may suggest that some skills cannot be acquired in a shorter period of time, regardless of the intensity, and that they may require long-term treatment, potentially over developmental periods. Future investigations should further evaluate the effect of treatment duration on outcome. A considerable amount of ABA research has focused on the role of treatment intensity on treatment outcomes, but there is no empirical evidence indicating that high intensity without consideration for duration will yield optimal results.

### Effect of wearable digital intervention for improving socialization in children with autism spectrum disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^111fiCbu]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Autism behavioral therapy is effective but expensive and difficult to access. While mobile technology-based therapy can alleviate wait-lists and scale for increasing demand, few clinical trials exist to support its use for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) care.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of Superpower Glass, an artificial intelligence-driven wearable behavioral intervention for improving social outcomes of children with ASD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized clinical trial in which participants received the Superpower Glass intervention plus standard of care applied behavioral analysis therapy and control participants received only applied behavioral analysis therapy. Assessments were completed at the Stanford University Medical School, and enrolled participants used the Superpower Glass intervention in their homes. Children aged 6 to 12 years with a formal ASD diagnosis who were currently receiving applied behavioral analysis therapy were included. Families were recruited between June 2016 and December 2017. The first participant was enrolled on November 1, 2016, and the last appointment was completed on April 11, 2018. Data analysis was conducted between April and October 2018.

Interventions

The Superpower Glass intervention, deployed via Google Glass (worn by the child) and a smartphone app, promotes facial engagement and emotion recognition by detecting facial expressions and providing reinforcing social cues. Families were asked to conduct 20-minute sessions at home 4 times per week for 6 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Four socialization measures were assessed using an intention-to-treat analysis with a Bonferroni test correction.

Results

Overall, 71 children (63 boys [89%]; mean [SD] age, 8.38 [2.46] years) diagnosed with ASD were enrolled (40 [56.3%] were randomized to treatment, and 31 (43.7%) were randomized to control). Children receiving the intervention showed significant improvements on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale compared with treatment as usual controls (mean [SD] treatment impact, 4.58 [1.62]; p = 0.005). Positive mean treatment effects were also found for the other 3 primary measures but not to a significance threshold of P = 0.0125.

Conclusions and Relevance

The observed 4.58-point average gain on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviors Scale socialization subscale is comparable with gains observed with standard of care therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial to demonstrate efficacy of a wearable digital intervention to improve social behavior of children with ASD. The intervention reinforces facial engagement and emotion recognition, suggesting either or both could be a mechanism of action driving the observed improvement. This study underscores the potential of digital home therapy to augment the standard of care.

### The clinician's guide to autism [^1172Dk2G]. Pediatrics in Review (2014). Low credibility.

On the basis of the most recent epidemiologic research, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects approximately 1% to 2% of all children. (1)(2) On the basis of some research evidence and consensus, the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers isa helpful tool to screen for autism in children between ages 16 and 30 months. (11) The Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, changes to a 2-symptom category from a 3-symptom category in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition(DSM-5): deficits in social communication and social interaction are combined with repetitive and restrictive behaviors, and more criteria are required per category. The DSM-5 subsumes all the previous diagnoses of autism (classic autism, Asperger syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified) into just ASDs. On the basis of moderate to strong evidence, the use of applied behavioral analysis and intensive behavioral programs has a beneficial effect on language and the core deficits of children with autism. (16) Currently, minimal or no evidence is available to endorse most complementary and alternative medicine therapies used by parents, such as dietary changes (gluten free), vitamins, chelation, and hyperbaric oxygen. (16) On the basis of consensus and some studies, pediatric clinicians should improve their capacity to provide children with ASD a medical home that is accessible and provides family-centered, continuous, comprehensive and coordinated, compassionate, and culturally sensitive care.

### Therapy and psychotropic medication use in young children with autism spectrum disorder [^111woAq4]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Guidelines suggest young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) receive intensive nonpharmacologic interventions. Additionally, associated symptoms may be treated with psychotropic medications. Actual intervention use by young children has not been well characterized. Our aim in this study was to describe interventions received by young children (3–6 years old) with ASD. The association with sociodemographic factors was also explored.

Methods

Data were analyzed from the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network (AS-ATN), a research registry of children with ASD from 17 sites in the United States and Canada. AS-ATN participants receive a diagnostic evaluation and treatment recommendations. Parents report intervention use at follow-up visits. At follow-up, 805 participants had data available about therapies received, and 613 had data available about medications received.

Results

The median total hours per week of therapy was 5.5 hours (interquartile range 2.0–15.0), and only 33.4% of participants were reported to be getting behaviorally based therapies. A univariate analysis and a multiple regression model predicting total therapy time showed that a diagnosis of ASD before enrollment in the AS-ATN was a significant predictor. Additionally, 16.3% of participants were on ≥ 1 psychotropic medication. A univariate analysis and a multiple logistic model predicting psychotropic medication use showed site region as a significant predictor.

Conclusions

Relatively few young children with ASD are receiving behavioral therapies or total therapy hours at the recommended intensity. There is regional variability in psychotropic medication use. Further research is needed to improve access to evidence-based treatments for young children with ASD.

### Occupational therapy practice guidelines for autistic people across the lifespan [^114mCDvZ]. The American Journal of Occupational Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Occupational therapy practice guidelines — communication and intervention stance — state that practitioners and researchers should support the use of a variety of communication technologies, broaden communication strategies with varied and low-cost resources, and recommended evaluating the effectiveness of communication devices rather than focusing only on autistic people's skill levels; practitioners also need to respect the individual choices and autonomy of autistic people as they choose augmentative and alternative communication methods and devices. The authors advocate for occupational therapy practitioners to engage in critical analysis and reflexive judgment to acknowledge, recognize, listen to, and respect autistic voices that highlight the negative impacts and trauma inflicted by certain interventions, and note there is evidence supporting the use of cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT), which is distinct from applied behavior analysis (ABA), while emphasizing it is crucial to include the perspectives of autistic people in both the use and evaluation of CBT. Additional cited guidance recommended carefully listening to autistic community members to explore the possible negative impact of behavioral interventions and underscored the importance of recognizing autistic people's strengths, bringing their perspectives to the forefront, and augmenting the implementation of functional assessments by ABA specialists to embrace a future neurodiversity-affirming approach.

### A multisite randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of intervention intensity and intervention style on outcomes for young children with autism [^112g3n7F]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This randomized, multisite, intent-to-treat study tested the effects of 2 levels of treatment intensity (number of hours) and 2 treatment styles on the progress of young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We predicted that initial severity of developmental delay or autism symptoms would moderate the effects of intensity and style on progress in 4 domains: autism symptom severity, expressive communication, receptive language, and nonverbal ability.

Method

A total of 87 children with ASD, mean age 23.4 months, were assigned to 1 of 2 intervention styles (naturalistic developmental/behavioral or discrete trial teaching), each delivered for either 15 or 25 hours per week of 1:1 intervention for 12 months by trained research staff. All caregivers received coaching twice monthly. Children were assessed at 4 timepoints. Examiners and coders were naive to treatment assignment.

Results

Neither style nor intensity had main effects on the 4 outcome variables. In terms of moderating the effects of initial severity of developmental delay and of autism symptom severity, neither moderated the effects of treatment style on progress in any of the 4 domains. In terms of treatment intensity, initial severity moderated effect of treatment intensity on only 1 domain, namely, change in autism symptom severity; in a secondary analysis, this effect was found in only 1 site.

Conclusion

Neither treatment style nor intensity had overall effects on child outcomes in the 4 domains examined. Initial severity did not predict better response to 1 intervention style than to another. We found very limited evidence that initial severity predicted better response to 25 vs 15 hours per week of intervention in the domains studied.

### Predictive modeling of adaptive behavior trajectories in autism: insights from a clinical cohort study [^117Jyqzh]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Collectively, these studies have revealed that a significant proportion of autistic children follow trajectories characterized by little to no growth in adaptive behavior. In other words, many children with a diagnosis of autism continue to lag significantly behind their peers in the development of adaptive behavior skills, despite presumably receiving some type of therapy within the community. However, the contribution of standard therapeutic interventions has not been comprehensively accounted for, as relevant clinical data are lacking in most research cohorts. It should also be noted that while research samples tend to emphasize psychometric characteristics, such as IQ, in predicting group membership, clinically relevant issues such as comorbid conditions and parent-reported concerns may not be routinely assessed.

On the other hand, research into the effectiveness of clinical interventions for autism often does not sufficiently account for heterogeneity in the population of individuals with that diagnostic label. This has resulted in a "one-size-fits-all" approach to clinical intervention, typically comprising numerous hours of intensive behavioral interventions such as Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy and ad hoc provision of other developmental therapies including speech-language therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. In theory, a more individually tailored approach to therapy could offer improvements in both cost efficiency and clinical efficacy, substantially reducing the lifelong socioeconomic burdens associated with an autism diagnosis.

Psychosocial, demographic, and longitudinal outcome data from various sources can be analyzed holistically using machine learning (ML) approaches, which have gained significant traction as a tool for predicting clinical outcomes in various mental health conditions. In the realm of autism research, ML prediction models have been applied to identify subtypes of autism based on clinical data, to develop precise diagnostic models, and, more recently, to predict differential responses to medical treatments. However, there is a paucity of studies employing ML to predict differential functional behavior outcomes among individuals with autism, and fewer still that systematically account for the impact of standard therapeutic interventions. From the perspective of autism care, therefore, there is a pressing need for studies that adopt a data-driven approach to explore predictors of variation in response to treatment. Such efforts should enhance the precision of intervention strategies and provide tailored support to individuals with autism, ultimately maximizing these individuals' overall quality of life.

### Concordance between patient-centered and adaptive behavior outcome measures after applied behavior analysis for autism [^115ReZsQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Measures

This investigation focused on measures that were indicators of clinically meaningful improvement. There were three main outcomes that were compared for concordance: (1) patient progress on individualized treatment goals, (2) caregiver progress on education and participation in treatment goals, and (3) child adaptive behavior measured by the Vineland-II ABC 12-month difference scores. We examined dichotomous indicators of clinically meaningful progress for all outcome variables because dichotomous outcomes are usually preferred in making practice decisions.

Patient progress on goals

Patient progress on goals was measured using four domains of behavioral function used by the ABA provider in the health system under study: Expressive and receptive communication, pragmatic communication, behavior reduction/target, and self-help and daily living skills. These domains are those which ABA targets and where behavioral change would be expected over time in ABA.

For each of the four patient domains, Board Certified Behavior Analysts® (BCBAs®) and the child's parent/caregiver set measurable, individualized goals for the patient at the time of baseline assessment. BCBAs® then documented patient progress on goals every 6 months in consultation with parents/caregivers (met, in progress, on hold, discontinued). Because the patients had different numbers of goals in various domains, we examined the number of goals met out of the number goals actively targeted (i.e. not on hold or discontinued) as a percentage for each goal domain and point in time. We examined whether or not patients had met at least 50% of their actively targeted goals in each domain and at each timepoint. Because there is no specific guidance on what constitutes clinically meaningful progress on patient goals, we selected 50% (half) as a threshold for this study.

Caregiver progress on education and participation goals

The ABA provider used by the health system also assessed caregiver education and participation in treatment as an individualized goal domain, assessed with the patient goals described above. We treated this goal measure separately from the four child goal measures because it targeted parents/caregiver behavior rather than child behavior. The caregiver education and participation goals were set and measured the same manner as the child goals described above. We again examined the number of goals met out of the number goals actively targeted (i.e. not on hold or discontinued) as a percentage for each goal domain and timepoint, plus a dichotomous indicator of clinically meaningful progress on caregiver education and participation (at least 50% of actively targeted goals met). We selected 50% as an indicator of progress because there are no existing standards for measures of progress in this domain.

### An update on psychopharmacological treatment of autism spectrum disorder [^116dbNCq]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-pharmacological (Behavioral) Interventions

In 1987, Lovaas published an article which introduced a new treatment approach describing a significant improvement of IQ scores and educational functioning in almost 50% of children with ASD. Also known as The Lovaas Method of Applied Behavior Analysis, and subsequently as discrete trial training (DTT), it is an intensive, highly structured, long-term, one-on-one behavior intervention designed for young children, which has a strong empirical support and has become the foundation for many of the evidence-based behavioral interventions in use today. Subsequently, through decades of extensive research, a number of modifications and adaptations of the Lovaas method have since been developed. These can be used in different settings, environments, and procedures, and have been shown to be effective in addressing the core impairments of ASD in social communication, speech, behaviors, play, and learning.

Odom et al. and Wong et al. have classified behavioral evidence–based interventions into two groups: comprehensive treatment models (CTMs) and focused interventions.

Comprehensive treatment models focused on core ASD symptoms have been found to improve language, cognitive, and functional language skills in young children, using intensive and long-term multi-disciplinary strategies in naturalistic environments. Instructions can be provided at home or in a classroom setting, individually or in a group, provided by instructors or by parents. Examples of well-established CTMs include Early Behavior Intervention (EIBI), Early Start Denver model (ESDM), Developmental, Individual difference, relationship-based model (DIR/Floortime, or Greenspan model), Pivotal Response Training (PRT), and Treatment and education of autistic and related communication handicapped children (TEACCH).

### Behavioral approaches to managing severe problem behaviors in children with autism spectrum and related developmental disorders: a descriptive analysis [^117X7Uoo]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Severe problem behaviors such as aggression, self-injury, and property destruction can result in injury, and require specialized and expensive treatment. This article reviews outcome research published since 1995 that used behavioral techniques to decrease severe problem behaviors among children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and/or intellectual disability. Many relatively simple interventions were reported to significantly reduce severe problem behavior, which offers hope for practitioners. Nonetheless, these studies also reveal a risk for injury and a need for specialized assessment and placement, careful tracking, and high-quality treatment that few agencies could likely replicate without increases in training and support.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for autistic youths — Frank et al. (2022), grade/evidence level 1b, randomized N = 167 autistic youths age 7–13 yr (M = 9.90; 20.4% female) in the United States to BIACA (n = 76), Coping Cat (n = 72), or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 19). Interventions were delivered to individual and family; all groups lasted 16 wk. The BIACA group had a 90-min session 1x/wk (45 for children and 45 for parents), and the Coping Cat group had a 60-min session 1x/week and two dedicated parent sessions, then 10–15-min check-ins weekly. Both CBT interventions led to a significant reduction in accommodation frequency posttreatment compared with TAU, and the program significantly reduced negative accommodating behaviors; children exposed to higher accommodation behaviors exhibited higher stress levels postintervention.

### Developmental and sequenced one-to-one educational intervention (DS1-EI) for autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability: a two-year interim report of a randomized single-blind multicenter controlled trial [^117R5Shb]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are defined as socio-communicative disorders beginning very early in life that are associated with atypical patterns of sensorimotor behavior or restrictive behaviors or interests. The etiology includes both biological (e.g. genetic conditions) and environmental factors that affect neurodevelopment.

Despite the growing evidence regarding behavioral and neurobiological pervasive developmental trajectories in children with ASD, no agency approved biological treatment exists for ASD, and the therapeutic approach is mainly provided by clinicians focusing on the development and behavior of the child. The USA National Standards Report on evidence-based practice guidelines concluded that there is currently no single effective treatment for ASD and underscored the importance of a multimodal treatment approach.

The effects of several therapeutic programs have been assessed through moderate-to-high-quality studies. The most widely-recognized programs include Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) and its derivative Pivotal Response Training (PRT), the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) and the Developmental, Individual-Differences and Relationship-based (DIR) Model. Other alternative developmental approaches based on play therapy, such as the Son-Rise Program®, Exchange and Development Therapy, and the 3i method have been investigated, but only in the context of pilot studies. Parent-mediated social communication therapy (PACT) has been found to have a positive impact at long term follow-up when the intervention is introduced early. As shown in various systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the effectiveness of behavioral and educational interventions for ASD is well-documented. Notably, several reviews showed that early intensive intervention (EIBI) is effective for young children with ASD. However, in a review of 34 studies, Warren (2011) concluded there was insufficient evidence to determine which specific interventions are the most effective treatments for children with ASDs. A more recent meta-analysis made the same conclusion when comparing three types of intervention (behavioral, social communication focused, and multimodal developmental): none showed a reduction in autism severity, and there was no significant difference among the intervention types. Another meta-analysis found that music therapy appears to be the most effective tool for improving social interaction in preschool-aged children with ASD. Thus, despite the RCT evidence base to date, new studies are needed to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each intervention, to determine which particular intervention or combination could be the most effective and to assess how interventions could be tailored to each child.

### Effects of the early start Denver model on emotional dysregulation and behavior problems in children with autism spectrum disorder: effects of the early start Denver model on emotional dysregulation and behavior problems in Chinese children with autism spectrum disorder [^112ZGWfS]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

ESDM is a successful model of intensive family intervention. However, the recommended intervention time is difficult to completely achieve in public hospitals, 20 h per week. A meta-analysis summarized that intervention time of ESDM by professional ranged from 4.6 to 20 h per week in 12 original researches, suggesting that most studies have not met the recommended time. In our study, although the intervention was low-intensity by therapists compare with the recommended intervention time, parents also were required to participate in the whole process and ESDM intervention for children was continued at home every-day. We were not given specific durations of the home intervention, but each parent actually conducted family intervention in different times every-day, which compensates for the lack of intervention time in hospitals. In longer longitudinal observation, however, cannot be evaluated in this study. Next, we will design control group to assess and define the possible impact of treatment interventions in the near further, as well as in longitudinal observation.

### Music therapy for autistic people [^116tTTCn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Social interaction and social communication are among the central areas of difficulty for autistic people. Music therapy uses music experiences and the relationships that develop through them to enable communication and expression, thus attempting to address some of the core problems of autistic people. Music therapy has been applied in autism since the early 1950s, but its availability to autistic individuals varies across countries and settings. The application of music therapy requires specialised academic and clinical training which enables therapists to tailor the intervention to the specific needs of the individual. The present version of this review on music therapy for autistic people is an update of the previous Cochrane review update published in 2014 (following the original Cochrane review published in 2006).

Objectives

To review the effects of music therapy, or music therapy added to standard care, for autistic people.

Search Methods

In August 2021, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eleven other databases and two trials registers. We also ran citation searches, checked reference lists, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised trials and controlled clinical trials comparing music therapy (or music therapy alongside standard care) to 'placebo' therapy, no treatment, or standard care for people with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Four authors independently selected studies and extracted data from all included studies. We synthesised the results of included studies in meta-analyses. Four authors independently assessed risk of bias (RoB) of each included study using the original RoB tool as well as the certainty of evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 16 new studies in this update which brought the total number of included studies to 26 (1165 participants). These studies examined the short- and medium-term effect of music therapy (intervention duration: three days to eight months) for autistic people in individual or group settings. More than half of the studies were conducted in North America or Asia. Twenty-one studies included children aged from two to 12 years. Five studies included children and adolescents, and/or young adults. Severity levels, language skills, and cognition were widely variable across studies. Measured immediately post-intervention, music therapy compared with 'placebo' therapy or standard care was more likely to positively effect global improvement (risk ratio (RR) 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 to 1.40; 8 studies, 583 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 11 for low-risk population, 95% CI 6 to 39; NNTB = 6 for high-risk population, 95% CI 3 to 21) and to slightly increase quality of life (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.49; 3 RCTs, 340 participants; moderate-certainty evidence, small to medium effect size). In addition, music therapy probably results in a large reduction in total autism symptom severity (SMD -0.83, 95% CI -1.41 to -0.24; 9 studies, 575 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No clear evidence of a difference between music therapy and comparison groups at immediately post-intervention was found for social interaction (SMD 0.26, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.57, 12 studies, 603 participants; low-certainty evidence); non-verbal communication (SMD 0.26, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.55; 7 RCTs, 192 participants; low-certainty evidence); and verbal communication (SMD 0.30, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.78; 8 studies, 276 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Two studies investigated adverse events with one (36 participants) reporting no adverse events; the other study found no differences between music therapy and standard care immediately post-intervention (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 5.94; 1 study, 290 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this updated review provide evidence that music therapy is probably associated with an increased chance of global improvement for autistic people, likely helps them to improve total autism severity and quality of life, and probably does not increase adverse events immediately after the intervention. The certainty of the evidence was rated as 'moderate' for these four outcomes, meaning that we are moderately confident in the effect estimate. No clear evidence of a difference was found for social interaction, non-verbal communication, and verbal communication measured immediately post-intervention. For these outcomes, the certainty of the evidence was rated as 'low' or 'very low', meaning that the true effect may be substantially different from these results. Compared with earlier versions of this review, the new studies included in this update helped to increase the certainty and applicability of this review's findings through larger sample sizes, extended age groups, longer periods of intervention and inclusion of follow-up assessments, and by predominantly using validated scales measuring generalised behaviour (i.e. behaviour outside of the therapy context). This new evidence is important for autistic individuals and their families as well as for policymakers, service providers and clinicians, to help in decisions around the types and amount of intervention that should be provided and in the planning of resources. The applicability of the findings is still limited to the age groups included in the studies, and no direct conclusions can be drawn about music therapy in autistic individuals above the young adult age. More research using rigorous designs, relevant outcome measures, and longer-term follow-up periods is needed to corroborate these findings and to examine whether the effects of music therapy are enduring.

### Music therapy for people with autism spectrum disorder [^111qcwTd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The central impairments of people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affect social interaction and communication. Music therapy uses musical experiences and the relationships that develop through them to enable communication and expression, thus attempting to address some of the core problems of people with ASD. The present version of this review on music therapy for ASD is an update of the original Cochrane review published in 2006.

Objectives

To assess the effects of music therapy for individuals with ASD.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases in July 2013: CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, ASSIA, Sociological Abstracts, and Dissertation Abstracts International. We also checked the reference lists of relevant studies and contacted investigators in person.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials comparing music therapy or music therapy added to standard care to 'placebo' therapy, no treatment, or standard care for individuals with ASD were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated the pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes to allow the combination data from different scales and to facilitate the interpretation of effect sizes. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic. In cases of statistical heterogeneity within outcome subgroups, we examined clients' age, intensity of therapy (number and frequency of therapy sessions), and treatment approach as possible sources of heterogeneity.

Main Results

We included 10 studies (165 participants) that examined the short- and medium-term effect of music therapy interventions (one week to seven months) for children with ASD. Music was superior to 'placebo' therapy or standard care with respect to the primary outcomes social interaction within the therapy context (SMD 1.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.10, 1 RCT, n = 10); generalised social interaction outside of the therapy context (SMD 0.71, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.25, 3 RCTs, n = 57, moderate quality evidence), non-verbal communicative skills within the therapy context (SMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.85, 3 RCTs, n = 30), verbal communicative skills (SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.49, 6 RCTs, n = 139), initiating behaviour (SMD 0.73, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.11, 3 RCTs, n = 22, moderate quality evidence), and social-emotional reciprocity (SMD 2.28, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.83, 1 RCT, n = 10, low quality evidence). There was no statistically significant difference in non-verbal communicative skills outside of the therapy context (SMD 0.48, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.98, 3 RCTs, n = 57, low quality evidence). Music therapy was also superior to 'placebo' therapy or standard care in secondary outcome areas, including social adaptation (SMD 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.60, 4 RCTs, n = 26), joy (SMD 0.96, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.88, 1 RCT, n = 10), and quality of parent-child relationships (SMD 0.82, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.52, 2 RCTs, n = 33, moderate quality evidence). None of the included studies reported any adverse effects. The small sample sizes of the studies limit the methodological strength of these findings.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this updated review provide evidence that music therapy may help children with ASD to improve their skills in primary outcome areas that constitute the core of the condition including social interaction, verbal communication, initiating behaviour, and social-emotional reciprocity. Music therapy may also help to enhance non-verbal communication skills within the therapy context. Furthermore, in secondary outcome areas, music therapy may contribute to increasing social adaptation skills in children with ASD and to promoting the quality of parent-child relationships. In contrast to the studies included in an earlier version of this review published in 2006, the new studies included in this update enhanced the applicability of findings to clinical practice. More research using larger samples and generalised outcome measures is needed to corroborate these findings and to examine whether the effects of music therapy are enduring. When applying the results of this review to practice, it is important to note that the application of music therapy requires specialised academic and clinical training.

### Predictive modeling of adaptive behavior trajectories in autism: insights from a clinical cohort study [^111fqHwe]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Current study

This study aimed to characterize the variability in adaptive behavior outcomes among autistic children, and to identify key clinical predictors of differential outcomes. The research described here is unique in part because it utilizes data gathered within the course of clinical care, rather than in the isolated context of a research study. Thus, in addition to adaptive behavior outcomes data from the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 3 rd Edition (VABS-3), we had access to in-depth clinical intake information, including baseline socio-demographic data as well as standardized parent ratings for a variety of neurodevelopmental concerns and medical comorbidities. We were also able to gather information about the type and duration of therapies children received.

The study had two primary objectives. First, we employed latent class growth mixture modeling (LCGMM) to uncover distinct trajectories of adaptive behavior change in a cohort of children (N = 1225) receiving clinical care within a network of centers with a uniform approach to autism treatment. We evaluated the Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC) score and the standardized score from each subdomain on the VABS-3 to facilitate comparisons with previous latent class trajectory research.

Second, utilizing predictive ML algorithms, we investigated the importance of socio-demographic variables and clinical phenotypes in predicting membership in one of the observed trajectories of adaptive behavior change identified through LCGMM analysis. We also evaluated whether including information about therapeutic intensity - operationalized as cumulative hours of ABA and developmental therapies - would substantially alter the prediction of outcomes of our models. What makes this sample unique is that for each autistic child receiving care, the parent or caregiver completed a detailed standardized intake form prior to the initial visit, providing a rich source of demographic, historical, and baseline clinical data. Caregivers also reported adaptive behavior skills using the VABS-3 every six months as part of routine clinical care.

### Autism intervention meta-analysis of early childhood studies (project AIM): updated systematic review and secondary analysis [^1138HV5u]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To summarize the breadth and quality of evidence supporting commonly recommended early childhood autism interventions and their estimated effects on developmental outcomes.

Design

Updated systematic review and meta-analysis (autism intervention meta-analysis; Project AIM).

Data Sources

A search was conducted in November 2021 (updating a search done in November 2017) of the following databases and registers: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Plus with full text, Education Source, Educational Administration Abstracts, ERIC, Medline, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and SocINDEX with full text, Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Any controlled group study testing the effects of any non-pharmacological intervention on any outcome in young autistic children younger than 8 years.

Review Methods

Newly identified studies were integrated into the previous dataset and were coded for participant, intervention, and outcome characteristics. Interventions were categorized by type of approach (such as behavioral, developmental, naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention, and technology based), and outcomes were categorized by domain (such as social communication, adaptive behavior, play, and language). Risks of bias were evaluated following guidance from Cochrane. Effects were estimated for all intervention and outcome types with sufficient contributing data, stratified by risk of bias, using robust variance estimation to account for intercorrelation of effects within studies and subgroups.

Results

The search yielded 289 reports of 252 studies, representing 13304 participants and effects for 3291 outcomes. When contributing effects were restricted to those from randomized controlled trials, significant summary effects were estimated for behavioral interventions on social emotional or challenging behavior outcomes (Hedges' g = 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 1.06; P = 0.02), developmental interventions on social communication (0.28, 0.12 to 0.44; P = 0.003); naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions on adaptive behavior (0.23, 0.02 to 0.43; P = 0.03), language (0.16, 0.01 to 0.31; P = 0.04), play (0.19, 0.02 to 0.36; P = 0.03), social communication (0.35, 0.23 to 0.47; P < 0.001), and measures of diagnostic characteristics of autism (0.38, 0.17 to 0.59; P = 0.002); and technology based interventions on social communication (0.33, 0.02 to 0.64; P = 0.04) and social emotional or challenging behavior outcomes (0.57, 0.04 to 1.09; P = 0.04). When effects were further restricted to exclude caregiver or teacher report outcomes, significant effects were estimated only for developmental interventions on social communication (0.31, 0.13 to 0.49; P = 0.003) and naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions on social communication (0.36, 0.23 to 0.49; P < 0.001) and measures of diagnostic characteristics of autism (0.44, 0.20 to 0.68; P = 0.002). When effects were then restricted to exclude those at high risk of detection bias, only one significant summary effect was estimated-naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions on measures of diagnostic characteristics of autism (0.30, 0.03 to 0.57; P = 0.03). Adverse events were poorly monitored, but possibly common.

Conclusion

The available evidence on interventions to support young autistic children has approximately doubled in four years. Some evidence from randomized controlled trials shows that behavioral interventions improve caregiver perception of challenging behavior and child social emotional functioning, and that technology based interventions support proximal improvements in specific social communication and social emotional skills. Evidence also shows that developmental interventions improve social communication in interactions with caregivers, and naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions improve core challenges associated with autism, particularly difficulties with social communication. However, potential benefits of these interventions cannot be weighed against the potential for adverse effects owing to inadequate monitoring and reporting.

### Effects of the early start Denver model on emotional dysregulation and behavior problems in children with autism spectrum disorder: effects of the early start Denver model on emotional dysregulation and behavior problems in Chinese children with autism spectrum disorder [^111cnwT3]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The present study suggests the positive effect of intensive training and parent training based on ESDM on ED and behavior problems in children with ASD. ESDM has a particular emphasis on reactive interaction and developmental orientation, which is based on evidence of normal social-communication development patterns. ESDM is an integration of a developmental model, the Denver model, a naturalistic applied behavior analysis (ABA) model and pivotal response training (PRT). Compared with other models, ESDM has a superiority in detailed behavioral teaching paradigms, focusing on the impact and quality of interpersonal relationship. ESDM is specifically designed for preschool children with ASD through interactive training which can be applied to every natural life scenario, promoting comprehensive development. More and more evidences demonstrate that ESDM can alleviate social interaction deficits, cognition, language, and adaptive behavior in children with ASD. Fuller et al. found that there were improvements in cognition and language, including 12 articles, whereas no significant effects were observed in autism symptomology, social communication, and repetitive behaviors for a short term. Based on the above results, we speculate that children with ASD had significant progress in language and cognitive after ESDM intervention, which helped them understand and express emotions, identify and deal with ED and behavioral problems. At the same time, we also considered the length of treatment. It is recommended that the requirement for more than 20 h of therapy per week, however, it is difficult in Chinese public hospitals. In our study, parent training based on ESDM makes up for the shortcomings of the above intervention practice. The results strengthen the comprehensive efficacy of ESDM interventions. In addition, it suggests that we should pay attention to the intensity of training and long-term efficacy of ESDM in children with ASD.

Model validation and tuning

The first set of machine learning models evaluated the predictive value of socio-demographic, historical, and phenotypic intake variables for discriminating between individuals who fell into the Limited Functional Gains behavior group versus the Multi-Domain Improvement behavior group. Table 3 presents the accuracy and AUC-ROC for each algorithm during the 10-fold cross validation. The random forest model out preformed the others with a validation AUC-ROC of 0.73. The elastic net logistic regression and support vector machine reached a validation AUC-ROC of 0.72 and 0.71, respectively. The secondary metric used to evaluate ML model selection during development was accuracy. All algorithms achieved a 74% accuracy rate. See Supplementary Table 4a–c for ML model results on individual VABS-3 subdomain outcome.

Adding behavioral and developmental therapy hours as predictors

We conducted secondary machine learning analyses to evaluate whether differences in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) or developmental therapy (DT) dosage would predict Limited Functional Gains versus Multi-Domain Improvement group membership. Specifically, we included total hours of ABA therapy (direct services, i.e. including one-on-one therapy with the child and excluding hours of supervision among ABA providers) and developmental therapy. The model's performance metrics showed little to no change, resulting in a random forest ROC-AUC of 0.75 and an accuracy rate of 75%. Full details on the model's performance can be found in the Supplementary Information (SI Table 5). To mitigate model complexity and prevent overfitting, we evaluated our final validation model excluding hours of ABA or DT therapy in the final random forest model.

### An evaluation of the effects of intensity and duration on outcomes across treatment domains for children with autism spectrum disorder [^111yUY1u]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Results

All eight domains demonstrated a strong linear relationship between skill acquisition and both treatment intensity and duration. The results of the regression models for each domain are shown in Table 2. Each of these models is discussed in further detail, including a summary of the unstandardized regression parameters, which represent the slope of the linear relationship between an independent variable and a predictor. In addition, the R² statistic, which captures the amount of variance accounted for by the predictors within the underlying multiple linear regression model, is provided below.

For the academic domain, the coefficients for intensity and duration were 1.68 and 4.70, respectively. See Figure 1 for a two-dimensional scatter plot of the model. Table 2 also demonstrates that the academic domain had the third largest effect size of intensity and the second largest effect size of duration. This model resulted in an R² value of 62%, which suggests that 62% of the variance in mastered learning objectives within the academic domain can be explained by these two variables alone. For the adaptive domain, the coefficients for the model were 0.63 and 1.88 for treatment intensity and duration, respectively. Despite having the lowest effect sizes for both variables, the R² value for this model was the second highest of all domains at 65%. The model of the cognitive domain had coefficients of 1.69 for treatment intensity and 2.64 for treatment duration. The R² value of the cognitive domain model was 59%. The executive function domain had an effect size for treatment intensity of 0.83 and had a coefficient for treatment duration of 2.46. The R² value for the executive function domain was 60%. The language domain had the highest effect sizes for both treatment intensity and duration at 1.85 and 9.02, respectively. The strong effect of duration was nearly double the effect size of any other domain. The language domain model had an R² value of 63%. The motor domain had positive effects in intensity and duration with effect sizes of 0.78 and 2.01, respectively. The model showed a strong linear relationship with an R² value of 67%, which is the highest of all domains. The play domain showed positive linear relationships with coefficients of 1.06 for intensity and 2.25 for duration, with an R² value of 58%. Finally, the social domain had coefficients of 1.28 and 3.27 for treatment intensity and duration, respectively. The social domain had the lowest R² value of 50%. The multiple linear regression models for each individual domain were significant, p < 0.001.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) [^112GmnfH]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) for behavioral problems in youths with ID/IDD — In a descriptive analysis of 101 behavioral intervention studies using a single-subject design, studies using ABA were generally effective for behavioral problems in youths 6 to 18 years old with ID/IDD (91% of participating youths) and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (48% of youths); differential reinforcement in school and home settings was found to be one of the more successful interventions, and a pilot of the Positive Parenting Program (Triple P) with parents of children with ID/IDD was associated with decreases in parental distress, maladaptive parenting, and child behavioral issues.

### An evaluation of the effects of intensity and duration on outcomes across treatment domains for children with autism spectrum disorder [^114wt2Te]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

It is important to note the variance in the distribution of mastered learning objectives across domains. Figure 1 shows that the language domain had the broadest distribution (that is, more variance in outcomes) of all the curricular domains, specifically for intensity. The source of this variance is not accounted for by the regression model. However, further consideration of the treatment variables does give some suggestions as to likely sources. First, the language domain had the largest number of treatment hours allocated per month (M = 24.94) to target objectives compared with the other curricular domains. Therefore, the broad distribution of language outcomes may be explained by the way treatment was conducted. That is, language objectives were targeted more frequently compared to other domain objectives. Second, this large variance may also be attributed to the idea that the language domain has a broader spectrum of mastery. On the basis of the child's current language level, targets within the language lessons may have been broken down into multiple objectives, thus increasing the variance in mastered objectives. The current findings warrant further evaluation of the variance in outcomes across curricular domains.

Another implication is that high treatment dosage yields positive treatment outcomes for children across a wide range of ages (M = 7.57). This finding challenges the commonly held perception that only young children with ASD may benefit from intensive ABA treatment. Granpeesheh and colleaguesreported that maximizing treatment hours during the younger ages (that is, under 7 years old) may potentially yield greater treatment gains. Nevertheless, without taking into account any child-specific variables including age, treatment intensity and treatment duration alone accounted for a significant portion of treatment progress across all curricular domains. These findings also have implications for expectations of skill acquisition during treatment. Additional research on the relationship between treatment duration and skill acquisition may serve to inform both clinicians and parents regarding potential treatment outcomes, reduce attrition, and increase parental involvement in treatment.

### Occupational therapy practice guidelines for autistic people across the lifespan [^112iRiYu]. The American Journal of Occupational Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Clinical recommendations for occupational therapy interventions for autistic people are described as the final phase of the synthesis of systematic review findings, and the grade is based on the specificity of the intervention, number of studies supporting the intervention, levels of evidence of the studies, quality of the studies, and significance of the study findings; recommendations were evaluated and finalized by AOTA staff, the AOTA research methodologist, and systematic review and Practice Guidelines authors, AOTA uses the grading methodology provided by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2018), and the clinical recommendations pertinent to each review are presented in Tables 1 through 4; for these Practice Guidelines, recommendations are graded A, B, and D, with A defined as "There is strong evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. Strong evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and that benefits substantially outweigh harms". and B defined as "There is moderate evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial".

### Determining associations between intervention amount and… [^117232W7]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

There is not robust evidence that the benefits of early childhood interventions to young autistic children increase when those interventions are intensified; practitioners recommending interventions should consider what amounts would be developmentally appropriate. Importance Health professionals routinely recommend intensive interventions for autistic children. However, primary research backing this recommendation is sparse and plagued by methodological flaws. Intensive interventions, provided for a minimum of 20 hours per week, for a duration of at least 2 to 3 years, are regularly recommended to support development in young autistic children.

1–3 Although other intervention approaches are available to this population, the most commonly recommended approach for young autistic children in the US is Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention, 4 which is characterized both by the type and amount of intervention provided. The first recommendations for intensive intervention were based on the results of an early, nonrandomized study that reported that children who received 40 hours of behavioral intervention per week for 2 or more years and who began the intervention before the age of 4 years experienced greater cognitive gains than those who received only 10 hours of intervention per week for 2 years and began intervention after age 4 years.

6, 7 Subsequent quasi-experimental studies comparing EIBI with eclectic intervention found mostly positive8–18 and some null results, 19, 20 but these studies confounded differences in intervention amount with differences in intervention approach. Our findings broadly align with those of a recent study, 49 which found that the amount of intervention provided in early childhood did not significantly predict developmental outcomes in autistic children at ages 5 to 7 years, as well as conclusions of a recent umbrella review30 of nonpharmacological interventions for young autistic children. and meta-analyses that suggest that high-intensity behavioral interventions are associated with greater gains than lower-intensity behavioral interventions. 31, 33, 50 It is notable that the only RCT28 explicitly designed to test this question documented no significant differences in gains on any outcome, on average, between children who received 15 vs 25 hours of EIBI per week for 2 years.

However, this study28 was relatively small, and larger replications are needed to more precisely estimate the causal impact of intervention amount on intervention efficacy.

### Intervention amount and outcomes for young autistic children… [^111KeeEB]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question Is the amount of intervention provided to young autistic children associated with improved child development. Findings Data from 144 studies of early childhood autism interventions featuring 9038 children gathered in a prior systematic review and meta-analysis were analyzed to determine whether the effects of common interventions were associated with any of 3 indices of intervention amount. None of the models evidenced a significant association between intervention amount and intervention effects. Meaning There is not robust evidence that the benefits of early childhood interventions to young autistic children increase when those interventions are intensified; practitioners recommending interventions should consider what amounts would be developmentally appropriate. Importance Health professionals routinely recommend intensive interventions for autistic children.

However, primary research backing this recommendation is sparse and plagued by methodological flaws. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary predictor of interest was intervention amount, quantified using 3 different metrics. The primary outcomes of interest were gains in any developmental domain, quantified by Hedges g effect sizes. Results. A total of 144 studies including 9038 children were included in this analysis. None of the meta-regression models evidenced a significant, positive association between any index of intervention amount and intervention effect size when considered within intervention type. Conclusions and Relevance Findings of this meta-analysis do not support the assertion that intervention effects increase with increasing amounts of intervention.

Health professionals recommending interventions should be advised that there is little robust evidence supporting the provision of intensive intervention.

### Treatment and intervention for autism spectrum disorder… [^1117YSLK]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Behavioral approaches Behavioral approaches focus on changing behaviors by understanding what happens before and after the behavior. Behavioral approaches have the most evidence for treating symptoms of ASD. They have become widely accepted among educators and healthcare professionals and are used in many schools and treatment clinics. A notable behavioral treatment for people with ASD is called applied behavior analysis. ABA encourages desired behaviors and discourages undesired behaviors to improve a variety of skills. Progress is tracked and measured. Two ABA teaching styles are discrete trial training and pivotal response training.
- DTT uses step-by-step instructions to teach a desired behavior or response. Lessons are broken down into their simplest parts, and desired answers and behaviors are rewarded. Undesired answers and behaviors are ignored.
- PRT takes place in a natural setting rather than clinic setting.

The goal of PRT is to improve a few "pivotal skills" that will help the person learn many other skills. One example of a pivotal skill is being able to initiate communication with others. Developmental approaches Developmental approaches focus on improving specific developmental skills, such as language skills or physical skills, or a broader range of interconnected developmental abilities. Developmental approaches are often combined with behavioral approaches. The most common developmental therapy for people with ASD is speech and language therapy. Speech and language therapy helps to improve the person's understanding and use of speech and language. Some people with ASD communicate verbally. Others may communicate through the use of signs, gestures, pictures, or an electronic communication device. The Early Start Denver Model is a broad developmental approach based on the principles of ABA. It is used with children 12–48 months of age.

Parents and therapists use play, social exchanges, and shared attention in natural settings to improve language, social, and learning skills. Educational approaches Educational treatments are given in a classroom setting. One type of educational approach is the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication-Handicapped Children approach. TEACCH is based on the idea that people with autism thrive on consistency and visual learning. It provides teachers with ways to adjust the classroom structure and improve academic and other outcomes. For example, daily routines can be written or drawn and placed in clear sight. Boundaries can be set around learning stations. Verbal instructions can be complemented with visual instructions or physical demonstrations.
