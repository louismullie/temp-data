## Question

What are the risks or concerns with taking Qsymia and Vyvanse together?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks or concerns with taking Qsymia (phentermine/topiramate) together with Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine), and what the recommendations are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled indications of each drug. Then, I should verify overlapping pharmacodynamic effects, especially cardiovascular and CNS stimulation. Next, I will examine specific adverse event domains including psychiatric, seizure risk, ophthalmic, metabolic, and growth concerns. After that, I need to check regulatory language for combination use and evidence gaps. Finally, I will assess the overall risk-benefit and make a practical recommendation with monitoring considerations, while double-checking for any formal contraindications I might miss in labeling.

> Let me first confirm the agents and their core properties. Qsymia is a fixed-dose combination of phentermine, a sympathomimetic amine anorectic, and topiramate, used for chronic weight management in adults and adolescents 12 years and older with obesity or in adults with overweight and comorbidities, with mechanisms that include appetite suppression and satiety enhancement, though the exact mechanism is not fully defined [^117Eanwh] [^111Lj1KD]. Vyvanse is lisdexamfetamine, a prodrug of d-amphetamine, indicated for ADHD and for moderate-to-severe binge-eating disorder in adults, with central dopaminergic and noradrenergic effects typical of stimulants [^117WsiMc] [^115AaTYZ].

> I need to check for overlapping pharmacodynamics that could amplify toxicity. Both phentermine and amphetamine are sympathomimetics that increase blood pressure and heart rate, and stimulants carry warnings for cardiovascular adverse effects including risks in patients with serious cardiac disease, so additive chronotropic and pressor effects are a predictable concern if combined [^11721Qv8] [^113Qc1jr] [^111Lj1KD]. Both also produce CNS stimulation that could manifest as anxiety, insomnia, tremor, and agitation, potentially compounding each other's effects on arousal and sleep when used together [^11721Qv8] [^115oNUbk].

> Hold on, let me verify cardiovascular safety signals and labeling caveats more carefully. Qsymia's labeling notes that the effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been established, and postmarketing for phentermine includes reports of elevated blood pressure and ischemic events, while historical experience with phentermine combinations highlights pulmonary hypertension and valvular disease concerns from prior fenfluramine combinations, underscoring caution in "stacking" sympathomimetics even if mechanisms differ from fenfluramine [^117Eanwh] [^113Qc1jr] [^112qumo3]. Vyvanse warns of increased blood pressure and heart rate and advises against use in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or serious cardiac disease, amplifying the rationale to avoid simultaneous stimulant exposure without a compelling indication and safety data [^117VtbgR] [^11721Qv8].

> Next, I should review CNS and seizure-related risks. Topiramate discontinuation can precipitate seizures even in patients without epilepsy, so any regimen shifts or abrupt stops matter, and combining with a potent stimulant could lower seizure threshold, although topiramate itself is anticonvulsant; the net balance is not well studied and warrants caution with dose changes and sleep deprivation from stimulants that can also provoke seizures [^111aC35Q] [^11721Qv8]. Qsymia can cause cognitive adverse effects including attention and memory problems and word-finding difficulty, which could be exacerbated or masked by concomitant stimulant effects, complicating assessment and safety monitoring in practice [^115oNUbk].

> I will now examine psychiatric adverse effects. CNS stimulants including Vyvanse can induce psychotic or manic symptoms even without prior history and can exacerbate bipolar disorder, while Qsymia's post-approval experience includes suicidal ideation and behavior, so additive risks for mood destabilization, anxiety, and psychosis are a realistic concern if combined and require careful pre-screening and monitoring if either agent is used alone, let alone together [^113PXM9e] [^113Qc1jr]. But wait, what if the patient is on concurrent serotonergic agents for mood or anxiety disorders? Vyvanse carries a serotonin syndrome warning with serotonergics, adding another risk layer in polypharmacy scenarios that often accompany obesity and ADHD care [^1124fAAx].

> I should confirm abuse, misuse, and dependence potential. Vyvanse is a Schedule II controlled substance with a strong abuse liability, while Qsymia contains phentermine, a Schedule IV with known abuse potential; co-prescribing two controlled stimulatory agents increases the risk for misuse, diversion, and complex withdrawal syndromes on discontinuation, and this risk is directly highlighted in FDA labeling for each product's class effects and scheduling [^112VXyai] [^111aC35Q]. Hold on, I should verify the specific warnings around dependence and withdrawal for each agent to ensure I am not overstating; both labels discuss dependence and withdrawal phenomena, supporting heightened caution if therapies overlap or are tapered improperly [^112VXyai] [^111aC35Q].

> Let me consider ophthalmic risks next. Qsymia has postmarketing reports of acute angle-closure glaucoma and increased intraocular pressure, and the product is contraindicated in glaucoma, while there is a case report of bilateral acute angle closure associated with lisdexamfetamine in an adolescent; taken together, concurrent use could plausibly raise risk for angle events in susceptible eyes, justifying screening for ocular history and prompt evaluation of visual symptoms [^113Qc1jr] [^112oiK97] [^111eJRH4].

> I need to check metabolic and growth-related issues. Topiramate has been associated with metabolic acidosis and other metabolic effects in the obesity literature, and Qsymia labeling documents cognitive adverse effects and pediatric slowing of linear growth, while stimulants like Vyvanse are associated with weight loss and growth suppression in children; the combination in adolescents would be particularly concerning for compounded effects on growth and nutrition, further arguing against co-use in pediatric populations [^112ujaK5] [^115oNUbk] [^113PXM9e].

> Next, I should review regulatory language and evidence gaps regarding coadministration. Qsymia's FDA labeling states that the safety and effectiveness of Qsymia in combination with other products intended for weight loss, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and herbal preparations, have not been established, a direct caution against combining with other anorectics, while phentermine labeling also advises that coadministration with other weight-loss agents is not recommended, and there are no studies establishing the safety of co-use with lisdexamfetamine, which itself is not approved for weight loss even though it reduces appetite and is indicated for binge-eating disorder [^117Eanwh] [^112qumo3] [^117WsiMc].

> Hold on, I should verify specific contraindications and drug–drug cautions that could intersect. Qsymia is contraindicated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, in glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, pregnancy, and in those with hypersensitivity to its components, and lisdexamfetamine is contraindicated with MAOIs and is not to be used in patients with serious cardiac disease, so even independent of each other, both have profiles that would frequently preclude coadministration in common comorbidity constellations seen in obesity and ADHD care [^112oiK97] [^117VtbgR]. If patients are on serotonergic agents for comorbid depression or anxiety, Vyvanse adds serotonin syndrome risk, reinforcing the complexity and risk of polypharmacy in any regimen that already includes a sympathomimetic weight-loss drug [^1124fAAx].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought I could state that concomitant use is formally contraindicated; let me verify the exact labeling. I should double-check: neither the Qsymia nor Vyvanse labels list the combination as an explicit contraindication, but Qsymia explicitly notes that safety and effectiveness with other weight-loss products are not established and phentermine monotherapy labeling advises against coadministration with other weight-loss drugs, while Vyvanse warns about cardiovascular, psychiatric, and abuse risks that would be additively relevant, so I should correct myself to say that while not a labeled absolute contraindication, the combination is off-label and strongly discouraged based on pharmacologic and safety considerations [^117Eanwh] [^112qumo3] [^11721Qv8].

> Putting this together, the overall risk assessment points to a stimulant-stacking effect with predictable additive cardiovascular and CNS toxicity, overlapping psychiatric liabilities, and increased abuse potential, without any established therapeutic advantage or supportive safety data to justify coadministration in typical clinical scenarios, yielding an unfavorable risk–benefit profile that should lead clinicians to avoid this combination in practice [^11721Qv8] [^113Qc1jr] [^112VXyai].

> If a patient truly has comorbid obesity and ADHD or binge-eating disorder, I need to ensure a single-agent strategy is prioritized and carefully monitored rather than combining sympathomimetics; that means selecting the one agent that best addresses the primary target condition, monitoring blood pressure, heart rate, mood, sleep, and ocular and cognitive symptoms, and considering non-stimulant or non-overlapping alternatives for the other condition as appropriate, keeping in mind that Vyvanse is indicated for ADHD and adult binge-eating disorder while Qsymia is indicated for chronic weight management, and both labels emphasize the need to monitor for cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse effects during treatment [^117WsiMc] [^117Eanwh] [^11721Qv8].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the practical recommendation clearly: avoid co-prescribing Qsymia and Vyvanse due to off-label combination use, lack of safety data, and substantial potential for additive cardiovascular, CNS, psychiatric, and abuse-related harms, and if one agent is used, implement vigilant monitoring and patient education about warning signs that warrant prompt medical evaluation, such as chest pain, palpitations, syncope, visual changes, severe anxiety, insomnia, mood changes, or emergent psychotic symptoms [^117Eanwh] [^113Qc1jr] [^11721Qv8].

The main problem with taking Qsymia and Vyvanse together is the **additive stimulant effects** from phentermine [^113Qc1jr] and lisdexamfetamine [^113PXM9e], which can cause **increased cardiovascular risk** (hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmias) and **heightened psychiatric risk** (anxiety, insomnia, psychosis, mania) [^11721Qv8]. Both drugs are **controlled substances with abuse potential**, and combining them increases the risk of dependence and withdrawal symptoms [^112VXyai] [^111aC35Q] [^114itd6u]. There is no established safety or efficacy for this combination, and **coadministration is not recommended** [^116NbKho].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms and interactions

Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine that increases norepinephrine release, which suppresses appetite and increases energy expenditure [^111Lj1KD]. Topiramate is an anticonvulsant that enhances GABA activity and inhibits glutamate receptors and carbonic anhydrase, contributing to appetite suppression and weight loss [^111Lj1KD] [^115ZZS6y]. Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine that increases norepinephrine and dopamine release and is indicated for ADHD and binge eating disorder [^117WsiMc] [^115FCUKE] [^112kexNQ]. Combining Qsymia and Vyvanse produces **additive stimulant effects** via overlapping mechanisms that increase norepinephrine and dopamine activity, leading to significant cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse effects [^11721Qv8].

---

## Cardiovascular risks

Both Qsymia and Vyvanse independently increase heart rate and blood pressure; combined use **significantly elevates cardiovascular risk** [^11721Qv8], including:

- **Hypertension and tachycardia**: Additive sympathomimetic effects can cause severe hypertension and tachycardia [^11721Qv8].
- **Arrhythmias**: Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to heightened sympathetic stimulation.
- **Cardiovascular events**: Elevated risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and other serious cardiovascular events, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions.

---

## Psychiatric and neurological risks

Combined use of Qsymia and Vyvanse **significantly increases the risk** for psychiatric and neurological adverse effects, including [^11721Qv8]:

- **Anxiety and insomnia**: Additive stimulant effects can exacerbate anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia [^11721Qv8].
- **Psychosis and mania**: Increased risk of psychotic or manic symptoms, particularly in patients with a history of psychiatric disorders [^113PXM9e].
- **Cognitive impairment**: Topiramate-associated cognitive dysfunction (memory, attention, language difficulties) may be exacerbated by stimulant-induced anxiety and insomnia [^115oNUbk].

---

## Abuse and dependence potential

Both Qsymia (via its phentermine component) and Vyvanse are controlled substances with known abuse and dependence potential [^111aC35Q] [^115KDGNh]. Combined use **increases the risk** of **abuse/misuse and addiction** due to additive stimulant effects [^112VXyai], and heightens the risk of **dependence and withdrawal** upon discontinuation [^114itd6u].

---

## Contraindications and warnings

The combination of Qsymia and Vyvanse is **contraindicated or warrants strong caution** in patients with:

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Coronary artery disease, serious cardiac arrhythmias, structural cardiac abnormalities, or uncontrolled hypertension [^112ujaK5] [^117VtbgR].
- **Psychiatric disorders**: History of psychosis, mania, or severe anxiety disorders [^113PXM9e].
- **Glaucoma**: Both medications are contraindicated in patients with glaucoma.
- **Pregnancy**: Both medications are contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential fetal harm.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and FDA labeling state that the safety and efficacy of Qsymia in combination with other weight-loss medications or stimulants have not been established, and such combinations are not recommended [^116NbKho]. Healthcare providers should **avoid coadministration** of Qsymia and Vyvanse due to the significant risks outlined above.

### Qsymia [^111aC35Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **9 Drug abuse and dependence**:

- **Controlled substance**: Qsymia contains phentermine, a Schedule IV controlled substance, and topiramate, which is not a controlled substance.
- **Abuse**: Phentermine has a known potential for abuse. Abuse is defined as the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Phentermine is chemically and pharmacologically related to amphetamines. Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused. Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs, such as phentermine, may be associated with impaired control over drug use and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients increasing the dosage of these drugs to many times higher than recommended. It is critical to assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing Qsymia as part of a weight reduction and long-term maintenance of body weight program.
- **Dependence**: Physical dependence may occur in patients treated with Qsymia. It is a state that develops due to physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms following abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

The following adverse reactions have been associated with the abrupt discontinuation of the individual components of Qsymia:

- For topiramate, abrupt discontinuation has been associated with seizures in patients without a history of seizures or epilepsy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
- For phentermine, abrupt discontinuation following prolonged high dosage administration results in…

### Vyvanse [^113PXM9e]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Psychiatric adverse reactions**: CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder. They may also induce a manic or mixed episode in patients with bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating Vyvanse treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode, such as a history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. CNS stimulants, at the recommended dosage, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms, including hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania, in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing Vyvanse.
- **Long-term suppression of growth in pediatric patients**: CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and a slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial of Vyvanse in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years old with ADHD, there was a dose-related decrease in weight in the Vyvanse groups compared to weight gain in the placebo group. Additionally, in studies of another stimulant, there was slowing of the increase in height.

The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of Qsymia, phentermine, and topiramate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
- **Qsymia**:
	- **Psychiatric**: Suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior.
	- **Ophthalmic**: Acute angle-closure glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure.
- **Phentermine**:
	- **Allergic reactions**: Urticaria.
	- **Cardiovascular**: Elevation of blood pressure, ischemic events.
	- **Central nervous system**: Euphoria, psychosis, tremor.

### Vyvanse [^112VXyai]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Controlled substance**: Vyvanse contains lisdexamfetamine, a prodrug of amphetamine, a Schedule II controlled substance.
- **Abuse**: Vyvanse has a high potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Vyvanse can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution.

	- Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, to achieve a desired psychological or physiological effect. Misuse is the intentional use of a drug, for therapeutic purposes, by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider, or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g. continuing drug use despite harmful consequences; giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.

	- Misuse and abuse of lisdexamfetamine, a prodrug of amphetamine, may cause increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure; sweating; dilated pupils; hyperactivity; restlessness; insomnia; decreased appetite; loss of coordination; tremors; flushed skin; vomiting; and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed with CNS stimulants abuse and/or misuse. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including Vyvanse, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)].

### Lomaira [^112qumo3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Lomaira™ tablets are prescribed as short-term monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and other drug products for weight loss, including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. As a result, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended.
- **Primary pulmonary hypertension**: Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a rare, often fatal disease of the lungs that has been reported in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea, while other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope, or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report any deterioration in exercise tolerance immediately. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope, or lower extremity edema, and they should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension.
- **Valvular heart disease**: Serious regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral, aortic, and (text ends here; please provide the complete text for further formatting).

Qsymia is contraindicated in patients:

- **Pregnancy**: Qsymia should not be used by pregnant individuals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Glaucoma**: The medication is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
- **Hyperthyroidism**: Patients with hyperthyroidism should not take Qsymia.
- **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors**: It is contraindicated in patients taking or who have taken monoamine oxidase inhibitors within the last 14 days [see Drug Interactions (7)].
- **Known hypersensitivity**: Patients with known hypersensitivity to phentermine, topiramate, or any of the excipients in Qsymia, or who have idiosyncratic reactions to sympathomimetic amines, should not use the medication [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Prospects for new drugs to treat binge-eating disorder: Insights from psychopathology and neuropharmacology [^115ZZS6y]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Low credibility.

Topiramate, a derivative of the naturally occurring monosaccharide D-fructose, is approved to treat epilepsy (Topamax®) and, when combined with phentermine, for obesity (Qsymia®). Topiramate has complex pharmacology with multiple actions. Like lamotrigine, topiramate inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium and high voltage-activated calcium (N- and P/Q-type) channels. It also enhances gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A-evoked Cl− ion currents, selectively inhibits kainate receptors, and, to a lesser extent, AMPA receptors. Topiramate inhibits carbonic anhydrase enzymes, CA-II and CA-IV. Although this last mechanism does not contribute to its anticonvulsant effect, it is probably involved in the drug's action to reduce food intake and body weight.

Topiramate's side effects include difficulty with attention, concentration, memory, speech problems, and psychomotor slowing. Many of these side effects are similar to the cognitive deficits observed in ADHD, rendering topiramate unsuitable as an ADHD treatment. While it decreased the frequency and severity of binge-eating disorder (BED) with significant decreases in BED psychopathology and substantial weight loss, a careful review indicates that topiramate's effects on impulsivity and compulsivity probably result from a generalized increase in inhibitory neurotransmission rather than an improvement in cognitive control. Moreover, topiramate's unacceptable adverse effect profile at these dose levels led to the halt of development in obesity and type-2 diabetes treatments. For this reason, topiramate is unsuitable as a monotherapy for these conditions.

Boxed warning regarding the use of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate PO (also known as Vyvanse) and the risks associated with drug abuse, misuse, stimulant use disorder: use extreme caution in all patients. Assess the risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction before prescribing lisdexamfetamine. Reassess the risk throughout treatment and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction.

### Qsymia [^115oNUbk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Cognitive impairment**: Qsymia can cause cognitive dysfunction such as impairment of concentration/attention, difficulty with memory, and speech or language problems, particularly word-finding difficulties. Rapid titration or high initial doses of Qsymia may be associated with higher rates of cognitive events like attention, memory, and language/word-finding difficulties [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The concomitant use of alcohol or central nervous system (CNS) depressant drugs with Qsymia may potentiate CNS depression or other centrally mediated effects of these agents, such as dizziness, cognitive adverse reactions, drowsiness, light-headedness, impaired coordination, and somnolence. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Qsymia therapy does not adversely affect them. Caution patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving Qsymia. If cognitive dysfunction persists, consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of Qsymia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
- **Slowing of linear growth**: Qsymia is associated with a reduction in height velocity (centimeters of height gained per year) in obese pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years. In a 56-week study, average height increased from baseline in both Qsymia- and placebo-treated patients; however, a lower height velocity of -1.3 to -1.4 cm/year was observed in Qsymia-treated compared to placebo-treated patients. Monitor height velocity in pediatric patients treated with Qsymia. Consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of Qsymia if necessary.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^112kexNQ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). High credibility.

Stimulants have long been considered potential treatment options for major depressive disorder (MDD) due to the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of depression and its associated symptoms, such as anhedonia and lethargy. Methylphenidate was initially studied for the treatment of MDD in the 1950s. Furthermore, meta-analyses have identified multiple trials from 2003 onwards that have investigated stimulants or modafinil as adjuncts for antidepressants.

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX), a d-amphetamine pro-drug, is approved in the United States and other countries for individuals aged six years and older with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and in adults with moderate to severe binge eating disorder in the United States and Canada (Vyvanse® Product Monograph). The effects of LDX augmentation therapy on depressive symptoms in individuals with MDD have been examined in two small phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept studies, and in two large phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In the first phase 2 study, LDX augmentation of escitalopram oxalate (ESC) monotherapy met predefined signal-detection criteria (prespecified critical α = 0.10) for significant reductions in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score compared to placebo in patients whose depression had not remitted with escitalopram monotherapy. The second phase 2 study focused on executive dysfunction in participants with partially to fully remitted MDD (MADRS total score ≤ 18) and found that LDX augmentation of SSRI provided beneficial outcomes.

### SPL drug information for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate [^11735mvy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate PO (also known as Vyvanse) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for withdrawal symptoms and sedation. The active metabolite of lisdexamfetamine crosses the placenta. Amphetamines induce vasoconstriction, potentially reducing blood flow to the placenta. Furthermore, they may stimulate uterine contractions, increasing the risk of preterm labor and low birth weight.

The drug lisdexamfetamine dimesylate PO (also known as Vyvanse) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Vyvanse [^114itd6u]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, abuse liability study involved 38 patients with a history of drug abuse. It researched single doses of 50, 100, or 150 mg of Vyvanse, 40 mg of immediate-release d-amphetamine sulfate (a controlled II substance), and 200 mg of diethylpropion hydrochloride (a controlled IV substance). Vyvanse at 100 mg produced significantly less "Drug Liking Effects", as measured by the Drug Rating Questionnaire-Subject score, compared to 40 mg of d-amphetamine. Additionally, 150 mg of Vyvanse showed similar "Drug Liking Effects" compared to both 40 mg of d-amphetamine and 200 mg of diethylpropion.

Intravenous administration of 50 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate to individuals with a history of drug abuse produced positive subjective responses on scales measuring "Drug Liking", "Euphoria", "Amphetamine Effects", and "Benzedrine Effects", which were greater than placebo but less than those produced by an equivalent dose (20 mg) of intravenous d-amphetamine.
- **Physical dependence**: Vyvanse may produce physical dependence. This is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, and it is manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms following abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of the drug. Such withdrawal signs and symptoms after prolonged use of CNS stimulants, including Vyvanse, include dysphoric mood, depression, fatigue, vivid and unpleasant dreams, insomnia or hypersomnia, and increased appetite.

Patients must be informed that phentermine hydrochloride is a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification, and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity, and that coadministration of phentermine with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended (see Indications and Usage and Warnings).

Patients must be instructed on how much phentermine to take, and when and how to take it (see Dosage and Administration). Advise pregnant women and nursing mothers not to use phentermine (see Precautions).

Patients must be informed about the risks of using phentermine, including the risks discussed in Warnings and Precautions, the symptoms of potential adverse reactions, and when to contact a physician and/or take other action. The risks include, but are not limited to:

- **Development of primary pulmonary hypertension**: (see Warnings) and
- **Development of serious valvular heart disease**: (see Warnings).
- **Effects on the ability to engage in potentially hazardous tasks**: (see Warnings).
- **The risk of an increase in blood pressure**: (see Warnings and Adverse Reactions).
- **The risk of interactions**: (see Contraindications, Warnings, and Precautions / Drug Interactions).

Patients must also be informed about:

- **The potential for developing tolerance and actions if they suspect the development of tolerance**: (see Warnings) and
- **The risk of dependence and the potential consequences of abuse**: (see Warnings, Drug Abuse and Dependence, and Overdosage).

Tell patients to keep phentermine in a safe place.

### Phentermine hydrochloride [^116NbKho]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Coadministration with other drug products for weight loss**: Phentermine is indicated only as short-term (a few weeks) monotherapy for the management of exogenous obesity. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine and any other drug products for weight loss, including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended.
- **Primary pulmonary hypertension**: Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) — a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs — has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone. The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope, or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop new, unexplained symptoms of dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncope, or lower extremity edema, and patients should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension.

### Qsymia [^111Lj1KD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, such as amphetamine (d- and d/l-amphetamine). Drugs in this class used for obesity are commonly known as "anorectics" or "anorexigenics". The effect of phentermine on weight reduction and the long-term maintenance of body weight is likely mediated by the release of catecholamines in the hypothalamus, resulting in reduced appetite and decreased food consumption. However, other metabolic effects may also be involved. The exact mechanism of action is not known.

The precise mechanism of action of topiramate on weight reduction and long-term maintenance of body weight is not known. Topiramate's effect on weight reduction and long-term maintenance of body weight may be due to its effects on both appetite suppression and satiety enhancement. This is induced by a combination of pharmacologic effects, including augmenting the activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyrate, modulation of voltage-gated ion channels, inhibition of AMPA/kainate excitatory glutamate receptors, or inhibition of carbonic anhydrase.
- **Pharmacodynamics**: Typical actions of amphetamines include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance have been demonstrated with drugs in this class.
- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: The effect of Qsymia on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (400 mg moxifloxacin), and parallel group/crossover thorough QT/QTc study. A total of 54 healthy subjects participated.

Common side effects with Qsymia include paresthesia, dry mouth, constipation, dysgeusia, insomnia, depression, and anxiety, with occurrences between 1% and 7%. Uncommon side effects that may be encountered include accelerated heart rate, impaired renal function, metabolic acidosis, and nephrolithiasis. As a safety precaution, depression and suicidal ideations should also be monitored.

Efficacy and safety were assessed in three major studies:

- **Controlled-release phentermine/topiramate in severely obese adults**:
	EQUIP, a randomized controlled trial, examined adults with high BMI and recorded total weight loss ranging from 3.5% to 6.6% for the 7.5 mg/46 mg dose and 8.6–9.3% for the 15 mg/92 mg dose.

- **Effects of low-dose, controlled-release, phentermine-plus-topiramate combination**:
	CONQUER, a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial, focused on weight and associated comorbidities in overweight and obese adults, also overlapping with EQUIP results.

- **2-year sustained weight loss and metabolic benefits**:
	SEQUEL, an extension of the CONQUER study, demonstrated prolonged health benefits and greater weight loss in groups treated with phentermine/topiramate compared to the placebo group after completing the 52-week extension.

EQUATE investigated the difference in weight loss for phentermine and topiramate monotherapy compared with combined therapy, which reinforced the beneficial weight loss effects of the combination therapy, though specific results are not detailed here.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^111ZrhSU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

In people with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² (EQUIP trial), phentermine/topiramate ER was associated with significant improvements in waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid profiles, and fasting serum glucose compared with placebo. Similar improvements accompanied weight loss with phentermine/topiramate ER in the CONQUER trial. In the SEQUEL study, the decreases in blood pressure of 3–5 mmHg did not significantly differ across arms; however, phentermine/topiramate ER reduced concomitant antihypertensive and lipid‐lowering medication use. Phentermine/topiramate ER also impeded progression to T2D over 108 weeks (up to 76% and 79% in those without diabetes or those with prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome at baseline, respectively, with the maximum dose of 15 mg/92 mg once daily) compared with placebo. In another study of obese adults with severe sleep apnea, phentermine/topiramate ER 15 mg/92 mg produced greater weight loss and improvements in the apnea‐hypopnea index and sleep apnea symptoms than placebo.
- **Adverse reactions**: The most common adverse reactions associated with phentermine/topiramate ER are paresthesia (19.9% with phentermine/topiramate ER 15 mg/92 mg, 13.7% with 7.5 mg/46 mg, 4.2% with 3.75 mg/23 mg vs 1.9% with placebo over 1 year), dry mouth (19.1%, 13.5%, 6.7% vs 2.8%, respectively), constipation (16.1%, 15.1%, 7.9% vs 6.1%, respectively), dysgeusia (9.4%, 7.4%, 1.3% vs 1.1%, respectively), insomnia (9.4%, 5.8%, 5.0% vs 4.7%, respectively), and dizziness (8.6%, 7.2%, 2.9% vs 3.4%, respectively).

Upon oral administration of a single Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg, the resulting mean plasma phentermine maximum concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), area under the concentration curve from time zero to the last time with measurable concentration (AUC0-t), and area under the concentration curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-∞) are 49.1 ng/mL, 6 hr, 1990 ng∙hr/mL, and 2000 ng∙hr/mL, respectively. A high-fat meal does not affect phentermine pharmacokinetics for Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg. Phentermine pharmacokinetics are approximately dose-proportional from Qsymia 3.75 mg/23 mg to phentermine 15 mg/topiramate 100 mg. Upon dosing phentermine 15 mg/topiramate 100 mg fixed-dose combination capsule to a steady state, the mean phentermine accumulation ratios for AUC and Cmax are both approximately 2.5.

Upon oral administration of a single Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg, the resulting mean plasma topiramate Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ are 1020 ng/mL, 9 hr, 61600 ng∙hr/mL, and 68000 ng∙hr/mL, respectively. A high-fat meal does not affect topiramate pharmacokinetics for Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg. Topiramate pharmacokinetics are approximately dose-proportional from Qsymia 3.75 mg/23 mg to phentermine 15 mg/topiramate 100 mg. Upon dosing phentermine 15 mg/topiramate 100 mg fixed-dose combination capsule to a steady state, the mean topiramate accumulation ratios for AUC and Cmax are both approximately 4.0.

Phentermine is 17.5% plasma protein bound. The estimated phentermine apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) is 348 L via population pharmacokinetics.

### Coadministration of lorcaserin and phentermine for weight management: A 12-week, randomized, pilot safety study [^111S6WM3]. Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

The Cochran‐Armitage test found no evidence of a trend in the primary endpoint event rates among the three treatment groups (P = 0.6719).

Some patients reported more than one potentially serotonergic adverse event (AE). In total, 152 reported AEs were part of the primary endpoint: LOR BID (44), LOR BID + PHEN QD (52), and LOR BID + PHEN BID (56).

Dry mouth, a known AE for both phentermine and lorcaserin, was reported at significantly higher rates [one‐sided 95% CI] by patients receiving phentermine: LOR BID + PHEN QD (26.9% [35.9%]) and LOR BID + PHEN BID (22.8% [31.4%]), with P values of 0.0006 and 0.0037 respectively, compared to LOR BID (6.4% [12.8%]). Dizziness and nausea also occurred at numerically higher rates [one‐sided 95% CI] in the LOR BID + PHEN BID group (10.1% [17.2%] and 7.6% [14.2%]) and the LOR BID + PHEN QD group (5.1% [11.2%] and 6.4% [12.8%]) compared to LOR BID (1.3% [6.0%] and 1.3% [6.0%]).

Headache [one‐sided 95% CI] occurred in 17.9% (26.2%) of patients in the LOR BID group, compared to 9.0% (15.9%) for LOR BID + PHEN QD and 13.9% (21.6%) for LOR BID + PHEN BID. Rates of fatigue and diarrhea [one‐sided 95% CI] were 10.3% (17.4%) and 6.4% (12.8%) in the LOR BID group, 3.8% (9.5%) and 2.6% (7.8%) in the LOR BID + PHEN QD group, and 6.3% (12.6%) and 0% in the LOR BID + PHEN BID group. Vomiting (n = 8) and anxiety (n = 1) occurred infrequently in all treatment groups.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: A new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^115A1FDh]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Phentermine and topiramate extended-release has been developed as a treatment for obesity based on the weight loss achieved with each agent individually and the potential for additive or synergistic effects in combination. This combination is aimed at providing improved efficacy and safety at low doses compared to the individual products. It is intended for once-daily oral dosing to enhance weight loss and improve weight-related comorbidities in overweight and/or obese patients.

In this low-dose formulation, phentermine, with a mean plasma maximum concentration (C max) of 49.1 ng/ml and a time to median plasma maximum concentration (T max) of 6 hours, is readily absorbed and immediately released to provide effects early in the day. In contrast, topiramate extended-release, with a C max of 1020 ng/ml and a T max of 9 hours, is released later to provide effects throughout later periods of the day.

Phentermine and topiramate extended-release is currently approved at doses of 3.75 mg/23 mg, 7.5 mg/46 mg, and 15 mg/92 mg for chronic weight management in obese and overweight adults with at least one weight-related comorbidity.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^114jV7UM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

The two major pivotal trials of phentermine/topiramate ER (EQUIP and CONQUER) were completed in overweight or obese populations with, or at a high risk of, weight-related complications.

In the EQUIP study, weight loss in subjects with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² was evaluated. The dose of 15 mg/92 mg produced a weight loss of 10.9% (vs. 1.6% with placebo; p < 0.0001) after 1 year. Participants in the CONQUER trial had a BMI of 27–45 kg/m² and ≥ 2 obesity-related comorbidities. In that study, 1-year weight loss was 7.8% with the 'mid-range' dose of phentermine/topiramate ER (7.5 mg/46 mg once daily) and 9.8% with the maximum dose (15 mg/92 mg once daily), compared with 1.2% with placebo; p < 0.0001 for both doses. Among those participants who entered an extension phase of the CONQUER study (the SEQUEL trial), weight loss was sustained following a total of 108 weeks of phentermine/topiramate ER therapy (−9.3% with 7.5 mg/46 mg; −10.5% with 15 mg/92 mg; compared with 1.8% with placebo; p < 0.0001 for both doses).

- **Drug interactions**: Acidifying and alkalinizing agents can alter the blood levels of amphetamine. Acidifying agents decrease amphetamine blood levels, while alkalinizing agents increase them. Adjust Vyvanse dosage accordingly.

- **Drugs having clinically important interactions with amphetamines**

- **Drugs having no clinically important interactions with Vyvanse**: From a pharmacokinetic perspective, no dose adjustment of Vyvanse is necessary when co-administered with guanfacine, venlafaxine, or omeprazole. Additionally, no dose adjustment of guanfacine or venlafaxine is needed when Vyvanse is co-administered.

	- From a pharmacokinetic perspective, no dose adjustment for drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2 (e.g. theophylline, duloxetine, melatonin), CYP2D6 (e.g. atomoxetine, desipramine, venlafaxine), CYP2C19 (e.g. omeprazole, lansoprazole, clobazam), and CYP3A4 (e.g. midazolam, pimozide, simvastatin) is necessary when Vyvanse is co-administered.

Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of Vyvanse and other serotonergic drugs, including SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, St. John's Wort, and with drugs that impair the metabolism of serotonin (particularly MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and others such as linezolid) [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.7), and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome.
- **Concomitant medications**: Advise patients to notify their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs because there is a potential for interactions [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: a new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^114oF6CT]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

It should be noted that there were reports of valvular heart disease when phentermine was used in combination with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. Of the 132 spontaneous reports with complete information, 113 (86%) met the cardiac valvulopathy case definition. Of these 113 cases, 2 (2%) used fenfluramine alone, 16 (14%) dexfenfluramine alone, 89 (79%) a combination of fenfluramine and phentermine, and 6 (5%) a combination of all three drugs. There were no cases reported with phentermine monotherapy use. Since none of these cases of cardiac valvulopathy was linked directly with phentermine treatment, the US FDA required the removal of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine from the market, while maintaining its approval of phentermine as a monotherapy. Ultimately, activity on the 5-HT2b receptor on heart valves was implicated as the primary mechanism associated with fenfluramine/dexfenfluramine-related valvulopathy. Phentermine has no affinity for the 5-HT2b receptor and does not increase circulating serotonin. Two case reports have described a temporal association between phentermine monotherapy and valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension, but numerous pre-existing and concomitant morbidities in these cases have precluded any definitive conclusion about whether these were linked to treatment.

### Medications for the treatment of obesity in adolescents [^116AbMDr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Qsymia® is a combination of phentermine and topiramate, acting as a norepinephrine and gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist, as well as a glutamate antagonist, leading to appetite suppression (although the exact mechanism is still under investigation).

The standard treatment plan for Qsymia involves a four-stage dose escalation starting with immediate-release phentermine/extended-release topiramate 3.75 mg/23 mg once daily for 2 weeks, followed by 7.5 mg/46 mg once daily for 12 weeks. If the patient does not lose at least 3% of baseline body weight, the medication can be discontinued or dose escalated. For dose escalation, immediate-release phentermine/extended-release topiramate at 11.25 mg/69 mg can be prescribed daily for 2 weeks, followed by a final titration to a dose of 15 mg/92 mg daily for 12 weeks. After completing the final 12-week treatment period, the drug is discontinued gradually if patients do not achieve weight loss at or above 5% of their baseline body weight. Upon discontinuation of treatment, patients are advised not to take any further doses within 14 days. Patients with conditions such as pregnancy, uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism and those using monoamine oxidase inhibitors should not be treated with Qsymia.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^116FY9Gv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Along with guidelines on how to titrate and when to stop using phentermine/topiramate ER, the FDA also imposes a Risk Evaluation Management Strategy program to ensure that the medication is used properly. This is because of the teratogenic risk associated with topiramate: fetuses exposed to topiramate in the first trimester have an increased risk of oral clefts (cleft lip with or without cleft palate). Phentermine/topiramate ER is contraindicated in pregnancy (category X). It is only available through certified pharmacies, which ensure recipients are aware of the risk and take appropriate precautions.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has raised concerns regarding the long-term safety of phentermine/topiramate ER because of potential adverse cardiovascular, psychiatric, cognitive, and teratogenic effects.
- **Lorcaserin**: In 2012, lorcaserin (brand name Belviq®), a 5-hydroxytriptamine (serotonin; 5-HT) 2C receptor agonist, was also approved for weight management in the United States. Lorcaserin is used at a dose of 10 mg twice daily and taken independently of meals. In contrast to phentermine/topiramate ER, no dose titration of lorcaserin is required, and no Risk Evaluation Management Strategy program is in place for this medication. It is recommended to discontinue the medication if it has not been effective for an individual. If the recipient has not lost ≥ 5% of their weight 3 months after having initiated lorcaserin, they are considered a non-responder, and the medication should be stopped.

### Qsymia [^115R3kEu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In the Qsymia clinical trials, a total of 254 (7%) of the patients were aged 65 to 69 years, and no patients aged 70 years or older were enrolled. Clinical studies of Qsymia did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range. This approach reflects the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
- **Renal impairment**: Compared to healthy volunteers with normal renal function, patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation, had higher exposures to phentermine and topiramate. The recommended dosage of Qsymia for patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl ≥ 50 and < 80 mL/min) is the same as for patients with normal renal function. In patients with moderate (CrCl ≥ 30 to < 50 mL/min) and severe (CrCl < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, the maximum recommended dosage is Qsymia 7.5 mg/46 mg once daily. Qsymia has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis, and it should be avoided in this patient population [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
- **Hepatic impairment**: In patients with mild (Child-Pugh 5–6) and moderate (Child-Pugh 7–9) hepatic impairment, exposure to phentermine was higher compared to healthy volunteers.

### Qsymia [^113qxoBw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Topiramate causes developmental toxicity, including teratogenicity, at clinically relevant doses in multiple animal species. Developmental toxicity and teratogenic effects were observed when topiramate was administered during the period of organogenesis (GD 6–15 in rodents, GD 6–18 in rabbits). Fetal malformations, primarily craniofacial defects such as cleft palate, limb malformations (ectrodactyly, micromelia, and amelia), rib/vertebral column anomalies, and/or reduced fetal weights were noted at dosages ≥ 20 mg/kg in mice, equivalent to approximately two times the MRHD of topiramate in Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg on a mg/m² basis. In rats, a dosage of 20 mg/kg (two times the MRHD of Qsymia based on estimated AUC) was associated with these effects. For rabbits, a dosage of 35 mg/kg (two times the MRHD based on estimated AUC) produced similar outcomes. When rats were administered topiramate from GD 15 through lactation day 20, reductions in pre- and/or post-weaning weights occurred at dosages ≥ 2 mg/kg (two times the MRHD of Qsymia based on estimated AUC).
- **Lactation**:

	- **Risk summary**: Topiramate and phentermine are present in human milk. There are no data on the effects of these substances on milk production. However, diarrhea and somnolence have been reported in breastfed infants with maternal use of topiramate. There are no data on the effects of phentermine in breastfed infants. Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions, including changes in sleep, irritability, hypertension, vomiting, tremor, and weight loss in breastfed infants with maternal use of phentermine, it is advised to inform pa.

### Controlled-release phentermine/topiramate in severely obese adults: a randomized controlled trial (EQUIP) [^114sjziT]. Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

A study limitation was the 40% dropout rate (47.1%, 39.0%, and 33.6% for patients receiving placebo, 3.75/23, and 15/92, respectively). This dropout rate is consistent with what one would expect at 56 weeks in obesity trials based on a published meta-analytic prediction equation and is lower than the 50% dropout recently reported with two other phase 3 obesity RCTs. Although our approach to retaining subjects, even if they discontinued the drug, and our use of ITT analyses with established missing data management procedures may have mitigated these high dropout rates, retention of patients in weight loss trials of 1 year or longer remains challenging. Nevertheless, we used several different ways of handling the missing data, all of which obtained confirmatory results. These statistical methods rest on fewer and less restrictive assumptions than do complete case analyses. Moreover, the retention rate was significantly higher with active treatment compared with placebo. Although speculative, this may have been due in part to greater weight loss efficacy in the treatment groups. Greater early weight loss may provide tangible encouragement for patients to pursue lifestyle guidance and has been shown to be associated with greater success in weight loss programs.

There were other limitations, including the overrepresentation of women (83%). Further studies with larger groups of men may be informative. The trial included mostly white persons, and many participants did not have significant obesity-associated comorbid diseases. A publication of another RCT of PHEN/TPM CR covers this broader population. Furthermore, the study…

In patients for whom lifestyle changes alone are insufficient and bariatric surgery is not an option, pharmacotherapies may be considered. Phentermine and topiramate extended release (PHEN/TPM ER; Qsymia; VIVUS, Inc. Mountain View, CA) have been shown to induce significant weight loss when combined with lifestyle modification in overweight or obese adults.

The CONQUER study assessed the effectiveness of PHEN/TPM ER for weight loss in overweight or obese adults with two or more weight-related comorbidities over 56 weeks (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00553787) and was followed by SEQUEL, a 52-week blinded extension study (NCT00796367). In order to assess the ability of PHEN/TPM ER to reduce progression to type 2 diabetes and improve cardiometabolic parameters in patients at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, we analyzed the subpopulation of patients meeting the criteria at baseline for prediabetes and/or MetS who elected to enroll in SEQUEL.

In the 1 and 2-year safety cohorts, the different outcome definitions of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) each had a hazard ratio (PHEN/TPM-ER vs. placebo) below 1.0, ranging from 0.49 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19, 1.25] for US FDA MACE to 0.84 (95% CI 0.26, 2.64) for the traditional MACE composite endpoint — including cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke.

The traditional MACE composite endpoint was incident in 12 of the 4323 patients, with 5 incidents occurring in the placebo group (5/1742) and 7 in the PHEN/TPM-ER group (7/2581). The wide CI found in the analysis of the traditional MACE composite endpoint suggests that a larger sample is required to sufficiently address this issue. The hazard ratio for the broadest MACE criteria, which included cardiovascular/neurovascular serious adverse events, encompassed a total of 43 events, with 20 in the placebo group and 23 in the PHEN/TPM-ER group. This had a 95% CI with an upper bound of 0.98, representing a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular risk.

At this time, there are too few events from clinical trial data to draw firm conclusions about decreases or increases in MACE in patients treated with PHEN/TPM-ER; however, available data remains under review.

### Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of controlled-release phentermine/topiramate in adults with obesity in Korea: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 4 trial (QUEEN's study) [^114DpbQA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a combination of phentermine and delayed-release topiramate (PHEN/TPM CR) versus placebo as an adjunct to standard lifestyle recommendations in Korean adults with obesity.
- **Materials and methods**: This 56-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 4 trial enrolled adults (age 19–70 years) with obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) at eight sites in South Korea. After a 12-week lifestyle program, participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive PHEN/TPM CR or placebo. PHEN/TPM CR was commenced at 3.75 mg/23 mg daily for 14 days and increased to 7.5 mg/46 mg daily, and to 15 mg/92 mg if 3% weight loss was not achieved after 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were percentage change in body weight from baseline to week 56.
- **Results**: A total of 232 participants underwent randomization. At 56 weeks, the percentage change in body weight was -8.3% with PHEN/TPM CR and -2.3% with placebo (treatment difference -6.1%; 95% confidence interval, -7.7 to -4.5, p < 0.001). Participants receiving PHEN/TPM CR were more likely to achieve ≥ 5% weight loss compared with those receiving placebo (68.5% vs. 25.0%; odds ratio [OR], 6.4; 95% CI, 3.5 to 11.6; p < 0.001). Dizziness, paraesthesia, and dry mouth were more common in the PHEN/TPM CR group, although most adverse events were mild or moderate.
- **Conclusions**: Administration of PHEN/TPM CR plus lifestyle intervention in Korean adults with obesity resulted in a greater reduction in body weight and adiposity than lifestyle intervention alone.

### Efficacy of phentermine/topiramate extended release in weight management and metabolic profiles: A multicentre study in South Korea [^111G8nDq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

This research examined the efficacy and safety of phentermine/topiramate extended release (ER) for weight management, focusing on changes in body weight and metabolic parameters in routine clinical practice. Clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of the phentermine and topiramate combination in weight management.
- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively included people with obesity who initiated phentermine/topiramate ER between January 2020 and April 2023 at 10 tertiary hospitals in South Korea. The study assessed body weight changes at 5–6 months and, for those who continued, at 12 months, along with metabolic parameters. Total body weight was measured using calibrated electronic scales with participants in light indoor clothing.
- **Results**: The cohort included 1,839 patients (540 men and 1,299 women), with a 5–6 month continuation rate of 48%. At 5–6 months, the mean weight reduction was 7.9%, with sex-specific losses of 7.1% in men and 8.2% in women. Over 56% of participants achieved more than 5% weight loss, with 23% exceeding a 10% reduction. Younger participants, women, and those with moderate to severe obesity exhibited more pronounced weight loss compared to older men and individuals with mild obesity. Concurrently, phentermine/topiramate ER treatment improved glucose regulation, lipid profiles, and decreased blood pressure: the HbA1c decreased by 0.4 ± 0.9%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 10 ± 32 mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure by 6 ± 15 mmHg (all p < 0.001). Treatment was well-tolerated, with a 15% incidence of mild adverse events.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: A new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^115JymE8]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Topiramate is an immediate-release, sulfamate-substituted monosaccharide used to treat epilepsy and prevent migraines. It is suggested that topiramate acts on kainate/alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid glutamate receptors. Moreover, topiramate appears to block voltage-dependent sodium channels, augment γ-aminobutyric acid activity (GABA-A), and inhibit carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes II and IV. The exact mechanism of topiramate's effects on weight is unknown.

Topiramate may decrease food intake through its effects on carbonic-anhydrase inhibition related to taste or through its effects on GABA transmission, since GABA-A receptor activation and the interaction between GABA and leptin pathways are known to mediate effects on appetite and metabolism. Additionally, topiramate may also affect energy expenditure based on preclinical data.

### Coadministration of lorcaserin and phentermine for weight management: A 12-week, randomized, pilot safety study [^115yKCXJ]. Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

Analyses of the primary endpoint used the full analysis set (FAS), which included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. This analysis was summarized with descriptive statistics and confidence intervals (CIs) for the three treatment arms. The Agresti-Coull approach was used to construct event rate CIs. The safety analysis population included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment.

Analyses of efficacy variables were performed on the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population, which included all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug and had both baseline and post-randomization weight measurements, using last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) imputation. Body weight analyses were also performed on the Completers population, which included all randomized patients who completed the study. Analyses of secondary endpoints were summarized descriptively.

An exploratory analysis using the Cochran-Armitage trend test was performed to assess any trend in the primary endpoint event rates and the proportion of patients achieving at least a 5% weight reduction among the three treatment groups. Similarly, mixed model repeated measures were used to explore any trend among treatment groups in change from baseline body weight, both in kilograms and percent, as well as pairwise comparisons of treatment differences.

In addition, post hoc exploratory analyses were conducted to test pairwise treatment differences for responder rates (considering at least a 5% weight loss at week 12 or at the end of treatment), safety parameters, and frequencies.

### Coadministration of lorcaserin and phentermine for weight management: A 12-week, randomized, pilot safety study [^112DWXWA]. Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the short-term tolerability of lorcaserin alone or in combination with two dosing regimens of phentermine.
- **Methods**: This was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, pilot safety study involving 238 non-diabetic patients with obesity or overweight and at least one comorbidity. Participants were randomized to receive lorcaserin 10 mg twice daily (BID; LOR BID) alone or in combination with phentermine 15 mg once daily (QD; LOR BID+PHEN QD) or 15 mg twice daily (LOR BID+PHEN BID). The study reported on patients experiencing one or more of nine potentially serotonergic adverse events (AEs), mean weight loss (WL), and weight loss of at least 5%.
- **Results**: A total of 238 patients were randomized, with 235 receiving treatment. Of these, 94 patients reported potentially serotonergic AEs: 37.2% in the LOR BID group, 42.3% in the LOR BID+PHEN QD group, and 40.5% in the LOR BID+PHEN BID group. Discontinuation due to AEs was approximately twice as frequent in the LOR BID+PHEN BID group compared to the LOR BID group. The mean WL observed was 3.5 kg (3.3%) for LOR BID, 7.0 kg (6.7%) for LOR BID+PHEN QD, and 7.6 kg (7.2%) for LOR BID+PHEN BID. A WL of at least 5% was achieved by 28.2% of the LOR BID group, 59.0% of the LOR BID+PHEN QD group (P = 0.0002 vs. LOR BID), and 70.9% of the LOR BID+PHEN BID group (P < 0.0001 vs. LOR BID).
- **Conclusions**: The addition of phentermine to lorcaserin enhanced short-term weight loss without increasing the incidence of potentially serotonergic AEs. However, a twice-daily phentermine regimen increased rates of discontinuation compared to both lorcaserin alone and the once-daily lorcaserin plus phentermine combination.

### Qsymia [^113Qr5au]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of lithium in patients were unaffected during treatment with topiramate at doses of 200 mg/day; however, there was an observed increase in systemic exposure of lithium, with a 27% increase in Cmax and a 26% increase in AUC following topiramate doses up to 600 mg/day.
- **Haloperidol**: The pharmacokinetics of a single dose of haloperidol (5 mg) were not affected following multiple dosing of topiramate (100 mg every 12 hours) in 13 healthy adults (6 males, 7 females).
- **Amitriptyline**: There was a 12% increase in AUC and Cmax for amitriptyline (25 mg per day) in 18 normal subjects (9 males, 9 females) receiving 200 mg/day of topiramate [see Drug Interactions (7)].
- **Sumatriptan**: Multiple dosing of topiramate (100 mg every 12 hours) in 24 healthy volunteers (14 males, 10 females) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of single-dose sumatriptan either orally (100 mg) or subcutaneously (6 mg).
- **Risperidone**: When administered concomitantly with topiramate at escalating doses of 100, 250, and 400 mg/day, there was a reduction in risperidone systemic exposure (16% and 33% for steady-state AUC at the 250 and 400 mg/day doses of topiramate). No alterations of 9-hydroxyrisperidone levels were observed. Co-administration of topiramate 400 mg/day with risperidone resulted in a 14% increase in Cmax and a 12% increase in AUC12 of topiramate. There were no clinically significant changes in the systemic exposure of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone or of topiramate; therefore, this interaction is not likely to be of clinical significance.
- **Propranolol**: Multiple dosing of topiramate (200 mg/day).

### Evaluation of phentermine and topiramate versus phentermine/topiramate extended-release in obese adults [^113wKP1j]. Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

A 28-week randomized, controlled trial compared the combination of phentermine and topiramate extended-release (PHEN/TPM ER) with its components as monotherapies and with placebo in obese adults.
- **Design and methods**: Subjects were randomized to receive either placebo, phentermine 7.5 mg, phentermine 15 mg, topiramate ER 46 mg, topiramate ER 92 mg, PHEN/TPM ER 7.5/46 mg, or PHEN/TPM ER 15/92 mg. All subjects received lifestyle intervention counseling. The primary endpoints were percent weight loss (WL) and the achievement of ≥ 5% WL.
- **Results**: At week 28, PHEN/TPM ER 7.5/46 (-8.5%) and 15/92 (-9.2%) achieved a greater percentage of WL compared to placebo (-1.7%; P < 0.0001) and their respective monotherapies (P < 0.05). The percentage of subjects achieving ≥ 5% WL was 15.5% for placebo, 43.3% for phentermine 7.5, 46.2% for phentermine 15, 39.2% for topiramate ER 46, 48.6% for topiramate ER 92, 62.1% for PHEN/TPM ER 7.5/46, and 66.0% for PHEN/TPM ER 15/92. PHEN/TPM ER was generally well tolerated; a comprehensive assessment of cognitive functions with the Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status revealed impairment only in the attention domain.
- **Conclusions**: PHEN/TPM ER demonstrated greater WL when used in combination than when used as monotherapies, suggesting an enhanced ability of the combination formulation to induce WL at doses lower than with available monotherapies.

### Coadministration of lorcaserin and phentermine for weight management: A 12-week, randomized, pilot safety study [^111xqDmy]. Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, phentermine was the most commonly prescribed weight loss drug and had been shown to be effective when combined with topiramate. Combination therapy can promote additional weight loss compared with monotherapy. Consequently, physicians are likely interested in combining phentermine with other anti-obesity agents such as lorcaserin. In this study, combination therapy resulted in significantly greater weight loss than lorcaserin alone in a dose-dependent manner, with a mean change from baseline in body weight of −3.5 kg, −7.0 kg, and −7.6 kg in the MITT/LOCF population for the LOR BID, LOR BID+PHEN QD, and LOR BID+PHEN BID groups, respectively.

We acknowledge several limitations of the study. The sample size is inadequate to assess major serious adverse events such as cardiovascular events. The duration of the study is too short to assess long-term tolerability and safety, which would require chronic treatment of at least a year. The primary endpoint was selected to assess a key clinical question regarding the tolerability of the combination at two common doses of phentermine. Additionally, the scientific rationale was based on the known pharmacology of each agent and prior clinical experience with lorcaserin and other serotonergic agents. This pilot study was not statistically powered to identify rare adverse events, including serotonin syndrome. P values should be considered exploratory; therefore, nonsignificance could be due to a true lack of differences or a lack of power to detect differences. As with all early studies to explore combination pharmacotherapy for weight management, further research is needed to confirm these findings.

### Medications for the treatment of obesity in adolescents [^114EyErk]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The FDA has approved Qsymia for long-term use, but little is known regarding its effectiveness for obesity treatment beyond two years. Due to the limited long-term evidence for phentermine's effects on cardiovascular risks, and topiramate's effects on psychiatric and cognitive dysfunctions, as well as phentermine's abuse potential, Qsymia has not been approved for use in Europe.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: a new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^113AZQfe]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Weight loss can reduce the increased cardiovascular risk associated with obesity. Pharmacotherapy is a recognized weight loss treatment option; however, cardiovascular safety issues with some previous weight loss drugs raise concerns for newly approved pharmacotherapies. Phentermine is approved for short-term obesity treatment in conjunction with lifestyle modifications but is commonly used chronically. Topiramate, approved for treating epilepsy and preventing migraines, also induces weight loss. A single-dose combination of low-dose phentermine and topiramate extended-release was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention for the chronic treatment of overweight/obese adults. This review summarizes and evaluates the cardiovascular risk/benefit profile associated with phentermine and topiramate, individually and in combination. Cardiovascular data associated with long-term use of phentermine and topiramate extended-release indicate that this combination may be a safe and effective option for reducing weight in overweight/obese patients at low-to-intermediate cardiovascular risk.

### Qsymia [^115FhU5x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients with renal impairment: A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg in adult patients with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to healthy volunteers with normal renal function. The study included patients with renal impairment classified on the basis of creatinine clearance as mild (greater or equal to 50 and less than 80 mL/min), moderate (greater or equal to 30 and less than 50 mL/min), and severe (less than 30 mL/min). Creatinine clearance was estimated from serum creatinine based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation.

Compared to healthy volunteers, phentermine AUC0-inf was 91%, 45%, and 22% higher in patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively; phentermine Cmax was 2% to 15% higher. Compared to healthy volunteers, topiramate AUC0-inf was 126%, 85%, and 25% higher for patients with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively; topiramate Cmax was 6% to 17% higher. An inverse relationship between phentermine or topiramate Cmax or AUC and creatinine clearance was observed.

Qsymia has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Patients with hepatic impairment: A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Qsymia 15 mg/92 mg in healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function compared with patients with mild (Child-Pugh score 5–6) and moderate (Child-Pugh score 7–9) hepatic impairment.

### Prevention of type 2 diabetes in subjects with prediabetes and metabolic syndrome treated with phentermine and topiramate extended release [^1169s7RL]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates that PHEN/TPM ER plus lifestyle modification was generally well-tolerated and produced significant weight loss through 108 weeks in patients with prediabetes and/or MetS at baseline. The ability of PHEN/TPM ER to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes was profound, with both PHEN/TPM ER treatment groups exhibiting statistically significant reductions in incidence rate in these high-risk individuals with prediabetes and/or MetS, with greater weight loss leading to greater reductions in progression to type 2 diabetes. Concomitant improvements in glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and cardiometabolic disease biomarkers were also observed. These data indicate that adding PHEN/TPM ER to lifestyle modification may constitute a new and effective therapeutic approach in patients with obesity and cardiometabolic disease, even as an alternative to bariatric surgery, due to the ability of PHEN/TPM ER to produce substantial weight loss and reduce the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes in patients at high risk.

### Phentermine hydrochloride [^111t2bzT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. Late evening administration should be avoided due to the risk of insomnia. Phentermine hydrochloride capsules can be taken with or without food. Limit the dosage to 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m²).
- **Exogenous obesity: Dosage guidelines**. The usual adult dose is one capsule (37.5 mg) daily, as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast for appetite control. The dosage may be adjusted according to the patient's need. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients ≤ 16 years of age. Late evening medication should be avoided to prevent possible insomnia.
- **Renal impairment: Dosage considerations**. The recommended maximum dosage of phentermine is 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m²). Avoid the use of phentermine in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m² or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Coadministration of lorcaserin and phentermine for weight management: A 12-week, randomized, pilot safety study [^115qnJpR]. Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

To assess the short-term tolerability of lorcaserin alone or with two dose regimens of phentermine, a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, pilot safety study was conducted with N = 238 nondiabetic patients who were either obese or overweight with at least one comorbidity. Participants were randomized to receive lorcaserin 10 mg twice daily (BID; LOR BID) alone, or with phentermine 15 mg once daily (QD; LOR BID+PHEN QD), or phentermine 15 mg twice daily (LOR BID+PHEN BID). Patients reported at least one of nine potentially serotonergic adverse events (AEs), mean weight loss (WL), and weight loss of at least 5%.

Out of 238 randomized patients, 235 were treated. Among them, 94 reported potentially serotonergic AEs, with 37.2% in the LOR BID group, 42.3% in the LOR BID+PHEN QD group, and 40.5% in the LOR BID+PHEN BID group. AEs leading to discontinuation occurred approximately twice as often in the LOR BID+PHEN BID group compared to the LOR BID group. Mean WL was 3.5kg (3.3%), 7.0kg (6.7%), and 7.6kg (7.2%) for LOR BID, LOR BID+PHEN QD, and LOR BID+PHEN BID, respectively. Achievement of at least 5% WL was noted in 28.2% of the LOR BID group, 59.0% of the LOR BID+PHEN QD group (P = 0.0002 vs. LOR BID), and 70.9% of the LOR BID+PHEN BID group (P < 0.0001 vs. LOR BID).

The conclusion from this study suggests that phentermine, when added to lorcaserin, enhanced short-term weight loss without increasing the incidence of potentially serotonergic AEs. However, phentermine administered twice daily increased discontinuation rates compared to both lorcaserin alone and lorcaserin plus phentermine once daily.

### Bilateral acute angle closure in a pediatric patient taking lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (Vyvanse) [^111eJRH4]. Journal of Glaucoma (2021). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is commonly treated with amphetamines as first-line therapy. Rare case reports have shown that amphetamines are associated with open-angle glaucoma. We report a rare case of a 14-year-old male who presented with bilateral acute angle closure presumed to be related to his use of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (Vyvanse). The patient's medication was discontinued, which resulted in the complete resolution of angle closure.
