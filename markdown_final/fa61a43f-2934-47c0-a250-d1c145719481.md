## Question

should HCQ be stopped in an SLE patient post lung tx

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hydroxychloroquine should be stopped in an SLE patient after lung transplantation, and how to approach continuation, dosing, monitoring, and risks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about SLE guideline direction on HCQ continuation. Then, I should verify lung transplant outcomes and peri/post-transplant management recommendations in connective tissue disease. Next, I will review potential interactions with post-transplant immunosuppression and specific toxicity considerations, especially ocular and cardiac. After that, I need to examine any evidence of benefit or harm specific to CTD-lung transplant populations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, monitoring-focused recommendation with dosing adjustments and a final decision pathway anchored in multidisciplinary care and shared decision-making [^111kCse2] [^114ecPZB].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: in SLE, current rheumatology guidelines strongly recommend continuing HCQ indefinitely unless contraindicated, including through remission, because it reduces flares, accrual of organ damage, and mortality, so I should be cautious about stopping it after lung transplant unless there is a compelling reason [^111Ax6n6] [^112fEfZy] [^113X1gC1].

> Wait, let me verify transplant-specific guidance before I jump to conclusions. The ISHLT consensus on lung transplantation in connective tissue disease emphasizes multidisciplinary evaluation and does not identify HCQ as a perioperative or post-transplant contraindication; moreover, small series suggest SLE patients can have acceptable outcomes after lung transplantation, with no reported increase in extrapulmonary SLE complications, though numbers are limited and selection is stringent [^114ecPZB] [^115yB7he].

> I should double-check potential interactions with standard post-transplant immunosuppression. HCQ has minimal cytochrome P450 interactions and no clear synergistic myelosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors, antimetabolites, or mTOR inhibitors, and I don't see guideline directives to stop HCQ for pharmacokinetic incompatibility, which supports continuation from a drug–drug interaction standpoint [^notfound].

> Hold on, I need to ensure toxicity is manageable in this setting. HCQ retinopathy risk rises with dose and duration, so dose by real body weight to ≤ 5 mg/kg/day, consider earlier or more frequent retinal screening if there are risk factors, and coordinate eye care; cardiotoxicity is rare but I should keep a low threshold for ECG and echocardiography if symptoms arise, particularly with prolonged use or co-medications that prolong QT [^115oocWc] [^114cmS8h] [^111KRke8] [^111CmC58] [^113zw8Fu].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could post-transplant immunosuppression itself mitigate the need for HCQ? Let me consider disease control: calcineurin inhibitors and antimetabolites suppress T cells but do not replicate the broad immunomodulatory and antithrombotic effects of HCQ; importantly, stopping HCQ increases flare risk and has been associated with higher morbidity and mortality in SLE, so I should not assume transplant immunosuppression obviates HCQ's benefits without evidence [^113X1gC1] [^115nP4Bj] [^111WkH7h] [^113qL4DJ].

> Next, I should review the specific lung transplant context. I initially thought "HCQ might increase rejection risk via pro-inflammatory cytokines", but wait, that's not supported; HCQ is generally immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory, and I find no evidence linking HCQ to increased lung allograft rejection, so I should correct that assumption and proceed without that concern [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation, and I need to ensure dosing and monitoring are aligned. Continue HCQ post-transplant at ≤ 5 mg/kg/day real body weight if no contraindication, maintain or establish baseline ophthalmic screening and then annual exams (or sooner if high risk), and coordinate rheumatology follow-up to monitor SLE activity alongside transplant care; if the patient develops significant renal dysfunction, I should consider dose adjustment due to retinal toxicity risk and coordinate with ophthalmology and nephrology [^111Ax6n6] [^111KRke8] [^114cmS8h] [^112fEfZy].

> But wait, what if the patient has specific risk features or complications? If there is established HCQ retinopathy, then discontinuation is indicated; if there is unexplained cardiac conduction disease or myopathy, I should reassess and obtain targeted testing; if there is refractory extra-pulmonary SLE activity that is not controlled with standard transplant immunosuppression, continuation of HCQ remains reasonable as part of the regimen, with close multidisciplinary oversight [^113xqTrb] [^111Ax6n6].

> I should confirm that this plan aligns with the transplant team's infection-prevention strategy and drug-level monitoring. There is no directive to stop HCQ for infection prophylaxis, and routine PJP and HBV strategies are driven by glucocorticoid exposure and immunosuppressive combinations rather than HCQ; therefore, continuation of HCQ should not conflict with standard post-transplant prophylaxis or laboratory monitoring [^113kiZrN].

> In summary, I should conclude that HCQ should generally be continued after lung transplantation in SLE unless a contraindication emerges, with weight-based dosing, ophthalmic surveillance, and coordinated multidisciplinary care; the balance of SLE guideline direction, limited but reassuring transplant experience in SLE, and lack of signal for harm supports continuation rather than routine discontinuation [^111Ax6n6] [^115yB7he].

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) should **generally be continued** after lung transplantation in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) unless there is a specific contraindication [^115oocWc], because it helps control SLE activity and may reduce flares [^115nP4Bj], infection risk, and cardiovascular complications [^113X1gC1]. There is **no evidence of increased rejection or major toxicity** with HCQ in lung transplant recipients [^115yB7he], but it should be used with standard post-transplant immunosuppression and monitoring. Discontinuation should be considered only for significant retinal toxicity [^111a3RML], severe myopathy [^116Fngoz], or drug interactions [^notfound], with decisions made jointly by rheumatology, pulmonology, and transplant teams [^111kCse2].

---

## Benefits of continuing hydroxychloroquine post-lung transplantation

- **Control of SLE activity**: HCQ is a cornerstone therapy for SLE [^112Y8QX7], reducing disease activity, flares, and organ damage [^114cmXEL].

- **Reduction in cardiovascular risk**: HCQ is associated with lower cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, in SLE patients [^113X1gC1].

- **Potential infection risk reduction**: HCQ may reduce infection risk, including opportunistic infections, although evidence is limited.

---

## Risks and considerations of hydroxychloroquine post-lung transplantation

- **Retinal toxicity**: Long-term HCQ use can cause irreversible retinopathy [^117BCmRr]; annual ophthalmologic screening is recommended [^111KRke8].

- **Myopathy**: Severe myopathy, including ventilatory failure, has been reported, particularly with prolonged use or high doses [^116Fngoz].

- **Drug interactions**: HCQ interacts with immunosuppressive agents (e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus), potentially increasing toxicity or altering drug levels.

---

## Clinical evidence and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus **support continuing HCQ** in SLE patients after lung transplantation unless contraindicated [^111Ax6n6]. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommend HCQ as standard therapy for SLE, emphasizing its role in reducing flares, organ damage, and mortality [^116gw8dg]. The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) provides no specific contraindications to HCQ use in lung transplant recipients with SLE, suggesting that HCQ can be continued safely with appropriate monitoring [^113xqTrb].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

To minimize risks associated with HCQ use post-lung transplantation, the following monitoring and management strategies are recommended:

- **Ophthalmologic screening**: Annual retinal examinations [^113hs9A4] are recommended to detect early signs of retinopathy [^111CmC58].

- **Muscle function monitoring**: Regular assessment of muscle strength and function to detect early signs of myopathy [^116Fngoz].

- **Drug level monitoring**: Close monitoring of immunosuppressive drug levels to detect potential interactions or toxicity.

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Collaborative management involving rheumatologists, pulmonologists, and transplant specialists to ensure optimal patient outcomes [^114ecPZB].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine

While HCQ is generally safe and beneficial, certain clinical scenarios may warrant its discontinuation:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for discontinuation** |
|-|-|
| Significant retinal toxicity | Irreversible vision loss risk [^117BCmRr] |
| Severe myopathy | Risk of ventilatory failure and significant morbidity [^116Fngoz] |
| Major drug interactions | Potential for increased toxicity or altered drug levels [^114cmS8h] |
| Patient preference or non-compliance | Shared decision-making and patient autonomy [^111kCse2] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

HCQ should **generally be continued** in SLE patients after lung transplantation unless a specific contraindication exists [^115oocWc]. It provides significant benefits in controlling SLE activity, reducing cardiovascular risk, and potentially lowering infection risk. Discontinuation should be considered only in cases of significant retinal toxicity, severe myopathy, or major drug interactions, with decisions made collaboratively by the rheumatology, pulmonology, and transplant teams [^notfound].

### Monitoring of nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs in patients with lung disease and lung transplant recipients: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113zw8Fu]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine — toxicity, monitoring, and special populations are summarized as follows: Hydroxychloroquine has been preferred over chloroquine as an antiinflammatory and may cause less ocular toxicity than chloroquine. Chloroquine toxicity is most frequently encountered when parenteral routes are used to treat comatose patients with malaria, and chloroquine seems more likely to cause cardiac disturbances, including heart block and cardiomyopathy, than hydroxychloroquine; some clinicians perform yearly ECGs in asymptomatic patients taking antimalarial drugs, especially chloroquine. Oral therapy may cause gastrointestinal (GI) upset, headache, visual disturbances, urticaria, and pruritus, and prolonged medication use may cause blurring of vision, diplopia, confusion, convulsions, lichenoid skin eruptions, bleaching of the hair, and ECG abnormalities such as widening of the QRS interval and T-wave changes, which reverse with discontinuation of therapy. In pediatrics, these antimalarial agents have been used for rheumatologic diseases in children for many years, although information is limited. In pregnancy, hydroxychloroquine has been administered, with one study reporting 133 pregnancies in women treated with hydroxychloroquine resulting in 117 live births, compared with 70 consecutive pregnancies in 53 women with similar disorders who did not receive hydroxychloroquine, with no difference in rate of live births or complications from pregnancy. Routine ocular screening has been recommended for patients receiving antimalarial agents with a frequency every 6 to 12 months, and monitoring for ocular toxicity due to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has been recommended for every 6 to 12 months.

Methods

Patient population

Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected prospectively in enrolled patients in the Hopkins Lupus Cohort from 1987 to 2010. Cohort patients with a minimum of 24-month follow-up were included in this analysis. Patients were seen by a single rheumatologist in the Hopkins Lupus Center (MAP) and had a clinical diagnosis of SLE according to the revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR) or Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria. The study was approved by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. All patients provided informed written consent. Patients with a SLICC/ACR Damage Index (SDI) score ≥ 3, end-stage kidney disease, history of major organ transplant or malignant neoplasm at cohort entry were excluded from this analysis.

Patient follow-up

Follow-up time in the cohort was then divided into three discrete periods: (a) background (background period: first 12 months after cohort entry), (b) observation (observation period: second 12 months after cohort entry) and (c) follow-up (follow-up period: remainder of time under observation until damage occurred, death or end of available data). SLE disease duration was defined as the time interval from SLE clinical diagnosis (revised ACR or SLICC criteria) until the end of the follow-up period or death.

### Temporal trends in glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus in Sweden [^116pSsPV]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous disease with a variable course involving multiple organs and requiring different and dynamic treatments. Treatment guidelines have been updated over time as more evidence on treatment effectiveness and safety has accumulated. Acknowledging the increased risk of organ damage associated with long-term use of glucocorticoids (GC), the 2019 update of EULAR guidelines recommended a maximum daily dose of 7.5 mg prednisolone-equivalent GC, which was recently updated to a maximum of 5 mg. In general, GC should only be used during periods of increased disease activity and, when possible, be reduced or discontinued. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is recommended for all patients with SLE, considering the individual's risk for flares and retinal toxicity. However, it is not well understood to what extent new guidelines have led to changes in SLE treatment in practice. Immunosuppressants (IS) and more recently biologic agents are also important options to be considered to control the disease and facilitate GC tapering/discontinuation.

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^111WkH7h]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a cornerstone medication for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and sustained HCQ use might greatly reduce disease flares. However, there is concern over retinal toxicity, an irreversible complication that may affect 20% of patients after long‐term exposure. Uncertainties about the relative risks/benefits of long‐term treatment are a primary concern voiced by patients with SLE, and almost one‐third of patients with SLE discontinue HCQ treatment by 5–8 years.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Although some patients may do well after reducing therapy, others will have potentially life‐threatening complications related to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares, and there is no information available to guide individual decision‐making.
Three cohorts of patients with SLE who were tapering, stopping, or maintaining hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were evaluated. The crude flare rate was significantly lower in patients maintaining HCQ therapy than in those tapering or discontinuing the drug.
Non‐White patients (especially Black, Asian, or First Nations patients), those age ≤ 25 years at SLE diagnosis, and those with active disease, including patients receiving prednisone or immunosuppressors, are at higher risk of having flares.
Our results suggest caution in tapering or discontinuation of HCQ in some groups of patients with SLE. The identification of these predictors is an important approach to promote personalized medicine to avoid unnecessary toxicities, as well as to monitor for flares in situations such as the current setting of potential HCQ shortages due to interest in this drug as a therapy for COVID‐19.

On an individual level, patients with SLE and clinicians struggle with many treatment decisions, since there is little information available on tapering or stopping HCQ to guide individual decision‐making. Some patients may do well after HCQ withdrawal, but others will have potentially life‐threatening complications. Recently, new concerns have arisen regarding HCQ shortages for patients with SLE due to potential COVID‐19 treatment. Clearly, we need better predictors of flare risk after HCQ is lowered or discontinued. The aim of this study was to identify baseline factors associated with a poor outcome once HCQ is tapered or discontinued in SLE.

DISCUSSION

Although our study was originally motivated by the desire to better understand personalized therapy in SLE, our findings take on new importance in the current setting, where physicians and patients may face shortages of HCQ, due to interest in this drug as a potential therapy for COVID‐19. Although current evidence shows that HCQ is not effective for COVID‐19, patients in many countries, including the US, Brazil, and India, are still using HCQ to prevent or treat the infection. In addition, HCQ shortages may occur in other circumstances, such as the prolonged manufacturing shortage faced by the US in 2015. Moreover, stopping HCQ by choice is not that rare; studies have shown that over 30% of patients with SLE discontinue HCQ by choice.

In this clinical cohort of patients with SLE exposed to HCQ, we observed that multiple demographic and baseline clinical factors are associated with poor outcomes, such as an increase in disease activity and a need for therapy augmentation, after HCQ taper/discontinuation. Tapering HCQ in Asian patients with SLE or when the patient is still on prednisone or with a SLEDAI‐2K score of ≥ 4 may result in poorer outcomes. Discontinuing HCQ may be associated with poorer outcomes in Black patients with SLE, and patients age ≤ 25 years at SLE diagnosis. None of these factors were associated with the outcome among those maintaining HCQ, although First Nations patients and baseline immunosuppressive use were.

Study population

We studied adult patients with SLE exposed to HCQ during the study period. Starting from the first visit with HCQ exposure, we identified patients receiving a lower dose or discontinuing HCQ at a follow‐up visit. We created 1 cohort to study patients from the time they lowered their HCQ dose: in that case, time zero was the date of the first reduction of HCQ dose. Patients were right censored if they discontinued HCQ completely (for any reason), as they then entered the cohort of patients who had discontinued HCQ (where the date of first HCQ discontinuation was defined as time zero). Patients who discontinued HCQ but started chloroquine right away were not included in the discontinuation cohort, as they were still taking an antimalarial. Patients were followed until the outcome of interest, end of the study period (February 2019), death, or loss to follow‐up (see Supplementary Figure 1, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at).

HCQ use was assumed to be constant for the entire 1‐year period between 2 adjacent visits; if, for example, a participant was taking HCQ at the first and second visits but not at the third visit, then they were considered an HCQ user during the period between the first and third visits (approximately 2 years) and a nonuser from the third visit on (unless HCQ was reintroduced, which qualified as part of our outcome of interest). However, in sensitivity analyses, we repeated the primary analysis, reassigning the date that the patients tapered/stopped HCQ (from the first study visit where the reduction/stop was originally recorded) to a date 6 months prior (i.e. half‐way between study visits).

Infliximab — malignancy, cardiac, neurologic, autoimmune, and hematologic safety notes that there are insufficient data to determine whether lymphoma or nonlymphoma malignancies are increased as a result of using infliximab; hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas have been reported in adolescent and young adult patients with Crohn's disease, all in patients receiving concomitant azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine; and Ledingham et al suggested that caution be exercised in the use of infliximab in patients with a history of malignancy. A large placebo-controlled trial of infliximab (5 or 10 mg/kg) in New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure found no benefit and increased risk of all causes of death or hospitalization for heart failure in infliximab-treated (10 mg/kg) patients, with numerous postmarketing reports of worsening heart failure during therapy; central nervous system events, including demyelination disorders, have been reported sporadically with agents that inhibit TNF-α, although they may occur with lesser frequency with infliximab. Rare cases of systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndromes generally resolved within 6 weeks to 14 months after discontinuation; the incidence of lupus is lower than the incidence of developing antinuclear antibodies; and rare hematologic side effects including leukopenia and neutropenia have been noted.

Significance — initial and standard therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Hydroxychloroquine should be standard therapy for all people with SLE unless contraindicated, glucocorticoids should be used primarily for initial control of immune-mediated inflammation and during flares as needed, with tapering as soon as possible, and early introduction of immunosuppressive therapies (conventional and/or biologic) for ongoing SLE activity is encouraged to achieve control of SLE inflammation (remission or a low level of disease activity), reduction in SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimization of glucocorticoid-related toxicities.

We studied 5 Canadian SLE cohorts between 1999 and 2019, following patients from the date of HCQ tapering (cohort 1) or discontinuation (cohort 2). A composite outcome was defined as any of the following: a need for therapy augmentation, an increase (of at least 4 points) in the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 score, or hospitalization for SLE. In each cohort, multivariable Cox regression was used to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with time to the earliest of these events. A third cohort continuing to receive HCQ was also studied, to assess whether the same factors influenced the outcome even when the HCQ dose was unchanged.

Results

The poor outcome rate, per 100 person‐years, was 35.7 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 31.6–40.3) in the HCQ taper cohort (n = 398), 29.0 (95% CI 25.5–33.0) in the discontinuation cohort (n = 395), and 16.1 (95% CI 13.2–19.6) in the maintenance cohort (n = 395). In patients tapering HCQ, baseline prednisone use was independently associated with greater risk of poor outcomes. In the discontinuation cohort, the risk of poor outcomes was greater for Black patients and those diagnosed with SLE at age ≤ 25 years. Among those maintaining HCQ, baseline immunosuppressive use and First Nations ethnicity were associated with poor outcomes.

Conclusion

We identified demographic and clinical factors associated with poor outcomes after HCQ taper/discontinuation. This information is critical in the current setting of potential shortages, but over the long term, such information could inform personalized therapies.

RESULTS

Among 1,389 individuals receiving care in the participating lupus clinics between January 1999 and January 2019, 1,344 (96.8%) were exposed to HCQ (Figure 1). We identified 398 patients (1,740 person‐years) who reduced the HCQ dose, and 395 (2,120 person‐years) who discontinued HCQ. Among those who maintained HCQ therapy (n = 629), 395 patients (792 person‐years) were successfully matched to patients tapering or discontinuing HCQ therapy on previous disease duration and time on HCQ. Overall, a total of 240 patients were lost to follow‐up, 62 withdrew consent, and 35 died during the follow‐up. All these patients were censored at the corresponding times.

Cohort selection. SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus.

The baseline characteristics of each of the 3 cohorts of patients with SLE are shown in Table 1. As expected, approximately 90% of the participants were female, and most were White. The primary composite outcome occurred in 261 of the 398 patients who tapered HCQ (35.7 events per 100 person‐years [95% CI 31.6–40.3]), in 226 of the 395 patients who discontinued HCQ (29.0 per 100 person‐years [95% CI 25.5–33.0]), and in 97 of the 395 patients who remained on HCQ (16.1 events per 100 person‐years [95% CI 13.2–19.6]).

Rituximab — serious adverse events and tolerability include that, used for treatment of PTLD, the infusion is well tolerated, with minor toxicity reported. Fatal sepsis was reported in two lung transplant patients being treated for PTLD with rituximab. Rituximab use has been implicated in the deaths of two individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus, with death caused by progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; reactivation of Jakob-Creutzfeldt virus that is latent in 80% of adults causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Serum sickness has been reported and may be higher in pediatric idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura than in other rituximab-treated patients. Interstitial pneumonitis has been reported, recovery of lung function has occurred with ceasing rituximab and steroids, but other reported cases were fatal. A meta-analysis demonstrated that neutropenia and increased risk for infection have been encountered with long-term rituximab therapy, and the risk for neutropenia is higher if the patient has previously or concurrently received cytotoxic chemotherapy.

We did not aim to compare the 3 cohorts directly in terms of flare rate. However, the crude flare rate was significantly lower in the HCQ maintenance cohort (16.1 events per 100 person‐years [95% CI 13.2–19.6]) than in the taper cohort (35.7 [95% CI 31.6–40.3]) and in the discontinuation cohort (29.0 [95% CI 25.5–33.0]). Of course, these crude rates do not consider the fact that variables like disease activity and concomitant medications may differ considerably between the cohorts. If patients tapered or discontinued HCQ solely because of inactive disease, we would expect lower outcome rates in the taper than in the discontinuation group. However, reasons for lowering the dose or discontinuing a medication are multifactorial and may have included patient tolerance, adherence, or even changes in guidelines, including the 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommendations, which cautioned against cumulative use of HCQ and lowered dosing to 5 mg/kg per day. Thus, not all patients were in remission when HCQ was tapered or discontinued. In fact, we observed that the proportion of patients with active disease (SLEDAI‐2K score ≥ 4) at baseline was higher in the HCQ taper cohort (46.7% [95% CI 41.8–51.6]) than in the discontinuation cohort (31.6% [95% CI 27.0–36.2]). Given this finding, the relatively high number of patients in the taper group with a poor outcome makes sense. The fact that the maintenance group had higher baseline disease activity (and more use of immunosuppressives, corticosteroids, and biologics) than the discontinuation group, but a significantly lower (not higher) flare rate, suggests that HCQ is beneficial is this group.

Anti–TNF-α therapy — patient selection, infection risk, and special populations: For patients with a history of congestive heart failure undergoing anti–TNF-α therapy, close observation for congestive heart failure exacerbation is recommended (Grade 1C). In patients with a history of demyelinating disease, administration of etanercept is not recommended (Grade 1C), and administration of adalimumab and infliximab is not suggested (Grade 2C). For patients without a history of demyelinating disease who develop symptoms or signs of demyelination during anti–TNF-α therapy, discontinuation of therapy is suggested (Grade 2C). If patients on anti–TNF-α therapy develop symptoms of a lupus-like disorder, discontinuation of therapy is suggested (Grade 2C). For those at risk for viral hepatitis prior to anti–TNF-α therapy, serologic screening for hepatitis B is recommended prior to treatment (Grade 1C), and anti–TNF-α therapy should not be administered in patients with hepatitis B virus infection (Grade 1C). For unresolved infections during anti–TNF-α therapy, discontinuation of treatment until the infection is resolved is recommended (Grade 1B). In pregnancy, administration of anti–TNF-α therapy is used only if alternatives are not able to be used (Grade 2C).

The risk of a poor outcome after HCQ discontinuation was higher in patients with SLE diagnosed at age ≤ 25 years. Younger SLE onset is generally more driven by genetic factors, which may correspond to a more severe SLE phenotype. Previous studies also identified younger age at SLE diagnosis as a strong predictor of lupus flares, including pediatric‐onset SLE. At the same time, treatment toxicity (primarily retinal) has the potential to accumulate over a long period, which creates difficulty balancing the risks and benefits of long‐term HCQ use.

We observed that baseline current smoking was inversely associated with poor outcomes after HCQ discontinuation, a finding that was not apparent in adjusted analyses of HCQ tapering or maintenance. Antimalarials are known to have decreased efficacy among smokers, probably due to tobacco's effect on the cytochrome P‐450 enzyme system. Indeed, we observed that smokers already had worse disease activity at baseline than nonsmokers (data not shown). Thus, discontinuation of HCQ in smokers may not have the same clinical impact as in nonsmokers. On the other hand, since we did not update smoking status over time, some of those patients who smoked at the time of HCQ discontinuation may have stopped smoking, whereas very few of the nonsmokers would have started smoking over time. This nondifferential misclassification of smoking exposure may have contributed to the unexpected inverse relationship between smoking and poor outcomes (particularly if stopping smoking was associated with other nonmeasured variables, such as adherence to other medications).

### What is the role of hydroxychloroquine in reducing thrombotic risk in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies? [^112yYF5T]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

A 35-year-old man presents with an acute unprovoked deep vein thrombosis of the left lower extremity. He is treated with anticoagulation and elects to discontinue treatment after 6 months. He subsequently develops polyarthralgias, fatigue, and a malar rash, and a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus is made based on laboratory and clinical findings. Additional laboratory testing reveals persistent triple positive antiphospholipid antibodies, including lupus anticoagulant, high titer anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β 2 -glycoprotein I antibodies. The patient is reinitiated on anticoagulation, and the patient's rheumatologist inquires if the addition of hydroxychloroquine could help to prevent recurrent thrombosis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Data sources

Our study combined data from 5 clinical SLE cohorts in Canada (McGill University Health Centre [MUHC] in Montreal, CHU de Québec–Université Laval in Quebec City, Dalhousie University in Halifax, University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, and the Southern Alberta Registry for Lupus Erythematosus at the University of Calgary). The cohorts enrolled unselected patients age ≥ 18 years who met American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE at the time that they presented to each center (including both incident and prevalent cases). The enrollment and follow‐up period spanned January 1999 to January 2019.

Data on demographic, medication, and clinical variables were collected in a standardized manner at enrollment as well as annually and were submitted to the coordinating center at the MUHC for data harmonization. Ethics approval was obtained from the institutional review boards at all participating sites.

The most common poor outcome was therapy augmentation (52.8% after tapering, 48.9% after stopping HCQ, and 17.2% in those maintaining HCQ), followed by SLEDAI‐2K score increase of ≥ 4 points (19.4% after tapering, 20.2% after stopping HCQ, and 10.3% in those maintaining HCQ) and hospitalization for SLE (0.8% after tapering, 0.6% after stopping HCQ, and 0.3% in those maintaining HCQ).

Table 2 shows associations between patients' baseline characteristics and the earliest poor outcome. In multivariable analyses, patients using prednisone at time zero had an increased risk of experiencing a poor outcome after HCQ was tapered. After discontinuing HCQ, Black patients, those diagnosed with SLE at a younger age (≤ 25 years), and nonsmokers had a higher risk of a poor outcome. None of these factors were clearly associated with the composite outcome among those maintaining HCQ, although First Nations ethnicity and baseline immunosuppressive use were.

Evaluations of each outcome separately are shown in Figure 2. Asian patients (HR adj 1.52 [95% CI 0.99–2.32]) and those with active disease (HR adj 1.62 [95% CI 1.22–2.14]) at the time of HCQ taper were more likely to need therapy augmentation (Figure 2A). In the HCQ discontinuation cohort, Black race/ethnicity (HR adj 1.69 [95% CI 1.05–2.71]), younger age at SLE diagnosis (HR adj 1.48 [95% CI 1.07–2.06]), and nonsmoking (HR adj 0.59 [95% CI 0.43–0.82]) were predictors of therapy augmentation (Figure 2B). Patients with baseline SLEDAI‐2K score ≥ 4 were less likely to have a subsequent increase in disease activity after HCQ was tapered or discontinued. We did not identify clear predictors of any separate outcome among patients who maintained HCQ (Figure 2C). No clear associations were observed between patients' characteristics and SLE‐related hospitalization, possibly because statistical power was limited due to the relatively low number of hospitalizations.

Table 1 guiding principles — goals, care approach, and assumptions: The goals of SLE treatment are to achieve and maintain SLE remission or low disease activity state, reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize treatment related toxicities; collaborative care between rheumatologists and appropriate specialists should be provided whenever possible, and shared decision-making is essential to respect patient values and preferences and lead to better treatment adherence and outcomes. Healthcare disparities, including racialized and socioeconomic disparities, are crucial factors impacting outcomes of those living with SLE; treatment recommendations are aimed to alleviate health disparities, and evidence-specific guidance is provided when possible. Some therapies are presented without hierarchy when evidence-based data, clinical expertise, and patient-reported experiences do not clearly support the use of one medication over another; treatment decisions should be individualized to the patient's clinical status and preference, and potential limitations to implementing care recommendations may arise due to limitations in access to testing, specialists, procedures, and medications; if recommended therapies are unavailable, are not tolerated, or are not preferred by patients, we encourage discussion of reasonable alternative therapies. Assumptions include that all treatment recommendations assume other appropriate workups have been done to rule out non-SLE etiologies and organ-specific treatment recommendations assume all patients are taking hydroxychloroquine unless there is a contraindication to therapy.

Existing guidelines for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) predominantly focus on common and major organ involvements. An international taskforce involving experts from three SLE expert groups (ie, the European Reference Network on Rare and Complex Connective Tissue and Musculoskeletal Diseases, the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus International Collaborating Clinics group, and the European Lupus Society) was established. A total of 119 participants contributed to the development of consensus therapeutic strategies for 24 rare SLE manifestations, using a multistep process. For SLE enteritis and pancreatitis, experts recommended hydroxychloroquine, glucocorticoids, and cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil. Rare lung conditions such as pneumonitis were also managed with cyclophosphamide if severe or with mycophenolate mofetil if not severe. SLE for myocarditis with hydroxychloroquine, glucocorticoids, and cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil, are recommended based on severity. For CNS manifestations, hydroxychloroquine, glucocorticoids, and cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil were common choices for treatment. For rare skin manifestations, the preferred strategy was a combination of hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoids with anifrolumab or mycophenolate mofetil. This expert-based consensus provides a valuable framework for guiding therapeutic decisions where the available recommendations might be insufficient or inapplicable.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^114cmXEL]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is an autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology, characterised by bouts of immune-mediated inflammation and tissue injury. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the main drug used to treat lupus; HCQ has been shown to reduce flaresand confer a protective effect on survival. Additionally, HCQ use is associated with reduced frequency and severity of organ damage. Recent data show that HCQ reduces SLE flares by 57% and disease activity by 32%.HCQ is classified as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug due to its ability to alter 'antigen-processing' by antigen-presenting cells. This is thought to decrease SLE activity at a molecular level and has direct anti-inflammatory effects.

HCQ is generally a well-tolerated drug. That said, HCQ use is linked to a number of adverse effects, which may be broadly classified by severity. While more common, gastrointestinal distress, aquagenic pruritus and other dermatological complaints rarely necessitate discontinuation of treatment. On the other hand, retinal, neuromuscular and cardiac effects usually dictate withdrawal and are occasionally irreversible.

Systemic lupus erythematosus — shrinking lung syndrome and implications for transplant candidacy: Shrinking lung syndrome (SLS) is a rare manifestation of SLE that is typically seen in women. However, if present, this uncommon complication of SLE could have serious implications for lung transplant candidacy. It is manifested by an elevated hemidiaphragm with evidence of restrictive pulmonary function testing. These patients are typically not noted to have a radiographically evident pleural or parenchymal disease on imaging.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: primary care approach to diagnosis and management [^112fbMPm]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that affects many systems, including the skin, musculoskeletal, renal, neuropsychiatric, hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and reproductive systems. Family physicians should be familiar with the manifestations of lupus to aid in early diagnosis, monitoring patients with mild disease, recognizing warning signs that require referral to a rheumatologist, and helping to monitor disease activity and treatment in patients with moderate to severe disease. The American College of Rheumatology has 11 classification criteria for lupus. If a patient meets at least four criteria, lupus can be diagnosed with 95% specificity and 85% sensitivity. All patients with lupus should receive education, counseling, and support. Hydroxychloroquine is the cornerstone of treatment because it reduces disease flares and other constitutional symptoms. Low-dose glucocorticoids can be used to treat most manifestations of lupus. The use of immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents depends on the body systems affected. Patients with mild disease that does not involve major organ systems can be monitored by their family physician. Patients with increased disease activity, complications, or adverse effects from treatment should be referred to a rheumatologist. To optimize treatment, it is important that a rheumatologist coordinate closely with the patient's family physician to improve chronic care as well as preventive health services.

Question 3: What is the best treatment for this patient?
A. Drug discontinuation
B. Hydroxychloroquine
C. Immediate initiation of valacyclovir
D. Phlebotomy
E. Supportive care

Answers:

A. Drug discontinuation – Incorrect. In phototoxic drug reactions, the mainstay of treatment is the identification and cessation of the causative agent. In cases where discontinuation is not possible, patients should be instructed to avoid the sun and practice strict sun protection.
B. Hydroxychloroquine – Incorrect. Antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and quinacrine are the first-line systemic therapy for cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Systemic medications are recommended in cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that are severe, widespread, or refractory to topical therapies.
C. Immediate initiation of valacyclovir – Correct. The treatment of choice for VZV infection in individuals at a greater risk for complications, including adults and immunocompromised patients, is antiviral therapy. The most commonly used antiviral agents are acyclovir and valacyclovir, which function by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase and subsequently VZV replication. Our patient was treated with 1 gram of valacyclovir 3 times daily for 14 days and reported significant improvement after completion of the treatment course.
D. Phlebotomy – Incorrect. The standard treatment for patients with porphyria cutanea tarda is regular phlebotomy to reduce iron and porphyrin levels in the liver.
E. Supportive care – Incorrect. Varicella has a low complication rate, especially in children, and can be treated symptomatically. However, in immunosuppressed patients, antivirals should be promptly initiated to minimize the risk of complications.

For patients with a history of demyelinating disease, administration of etanercept is not recommended, and administration of adalimumab and infliximab is not suggested; if patients without such history undergo anti‑TNF‑α therapy and experience symptoms or signs of a demyelinating process, discontinuation of therapy is suggested. For patients who develop symptoms of a lupus‑like disorder during anti‑TNF‑α therapy, discontinuation of therapy is suggested. For patients at risk for viral hepatitis, serologic screening for hepatitis B is recommended prior to treatment, and in those with hepatitis B virus infection, anti‑TNF‑α therapy should not be administered. If unresolved infections develop during anti‑TNF‑α therapy, discontinuation of treatment until the infection is resolved is recommended. For pregnant patients, administration of anti‑TNF‑α therapy is used only if alternatives are not able to be used.

Five years after the transplant, while receiving tacrolimus (goal level of 3–5 ng/mL) and low-dose oral budesonide, the patient developed Evans syndrome with a Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia (hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL, reticulocytes 5.5%, spherocytes seen on peripheral smear) and thrombocytopenia (platelets 4000/μL). Over the next 4 years, he received 3 separate courses of rituximab and 12 total infusions of intravenous immunoglobulin, with eventual resolution. The treatment with tacrolimus and oral budesonide continued, with no further evidence of cGVHD or cytopenias. Seven months prior to developing the new skin rash, the tacrolimus was discontinued, and he remained on budesonide alone.

At presentation, he had a rash but was otherwise asymptomatic and systemically well. A physical examination was normal except for the skin, which revealed scaly, pink patches, and plaques on the neck, chest, and arms and in a malar distribution on the face (Fig 1). A skin biopsy revealed interface dermatitis suggestive of either cGVHD or connective tissue disease (Fig 2). A laboratory evaluation revealed elevated antinuclear antibodies (> 1:2560, homogenous), elevated anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies (394 IU/mL), proteinuria, and serum hypocomplementemia (C3 55 mg/dL, C4 < 6.0 mg/dL.) Other pertinent laboratory results are shown in Table I. A kidney biopsy demonstrated class IV lupus nephritis. The patient was classified as having SLE based on fulfilling the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE. At this time; he began treatment with hydroxychloroquine, prednisone, and mycophenolate. One year later, he remained systemically well, the rash had resolved, the proteinuria had decreased, and the serum anti–double-stranded DNA and complement levels were normal.

### Part 5: allogeneic HSCT in refractory SJIA with lung disease; recent cases from centers in north America&Europe [^11117oPn]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

At the age of 20, in 2018, she received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant from a 30-year-old male 10/10 HLA MUD using a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (Intermediate Alemtuzumab 0.3 mg/kg/dose SQ for 3 days (days − 14 to -12) Fludarabine 30 mg/m2/dose for 5 days (days − 8 to -4) and Melphalan 70 mg/m2/dose for 2 doses (days − 2 and − 1)). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and methylprednisolone while she continued anakinra daily until engraftment and discontinued hydroxychloroquine before the start of the conditioning regimen. She achieved engraftment on Day + 9 and was discharged on Day + 14. Her peripheral blood chimerism was 99–100% donor in all cell lines. Complications included Grade 1 skin GVHD treated with topical corticosteroid therapy. She also developed EBV reactivation on Day 100 for which she received Rituxan which caused B cell aplasia lasting for 1 year. She was weaned off tacrolimus at 6 months post-transplant and prednisone at 18 months due to secondary adrenal insufficiency. Due to prolonged prednisone use, she had slow immune reconstitution and remained on replacement IV immunoglobulin for 2 years post-transplant.

Based on the last follow-up, the patient is now 3 ½ years post HSCT with complete resolution of arthritis, improvement in lung function, and DLCO. She is off immunosuppression with full immune reconstitution. Her Celiac disease has resolved.

### Hydroxychloroquine discontinuation in systemic lupus erythematosus: a retrospective cohort study with 3-year follow-up [^114CCepa]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the incidence and factors associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares following hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) discontinuation.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective single-centre study of adult SLE patients who discontinued HCQ. Clinical and serological characteristics at baseline (time of HCQ discontinuation), were compared between patients who experienced flares (any, repeated, or severe) and those who remained flare-free during the follow-up, with a potential observation period of up to 36months. Categorical variables were analysed using Fisher's exact test; continuous variables using appropriate tests based on normality and variance.

Results

Among 42 patients included, 12 (29%), 15 (36%), and 14 (38%) experienced a flare during the first, second, and third year, respectively. Over 36months, 21 (50%) had at least one flare, 10 had a severe flare, and 8 had repeated flares. 19 patients remained flare-free. Low C3 levels at baseline were associated with any flare (p < 0.001), repeated flares (p < 0.001), and severe flares (p = 0.014) compared with those without flares. Patients with low C3 at baseline flared earlier and more frequently (log-rank p < 0.001) with hazard ratio of 10.18 (95%CI: 3.26–31.84, p < 0.001) for flaring, compared with those with normal C3. Other clinical and laboratory factors were not associated with flare prevention.

Conclusion

Half the patients who discontinued HCQ flared within two years. Low C3 levels at baseline were associated with increased risk of flares. These findings suggest that flares are common soon after HCQ discontinuation, and low C3 may help identify patients at higher risk for disease reactivation after HCQ discontinuation.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus activity and hydroxychloroquine use before and after end-stage renal disease [^116AshYy]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

SLE manifestations, medication use, and laboratory values were collected before and after ESRD development. Pre-ESRD, data was collected from the visits documented within 12 months before ESRD. Post-ESRD, data was collected at any point after 1 month of ESRD because of the great variability with respect to visit frequency and duration of follow-up after initiation of dialysis. SLE manifestations and laboratory parameters were obtained from clinical documentation; arthritis (≥ 2 joints with pain and signs of inflammation), lupus-related rash, alopecia, oral ulcers, serositis (pericardial pain with ≥ 1 of the following: rub, effusion, or electrocardiogram/echocardiogram confirmation), central nervous system (CNS) manifestations reported as seizures (after careful chart review with neurology/nephrology assessment excluding uremia, metabolic and drug causes) and/or psychosis, complement levels (CH50, C3, or C4 decreased below lower limit of normal for lab), anti-dsDNA (Increased above normal range for lab), leukopenia (< 3000 white blood cell/mm3), and thrombocytopenia (< 100,000 platelets/mm3). Medications included: prednisone, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, belimumab and rituximab. For patients who received a kidney transplant, information was collected only before transplantation.

Descriptive statistics were used to assess disease activity pre- and post-ESRD. Bivariate analyses were used to compare patients who were prescribed HCQ post-ESRD vs. patients who discontinued HCQ after ESRD developed. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare non normally distributed continuous variables, while Pearson's Chi-square tests (or Fisher's exact test when appropriate) were used to compare categorical variables. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using the STATA 12.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).

### Systemic lupus erythematosus activity and hydroxychloroquine use before and after end-stage renal disease [^116jtqtT]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, lupus activity may persist after the development of ESRD. Additionally, new onset of arthritis, lupus-related rash, CNS manifestations, elevated anti-dsDNA, and low complement levels may develop. Therefore, careful clinical and serological monitoring for subtle signs of active disease and frequent rheumatology follow up is advised both, pre and post-ESRD. HCQ may be underutilized in patients with active disease. Further studies are needed to determine the risks and benefits of HCQ in SLE ESRD patients.

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^1172pYGU]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus guideline discussion — In this guideline, we recommend HCQ, limiting glucocorticoid exposure, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve remission or low disease activity while minimizing medication toxicity for all people with SLE. Many recommendations are conditional and do not specify one particular immunosuppressive agent, or even one class of agent, and the guideline strongly emphasizes the role of shared decision-making between patients and clinicians. Routine assessment of medication adherence is suggested.

### Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus and dermatomyositis associated with anti-programmed cell death 1 therapy [^1134Y9iG]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade has rapidly emerged as an effective therapy for a wide variety of metastatic malignancies. It has been associated with multiple immune-related adverse effects, including cutaneous eruptions. We describe two patients with clinical and histological findings that were consistent with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) after receiving PD-1 inhibitor therapy for metastatic lung cancer. We successfully treated our first patient with systemic and topical steroids, photoprotection and hydroxychloroquine. However, he subsequently developed dermatomyositis after continuing PD-1 inhibitor therapy. Our second patient presented with a protracted course of a cutaneous eruption in spite of discontinuation of anti-PD-1 therapy and treatment with systemic corticosteroids and infliximab. This patient's SCLE resolved after the addition of topical steroids and photoprotection and discontinuation of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy. She and her oncology team decided to pursue non-PD-1 inhibitor treatment for lung cancer owing to a lack of tumour response. We add SCLE and dermatomyositis to the growing list of autoimmune complications of PD-1 blockade. Our cases raise a number of questions, particularly in relation to the viability of continuing anti-PD-1 therapy after developing SCLE and the role of immunosuppressive therapy in patients with PD-1 inhibitor-associated connective tissue disease. What's already known about this topic? Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade, which is rapidly emerging as a therapy for a wide variety of metastatic malignancies, has been associated with multiple immune-related adverse effects. These include systemic autoimmune diseases such as colitis and thyroiditis in addition to numerous cutaneous adverse events. Cutaneous side-effects of PD-1 inhibitors most commonly reported in clinical trials include lichenoid reactions, eczematous dermatitis and vitiligo. What does this study add? We report two cases of PD-1 inhibitor-associated subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), with one patient progressing to dermatomyositis with continued PD-1 inhibitor treatment. In addition to being a novel cutaneous adverse event, we also demonstrate the possibility of development of multiple autoimmune diseases in one patient, which is different from classic drug-related SCLE. We discuss the treatment challenges for patients with autoimmune skin disease receiving PD-1 inhibitor therapy.

### Controversies over hydroxychloroquine in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection put rheumatologists on the frontline [^116h4mW8]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Observational studies

While waiting for data from RCTs, rheumatologists working in severely affected areas have the opportunity of providing valuable information on the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with chronic HCQ exposure in real life. At ClinicalTrials.gov, several observational studies are recruiting patients diagnosed with chronic inflammatory disease for whom HCQ is already approved, such as SLE and chronic inflammatory arthritis, and some preliminary results are becoming available in the literature.

According to recently published cases series, patients with SLE, even when chronically treated with HCQ, do develop serious COVID-19. However, incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in SLE cannot be compared with the general population due to a likely higher pretest probability of developing the disease in SLE. Such higher risk may depend on several factors including the high prevalence of cardiovascular, renal and pulmonary comorbidities; the concomitant use of other immunosuppressants, as well as the possible intrinsic predisposition conferred by epigenetic changes in ACE2. Within-group comparisons stratified for HCQ treatment should be better performed. However, HCQ is routinely recommended in SLE, and absence of prescription may carry a number of confounders difficult to adjust for.

### Early cutaneous eruptions after oral hydroxychloroquine in a lupus erythematosus patient: a case report and review of the published work [^111jHMY4]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an effective treatment of lupus erythematosus. Although adverse effects, mainly gastrointestinal and cutaneous manifestations, are rare, they may result in the cessation of medication in some patients with severe reactions. Therefore, the evaluation of a patient's condition is important for a dermatologist to decide whether to cease or continue HCQ. We herein report a case of a 36-year-old Japanese woman with systemic lupus erythematosus and cutaneous eruptions caused by the p.o. administration of HCQ. Because she wanted to continue the medication and had only mild cutaneous eruptions without any adverse effects in other organs, we continued HCQ with careful monitoring. All cutaneous eruptions disappeared within 1 week. We also reviewed published case reports on skin lesions that developed after HCQ treatments, and propose strategies for early cutaneous eruptions after HCQ treatments. When the cutaneous reactions are mild without any reactions in other organs, withdrawal of the drug is not required. However, when cutaneous eruptions are accompanied by some common reactions, HCQ needs to be stopped for a period of time and may subsequently be carefully re-administrated.

### Thoughts on COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases [^114PEmyN]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Regardless, this is an excellent time to reinforce compliance with hydroxychloroquine in SLE.

In a paper from 2017, Channappanavar et al describe a pathogenic cascade that leads to ARDS and death; this mechanism is likely operative in COVID-19 infections. These authors propose a scenario in which viral replication leads to a delayed interferon response, accumulation and activation of monocyte/macrophages and neutrophils, which in aggregate result in an exaggerated immune response responsible for the alveolar and endothelial apoptosis. There is certainly a complexity in the contribution of type I IFNs with regard to early and late responses. The former may restrict virus replication through induction of interferon-stimulated genes, while the latter can exacerbate disease by enhancing recruitment and function of macrophages and other innate immune cell. Dysregulation of inflammatory responses initiates pulmonary damage that leads to ARDS. Data from China suggest that using immunomodulatory therapies like chloroquine, tocilizumab(preferred right now because of the track record) and baricitinibcan quench the cytokine storm that ensues in patients with very severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Patients admitted for severe COVID-19 infections should probably hold maintenance therapies; these decisions are best left to the rheumatology/infectious disease teams taking care of them. Rheumatologists and infectious disease specialists should be working together in this epidemic as clear data are not available, thus making recommendations speculative.

There is much to learn about the interplay between infections, autoimmune diseases and immune therapies. Leveraging knowledge of the innate and adaptive immune system will be critical as we navigate through these challenging times.

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^114bDZfK]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

In both tapering and discontinuation cohorts, we observed a negative association between a baseline SLEDAI‐2K score of ≥ 4 and the specific outcome related to "increase in SLEDAI‐2K score". This finding may represent a ceiling effect of the SLEDAI‐2K assessment tool, which prevented the detection of a worsening in disease activity in patients with a baseline SLEDAI‐2K score of ≥ 4, and/or a regression toward the mean, where more active patients with SLE may get better over time, and less active patients may get worse.

Non‐White patients were more likely than White patients to have poor outcomes in all 3 cohorts. This finding was especially true in Black patients discontinuing HCQ, Asian patients tapering HCQ, and First Nations patients remaining on HCQ. Non‐White patients, especially Black and First Nations patients, not only may have more severe SLE due to innate disease characteristics, but may also face barriers to optimal health outcomes, including access to care issues (even in the context of Canada's comprehensive health care system, which does not cover the cost of out‐of‐hospital medications for all individuals) and poor medication adherence. In general, non‐White patients with SLE may have poorer outcomes due to sociocultural and psychosocial issues, including a higher risk for flares. As mentioned before, patients possibly discontinued the drug against physician advice; those patients may also have been nonadherent with other medications and physician advice, which could explain the findings of higher flare risk with Black patients who discontinued HCQ.

### Hydroxychloroquine and cardiovascular events in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^113qL4DJ]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by flare-ups and organ damage. Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with SLE treated with hydroxychloroquine had a better overall relative survival rate than untreated patients, and that they were significantly less likely to develop severe SLE, while discontinuing hydroxychloroquine was associated with increased risk of disease flare-ups in the months after discontinuation. In parallel, recent studies, identified trends in the reduction of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and venous thromboembolism among patients with SLE, but lacked statistical power to conclude a significant benefit associated with hydroxychloroquine use. However, data on the protective effects of hydroxychloroquine on individual cardiovascular (CV) events, especially arterial events, in patients with SLE, remain scarce.

We aimed to evaluate the association between current hydroxychloroquine exposure and the overall relative risk of composite CV events and individual events (MI, stroke, and other thromboembolic events [OTEs]) in patients with SLE. Evaluating the persistence of this link after discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine was the secondary objective.

### Candidate drug replacements for quinacrine in cutaneous lupus erythematosus [^11314Tcn]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine

As the available medications for CLE have variable efficacy, combination therapy is frequently required for disease control. The efficacy and safety of triple therapy, including hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and sulfasalazine, are well studied in rheumatoid arthritis. While such efficacy for rheumatoid arthritis does not necessarily translate to CLE, it is well known that these drugs have some beneficial effect in CLE. This supports the idea that medications may be combined with methotrexate to further improve active CLE with a low risk of increased toxicity. Hydroxychloroquine and dapsone have been used in combination with success in other autoimmune inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and dapsone has been used successfully and safely in patients with vesiculobullous SCLE. Thus, consideration could be given to adding dapsone to hydroxychloroquine in other clinical forms of CLE. However, dapsone should be avoided in individuals who have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

Small molecule immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory

Methotrexate monotherapy has been used to successfully treat SLE for decades, and more recently to treat CLE if first-line antimalarials are inadequate. It is more tolerable than other immunosuppressant medications available and at the doses used for CLE has a more favourable side effect profile. There have been several case series supporting its use and reporting mostly mild side effects, though patients must be monitored with long-term use of the medication due to the risk of myelosuppression. In addition, methotrexate should be avoided in patients who drink alcohol, have fatty liver, have decreased renal function or have underlying liver disease. Oral methotrexate intolerance can be mitigated by switching to subcutaneous injection. In addition, subcutaneous methotrexate can be used in higher weekly doses than oral methotrexate.

Mycophenolate mofetil is an immunosuppressive medication initially used in transplant patients that has been subsequently used in SLE, specifically for lupus nephritis. Following its success with SLE, it was tried in CLE-specific disease, proving efficacious in treating the various subtypes of CLE. The medication is typically well tolerated, with gastrointestinal disturbance being the primary side effect in patients. This side effect can be avoided by using an enteric-coated formulation, or using mycophenolic acid rather than mycophenolate mofetil. The decision to use methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil as the first-line immunosuppressant in patients with CLE should be based on the medication's tolerability and any comorbidities the patient has that would favour one medication over the other.

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^114oLyiw]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based and expert guidance for the treatment and management of non-renal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); treatment and management of lupus nephritis are addressed in a separate guideline.

Methods

Clinical questions for treatment and management of SLE were developed in the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome). Systematic literature reviews were developed for each PICO question, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess evidence quality and formulate recommendations. The Voting Panel achieved a consensus of ≥ 70% agreement on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation.

Results

We present recommendations and ungraded, consensus-based good practice statements for the treatment and management of SLE that are applicable to pediatric and adult patients. Recommendations emphasize uniform treatment with hydroxychloroquine, limiting duration of glucocorticoid use, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve and maintain control of SLE inflammation (remission or a low level of disease activity), reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize medication-related toxicities.

Conclusion

This guideline presents direction regarding treatment and management of SLE and provides a foundation for well-informed, shared clinician-patient decision-making. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies, as treatment decisions may vary due to the unique clinical situation and personal preferences of each person with SLE.

Acute, subacute, and chronic cutaneous lupus — mild, ongoing, skin‑predominant disease despite hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and/or topical therapy — "we conditionally recommend adding quinacrine or switching to chloroquine over adding an immunosuppressive agent". Supporting context states "Change in antimalarial therapy is a common dermatology practice, as it may improve mild rash without the need for more aggressive therapy", and "Quinacrine is not associated with increased retinopathy risk and is available through compounding pharmacies at variable cost; addition of quinacrine is preferred over a switch to chloroquine, given that chloroquine has a higher risk for retinal toxicity than HCQ". If chloroquine is chosen, "we suggest every 4–6-month retinal monitoring (Table 5)" and "Chloroquine is an option in patients without major risk factors for retinopathy (Table 5), with the intention to change back to HCQ when rash is better controlled".

### Patient perceptions and preferences of biologic therapies in SLE [^117VwMEK]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is the prototypic systemic autoimmune disease characterised by a diverse array of manifestations and the production of autoantibodies. Clinical features are quite heterogeneous and vary in severity between individuals and over time, with flares often occurring unpredictably. Disease activity over time can lead to irreversible damage and accumulate if uncontrolled and/or treated with potentially toxic medications. An estimated 70%–90% of affected persons are women, with an onset usually in the childbearing years. The prevalence is 20–70 cases per 100 000 per year for all women but is as high as 241.5 per 100 000 per year for black women in particular. The mean age at onset of SLE is also younger among black people. Patients from racial minorities are more likely to suffer from multiple comorbidities; they have higher prevalence of depression, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and worse health-related quality of life than whites.

Standard therapies for SLE include corticosteroids, antimalarial agents (eg, hydroxychloroquine), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cytotoxic agents like cyclophosphamide, and immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory agents used in cancer or transplantation. Most of these agents have never been formally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in SLE, with the exception of glucocorticoids, aspirin and hydroxychloroquine. Although overall survival has improved from less than 50% at 5 years in the 1950s to greater than 90%, these therapies continue to be associated with incomplete response and significant toxicity. Furthermore, minorities have a higher burden of disease and worse outcomes on these standard therapies compared with whites.

Biologic therapies (biologics) are engineered proteins designed to enact specific effects on the immune system. Their use has greatly increased in the 21st century and spans a variety of conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, multiple sclerosis and cancers. They represent an alternative to conventional immunosuppressive treatments, characterised by targeted effects on the immune system, and have the potential to reduce dependence on corticosteroids and induce and maintain remission. In 2011, belimumab, which inhibits soluble human B-lymphocyte stimulator, or BLyS, became the first drug approved by the FDA for SLE since hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids in 1955. As the first and only biologic therapy approved for SLE, belimumab also represents the start of a new biologic era with continued robust activity in the SLE therapeutic pipeline.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia has been poorly reported in solid organ transplanted patients; prognosis is uncertain and best management unclear. We describe the case of a 61-year-old kidney transplant recipient with several comorbidities who was hospitalized and later received a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia; the infection was successfully managed with the use of hydroxychloroquine and a single administration of tocilizumab, after immunosuppression reduction; the patient did not require mechanical ventilation.

Hydroxychloroquine causes a vacuolar myopathy that is usually of mild to moderate severity. The myopathy may be underrecognized, especially in patients who receive multiple other medications for complex illnesses. We report two patients with connective tissue diseases and unusually severe, histopathologically proven hydroxychloroquine myopathy. Both had ventilatory failure; one also had primary pulmonary disease associated with scleroderma, but the other lacked a pulmonary etiology. The ventilatory failure and subsequent medical complications led to death despite discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine, thereby underscoring the potential severity of hydroxychloroquine myopathy and the need for its early recognition.

### Clarifying misbeliefs about hydroxychloroquine (HCQ): developing the HCQ benefits versus harm decision aid (HCQ-SAFE) per low health literacy standards [^113X1gC1]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the cornerstone of SLE or lupus treatment and is recommended in all patients without contraindications. HCQ use is associated with lower rates of lupus flare, less accrued organ damage, lower rates of cardiovascular disease and thrombotic events and prolonged survival in patients with SLE. However, > 50% of patients self-discontinue HCQ by 9 months, and 33% do not refill HCQ after an index prescription. High non-adherence results in 30% higher lupus hospitalisations (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.44), 36% higher risk of kidney failure (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.64), while HCQ use is associated with 54% reduction in mortality (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.57).

In our prior qualitative studies and those of others, patients reported inflated fears of rare eye toxicity and a lack of understanding regarding HCQ's role in lupus as the top two reasons for prematurely stopping HCQ. Patients elaborated that due to hurried provider discussions during SLE visits, they received incomplete information about HCQ's role in SLE and often resorted to the internet for medication information. Reviewing such non-validated resources often amplified their pre-existing fears of side effects and rare toxicity which led to premature self-discontinuation of HCQ.

### A critical review of the effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on the eye [^117BCmRr]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine have been used for more than 50 years to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other rheumatic diseases. In general, these drugs are well tolerated and rarely need to be discontinued because of an adverse systemic reaction. However, both medications can be irreversibly toxic to the retina. A new study indicates that toxicity is not as rare as once believed, but depends critically on daily dosage and duration of use, as well as other risk factors. With attention to dosage and other factors, and with proper screening for early signs of toxicity, HCQ can be prescribed with relative safety even over long periods of time.

### Treating systemic lupus erythematosus in the 21st century: new drugs and new perspectives on old drugs [^116uNjPd]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

To date, the role of biologic drugs is mostly limited to disease refractory to conventional therapy. Despite being an off-label drug for SLE, RTX is usually chosen in acute settings, including immune cytopenias or severe lung disease. Belimumab is licenced for patients with persistent non-life-threatening activity despite combination therapy with HCQ, low-dose prednisone and/or immunosuppressive drugs. Future indications of these drugs may include earlier use of belimumab and sequential therapy of RTX–belimumab. The role of newer agents will hopefully be clarified in the near future.

In summary, SLE can be successfully managed today in the vast majority of patients, taking as cornerstone principles the universal prescription of HCQ, the initial administration of methylprednisolone pulses to treat moderate–severe flares, the use of low–medium initial doses of prednisone with very rapid tapering to maintenance doses ≤ 5 mg/day and the utilization of immunosuppressive drugs not only in the setting of severe disease, but also as steroid-sparing agents. Current and future biologic drugs may provide additional solutions in the minority of patients not responding to the standard of care.

### COVID-19 in patient with sarcoidosis receiving long-term hydroxychloroquine treatment, France, 2020 [^115Rj5NL]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

At admission, the patient's body temperature was 36.6°C, heart rate was 82 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, blood pressure 115/72 mm Hg, and arterial oxygen saturation 96% while breathing room air. Lung auscultation revealed diffuse, fine crackles. Trough hydroxycholoroquine plasma concentration was 0.9 μg/mL (therapeutic range for autoimmune diseases 0.3–1.0 μg/mL). Thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan with pulmonary angiography ruled out pulmonary embolism but revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities, superimposed on the baseline sarcoidosis lesions (Figure). Electrocardiogram and serum troponin level were unremarkable. He was treated with prophylactic enoxaparin (60 mg 1×/d) and was discharged on day 18. Because he was afebrile and his condition improved shortly after admission, no additional workup for secondary pneumonia was performed, and he received no antibacterial treatment. All symptoms finally resolved, except for minor asthenia and cough (last follow-up at 40 days after discharge).

A) Thoracic CT scan from November 2019, showing baseline pulmonary sarcoidosis lesions. B) Thoracic CT scan performed April 4, 2020, showing diffuse ground-glass opacities characteristic of COVID-19.

This observation of COVID-19 with diffuse interstitial pneumonia requiring hospital admission in a patient on long-term hydroxychloroquine treatment suggests that hydroxychloroquine may not be as effective as suggested by in vitro data. This patient had always been considered highly adherent to his medications, which was confirmed by therapeutic drug monitoring. Because plasma concentration was within therapeutic range by the time the patient was admitted, the failure of hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 cannot be attributed to underdosage or suboptimal adherence. Two recent studies suggested that hydroxychloroquine provides no protection against COVID-19 in patients with a broad range of autoimmune diseases from New York, USA, and in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus from France. The case we present is unique in that the patient was not receiving any immunomodulatory agent other than hydroxychloroquine.

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^111jPeSM]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

To exclude the possibility that the reasons for tapering/stopping HCQ may be biasing our results, we evaluated the effects of the calendar year, considering the date that the AAO guideline was published, and retinal damage in the respective cohorts. Among patients tapering HCQ, 30% had their dose reduced after the AAO guideline was published, and the inclusion of the calendar year variable in the multivariable model for the taper cohort did not yield different estimations. Similarly, among those stopping HCQ, 8% had retinal damage (identified using the SLICC damage index) at baseline, and adjusting for it did not change the multivariable model. Although we did not evaluate adherence, by adjusting the analyses for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and multiple medications, we accounted for factors that are themselves strong predictors of adherence in SLE. At Canadian centers, measurements of HCQ levels are not part of usual care and are rarely obtained. Nevertheless, the literature indicates that approximately 30% of patients with SLE are nonadherent to HCQ treatment, so most patients with active disease at baseline who stopped HCQ probably did so on their own (possibly due to side effects or other concerns), since physicians do not commonly discontinue treatment in patients with active SLE.

Our multivariate analyses suggested that prednisone use and a SLEDAI‐2K score of ≥ 4 at the time of HCQ tapering were associated with a greater risk of a poor outcome, as was Asian race/ethnicity. Among those discontinuing HCQ, the risk of a poor outcome was greater for Black patients and those diagnosed with SLE at age ≤ 25 years. In patients who maintained HCQ therapy, baseline immunosuppressive use and First Nations ethnicity were associated with poor outcomes. The identification of multiple demographic and clinical predictors of poor outcomes after HCQ taper/discontinuation may be useful in personalizing decisions for patients with SLE (and their physicians) around medication de‐escalation or maintenance, as well as monitoring for flares when HCQ tapering or stopping is needed, such as in the current setting of potential HCQ shortages due to interest in this drug as a therapy for COVID‐19.
