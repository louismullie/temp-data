## Question

Why is hypertension dangerous to kidney patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why hypertension is dangerous to kidney patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the bidirectional relationship between hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological mechanisms that make kidneys uniquely vulnerable to high blood pressure. Next, I will quantify the clinical consequences, including progression to ESRD and cardiovascular events. After that, I need to examine the evidence on blood pressure targets and whether intensive control helps or harms kidneys. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and highlight special populations and monitoring needs, making sure I double-check guideline concordance and trial limitations before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the bidirectional relationship. Hypertension is both a cause and a consequence of CKD, creating a vicious cycle in which elevated blood pressure damages renal microvasculature, which in turn worsens blood pressure control, thereby accelerating kidney function decline and amplifying cardiovascular risk, which is the leading cause of death in CKD [^112SgaPL] [^1114dFYq] [^115qYhL1].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to ensure I'm precise. Chronic hypertension transmits systemic pressure to glomerular capillaries, causing barotrauma, endothelial injury, and sclerosis of afferent and efferent arterioles, reducing renal blood flow and promoting ischemic nephron loss. In CKD, impaired autoregulation and RAAS activation exacerbate this vulnerability, and proteinuria further injures tubules and accelerates fibrosis, while sympathetic overactivity and volume expansion perpetuate the cycle [^111BpJe6] [^112SgaPL] [^1114dFYq].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical consequences so I don't overstate anything. Uncontrolled hypertension accelerates progression to ESRD and increases all-cause and cardiovascular mortality; even modest blood pressure elevations independently predict incident ESRD in population cohorts, and in CKD, the absolute risk of cardiovascular events far exceeds the risk of kidney failure, underscoring the cardio-renal link and the primacy of cardiovascular risk reduction in this population [^113JTnvF] [^117TMnXs] [^1114dFYq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about targets; I should review the evidence on BP goals. Intensive BP lowering reduces major cardiovascular events and mortality in high-risk populations, including many with CKD, but effects on hard kidney outcomes are mixed: meta-analyses show consistent cardiovascular benefit with more intensive control, yet no clear reduction in ESRD overall, with signals of benefit in advanced CKD and proteinuric disease but potential hemodynamic AKI and modest eGFR declines in some trials, which are often reversible when therapy is adjusted [^113NMA8q] [^115WzKdb] [^113GuPnW] [^116bJBsk].

> Let me consider guideline targets carefully and double-check for discrepancies. KDIGO 2021 recommends a systolic BP target less than 120 mm Hg for most adults with CKD not on dialysis, emphasizing standardized measurement; ACC/AHA and KDOQI generally endorse less than 130/80 mm Hg for CKD, while ESH 2023 recommends less than 130/80 mm Hg for most CKD patients and advises caution with very low targets; ESC 2024 prioritizes lifestyle plus pharmacotherapy to reduce CVD risk and individualizes targets in lower eGFR or transplant, reflecting uncertainty and the need to tailor to frailty and comorbidity [^117CkTEd] [^111xfgjo] [^1177p1vz] [^117NcuD9] [^111tZe8b].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought SPRINT clearly slowed CKD progression; let me reconsider. SPRINT demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular events and mortality with intensive SBP less than 120 mm Hg, including in the CKD subgroup, but did not show a reduction in CKD progression and was associated with more AKI and hemodynamic eGFR declines, reinforcing that kidney-specific benefits are uncertain outside proteinuric phenotypes and that measurement methodology matters for generalizability [^111bpcqd] [^113cup1Z] [^116LFD1n].

> Next, I should review who benefits most from intensive control so I can align targets with risk. Patients with higher proteinuria, younger age, and advanced CKD stages may accrue greater kidney benefits from tighter BP control, whereas older adults with frailty, fall risk, or limited life expectancy warrant less intensive targets. KDIGO 2024 explicitly advises less intensive therapy in frail patients or those with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, and ESH emphasizes individualization in lower eGFR or transplant settings [^117GDU5C] [^113k4R4p] [^114ohfsG] [^111tZe8b].

> I need to ensure the measurement strategy is correct because misclassification can mislead treatment. Office BP should be standardized with validated devices, appropriate cuff size, and proper positioning, and out-of-office monitoring with home BP or ambulatory BP is recommended to detect white-coat or masked hypertension and to guide titration, especially when targeting SBP in the 110–130 mm Hg range in CKD [^113ghkYQ] [^111VHZ2f].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and double-check it against guidelines. For most adults with CKD, a reasonable and evidence-aligned target is SBP less than 130/80 mm Hg if tolerated, with consideration of less than 120 mm Hg in selected higher-risk, nonfrail patients after shared decision-making and with close monitoring. Therapy should prioritize RAAS blockade when albuminuria is present, add diuretics for volume control, and escalate to combination therapy as needed, while reassessing for hypotension, AKI, and electrolyte disturbances during intensification [^111xfgjo] [^117CkTEd] [^111QhYd2].

> But wait, what about special populations where the balance of risks differs. In older adults with CKD, I should start low, go slow, and avoid overly aggressive targets due to higher risks of falls, syncope, and AKI; in dialysis, evidence for specific BP targets is limited and management should be individualized; after kidney transplantation, calcineurin inhibitor–related hypertension is common and RAAS blockade may be considered, though high-quality target-based evidence is sparse, reinforcing the need for individualized care [^114fq6Ug] [^113Bznor].

> I should confirm that I've addressed the core question directly. Hypertension is uniquely dangerous in CKD because it both accelerates kidney damage through direct microvascular injury and loss of autoregulation and drives cardiovascular events, which dominate outcomes; controlling BP is one of the most impactful modifiable interventions, but the optimal target must be individualized to proteinuria, CKD stage, age, frailty, and tolerance, with standardized measurement and vigilant safety monitoring to realize cardiovascular gains while minimizing kidney and systemic harms [^112SgaPL] [^1114dFYq] [^113ghkYQ].

Hypertension is dangerous for kidney patients because it **accelerates CKD progression** to ESRD through persistent glomerular hypertension and hyperfiltration [^111BpJe6], causing glomerulosclerosis and nephron loss [^115ke2oh] [^111BpJe6]. It also **increases cardiovascular risk** — the leading cause of death in CKD — via atherosclerosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure [^112SgaPL] [^115qYhL1]. Intensive BP lowering reduces cardiovascular events and mortality [^113NMA8q] [^115WzKdb] but may cause hemodynamic kidney injury in advanced CKD, so targets should be individualized [^111bpcqd] [^113k4R4p]. Hypertension is both a cause and consequence of CKD, creating a vicious cycle that worsens outcomes [^1114dFYq] [^112SgaPL].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking hypertension to kidney damage

Hypertension damages the kidneys through **several interrelated mechanisms**:

- **Glomerular hypertension and hyperfiltration**: Elevated systemic BP transmits to glomeruli, causing capillary hypertension and hyperfiltration, leading to endothelial injury, mesangial expansion, and glomerulosclerosis [^111BpJe6].

- **Renal microvascular injury**: Hypertension induces arteriolar hyalinosis, intimal fibrosis, and narrowing, reducing renal blood flow and ischemia, further nephron loss, and fibrosis [^115ke2oh].

- **Proteinuria and tubular injury**: Glomerular injury allows proteinuria, which is both a marker and driver of tubular injury, inflammation, and fibrosis, accelerating CKD progression [^111BpJe6].

- **Activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)**: Hypertension activates RAAS, promoting vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and fibrosis, further worsening hypertension and kidney damage [^111BpJe6].

## Clinical consequences of hypertension in kidney patients

Hypertension in CKD patients leads to **severe clinical consequences**:

| **Clinical consequence** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) | Hypertension is a major driver of CKD progression to ESRD, necessitating dialysis or transplantation [^113JTnvF] [^112drtUz]. |
| Cardiovascular disease (CVD) | Hypertension markedly increases CVD risk — the leading cause of death in CKD — via atherosclerosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure [^114aSREj] [^112SgaPL]. |
| Acute kidney injury (AKI) | Hypertension increases AKI risk, which can cause permanent kidney damage and worsen CKD [^notfound]. |
| Proteinuria | Hypertension promotes proteinuria, a strong predictor of CKD progression and cardiovascular events [^111BpJe6]. |
| Increased mortality | Hypertension significantly increases all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in CKD patients [^115WzKdb] [^113ghkYQ]. |

---

## Evidence from clinical studies and guidelines

- **SPRINT trial**: Intensive BP control (SBP < 120 mmHg) reduced cardiovascular events and mortality in CKD patients but increased acute kidney injury and electrolyte abnormalities, highlighting the need for careful monitoring and individualized targets [^111bpcqd] [^113cup1Z].

- **Meta-analyses**: Intensive BP lowering reduces cardiovascular events and mortality in CKD but may not significantly slow CKD progression, especially in advanced stages [^115WzKdb] [^116bJBsk].

- **Guidelines**: Most recommend BP targets < 130/80 mmHg for CKD patients, with individualized adjustments for frailty, falls risk, or limited life expectancy [^1177p1vz] [^113k4R4p].

---

## Risks associated with intensive blood pressure control

While intensive BP control offers cardiovascular benefits, it carries **potential risks** for kidney patients:

- **Hemodynamic kidney injury**: Lower BP can reduce renal perfusion, causing transient eGFR declines and AKI, particularly in advanced CKD [^1114dFYq] [^113GuPnW].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Intensive control increases risks of hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, especially with RAAS blockade [^116LFD1n].

- **Adverse events**: Higher rates of hypotension, syncope, and falls are reported with intensive targets, necessitating careful patient selection and monitoring [^113NMA8q].

---

## Individualized blood pressure targets and management strategies

Given the complex balance of benefits and risks, **BP targets should be individualized** according to CKD stage, proteinuria, cardiovascular risk, age, frailty, and comorbidities. Most guidelines recommend a **target BP < 130/80 mmHg** for CKD patients, with less intensive targets for frail or high-risk patients [^1177p1vz] [^113k4R4p]. RAAS blockade with ACE inhibitors or ARBs is **first-line** in CKD with proteinuria, with careful monitoring of renal function and electrolytes [^111QhYd2]. Lifestyle measures — sodium restriction, weight loss, and physical activity — are essential adjuncts [^112drtUz] [^114mUJqB].

---

## Conclusion

Hypertension is dangerous for kidney patients because it **accelerates CKD progression** [^111BpJe6], increases cardiovascular risk [^114aSREj], and raises mortality [^113aeE6C]. Intensive BP control provides cardiovascular and survival benefits [^111bpcqd] but may cause hemodynamic kidney injury in advanced CKD; therefore, targets and therapy should be individualized and monitored closely [^113k4R4p].

### SPRINT treatment among adults with chronic kidney disease from 2 large health care systems [^113cup1Z]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Reducing morbidity attributable to hypertension is a pillar of chronic kidney disease (CKD) management. Guidelines from the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) recommend treatment of hypertension to a target systolic blood pressure (BP) of less than 120 mm Hg when tolerated. This recommendation is based on the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) and its prespecified subgroup analyses in participants with CKD. SPRINT found that treatment to a systolic BP less than 120 mm Hg vs less than 140 mm Hg reduced mortality, cardiovascular events, and mild cognitive impairment; increased certain adverse events, such as acute kidney injury; and had no effect on CKD progression.

One of the main points of controversy concerning the KDIGO BP target is the uncertain generalizability of SPRINT to adults with CKD in clinical practice. Studies generalizing SPRINT treatment to the US population using NHANES data are limited by the small number of individuals with advanced CKD in the NHANES sample. Furthermore, although randomized trials have strong internal validity, they may not reflect the risks and benefits of treatment in clinical populations. Trial eligibility criteria and enrollment procedures result in study populations with different clinical characteristics than patients in routine practice. When the effect of treatment depends on baseline covariates (effect modification), and the distribution of such covariates differs between the trial sample and the target population, the treatment effect estimated in the trial sample will be biased or will not generalize to the target population. Traditional, 1-variable-at-a-time subgroup analyses in trials often have limited power to detect effect modification and usually explore effect modification on the relative but not the absolute scale. Additionally, such approaches do not provide patient-centered estimates of treatment effects because patients have many attributes that simultaneously affect the outcome and benefits of treatment.

### Does chronic kidney disease predict stroke risk independent of blood pressure? a systematic review and meta-regression [^1118JtJy]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

We report a hierarchy of adjustment for hypertension. The differential risk association between CKD and stroke depending on the method of hypertension adjustment used, particularly the effect of adjusting for multiple prior blood pressure readings, may have broader epidemiological implications for how we interpret allegedly independent relationships when the exact method of adjustment for confounding variables may be important. Based on these results, long-term blood pressure burden or control does appear to be a potentially important confounder of the CKD and stroke risk association. The degree of risk attenuation would tend to refute the hypothesis that low eGFR is a significant independent risk factor for incident stroke, outside of traditional vascular risk factors, particularly hypertension.

Adjusting for actual achieved blood pressure over time better reflects blood pressure control and duration, and may be a more meaningful method of considering this important confounder in the relationship between CKD and stroke than a single measurement or diagnostic label. A recently published post hoc analysis of the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial aimed to test the impact of achieved blood pressure on first stroke and renal function decline among hypertensive patients with mild-to-moderate CKD. In patients with a time-averaged systolic blood pressure of ≤ 135 mm Hg compared with participants with a time-averaged on-treatment systolic blood pressure of 135 to 140 mm Hg, the incidence of total first stroke (1.7% versus 3.3%; hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26–0.99) and ischemic stroke (1.3% versus 2.8%; hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22–0.98) diminished significantly.

Understanding the long-term sequelae of middle life hypertension beyond the typical duration of BP trials is important as clinical practice shifts toward more intensive blood pressure control. This is particularly true for patients with CKD where the optimal blood pressure target is controversial and for whom most of the evidence comes from short trials insufficiently powered to assess cardiovascular outcomes. There have been concerns from SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial)and other trials, that treating to lower BP targets results in higher risk for acute kidney injury and more rapid loss of eGFR. However, in a SPRINT subgroup analysis of patients with CKD, those assigned to the intensive systolic blood pressure arm did not experience an increase in urinary biomarkers of tubule cell damage despite loss of eGFR. It is likely that eGFR declines in this setting reflect hemodynamic changes rather than intrinsic kidney cell damage in patients with CKD.

### Effect of blood pressure control on long-term risk of end-stage renal disease and death among subgroups of patients with chronic Kidney disease [^115Rw2Xx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2017 American Heart Association guidelines recently lowered the blood pressure (BP) level that defines hypertension from 140/90 to 130/80 mm Hg for all patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 1 These guidelines were strongly influenced by the results of the recent SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), which demonstrated lower cardiovascular morbidity and all‐cause mortality among patients with and without CKD at elevated cardiovascular risk who were randomized to a lower systolic BP target of < 120 mm Hg. 1, 2, 3 However, the results of SPRINT have sparked considerable debate over optimal BP targets for individuals with different risk factors. 4, 5, 6

Despite the cardiovascular and mortality benefit seen with intensive BP lowering, SPRINT did not demonstrate a benefit of strict BP control on renal outcomes before the trial was stopped early by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board. But there were only a small number of kidney events in SPRINT. 7 The results of SPRINT are consistent with those of other trials in nondiabetic CKD, which also failed to demonstrate in their primary analyses a benefit to intensive BP lowering over a relatively short time period on renal or mortality outcomes. 8, 9, 10, 11 Post hoc analyses of SPRINT have suggested potential harm with an intensive BP‐lowering approach among patients with CKD, including a higher risk for acute kidney injury, although most patients with CKD did recover from these acute kidney injury episodes, and acute kidney injury was not a primary outcome in SPRINT. 2, 12

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent non-communicable disease afflicting excess of 650 million people and resulting more than 1.2 million deaths in 2017 worldwide. It has been well documented that the prevalence number of chronic kidney disease varies considerably across the world, such as, almost a third of patients living in China (132.3 million) and India (115.1 million). A significant contributor to the CKD burden is hypertension, recognized as a leading risk factor for the development and progression of kidney disease, which was reported affect up to 90% of the population with CKD and accelerating its progression. The intricate interplay between hypertension and kidney function has far-reaching implications for global health.

Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a pervasive and modifiable risk factor, and its association with CKD has been well-established, especially in Low- and Middle-income countries. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to kidney damage, ultimately culminating in CKD, which, in its advanced stages, necessitates life-long dialysis or kidney transplantation. However, there is no consensus on the goal of optimal blood pressure (BP) in the relevant guidelines, which makes it difficult to prevent hypertension related CKD. In addition, the uneven worldwide distribution of chronic diseases, such as CKD, complicates the allocation of global health resources. Global burden of disease (GBD) CKD Collaboration estimated the burden of CKD globally in 2017, and highlighted its rising incidence and deaths burden. CKD with different etiologies (such as diabetes, glomerulonephritis, and hypertension, etc.) were not reported in depth, nor was the temporal trend over the past 30 years. Exploring the burden pattern of aetiology-specific CKD, and the temporal trends may promote the precise prevention of CKD via more targeted prevention strategies.

### Primary hypertension and nephropathy [^112JgJRv]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The relationship between primary hypertension (formerly called essential hypertension) and hypertension-associated chronic kidney disease is complex and poorly understood. The strong association between hypertension-associated chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease supports the existence of common mediators. We will review data indicating common mediating mechanisms for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease in primary hypertension.

Recent Findings

Chronic kidney disease develops in primary hypertension due to local and systemic inflammatory mediators that cause endothelial injury. This injury is an important early step in the development of hypertension-associated vasculopathy that causes nephron ischemia with nephrosclerosis. Similar mechanisms mediate endothelial injury in cardiovascular disease and its progression. Subjects with primary hypertension at increased risk for chronic kidney disease are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, the major cause of mortality in primary hypertension.

Summary

Primary hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for both cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Better understanding of how primary hypertension leads to these outcomes might help in the development of pharmacologic strategies that retard and/or prevent chronic kidney disease in primary hypertension. Because of the strong association between cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease in primary hypertension, this improved understanding will likely lead to better therapies to hinder the development and/or progression of cardiovascular disease, in addition to its benefits in preventing hypertension-associated chronic kidney disease.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension, BP targets, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate immediate antihypertensive drug treatment in most patients with CKD independently of the CKD stage if SBP is ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP is ≥ 90 mmHg.

### Managing kidney disease with blood-pressure control [^112W1F7M]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

The progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is largely independent of the underlying kidney disorder once renal function has fallen below a critical level. Hypertension is an independent risk factor for disease progression in both adult and pediatric patients with kidney disorders. Increasing evidence from clinical trials indicates that the rate of CKD progression can be lowered by pharmacological interventions. Nephroprotective strategies currently focus on the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers provide efficient control not only of blood pressure, but also of proteinuria, an effect associated with improved long-term nephroprotection compared with other antihypertensive drug classes. In addition, evidence for an additional nephroprotective advantage of tight blood-pressure control towards the low-normal range in young patients and patients with proteinuria is emerging. In this Review, we describe the role of hypertension in CKD and discuss the therapeutic principle of the prevention of CKD progression with antihypertensive agents.

KDIGO 2021 blood pressure in CKD — implementation of physical activity and related lifestyle measures. The 2020 Hypertension Canada guideline recommends 30–60 minutes of moderate-intensity dynamic exercise 4–7 days per week (grade D), and targets may be challenging in CKD due to comorbidities and frailty with potential risks such as falls; moderate physical activity within the daily living environment may be easiest to implement. While weight loss and reduction in alcohol consumption are recommended for hypertension in the general population, the KDIGO work group did not provide specific recommendations for these in CKD due to lack of evidence; the KDOQI work group recommends that these interventions should be discussed with patients with hypertensive CKD, with targets like those for the general population if they can be implemented safely as there is no specific evidence for harm in CKD.

Comorbidities

Hypertension

For patients with CKD and hypertension, clinical practice guidelines recommend intensive BP control goal of < 130/80 mm Hg in most patients and < 120/80 mm Hg for high-risk individuals. For the general population, intensive hypertension control has been shown to have cardiovascular and mortality benefits in large, randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analysis. Application to CKD patients was initially conflicting, as many trials did not include significant kidney disease. Subgroup analysis of the SPRINT trial suggested that there may be increased CKD incidence with intensive BP control. Meta-analysis data suggests that intensive BP control may prevent progression of kidney disease in those with proteinuric CKD. Cardiovascular and mortality benefits seen in SPRINT and meta-analysis data rather than kidney-specific protection are the primary benefits for CKD patients with intensive BP targets.

Measuring blood pressure is a routine procedure in outpatient and inpatient practice that is often performed inaccurately. In an office setting, blood pressure should be measured with an appropriate fitting cuff on a patient's bare upper arm rested at the level of the heart after at least five minutes of rest. Other accepted forms of measurement include 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM), which provide more accurate representation of the patient's blood pressure outside of an office environment. Particularly when targeting systolic blood pressure in the range of 110 to 130 mm Hg, assessing blood pressure outside of the clinic to provide additional datapoints in between visits using a validated and calibrated HBPM or when available in select cases ABPM is important for monitoring and safety.

Diabetes Mellitus

For patients with diabetes and CKD, tight glycemic control alone has been shown to prevent the progression of diabetic kidney disease. Hemoglobin-A1c targets of < 7% are generally accepted as goal for reducing microvascular complications. This benefit must be outweighed by the potential for increased adverse events associated with intensive control.

Pharmacotherapy

GFR adjustments

As many as 50% of all FDA approved medications are renally excreted, and alterations in excretion may lead to systemic toxicities. For patients with CKD, medication regimens should be evaluated and dosed appropriately according to the patient's eGFR. The level of kidney function should guide prescription practice including avoidance or dose adjustment of medications.

### Hypertension and the kidney: perspectives on the relationship of kidney disease and cardiovascular disease [^115bpseh]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The kidney is important not only in the genesis of blood pressure elevation, but declining renal function is also important for predicting cardiovascular risk. The primacy of the kidney in causing essential hypertension was a topic of debate until the proof-of-principle experiment was performed, which demonstrated remission of essential hypertension in six African-American hypertensives with ESRD after they received successful kidney transplants from normotensive donors. The resolution of hypertension and hypokalemia in a patient with Liddle's syndrome and ESRD after subsequent successful renal transplantation also demonstrated the primacy of the kidney in a monogenic form of hypertension related to sodium epithelial channel dysfunction.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A review of the available evidence linking cardiovascular disease with chronic kidney disease.

Results

The cause for the inverse continuous relationship between kidney function and cardiovascular events in patients with native kidney disease and kidney transplant recipients is unknown but may be related to traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors. This is an important clinical concern and requires close attention to cardiovascular risk reduction measures.

Conclusions

Increased cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease is an important clinical concern. Improved biomeasures of cardiovascular risk and response to therapy are needed.

### Blood pressure goals in patients with CKD: a review of evidence and guidelines [^112u6U1C]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects the vast majority of patients with CKD and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, ESKD, and death. Over the past decade, a number of hypertension guidelines have been published with varying recommendations for BP goals in patients with CKD. Most recently, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2017 hypertension guidelines set a BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg for patients with CKD and others at elevated cardiovascular risk. These guidelines were heavily influenced by the landmark Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), which documented that an intensive BP goal to a systolic BP < 120 mm Hg decreased the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in nondiabetic adults at high cardiovascular risk, many of whom had CKD; the intensive BP goal did not retard CKD progression. It is noteworthy that SPRINT measured BP with automated devices (5-minute wait period, average of three readings) often without observers, a technique that potentially results in BP values that are lower than what is typically measured in the office. Still, results from SPRINT along with long-term follow-up data from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension suggest that a BP goal < 130/80 mm Hg will reduce mortality in patients with CKD. Unfortunately, data are more limited in patients with diabetes or stage 4–5 CKD. Increased adverse events, including electrolyte abnormalities and decreased eGFR, necessitate careful laboratory monitoring. In conclusion, a BP goal of < 130/80 is a reasonable, evidence-based BP goal in patients with CKD. Implementation of this intensive BP target will require increased attention to measuring BP accurately, assessing patient preferences and concurrent medical conditions, and monitoring for adverse effects of therapy.

### Are biomarkers useful for assessing cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic kidney disease? [^115qYhL1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic kidney disease is now recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular disease is the major cause of mortality in patients with the disease. Recent studies have attempted to evaluate the utility of biomarkers for assessing cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic kidney disease. This review will summarize these studies and critically assess the utility of cardiovascular risk biomarkers for clinical practice.

Recent Findings

Traditional cardiovascular risk factors including dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking and diabetes mellitus are highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease. Although prediction models using traditional risk factors underestimate cardiovascular disease risk in these patients, nontraditional biomarkers (i.e. markers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, myocardial necrosis, and left ventricular remodeling) have been associated with increased cardiovascular event rates and mortality risk in populations with and without chronic kidney disease. Moreover, a high prevalence of biomarkers that are directly attributable to loss of kidney function is observed in patients with the disease.

Summary

Recent studies suggest only limited utility of either single or multiple biomarkers of cardiovascular risk as prognostic tools in patients with and without chronic kidney disease. Novel approaches for biomarker development capturing augmented information through a systems biology approach are urgently needed to improve the usefulness of cardiovascular risk biomarkers.

### Risk factors for chronic kidney disease… [^111BQifF]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Approximately 1 in 3 adults with diabetes has chronic kidney disease.
- About 1 in 5 adults with high blood pressure has CKD.
- Adults with heart failure also have a higher risk of CKD. Risk factors Diabetes CKD is common in people with diabetes. Approximately 1 in 3 adults with diabetes has CKD. Each kidney is made up of millions of tiny filters called nephrons. High blood sugar from diabetes can damage blood vessels in the kidneys and nephrons so they don't work well. High blood pressure Approximately 1 in 5 adults with high blood pressure has CKD. High blood pressure can make blood vessels narrower, reducing blood flow. Over time, blood vessels throughout the body weaken, including in the kidneys. Damaged blood vessels in the kidneys may no longer work properly. When this happens, the kidneys can't remove all wastes and extra fluid from your body. Extra fluid can raise your blood pressure even more.

Keep Reading: Chronic Kidney Disease and High Blood Pressure. Heart disease Adults with heart failure have a higher risk of CKD because of reduced blood flow to the kidneys. Having CKD is also a risk factor for heart disease. Keep Reading: Chronic Kidney Disease, and Diabetes, and Heart Disease Family history of CKD CKD runs in families. You may be more likely to get kidney disease if you have a close relative with CKD. Obesity Having overweight or obesity raises your risk for high blood pressure and diabetes, the two biggest causes of CKD. This means that having overweight or obesity puts you at greater risk for CKD.

### Blood pressure targets and kidney and cardiovascular disease: same data but discordant guidelines [^115hKWdq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypertension is highly prevalent in the United States and a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Hypertension is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and likely contributes to the association between CKD and cardiovascular disease. The ideal systolic BP to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in individuals with CKD is controversial.

Several societies have released guidelines on the treatment of hypertension in the past year, each differing in important aspects, including BP targets. The release of new guidelines was largely spurred by the results of Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), which suggested mortality benefit with more intensive BP targets. Recent post-hoc analyses of a subgroup of ACCORD-BP participants suggest a benefit with tighter BP control. However, another post-hoc analysis of ACCORD-BP participants showed worse kidney outcomes with tighter BP control.

Summary

Lower target BP appears associated with lower mortality in CKD, although longer term benefits with regard to kidney function remain unclear. Within this framework, treatment of hypertension should be tailored to each individual patient, accounting for cardiovascular disease risk, medication tolerance, and individual patient goals.

Effects of intensive blood pressure lowering on cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease

There was no clear benefit for more intensive compared with less intensive blood pressure lowering regimens in people with chronic kidney disease, although there was only limited power for these analyses and little capacity to detect whether the effects of treatment varied according to kidney function; lower blood pressure targets have, nonetheless, been suggested to improve renal outcomes in people with proteinuric chronic kidney disease, providing some support for the earlier recommendation that blood pressure be lowered more intensively in these high risk patients. The effects of more intensive blood pressure lowering on cardiovascular outcomes in people with kidney disease remains to be demonstrated by future trials, such as the ongoing Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT, NCT01206062).

### Blood pressure control in chronic kidney disease: is less really more? [^112LPh8V]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

BP control is critical in the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease. Recent guidelines now recommend a BP goal of < 130/80 mmHg. Clinical trials using a randomized, intention-to-treat design have not established the benefits of this goal; rather, observational data and secondary or subgroup analyses drove the development of the new guidelines. A variety of observations suggest potential adverse events associate with achieving too low a BP in patients with chronic kidney disease, and ongoing randomized trials will have to establish the benefits or risks of meeting this goal.

### The kidney as a sensor of cardiovascular risk in essential hypertension [^114xD4jd]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Renal damage as a consequence of uncontrolled arterial hypertension is well recognized. Antihypertensive therapy has come to very significantly decrease the vascular damage in the kidneys of hypertensive patients. However, prevalence of mild renal insufficiency remains present in a significant proportion of the hypertensive population. This is accompanied by a marked increase in cardiovascular risk, as a consequence of the clustering of other cardiovascular risk factors and of insufficiently controlled BP. Prevention and protection of renal and cardiovascular damage in these patients will be one of the most relevant tasks in the future.

### Current strategies for management of hypertensive renal disease… [^111BpJe6]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension may result from any form of renal disease that leads to a reduced number of functioning nephrons because of dietary sodium and water retention. 5 Renal failure also can result from uncontrolled hypertension. The greater the severity of the hypertension, the greater the risk of renal failure, although it has been suggested that many of the new cases of hypertensive ESRD currently being seen result from poorly controlled stage 1 hypertension. 6 Although any primary renal disease can occur in a hypertensive patient, renal failure most commonly results from nephrosclerosis, a progressive proliferative lesion within the wall of renal arterioles.
7. This increased efferent arteriolar resistance reduces flow to the vasa recta, producing renal tubular ischemia leading to additional nephron loss. 5, 9, 10 The remaining nephrons increase in size in an attempt to accommodate the increased filtration load per nephron.

With continued dietary intake of salt and water, intravascular volume expands, which is a major cause of the systemic hypertension in patients with renal disease. The renin angiotensin is activated or at least not appropriately suppressed for the degree of intravascular volume expansion. 11, 12 Thus, the increased angiotensin II contributes to the systemic hypertension. The severity of proteinuria parallels progressive renal failure and increasing systemic hypertension. The increased angiotensin II is a factor in the proteinuria by decreasing the size-selective sieving of the glomerular basement membrane. 14–16 Proteinuria may also injure tubular cells, causing the release of cytokines, growth factors, and mediators of inflammation, as well as exposing tubules to filtered hormones and growth factors normally excluded by the glomerular macromolecule filtration barrier.
16. A persistent increase of the serum creatinine level greater than 88 µmol/L above a baseline serum creatinine value indicates worsening of renal function. The ACEIs can reduce renal function in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or renal artery stenosis to a solitary kidney. They can cause hyperkalemia in older patients and some patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. 52, 53 If goal blood pressure is not reached with an ACEI and a diuretic, another class of antihypertensive agents should be added. There is incomplete knowledge concerning all of the renal effects mediated by angiotensin II through the various AT receptors.

### Health-related quality of life in hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease in low and middle-income countries [^115ke2oh]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a major global health issue, responsible for an estimated 10.8 million deaths annually. By 2019, it was estimated that 1.28 billion people worldwide were living with hypertension, yet only 30% of these individuals had their blood pressure adequately controlled. Uncontrolled hypertension is a key risk factor for the development of kidney disease, stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The relationship between hypertension and kidney disease is bidirectional; elevated blood pressure causes damage to kidney function, and the progression of kidney disease can worsen hypertension, creating a vicious cycle. One of the primary mechanisms by which chronic hypertension contributes to chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the damage it causes to the renal vasculature, particularly through arteriosclerosis of the afferent arterioles, which reduces blood flow to the kidneys. Over time, this ischemic injury can result in glomerulosclerosis and progressive kidney damage. Additionally, uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk of CVD, which can accelerate the progression of CKD to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

CKD is associated with various complications affecting multiple organ systems, leading to a significant reduction in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) when compared to the general population. In hypertensive patients, symptoms such as headaches, chest pain, dizziness, and visual disturbances are common; however, these symptoms are not exclusive to hypertension and may also occur in individuals with other underlying health conditions. CKD patients frequently experience symptoms such fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite, all of which further contribute to lower HRQoL. Even in the early stages of CKD, patients often experience comorbidities and require polypharmacy, including nephrotoxic drugs that may worsen kidney function. The use of inappropriate or suboptimal treatments, such as medications that fail to adequately manage hypertension or that further impair kidney function also contributes to diminished HRQoL in hypertensive patients with CKD. Additionaly, side effects of treatment and family dynamics are crucial factors that influence HRQoL.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113Bznor]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension after kidney transplantation — evidence summary: Hypertension is common after kidney transplantation because of pre-existing kidney disease, effects of immunosuppressive medications, and presence of allograft pathology. Calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression regimens are associated with a high (70% to 90%) prevalence of hypertension. There are no robust trials in post-transplant patients comparing different BP targets or drug choices. A systematic review did not find that any BP-lowering medication class reduced the risk of graft loss, withdrawal because of adverse events, death, cardiovascular outcomes, or kidney outcomes compared with placebo/other drug classes. One trial of 188 kidney transplant recipients randomized patients to spironolactone versus placebo for 3 years and found no difference in kidney function or proteinuria. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to support specific recommendations on BP targets or recommended agents for kidney transplant recipients.

### Association of blood pressure with clinical outcomes in older adults with chronic kidney disease [^115mutop]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in older adults and is an established risk factor for mortality and cardiovascular events. Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) described the grading system used internationally for CKD, with Grade 3 representing moderate impairment, Grade 4 severe impairment and Grade 5 kidney failure. Global estimates of CKD3–5 prevalence for adults over 70 years range from 14.1% in the Netherlands to 56.6% in Ireland, higher in women. CKD and hypertension frequently co-exist and independently increase the risk of cardiovascular outcomes. Blood pressure (BP) management is a key aspect of CKD clinical care. However, studies incorporated into guidelines on BP in CKD largely exclude adults older than 70 years, despite comprising over half of the CKD population.

Debate continues about safe levels of BP reduction in older adults. Until recently, the consensus internationally for older adults with CKD without diabetes or significant proteinuria was to control BP to a target of < 140/90 mmHg. CKD guidelines do not specifically recommend adjustments for BP management in older adults. The recently published American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guidelines suggest a 'team-based approach to risk/benefit' in older adults, but currently BP-associated prognosis in older adults with moderate to severe CKD is not known.

### National Kidney Foundation consensus conference on cardiovascular and kidney diseases and diabetes risk: an integrated therapeutic approach to reduce events [^117LcTnz]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death in industrialized nations. Type 2 diabetes is a CVD risk factor that confers risk similar to a previous myocardial infarction in an individual who does not have diabetes. In addition, the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is diabetes. Together, diabetes and hypertension account for more than two-thirds of CVD risk, and other risk factors such as dyslipidemia contribute to the remainder of CVD risk. CKD, particularly with presence of significant albuminuria, should be considered an additional cardiovascular risk factor. There is no consensus on how to assess and stratify risk for patients with kidney disease across subspecialties that commonly treat such patients. This paper summarizes the results of a consensus conference utilizing a patient case to discuss the integrated management of hypertension, kidney disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and heart failure across disciplines.

Cardiovascular Risk Reduction in CKD

Blood Pressure Lowering

Hypertension is a major risk factor for CVD and CKD while cardiovascular events can effectively be reduced by blood pressure lowering in patients with and without CKD. A meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials including 15 924 participants with CKD found more intensive blood pressure lowering (from 148 to 132 mm Hg) to result in a significant 14% reduction in all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.76–0.97]; P = 0.01) in comparison to a less intensive blood pressure lowering (from 148 to 140 mm Hg) with similar efficacy in patients with more or less severe renal dysfunction. Blood pressure targets do consequently not differ in patients with CKD aiming for a reduction < 140/90 mm Hg in all patients, which should be extended to < 130/80 mm Hg if tolerated. Ongoing controversy exists whether systolic blood pressure should further be lowered to targets < 120 mm Hg. This debate was steered by the SPRINT trial (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), which randomized patients without diabetes (n = 9361) with a systolic blood pressure > 130 mm Hg to a target of < 120 mm Hg in comparison to < 140 mm Hg. Importantly, intensified blood pressure lowering led to reduced cardiovascular events (HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.64–0.89]; P < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.60–0.90]; P = 0.003), which was similarly found in patients with and without CKD, suggesting broad applicability. Interpretation of trial results remains, however, complicated due to a specific methodology with unattended blood pressure measurements performed in the SPRINT trial, which does not match the general assessment of office blood pressure in clinical practice. This uncertainty has created deviating blood pressure recommendations by different societies. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 2021 guideline adopted the results of the SPRINT trial and recommends systolic blood pressure to be lowered < 120 mm Hg in patients with CKD but without diabetes. In contrast, the European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend office blood pressure targets < 130/80 mm Hg in patients with CKD with the European Society of Cardiology guideline advocating to avoid systolic blood pressure values < 120 mm Hg.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^116LfaYF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In June 2023, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) presented and published the new 2023 ESH Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension, a document that was endorsed by the European Renal Association (ERA). Following recent evidence, several novel recommendations relevant to the management of hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) appeared in these Guidelines. The present report is a synopsis of the sections of the ESH Guidelines that are relevant to the daily clinical practice of nephrologists, prepared by experts from ESH and ERA. The sections summarized are those referring to the role of CKD in hypertension staging and cardiovascular (CV) risk stratification, the evaluation of hypertension-mediated kidney damage and, most importantly, the management of hypertension in patients with CKD. Of note, the 2023 ESH Guidelines and the present document do not discuss issues relevant to hypertension in patients with CKD G5 on chronic dialysis treatment; this field is extensively discussed in a previous joint consensus statement of the two societies.

### Blood pressure targets in chronic kidney disease: still no consensus [^1141zur6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite a strong consensus that treatment of hypertension is fundamental to strategies seeking to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce the associated risk of cardiovascular events (CVE), controversy persists regarding optimal blood pressure (BP) targets. This article reviews the evidence for different targets, discusses associated controversies and suggests approaches to improve BP control.

Recent Findings

Landmark clinical trials established the principle that lower BP targets are associated with slower progression of CKD in people with a greater magnitude of proteinuria and previous guidelines recommended a target BP of < 130/80mmHg for those with proteinuria. However, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial provided new evidence that a systolic BP target of < 120mmHg was associated with a reduced risk of CVE, though there was no impact on CKD progression and there was concern about an increase in renal adverse events. Nevertheless, 2021 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommended systolic BP < 120 mmHg, though other updated guidelines did not follow this trend. All guidelines emphasise the importance of standardised BP measurement and a personalised approach.

Summary

An individualised and shared decision-making approach to BP target setting and management is recommended, guided by standardised BP measurement.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^112gDYYh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and reduction of elevated blood pressure (BP) remains an important intervention for slowing kidney disease progression. Over the past decade, the most appropriate BP target for initiation and titration of BP-lowering medications has been an area of intense research and debate within the clinical community. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) in conjunction with several other professional societies released new hypertension guidelines based on data from a systematic review of clinical trials and observational data. While many of the recommendations in the ACC/AHA hypertension guideline are relevant to nephrology practice, BP targets and management strategies for patients receiving dialysis are not discussed. This Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) commentary focuses largely on recommendations from the ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines that are pertinent to individuals at risk of chronic kidney disease or with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. This KDOQI commentary also includes a brief discussion of the consensus statement regarding hypertension diagnosis and management for adults receiving maintenance dialysis published by the European Renal and Cardiovascular Medicine Working Group of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) and the Hypertension and the Kidney working group of the European Society of Hypertension. Overall, we support the vast majority of the ACC/AHA recommendations and highlight select areas in which best diagnosis and treatment options remain controversial.

### Intensive BP control in patients with CKD and risk for adverse outcomes [^113GuPnW]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance Statement

Although most guidelines recommend tightly controlling BP in patients with CKD, individuals with advanced kidney disease or severe albuminuria were not well-represented in trials examining the effect of this intervention on kidney outcomes. To examine the effect of intensive BP control on the risk of kidney outcomes in patients with CKD, the authors pooled individual-level data from seven trials. They found that overall, intensive BP control was associated with a 13% lower, but not significant, risk of a kidney outcome. However, the intervention's effect on the kidney outcome differed depending on baseline eGFR. Data from this pooled analysis suggested a benefit of intensive BP control in delaying KRT onset in patients with stages 4–5 CKD, but not necessarily in those with stage 3 CKD.

Background

The effect of intensive BP lowering (to systolic BP of < 120 mm Hg) on the risk of kidney failure requiring KRT remains unclear in patients with advanced CKD. Such patients were not well represented in trials evaluating intensive BP control.

Methods

To examine the effect of intensive BP lowering on KRT risk-or when not possible, trial-defined kidney outcomes-we pooled individual-level data from seven trials that included patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m². We performed prespecified subgroup analyses to evaluate the effect of intensive BP control by baseline albuminuria and eGFR (CKD stages 4–5 versus stage 3).

Results

Of 5823 trial participants, 526 developed the kidney outcome and 382 died. Overall, intensive (versus usual) BP control was associated with a lower risk of kidney outcome and death in unadjusted analyses but these findings did not achieve statistical significance. However, the intervention's effect on the kidney outcome differed depending on baseline eGFR (P interaction = 0.05). By intention-to-treat analysis, intensive (versus usual) BP control was associated with a 20% lower risk of the primary kidney outcome in those with CKD GFR stages 4–5, but not in CKD GFR stage 3. There was no interaction between intensive BP control and the severity of albuminuria for kidney outcomes.

Conclusions

Data from this pooled analysis of seven trials suggest a benefit of intensive BP control in delaying KRT onset in patients with stages 4–5 CKD but not necessarily with stage 3 CKD. These findings suggest no evidence of harm from intensive BP control, but also point to the need for future trials of BP targets focused on populations with advanced kidney disease.

### Impact of intensive blood pressure control on kidney outcomes [^113Ei7PL]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypertension has long been recognized as a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular events. However, the role of intensive blood pressure (BP) control in preventing kidney disease progression continues to be debated. This review will provide a brief update on the evidence in support of or against the intensive control of BP on kidney outcomes in patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), focusing particularly on trial-grade evidence.

Recent Findings

Recently, three large trials conducted in China compared the effects of intensive BP control in adults with cardiovascular risk factors. All three trials demonstrated that intensive BP control confers cardiovascular benefits, but mixed results were noted in terms of the risk of adverse kidney outcomes. In individual-level meta-analyses of six trials of different BP control strategies in patients with CKD, intensive BP control appeared to reduce the risk of kidney replacement therapy in those with CKD stage 4–5, but not in patients with CKD stage 3.

Summary

Most guidelines continue to recommend a systolic BP target of 120–130mmHg for patients with CKD given the cardiovascular benefits observed in trials of intensive BP control, though there are some signals of potential risks to the kidney with this BP treatment strategy.

### Blood pressure lowering and major cardiovascular events in people with and without chronic kidney disease: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114aSREj]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

These overviews provide clear evidence that a broad range of different blood pressure lowering regimens provide protection against cardiovascular complications in patients with and without chronic kidney disease. Specifically, blood pressure lowering per se, not the effects of a particular drug class (such as renin-angiotensin system blockade), seems to be significantly associated with lower cardiovascular risk in early stage chronic kidney disease, possibly suggesting the importance of blood pressure lowering as a driver of cardiovascular risk reduction. These findings should help to guide decision making for many physicians and their patients, given the absence of clear evidence to date supporting recommendations (for particular drug classes) to reduce the cardiovascular risk among people with early stage chronic kidney disease. As people with chronic kidney disease are at greatly increased cardiovascular risk, the benefits of blood pressure lowering in this population are large. The broader use of blood pressure lowering drugs, along with other proved treatments such as lipid lowering, will both improve outcomes for affected individuals and help to reduce the escalating global burden of cardiovascular disease.

### Hypertension as cardiovascular risk factor in chronic kidney disease [^112SgaPL]. Circulation Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is the leading modifiable cause of premature death and hence one of the global targets of World Health Organization for prevention. Hypertension also affects the great majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Both hypertension and CKD are intrinsically related, as hypertension is a strong determinant of worse renal and cardiovascular outcomes and renal function decline aggravates hypertension. This bidirectional relationship is well documented by the high prevalence of hypertension across CKD stages and the dual benefits of effective antihypertensive treatments on renal and cardiovascular risk reduction. Achieving an optimal blood pressure (BP) target is mandatory and requires several pharmacological and lifestyle measures. However, it also requires a correct diagnosis based on reliable BP measurements (eg, 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring, home BP), especially for populations like patients with CKD where reduced or reverse dipping patterns or masked and resistant hypertension are frequent and associated with a poor cardiovascular and renal prognosis. Even after achieving BP targets, which remain debated in CKD, the residual cardiovascular risk remains high. Current antihypertensive options have been enriched with novel agents that enable to lower the existing renal and cardiovascular risks, such as SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2) inhibitors and novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Although their beneficial effects may be driven mostly from actions beyond BP control, recent evidence underline potential improvements on abnormal 24-hour BP phenotypes such as nondipping. Other promising novelties are still to come for the management of hypertension in CKD. In the present review, we shall discuss the existing evidence of hypertension as a cardiovascular risk factor in CKD, the importance of identifying hypertension phenotypes among patients with CKD, and the traditional and novel aspects of the management of hypertensives with CKD.

KDOQI diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — hypertension definitions and risk: Because the studies cited were published before JNC 7, hypertension generally was defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg, whereas the JNC 7 defines hypertension in those with diabetes or CKD as blood pressure greater than 130/80 mm Hg. A large number of epidemiological studies and controlled trials have defined hypertension as a risk factor for progression of DKD, and antihypertensive treatment reduces this risk.

### Management of hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus [^114qpKHb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients at high risk for developing cardiovascular disease aims at controlling blood pressure, optimizing blood glucose levels, and providing renoprotection. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes mellitus are prevalent causes of cardiovascular disease owing to associations with major cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, and they are substantial health burdens. Even mild-to-moderate CKD and prehypertension increase cardiovascular risk. First-line agents for reducing cardiovascular risk are inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). In clinical trials, treatment of high-risk patients with ACE inhibitors and ARBs delays or prevents the onset of diabetes and prevents progression of renal disease and cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular mortality. Current evidence indicates that the clinical efficacy of these end points includes effects that may be beyond blood pressure reduction.

### Preventing chronic kidney disease in special populations [^1161ntKn]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular events, and premature death. However, certain groups are known to be at higher risk for hypertensive end-organ damage, including diabetic patients, older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, and specific ethnic populations. Coexistent diabetes and hypertension dramatically increase the risk of developing CKD and other target-organ complications. The prevalence of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, CKD, hypertensive renal disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is far greater in African Americans compared with white Americans. Identification of patients at increased risk for CKD offers the potential to prevent or delay ESRD and the cardiovascular events associated with CKD. Data from completed and ongoing controlled clinical hypertension trials will assist clinicians in creating optimal antihypertensive regimens for patients at increased risk for CKD.

### Hypertension in chronic kidney disease (CKD): diagnosis, classification, and therapeutic targets [^115S86Kq]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) in the office is often recorded without standardization of the technique of measurement. When office BP measurement is performed with a research-grade methodology, it can inform better therapeutic decisions. The reference-standard method of ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) together with the assessment of BP in the office enables the identification of white-coat and masked hypertension, facilitating the stratification of cardiorenal risk. Compared with general population, the prevalence of resistant hypertension is 2- to 3-fold higher among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The use of ABPM is mandatory in order to exclude the white-coat effect, a common cause of pseudoresistance, and confirm the diagnosis of true-resistant hypertension. After the premature termination of Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial due to an impressive cardioprotective benefit of intensive BP-lowering, the 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline reappraised the definition of hypertension and recommended a tighter BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg for the majority of adults with a high cardiovascular risk profile, inclusive of patients with CKD. However, the benefit/risk ratio of intensive BP-lowering in particular subsets of patients with CKD (i.e., those with diabetes or more advanced CKD) continues to be debated. We explore the controversial issue of BP targets in CKD, providing a critical evaluation of the available clinical-trial evidence and guideline recommendations. We argue that the systolic BP target in CKD, if BP is measured correctly, should be < 120 mm Hg.

### Effects of exercise on kidney function among non-diabetic patients with hypertension and renal disease: randomized controlled trial [^1143s45K]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease is an important public health threat. Studies in several countries have estimated that around 12% of the population presents kidney dysfunction (glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min × 1.73 m²) and that this rate becomes greater with increasing age. Patients with chronic kidney disease present high morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (DCV), with low quality of life and survival.

These patients present diminished kidney function most frequently as a result of diabetes mellitus or systemic arterial hypertension. Systemic arterial hypertension is both a cause and a complication of chronic kidney disease and hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases among these patients. Kidney disease patients who are not undergoing dialysis have been studied less often than those receiving dialysis. Strategies are required for keeping these patients' kidneys functioning and attenuating the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Physical inactivity may be an important determinant of morbidity and mortality among these patients.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with CKD, lifestyle modifications, KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend to consider advising patients with HTN and CKD to practice moderate-intensity physical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 minutes/week or to a level compatible with their cardiovascular and physical tolerance.

### Association between more intensive vs less intensive blood pressure lowering and risk of mortality in chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 5: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115WzKdb]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Trials in patients with hypertension have demonstrated that intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality but may increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) incidence and progression. Whether intensive BP lowering is associated with a mortality benefit in patients with prevalent CKD remains unknown.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to investigate if more intensive compared with less intensive BP control is associated with reduced mortality risk in persons with CKD stages 3 to 5.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, Science Citation Index, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov electronic databases.

Study Selection

All RCTs were included that compared 2 defined BP targets (either active BP treatment vs placebo or no treatment, or intensive vs less intensive BP control) and enrolled adults (≥ 18 years) with CKD stages 3 to 5 (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) exclusively or that included a CKD subgroup between January 1, 1950, and June 1, 2016.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two of us independently evaluated study quality and extracted characteristics and mortality events among persons with CKD within the intervention phase for each trial. When outcomes within the CKD group had not previously been published, trial investigators were contacted to request data within the CKD subset of their original trials.

Main Outcome and Measure

All-cause mortality during the active treatment phase of each trial.

Results

This study identified 30 RCTs that potentially met the inclusion criteria. The CKD subset mortality data were extracted in 18 trials, among which there were 1293 deaths in 15 924 participants with CKD. The mean (SD) baseline systolic BP (SBP) was 148 (16) mm Hg in both the more intensive and less intensive arms. The mean SBP dropped by 16 mm Hg to 132 mm Hg in the more intensive arm and by 8 mm Hg to 140 mm Hg in the less intensive arm. More intensive vs less intensive BP control resulted in 14.0% lower risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76–0.97; p = 0.01), a finding that was without significant heterogeneity and appeared consistent across multiple subgroups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Randomization to more intensive BP control is associated with lower mortality risk among trial participants with hypertension and CKD. Further studies are required to define absolute BP targets for maximal benefit and minimal harm.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, affecting 13.1% of the United States (US) population; 26.3 million Americans are estimated to have stages 1–4 CKD. Hypertension is closely associated with CKD; 70% of patients with an elevated serum creatinine (defined as ≥ 1.6 mg/dL for men and ≥ 1.4 mg/dL for women) have hypertension, and 26.8% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were deemed to have kidney failure as a result of hypertension by treating nephrologists. Although high blood pressure is a major promoter of the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease, only a small percentage of patients with hypertension will develop CKD. Therefore being able to identify those hypertensive individuals at high risk for decline in kidney function early in the course of their disease process may help to guide their treatment.

Existing studies on the rate of decline in kidney function have been based on subjects in whom CKD (defined as GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) has already developed; little information is available on rates of decline in kidney function prior to the onset of CKD, specifically in known hypertensive cohorts. In addition, many inferences have been drawn from post-hoc analyses of subjects enrolled in clinical trials, who may not be representative of patients encountered in routine clinical care.

Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to (i) identify predictors of incident CKD and (ii) to estimate rate of decline in kidney function in a racially and ethnically diverse hypertensive patient population with normal or near normal kidney function at baseline.

### Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in CKD [^1154mcBH]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) 2012 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure (BP) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) provides the structural and evidence base for the Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) commentary on this guideline's relevancy and application to the Canadian health care system. While in general agreement, we provide commentary on 13 of the 21 KDIGO guideline statements. Specifically, we agreed that nonpharmacological interventions should play a significant role in the management of hypertension in patients with CKD. We also agreed that the approach to the management of hypertension in elderly patients with CKD should be individualized and take into account comorbid conditions to avoid adverse outcomes from excessive BP lowering. In contrast to KDIGO, the CSN Work Group believes there is insufficient evidence to target a lower BP for nondiabetic CKD patients based on the presence and severity of albuminuria. The CSN Work Group concurs with the Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP) recommendation of a target BP for all non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients without diabetes of ≤ 140 mm Hg systolic and ≤ 90 mm Hg diastolic. Similarly, it is our position that in diabetic patients with CKD and normal urinary albumin excretion, raising the threshold for treatment from < 130 mmHg systolic BP to < 140 mm Hg systolic BP could increase stroke risk and the risk of worsening kidney disease. The CSN Work Group concurs with the CHEP and the Canadian Diabetic Association recommendation for diabetic patients with CKD with or without albuminuria to continue to be treated to a BP target similar to that of the overall diabetes population, aiming for BP levels < 130/80 mm Hg. Consistent with this, the CSN Work Group endorses a BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg for diabetic patients with a kidney transplant. Finally, in the absence of evidence for a lower BP target, the CSN Work Group concurs with the CHEP recommendation to target BP < 140/90 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients with a kidney transplant.

### Management of blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease not receiving dialysis: synopsis of the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline [^117CkTEd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Description

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure (BP) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not receiving dialysis is an update of the KDIGO 2012 guideline on the same topic and reflects new evidence on the risks and benefits of BP-lowering therapy among patients with CKD. It is intended to support shared decision making by health care professionals working with patients with CKD worldwide. This article is a synopsis of the full guideline.

Methods

The KDIGO leadership commissioned 2 co-chairs to convene an international Work Group of researchers and clinicians. After a Controversies Conference in September 2017, the Work Group defined the scope of the evidence review, which was undertaken by an evidence review team between October 2017 and April 2020. Evidence reviews were done according to the Cochrane Handbook. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used to guide the development of the recommendations and rate the strength and quality of the evidence. Practice points were included to provide guidance when evidence was insufficient to make a graded recommendation. The guideline was revised after public consultation between January and March 2020.

Recommendations

The updated guideline comprises 11 recommendations and 20 practice points. This synopsis summarizes key recommendations pertinent to the diagnosis and management of high BP in adults with CKD, excluding those receiving kidney replacement therapy. In particular, the synopsis focuses on recommendations for standardized BP measurement and a target systolic BP of less than 120 mm Hg, because these recommendations differ from some other guidelines.

### Hypertension in chronic kidney disease after the systolic blood pressure intervention trial: targets, treatment and current uncertainties [^112cd3yj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the number one cardiovascular (CV) risk factor, and its treatment represents one of the most important interventions in patients at high risk for CV events. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high CV risk, yet as a group they have been excluded from most major blood pressure (BP)-lowering trials examining CV and mortality end points. The paucity of randomized clinical trial evidence for BP lowering in CKD patients is compounded by the fact that the association between BP levels and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD suggests the presence of a J-curve, which makes extrapolations from general population studies especially difficult. The recent completion of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), which enrolled a large number of patients with mild to moderate CKD, has raised hope for much-needed clarity about the ideal systolic BP target in this patient population. This review discusses the epidemiology of hypertension in CKD and the pathophysiologic underpinnings of the distinct associations between BP levels and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD, and it examines the applicability of the SPRINT results to the general CKD population.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension, lifestyle modifications, KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend to consider advising patients with CKD and hypertension to practice moderate-intensity physical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 minutes/week or to a level compatible with their cardiovascular and physical tolerance.

### Chronic kidney disease as a situation of high added risk in hypertensive patients [^114ysDhe]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for the management of hypertension have recognized the relevance of renal function on cardiovascular prognosis of hypertensive patients. In fact, growing evidences have confirmed that as soon as renal function exhibits minor derangements, cardiovascular risk starts a continuous rise until the development of end-stage renal disease. Both estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin excretion are associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and death among hypertensive patients and in general population. Consequently, hypertensive patients presenting with chronic kidney disease are considered by guidelines as high-risk patients, and strict blood pressure control should be considered as a part of an integrative therapeutic approach, including correction of anemia, treatment of dyslipidemia, cessation of tobacco use, and antiplatelet therapy. This paper briefly reviews the most recent evidences about pharmacologic therapies in high-risk patients, focusing on benefits related to improvement of cardiovascular risk factors in hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Protecting renal function in the hypertensive patient: clinical guidelines [^114RfV1r]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Both the incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasing in the United States and worldwide. Patients with both diabetes and hypertension have a dramatically increased risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly if both conditions are not effectively controlled. Failure to achieve the goals for blood glucose, blood pressure (BP), and lipids is associated with high morbidity from cardiovascular and renal events as well as the high costs of treating these morbid events. There is increasing evidence that cardiovascular events, renal failure, and premature death can be prevented or delayed by earlier identification and treatment of CKD, as well as by taking measures to prevent its onset. A large subgroup of hypertensive patients may be at increased risk for developing CKD and should be targeted for appropriate monitoring and treatment. Not all antihypertensive regimens are equally effective at preserving renal function. Clinical trials indicate that the primary clinical goal in the treatment of patients with CKD is to lower BP to the recommended goal as well as to reduce albuminuria and proteinuria to the lowest levels possible. This is achieved optimally by using agents that block the renin-angiotensin system in concert with other agents that reduce proteinuria and BP.

### Associations of kidney disease measures with mortality and end-stage renal disease in individuals with and without hypertension: a meta-analysis [^113aeE6C]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the most prevalent comorbidity in individuals with chronic kidney disease. However, whether the association of the kidney disease measures, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria, with mortality or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) differs by hypertensive status is unknown.

Methods

We did a meta-analysis of studies selected according to Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium criteria. Data transfer and analyses were done between March, 2011, and June, 2012. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) of mortality and ESRD associated with eGFR and albuminuria in individuals with and without hypertension.

Findings

We analysed data for 45 cohorts (25 general population, seven high-risk, and 13 chronic kidney disease) with 1,127,656 participants, 364,344 of whom had hypertension. Low eGFR and high albuminuria were associated with mortality irrespective of hypertensive status in the general population and high-risk cohorts. All-cause mortality risk was 1.1–1.2 times higher in individuals with hypertension than in those without hypertension at preserved eGFR. A steeper relative risk gradient in individuals without hypertension than in those with hypertension at eGFR range 45–75 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) led to much the same mortality risk at lower eGFR. With a reference eGFR of 95 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) in each group to explicitly assess interaction, adjusted HR for all-cause mortality at eGFR 45 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) was 1.77 (95% CI 1.57–1.99) in individuals without hypertension versus 1.24 (1.11–1.39) in those with hypertension (p for overall interaction = 0.0003). Similarly, for albumin-creatinine ratio of 300 mg/g (vs 5 mg/g), HR was 2.30 (1.98–2.68) in individuals without hypertension versus 2.08 (1.84–2.35) in those with hypertension (p for overall interaction = 0.019). We recorded much the same results for cardiovascular mortality. The associations of eGFR and albuminuria with ESRD, however, did not differ by hypertensive status. Results for chronic kidney disease cohorts were similar to those for general and high-risk population cohorts.

Interpretation

Chronic kidney disease should be regarded as at least an equally relevant risk factor for mortality and ESRD in individuals without hypertension as it is in those with hypertension.

### The role of combination antihypertensive therapy in the prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease [^113y2qtJ]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

The failure to achieve blood pressure (BP) control in the general population makes a substantial contribution to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and subsequent renal failure. Each year, in the United States, more than 94,000 people develop end-stage renal disease; about 65% of these cases are directly attributable to hypertension and diabetes. Like hypertension, CKD does not produce symptoms for many years, and therefore its detection, prevention, and treatment are largely dependent on the vigilance of physicians and other health care providers. Current therapeutic advances make it possible to slow the progression of CKD and to improve clinical outcomes for these patients. Large, randomized, clinical hypertension trials have shown that tighter BP control, compared with less tight BP control, can reduce progression of renal disease by 30% to 50% and cardiovascular disease by 40% to 70%. Achieving BP levels of < 130/80 mm Hg, as currently recommended for patients with diabetes or CKD, will often require three or more antihypertensive medications. Furthermore, reduction of BP should be accompanied by reductions in albuminuria and proteinuria to maximize potential benefits to the kidney. Evidence from numerous randomized controlled trials mandate that agents that block the renin-angiotensin system should always be included in the antihypertensive regimens of patients with CKD, particularly with the excellent safety data with serum creatinine levels < 3 to 4 mg/dL. Fixed-dose combination agents are useful in bringing high-risk hypertensive patients to appropriate BP goals, primarily by simplifying the complex medical regimens in these patients.

### Update on the drug treatment of hypertension in patients with cardiovascular disease [^115ZHdAF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The management of the high-risk patient with hypertension has become more challenging in recent years. Drug therapy should be initiated earlier and at lower blood pressure levels in patients with coexisting cardiovascular or kidney diseases. The blood pressure goals of drug therapy are substantially lower when patients have concomitant heart or kidney disease or diabetes mellitus. Numerous clinical trials in tens of thousands of hypertensive patients with increased cardiovascular risk have demonstrated that the calcium antagonists are as effective and safe as diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, and renin-angiotensin blocking agents to prevent heart attack and stroke but not heart failure. Several recent studies also demonstrate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers are effective in preventing stroke, progressive renal insufficiency, and heart failure in higher risk patients with hypertension. To achieve the aggressive blood pressure goals in patients with cardiovascular disease, thoughtful combinations of additive or synergistic agents improve efficacy and tolerability and have become an integral part of the modern management of hypertensive patients with coexisting cardiovascular disease.

### Guideline-driven management of hypertension: an evidence-based update [^114ugJqL]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Several important findings bearing on the prevention, detection, and management of hypertension have been reported since publication of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline. This review summarizes and places in context the results of relevant observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and meta-analyses published between January 2018 and March 2021. Topics covered include blood pressure measurement, patient evaluation for secondary hypertension, cardiovascular disease risk assessment and blood pressure threshold for drug therapy, lifestyle and pharmacological management, treatment target blood pressure goal, management of hypertension in older adults, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, resistant hypertension, and optimization of care using patient, provider, and health system approaches. Presenting new information in each of these areas has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, treatment, and control which remain essential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the future.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic renal disease [^116bJBsk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, development of end-stage renal disease, and all-cause mortality. It affects around 10% of the population worldwide. The prevalence of hypertension in people with CKD ranges from 22% in stage 1 to 80% in stage 4. Elevated arterial blood pressure is one of the major independent risk factors for adverse cardiovascular events. Thereby, reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial but could also increase the risk of adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and CKD remains unknown.

Objectives

Primary: to compare the effects of standard and lower-than-standard blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease on mortality and morbidity outcomes. Secondary: to assess the magnitude of reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the proportion of participants reaching blood pressure targets, and the number of drugs necessary to achieve the assigned target.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, one other database, and two trial registers up to 8 February 2023. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in people with hypertension and CKD that provided at least twelve months' follow-up. Eligible interventions compared lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (130/80 mmHg or lower) to standard targets for blood pressure (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or lower). Participants were adults with CKD and elevated blood pressure documented in a standard way on at least two occasions, or already receiving treatment for elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our critical outcomes were: total mortality, total serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and progression to end-stage renal disease. Important outcomes were: participant withdrawals due to adverse effects, and number of participants with a doubling of serum creatinine level or at least a 50% reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the end of the study. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for the critical outcomes. This review received no funding.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that contributed data for meta-analysis, involving 7348 participants overall (range 840 to 4733 people per study). The mean follow-up was 3.6 years (range 1.0 to 8.0 years). Three studies were publicly funded, two were privately funded, and one had both public and private funding. All RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies blinded participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure target. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all studies. Critical outcomes. Compared with standard blood pressure targets, lower targets likely result in little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.06; 6 studies, 7348 participants), total serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 6 studies, 7348 participants), and total cardiovascular events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.15; 5 studies, 6508 participants), all with moderate-certainty evidence. Compared with standard blood pressure targets, lower targets may result in little to no difference in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 6 studies, 7348 participants) and progression to end-stage renal disease (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11; 4 studies, 4788 participants), both with low-certainty evidence. Important outcomes. We found little to no differences in: participant withdrawals due to adverse effects; and the number of participants with a doubling of serum creatinine level, or at least a 50% reduction in GFR at the end of the study. Exploratory outcomes. Compared to the standard blood pressure target groups, participants in the lower target groups achieved lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure values after one year, and required a higher number of antihypertensive drugs at the end of the studies. A higher proportion of participants in the standard blood pressure target groups achieved the targets they were assigned than did participants in the intensive target groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared to a standard blood pressure target, lower blood pressure targets probably result in little to no difference in total mortality, total serious adverse events, and total cardiovascular events, and may result in little to no difference in total cardiovascular mortality or in the progression to end-stage renal disease in people with hypertension and CKD. However, the evidence underpinning these conclusions has several limitations. All studies were open design, blood pressure measurement was performed at a medical office, and there was scant information about adverse events. Future research should include high-quality adverse event data, report results for people with different levels of proteinuria, and consider out-of-office blood pressure monitoring. Several studies are ongoing, and may provide new evidence for this topic in the near future.

### Intensive systolic blood pressure reduction and kidney and cardiovascular outcomes: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^111dPFvc]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The global burden of hypertension, which affects 1.28 billion adults worldwide, poses a substantial public health challenge. Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and chronic kidney injury. The dysfunction caused by chronic kidney injury is irreversible. Therefore, the investigation of the association between blood pressure (BP) control and kidney function is crucial.

Intensive BP control has been demonstrated to additionally reduce major cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension compared with traditional BP targets. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) highlighted a reduction in cardiovascular outcomes on achieving a systolic BP (SBP) level below 120 mm Hg. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommended intensive BP lowering to an SBP level below 130 mm Hg and noted the need for implementation studies to demonstrate the benefits and safety of intensive BP control in resource-constrained practice settings.

However, when implementing intensive BP control, the risk of kidney injury should be taken into consideration. A substantial reduction of SBP levels may impair the kidney function. A meta-analysis study revealed that SBP lower than 120 mm Hg results in loss of kidney protection and a SBP less than 110 mm Hg increases kidney injury. A subgroup analysis of the SPRINT study showed that a SBP less than 120 mm Hg increased 2.6% of kidney outcomes compared with a SBP less than 140 mm Hg in individuals without chronic kidney disease (CKD), yet this finding was outweighed by the potential benefits for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Similarly, a secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials, including SPRINT and Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD), showed that intensive BP control also increased the risk of kidney outcomes in populations with and without type 2 diabetes. In the Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients (STEP) trial, intensive BP control in the elderly population did not increase the risk of kidney outcomes but reduced the risk of cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, the effect of intensive BP control on kidney outcomes seems to be controversial because all these previous studies were conducted in special populations. Therefore, there is an urgent need for studies involving more representative populations to provide robust evidence on whether intensive BP control increases the risk of kidney outcomes in patients without CKD.

### Development of chronic kidney disease in essential hypertension during long-term therapy [^1125qNzD]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review examines the relevance of the development of chronic kidney disease in long-term hypertensive patients on the cardiovascular prognosis.

Recent Findings

Recently published guidelines recognize the relevance of the development of chronic kidney disease in the stratification of risk for the hypertensive patient. An adequate assessment of renal function, including an estimation of the glomerular filtration rate, is mandatory in order to ensure an adequate evaluation of the global cardiovascular risk in the hypertensive patient. The presence of subtle elevations in serum creatinine concentrations is a potent predictor of a poor cardiovascular prognosis. The clustering of associated risk factors seems to justify the elevated cardiovascular risk observed in patients with essential hypertension and mild renal function derangement.

Summary

Chronic kidney disease is associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular risk attributable to the simultaneous existence of other risk factors related to the metabolic syndrome. The high prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the general and hypertensive populations forces the recognition of its relevance and the need for an integrated therapeutic approach simultaneously to protect the renal and cardiovascular systems fully.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^117GDU5C]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Current evidence in the field comes mainly from two previous trials in non-diabetic CKD that randomized patients to different levels or ranges of mean BP and examined kidney outcomes. In the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study the projected GFR decline within 3 years, and the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and death were not significantly different between groups of low and usual BP target. However, analyses by baseline proteinuria showed that those with proteinuria > 1 g/day in the low-target group had a decrease in protein excretion and a slower GFR decline over time compared with patients in the usual-target group. Similarly, in the African American Study on Kidney Disease (AASK) no difference in outcomes between BP target groups was observed in the overall population; in a post hoc analysis, again, low BP was associated with better kidney outcomes in the small subset of patients with proteinuria > 1 g/day. Subsequent analyses of MDRD and AASK combined the randomized trial periods with subsequent observational follow-up phases. In MDRD long-term analysis, low-target BP was associated with overall reduced risk for ESKD and the composite of ESKD or death, but this was again mainly driven by a beneficial effect in patients with baseline proteinuria > 1 g/day. In the AASK long-term follow-up analysis, no difference in the risk of the composite outcome of doubling of SCr, ESKD or death was noted. However, for patients with urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) > 0.22 g/g, which roughly equals proteinuria of 0.25–0.3 g/day and urine ACR > 100 mg/g in most patients, there was a beneficial effect with low BP. A subsequent analysis combining the trial and cohort periods of both these trials (adding up to 1907 patients and a median follow-up of 14.9 years), showed that low target BP was associated with significant reductions in the risks of ESKD and mortality in the total population; and this effect was mainly driven by changes in patients with urine PCR > 0.44 g/g (urine ACR roughly > 200 mg/g). Thus, sustainability of BP reduction and extent of proteinuria are major determinants of nephroprotection in patients with non-diabetic CKD.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^115b7hoZ]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Gauging the Impact of the Recommended Risk-Based Strategy

Echoing, to some extent, the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines, the AHA Statement categorically exempts individuals with BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg (stage 2 hypertension) from formal risk assessment. The same exemption is extended to the BP range of 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) for those with established cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or any individual with ongoing antihypertensive therapy. These groups are automatically designated as high risk.

With these exemptions, a formal risk assessment strategy applies to ≈23 million individuals, of whom around 2.5 million (equivalent to 1% of US adults) are projected to exceed the PREVENT risk threshold of > 7.5% for immediate pharmacological intervention (Figure 1). These rates are roughly consistent with the application of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines to European adults, where ≈1% to 4% would be recommended for treatment based on their predicted high cardiovascular risk and moderate BP elevation.

### Strategies to prevent, diagnose and treat kidney disease related to systemic arterial hypertension: a narrative review from the Mexican group of experts on arterial hypertension [^1136TpMN]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Section 1: strategies to mitigate kidney disease

Systemic arterial hypertension and kidney disease (KD) are interlinked through complex pathophysiological pathways; these relationships position the kidney as both a target and a causative factor in hypertension. Disentangling the precise pathogenic role of moderate hypertension in kidney damage is challenging, as other risk factors or associated morbidities often coexist. In the United States, systemic arterial hypertension and impaired kidney function (glomerular filtration rate, [GFR], between 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m 2) prevalence have been consistently increasing, reaching 28.9% and 51.2%, respectively. From 1999 to 2004, the occurrence of CKD with GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 rose to 8%. Once KD is evident with the onset of albuminuria, the progression of CKD accelerates; this is particularly relevant when systemic arterial hypertension is accompanied by diabetes, hyperuricemia, or another KD. Considering these challenges, it is essential to create strategies to mitigate systemic arterial hypertension in patients living with CKD.

### Effect of blood pressure control on long-term risk of end-stage renal disease and death among subgroups of patients with chronic Kidney disease [^1132BuxH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Because the duration of most clinical trials of intensive BP control have been short (mean duration, ≈3 years), 8, 9, 10, 11 trials that are stopped early may have exaggerated effect sizes, 13, 14 and lower BP targets may be difficult to achieve in all patients with CKD, there is a need for longer‐term studies of the effect of intensive BP control on CKD and mortality outcomes, which may occur over many years. In particular, there is a paucity of trial‐based evidence to support appropriate BP targets among patients with advanced CKD (stage 4 or beyond) and among young patients with CKD (eg, 18–40 years of age) because of their underrepresentation in most clinical trials. There have also been few studies that have examined whether the effect of intensive BP lowering is more pronounced among patients who have other concurrent metabolic or cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, a known risk factor for both CKD progression and death. 15, 16, 17, 18 Furthermore, current guidelines suggest that selection of BP targets be based on the estimated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, but the available risk estimators have not been validated and may not be applicable to patients < 40 years of age. 1, 19

### Individualized risk of CKD progression among US adults [^117UoKTR]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

In treating patients, as opposed to population epidemiology, an individual's absolute risk of disease progression is more relevant than their theoretical relative risk compared with a healthy population. The Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease risk score has been useful in predicting one's 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease and has guided primary prevention therapy accordingly. The 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines also recommended using the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease risk score to identify patients with stage 1 hypertension who may benefit from pharmacologic therapy. The 3-year risk could potentially be used in a similar manner, especially with recent clinical trials demonstrating that it is now possible to slow CKD progression using kidney-preserving therapies. The risk categorization can also be applied to guide nephrology referral for high-risk patients.

Our study has important implications for future research. The efficacy of treatment intensification based solely on the pretreatment CKD progression risk is unknown. Post hoc analyses of recent landmark trials of kidney-preserving therapies, can provide this information and assess efficacy in different strata of the CKD progression risk. These randomized controlled trials recruited individuals with eGFRs from 25 to 90 ml/min per 1.73 m² and UACRs from 30 to 5000 mg/g. However, we found the 3-year risk of CKD progression to be high (risk ≥ 5%) in over 1 million US adults who do not have CKD on the basis of laboratory criteria (eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and UACR < 30 mg/g) but with concurrent risk factors of kidney disease, such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart failure, or vascular disease. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of kidney-preserving therapies in these individuals. Finally, the 3-year risk was developed using data from an era before the new kidney-preserving therapies. Further studies are needed to evaluate the performance of the risk score in individuals receiving these therapies.

### Sex and gender differences in the management of chronic kidney disease and hypertension [^1113LpUr]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is both a precursor to and a sequela of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hypertension is increasingly prevalent as kidney function declines and occurs in between 60 and 90% of individuals with CKD. Optimisation of blood pressure control reduces cardiovascular risk in CKD and may slow kidney disease progression thus blood pressure control is a critical component of CKD management.

In contrast to decreasing trends observed over time for other sequelae of hypertension (such as stroke and ischaemic heart disease), CKD is a growing problem: age-standardised mortality rates in CKD remain stubbornly high; and by 2040, CKD is projected to be the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. Sex and gender have key impacts on many aspects of CKD - including prevalence and patterns of disease, treatment decisions and clinical outcomes (Fig. 1). Though often incorrectly used interchangeably, sex and gender must be understood as different concepts. Sex is a biologically-determined characteristic reflecting physical differences whilst gender is self-ascribed and reflects socio-cultural factors.

The pathophysiology of CKD appears to differ by sex. Accepting limitations relating to sampling bias and the markers used to estimate kidney function, CKD is reported to be more common in women, yet is thought to progress more slowly compared with men. Perhaps as a consequence, both kidney replacement therapy and age-standardised CKD-related mortality are markedly higher in men: the Global Burden of Disease Study (spanning over 20 years) quantified this increased CKD mortality risk at around 30%. Sex differences were broadly consistent across 50 countries, which may suggest biological sex is a greater contributor to CKD-related mortality than socio-cultural gender-related factors.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension, lifestyle modifications, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to offer lifestyle optimization along with BP-lowering medication in patients with diabetic or non-diabetic moderate-to-severe CKD and confirmed BP ≥ 130/80 mmHg to reduce CVD risk, if such treatment is well tolerated.

### Effects of intensive blood pressure lowering on cardiovascular and renal outcomes: updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113NMA8q]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Recent hypertension guidelines have reversed previous recommendations for lower blood pressure targets in high-risk patients, such as those with cardiovascular disease, renal disease, or diabetes. This change represents uncertainty about whether more intensive blood pressure-lowering strategies are associated with greater reductions in risk of major cardiovascular and renal events. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of intensive blood pressure-lowering strategies.

Methods

For this updated systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for trials published between Jan 1, 1950, and Nov 3, 2015. We included randomised controlled trials with at least 6 months' follow-up that randomly assigned participants to more intensive versus less intensive blood pressure-lowering treatment, with different blood pressure targets or different blood pressure changes from baseline. We did not use any age or language restrictions. We did a meta-analysis of blood pressure reductions on relative risk (RR) of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or cardiovascular death, separately and combined), and non-vascular and all-cause mortality, end-stage kidney disease, and adverse events, as well as albuminuria and progression of retinopathy in trials done in patients with diabetes.

Findings

We identified 19 trials including 44,989 participants, in whom 2496 major cardiovascular events were recorded during a mean 3.8 years of follow-up (range 1.0–8.4 years). Our meta-analysis showed that after randomisation, patients in the more intensive blood pressure-lowering treatment group had mean blood pressure levels of 133/76 mm Hg, compared with 140/81 mm Hg in the less intensive treatment group. Intensive blood pressure-lowering treatment achieved RR reductions for major cardiovascular events (14% [95% CI 4–22]), myocardial infarction (13% [0–24]), stroke (22% [10–32]), albuminuria (10% [3–16]), and retinopathy progression (19% [0–34]). However, more intensive treatment had no clear effects on heart failure (15% [95% CI -11 to 34]), cardiovascular death (9% [-11 to 26]), total mortality (9% [-3 to 19]), or end-stage kidney disease (10% [-6 to 23]). The reduction in major cardiovascular events was consistent across patient groups, and additional blood pressure lowering had a clear benefit even in patients with systolic blood pressure lower than 140 mm Hg. The absolute benefits were greatest in trials in which all enrolled patients had vascular disease, renal disease, or diabetes. Serious adverse events associated with blood pressure lowering were only reported by six trials and had an event rate of 1.2% per year in intensive blood pressure-lowering group participants, compared with 0.9% in the less intensive treatment group (RR 1.35 [95% CI 0.93–1.97]). Severe hypotension was more frequent in the more intensive treatment regimen (RR 2.68 [1.21–5.89], p = 0.015), but the absolute excess was small (0.3% vs 0.1% per person-year for the duration of follow-up).

Interpretation

Intensive blood pressure lowering provided greater vascular protection than standard regimens. In high-risk patients, there are additional benefits from more intensive blood pressure lowering, including for those with systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg. The net absolute benefits of intensive blood pressure lowering in high-risk individuals are large.

### Cardiovascular risk factors in patients with chronic kidney disease [^116pvQLL]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease have a higher burden of cardiovascular disease, which increases in a dose-dependent fashion with worsening kidney function. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including advanced age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia, have an important role in the progression of cardiovascular disease in patients who have a reduced glomerular filtration rate, especially in those with mild-to-moderate kidney disease. In patients with severe kidney disease, nontraditional or 'novel' risk factors, including inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular calcification, a prothrombotic milieu, and anemia, seem to confer additional risk. In this Review, we highlight factors that increase cardiovascular risk in patients with a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate. In addition, we discuss therapeutic strategies for reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with kidney disease, whose unique atherosclerotic phenotype might require an approach that differs from traditional models developed in populations with normal kidney function. Therapeutic paradigms for patients with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular risk factors must be evaluated in randomized trials, from which such patients have often been excluded.

### Elevated blood pressure and risk of end-stage renal disease in subjects without baseline kidney disease… [^113JTnvF]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Even relatively modest elevation in blood pressure is an independent risk factor for ESRD. The observed relationship does not appear to be due to confounding by clinically evident baseline kidney disease. Many cases of end-stage renal disease are ascribed to hypertension. 1–5 However, because kidney disease itself can raise blood pressure, the importance of hypertension as a risk factor for ESRD continues to be questioned. 6–15 In emphasizing the possibility that primary renal disease may explain both elevated blood pressure and progression to ESRD, some have pointed out that there are "no reported cases of benign essential hypertensive patients with normal serum creatinine levels and no proteinuria who subsequently went on to develop renal failure. "11, 16.

In contrast to the much stronger evidence that malignant hypertension causes kidney damage, there are surprisingly few rigorous studies to support the widely and strongly held belief that nonmalignant hypertension is an important cause of ESRD. 16 Establishing the detrimental effect of lesser degrees of blood pressure elevation on the kidneys is difficult chiefly because kidney disease itself can elevate blood pressure. Some investigators12, 16 argue that ESRD seen in patients with hypertension is due to underlying primary renal disease such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Previous cohort studies18–20, 28 of the relationship between blood pressure and ESRD did not uniformly screen out kidney disease at baseline so were unable to address this potential critical confounder. Hence, proof that elevated blood pressure is a causal risk factor of ESRD by observing the effect of interrupting this risk factor cannot be easily accomplished using a randomized trial approach.

Intriguingly, in randomized trials, antihypertensive therapy did not appear to reduce the incidence of less severe cases of renal dysfunction. 14, 15 Second, because of the large differences between the absolute risk of ESRD and absolute risk of cardiovascular disease, in a competing mortality paradigm, modest absolute reductions in cardiovascular mortality through implementation of available cardiovascular therapies may contribute to significant relative increases in ESRD incidence because patients survive longer and therefore develop kidney failure. This study provides the strongest epidemiologic evidence to date that nonmalignant hypertension is indeed an independent risk factor for ESRD. Risk is increased even with relatively modest elevations in blood pressure. Notably, the observed relationship does not appear to be due to confounding by clinically evident baseline kidney disease.

Improved control of blood pressure and better understanding of other contributors to the worsening epidemic of ESRD are needed to reduce the worldwide burden of kidney disease.

### SPRINT – A kidney-centric narrative review: recent advances in hypertension [^111bpcqd]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a potent cardiovascular risk factor with deleterious end-organ effects and is especially prevalent among patients with chronic kidney disease. The SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) enrolled patients at an elevated cardiac risk including patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease and found that an intensive systolic blood pressure goal of < 120 mm Hg significantly reduced the rates of adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality and nonsignificantly reduced the rates of probable dementia; these results were consistent whether one had chronic kidney disease or not. However, results of intensive blood pressure therapy on chronic kidney disease progression were inconclusive, and there was an increased risk of incident chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury, but the declines in kidney function appear to be hemodynamically driven and reversible. Overall, an intensive blood pressure target is effective in reducing cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality and may reduce the risk of probable dementia in patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease. More studies are needed to determine its long-term effects on kidney function.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^111uzNKG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

KDOQI US commentary — scope relative to the 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension guideline is outlined as follows: In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released new hypertension guidelines based on a systematic review; many recommendations are relevant to nephrology, but dialysis blood pressure (BP) targets and management are not discussed. This Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) commentary focuses on recommendations pertinent to individuals at risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or with non–dialysis-dependent CKD and includes a brief discussion of a consensus statement for adults receiving maintenance dialysis from the European Renal Association–European Dialysis and Transplant Association and the European Society of Hypertension working groups. Overall, the commentary supports the vast majority of ACC/AHA recommendations and highlights areas in which best diagnostic and treatment options remain controversial.

Risk scores

A significant innovation of the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline refers to the introduction of risk scores for personalization of care. While the traditional KDIGO staging heat map illustrates risks at a population level, the true individual risk of a given patient is determined not only by his/her eGFR or albuminuria, but also the underlying aetiology of CKD, demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions (especially cardiovascular disease) and other factors, including lifestyle, socioeconomic status, nutritional status and intercurrent events. Individual risk prediction in nephrology using accurate and externally validated risk equations have the potential to help inform key clinical decisions and improve the patient–healthcare provider dialogue.

We reflect that the panorama of risk scores in nephrology is changing rapidly. The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline mentions four externally validated risk scores for kidney failure, but since the publication of the guidelines new ones have emerged (Table 3). Academic discussions may revolve around small improvements in prediction of one score versus another. From a clinical point of view all of them tend to offer excellent precision, and differences in performance must be evaluated within the context of the alternative, which frequently is not to use any. After all, features like old age, hypertension, low eGFR and albuminuria, which are common to all risk scores, largely capture the patient's future kidney risks. Amongst available validated equations, the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) has so far had the largest penetration in routine care: many North American health systems and the National Health Service in the UK have integrated KFRE reporting in electronic medical records. However, we are not aware of these tools been used much in the routine care practice of other European countries yet, and we hope that this guideline statement contributes to a paradigm change.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension — prevalence, targets, and treatment: The prevalence of hypertension is 67% to 92% among people with CKD, and despite this risk a majority of people with CKD have uncontrolled BP. As demonstrated in SPRINT, intensive BP treatment (mean achieved SBP 121 mm Hg) versus standard treatment (mean achieved SBP 136 mm Hg) reduced the risk of CVD, including among those with CKD. The recommendation in this guideline is for a treatment goal SBP < 130 mm Hg and balances the benefits of intensive BP lowering with risks of adverse events. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is recommended for initial treatment of hypertension in CKD due to long-term kidney and CVD benefits in people with moderate or severe albuminuria (≥ 30 mg/g) and may be considered for those with lower level albuminuria (< 30 mg/g) based on expert opinion. These recommendations refer to people with nondialysis-requiring CKD given limited data in patients receiving chronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, and ACEi or ARB is also appropriate for less-severe CKD (stage 1 or 2) when moderate or severe albuminuria is present.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^111xfgjo]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

KDOQI commentary — blood pressure targets in chronic kidney disease (CKD) states that the KDOQI work group is generally supportive of the SBP thresholds and that the current evidence supports an SBP goal of < 130 mm Hg in CKD stages 1 to 3, particularly in those with elevated levels of urine albumin excretion; based on a lack of data evaluating DBP targets, the work group deliberately focused on SBP targets; there are no large definitive RCTs on SBP goals in dialysis-dependent or non–dialysis-dependent stage 5 CKD, and the ACC/AHA guideline thresholds do not apply to these patients; and both diabetes mellitus (DM) and CKD are considered high risk regardless of the 10-year calculated ASCVD risk. While existing data generally favor this recommendation, not all meta-analyses support treatment of patients with SBP < 140 mm Hg to the ACC/AHA-recommended threshold SBP < 130 mm Hg in the absence of prior CVD.

### Prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: synopsis of the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association hypertension guideline [^116VRena]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2017, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) released a clinical practice guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) in adults. This article summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2014, the ACC and the AHA appointed a multidisciplinary committee to update previous reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. The committee reviewed literature and commissioned systematic reviews and meta-analyses on out-of-office BP monitoring, the optimal target for BP lowering, the comparative benefits and harms of different classes of antihypertensive agents, and the comparative benefits and harms of initiating therapy with a single antihypertensive agent or a combination of 2 agents.

Recommendations

This article summarizes key recommendations in the following areas: BP classification, BP measurement, screening for secondary hypertension, nonpharmacologic therapy, BP thresholds and cardiac risk estimation to guide drug treatment, treatment goals (general and for patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and advanced age), choice of initial drug therapy, resistant hypertension, and strategies to improve hypertension control.

### Blood pressure measurement: a KDOQI perspective [^113ghkYQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have elevated blood pressure (BP). In patients with CKD, hypertension is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, progression of CKD, and all-cause mortality. New guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommend new thresholds and targets for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in patients with and without CKD. A new aspect of the guidelines is the recommendation for measurement of out-of-office BP to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension and guide therapy. In this KDOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) perspective, we review the recommendations for accurate BP measurement in the office, at home, and with ambulatory BP monitoring. Regardless of location, validated devices and appropriate cuff sizes should be used. In the clinic and at home, proper patient preparation and positioning are critical. Patients should receive information about the importance of BP measurement techniques and be encouraged to advocate for adherence to guideline recommendations. Implementing appropriate BP measurement in routine practice is feasible and should be incorporated in system-wide efforts to improve the care of patients with hypertension. Hypertension is the number 1 chronic disease risk factor in the world; BP measurements in the office, at home, and with ambulatory BP monitoring should adhere to recommendations from the AHA.

Older adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — initiation and caution for blood pressure (BP) lowering: Adults with a standing SBP < 110 mm Hg at screening were excluded from SPRINT; accordingly, caution is warranted when determining BP targets and treatment strategies for these individuals, with careful consideration of undue risks of hypotension and syncope. For therapy initiation, the ACC/AHA guideline suggests using a stepped-care approach instead of starting with 2-drug therapy when initiating BP-lowering therapy in an elderly patient with SBP ≥ 150 mm Hg, and elderly patients also need to be monitored closely for adverse effects from BP lowering, especially AKI, the most common adverse effect with intensive SBP lowering.

### Strategies to prevent, diagnose and treat kidney disease related to systemic arterial hypertension: a narrative review from the Mexican group of experts on arterial hypertension [^11656qTT]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 1.1: can kidney damage and the development of CKD be prevented in patients with primary systemic arterial hypertension?

Preventing KD caused primarily by systemic arterial hypertension involves preventing its onset. The main etiological factors of systemic arterial hypertension include inherited hypertension phenotypes, epigenetic inheritance, and acquired or environmental factors. Although genetic factors cannot currently be altered, it may be possible to modify epigenetic and environmental factors related to systemic arterial hypertension onset. Overall, lifestyle and dietary changes, along with the effects of specific drugs, contribute to lowering blood pressure levels and promote nephroprotection, which may hinder or delay systemic arterial hypertension onset in some individuals. A second measure consists in providing adequate control of blood pressure levels in patients with systemic arterial hypertension to reduce macro- and micro-vascular complications associated with systemic arterial hypertension. In this regard, choosing and monitoring antihypertensive medications is crucial to reducing systemic arterial hypertension-associated complications. In the context of Mexico and Latin America, the following prevention measures are endorsed for both the general population and susceptible individuals:
National information campaigns and increased physician awareness: Early detection of systemic arterial hypertension is essential for preventing systemic arterial hypertension-related kidney damage. National campaigns should raise awareness regarding abdominal obesity, which has been demonstrated to be a main contributor to the development of cardiometabolic diseases, including systemic arterial hypertension. Additionally, all healthcare personnel should prioritize systemic arterial hypertension awareness and detection for the general population, from medical schools to practicing doctors, including internists, endocrinologists, neurologists, cardiologists, and nephrologists.
Behavioral lifestyle modifications for patients living with systemic arterial hypertension: Three interventions have been proven to reduce the risk of systemic arterial hypertension-related outcomes: the DASH diet, reducing salt intake to < 5 g/day (2 g of sodium), and weight loss. These three interventions lower blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals, preventing kidney damage onset and progression. Additionally, it is important to warn against the potential harm of high-protein diets and supplements, as intake of > 0.8 g of protein/kg of ideal weight, along with obesity and excess salt consumption, can cause hyperfiltration and glomerular hypertension.
Caution regarding nephrotoxic agents: Physicians should aim to educate the general population and susceptible individuals regarding the potential nephrotoxic risks of medications, which can lead to hyperfiltration, tubular and cortical toxicity, interstitial nephritis, crystalline nephropathy, and papillary necrosis. These include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics (including neomycin, kanamycin, paromomycin, bacitracin, polymyxin B, colistin, and amphotericin B), anticancer drugs, and more. Awareness about the nephrotoxic risks of off-label herbal substances such as licorice, aloe, and ephedra should also be raised.
Continuous medical follow-up using accessible biochemical biomarkers: Follow-up of patients living with systemic arterial hypertension should include evaluations of serum creatinine or cystatin C (where available) at the point of first evaluation and clinical care and with subsequent follow-up visits. Furthermore, all patients should be assessed for estimated GFR (eGFR) using the CKD-EPI 2021 equation and albuminuria (using nephelometry or turbidimetry techniques), as well as casual and morning urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio assessments (ACR index). It is important to note that an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and an ACR index > 30 mg/g are indicative of CKD-related damage in systemic arterial hypertension.
Consider the nephroprotective role of antihypertensive drugs: Systemic arterial hypertension-related kidney damage may be caused by several mechanisms, including vascular injury, hyperfiltration, and glomerular hypertension, amongst others. Because of its effects in improving endothelial dysfunction and reducing vascular injury, all antihypertensive drugs offer some level of nephroprotection. However, not all antihypertensive agents have positive and significant effects in ameliorating hyperfiltration and glomerular hypertension. Hyperfiltration depends on afferent arteriolar vasodilation and efferent vasoconstriction, which can result from impairments in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) often observed in diabetes, obesity, excess sodium, and protein intake. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARBs) use leads to post-capillary, efferent arteriolar vasodilation, increasing glomerular flow without increasing glomerular pressure or filtration.

### Hypertension in CKD: core curriculum 2019 [^1114dFYq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are closely interlinked pathophysiologic states, such that sustained hypertension can lead to worsening kidney function and progressive decline in kidney function can conversely lead to worsening blood pressure (BP) control. The pathophysiology of hypertension in CKD is complex and is a sequela of multiple factors, including reduced nephron mass, increased sodium retention and extracellular volume expansion, sympathetic nervous system overactivity, activation of hormones including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and endothelial dysfunction. Currently, the treatment target for patients with CKD is a clinic systolic BP < 130mm Hg. The main approaches to the management of hypertension in CKD include dietary salt restriction, initiation of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretic therapy. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and accelerate progression to end-stage kidney disease. Although intensive BP control has not been shown in clinical trials to slow the progression of CKD, intensive BP control reduces the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in the CKD population.

### Management of hypertension in chronic kidney disease [^112drtUz]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2015). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with impaired kidney function. The kidney exerts a marked degree of control over blood pressure through various mechanisms, such as by regulating sodium balance and hormone secretion through the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. The kidney is susceptible to injury, and if already damaged can be at risk of further loss of function as a consequence of elevated blood pressure. Once elevated blood pressure is identified, a combination of sensible lifestyle measures, such as sodium restriction and weight loss, with pharmacological intervention to reduce blood pressure will usually achieve blood pressure goals. In this Review, we outline the importance of blood pressure control for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the mechanisms that affect blood pressure control, and the basis for non-drug and drug therapies. We further discuss the rationale for < 140 mmHg systolic and < 90 mmHg diastolic targets for blood pressure in patients with CKD, with consideration for tighter targets in the setting of proteinuria.

### Is the KDIGO systolic blood pressure target [^1166ERae]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Meticulous management of hypertension is important in chronic kidney disease (CKD) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, mortality, and progression of CKD. The recently published Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline on blood pressure (BP) management in CKD stresses the importance of standardized BP measurement and strict control of BP. This is a useful document that will help to improve the management of hypertension in CKD globally. However, the recommendation of systolic BP target of < 120 mmHg by KDIGO is controversial. It is based on weak evidence derived mainly from a single randomized controlled trial and its CKD subgroup analysis. Here, we review the current evidence surrounding BP target in CKD. We argue that the target recommended by KDIGO is not generalizable to the majority of people with CKD. Standardized BP measurements are challenging to implement outside specialist hypertension and research clinics, and the target of < 120 mmHg BP systolic cannot be extrapolated to routine clinic BP measurements. If applied to routine BP measurement, this target will expose the multimorbid and frail CKD patients to the risk of adverse events including falls and fractures. Furthermore, it will not be achievable in the majority of CKD patients. The target recommended by KDIGO is an outlier among contemporary major international hypertension guidelines and is likely to perplex clinicians. We believe the KDIGO-recommended target systolic BP < 120 mmHg for CKD is inappropriate in the majority of CKD patients and it may even be harmful for patients managed in routine clinical practice.

### Hypertension and cardiomyopathy associated with chronic kidney disease: epidemiology, pathogenesis and treatment considerations [^1168LakM]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure target in chronic kidney disease

Prior to publication of the SPRINT trial results, most societies and guidelines recommend lowering blood pressure to below 140/90 mmHg with some suggesting higher thresholds for the elderly and lower thresholds for those at higher high risk including patients with diabetic mellitus and patients with CKD. It is now recognised that more intensive blood pressure reduction strategies are effective and safe. The SPRINT investigators reported a 25% lower risk of major cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke and 27% lower risk of all-cause mortality when treating to a target systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mmHg compared to the standard target of 140 mmHg. This was associated with an increase in complications such as lower serum potassium, sodium, and syncopal episodes, but no increased risk of falls. Treatment of hypertension in those with CKD, which formed 28% of the SPRINT cohort, was associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality, with no adverse effects on kidney function or increased risk of dialysis. Elderly patients aged over 75 years old also sustained benefit from more intensive blood pressure control.

These data have resulted in lowering of both American and European blood pressure targets in their respective 2017 and 2018 hypertension guidelines. The recently published Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 guideline on the management of blood pressure in CKD also recommends an intensive systolic blood pressure target of 120 mmHg or less in patients with CKD (excluding those with a functioning kidney transplant) with an emphasis on standardised office blood pressure measurement and lifestyle interventions such as salt restriction and moderate-intensity exercise (Fig. 7).

### Long-term renal consequences of hypertension for normal and diseased kidneys [^116JLT42]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Substantial evidence indicates that the adverse effects of hypertension on the kidney depend on the degree to which systemic blood pressure elevations are transmitted to the renal microvasculature. Such blood pressure transmission and consequent susceptibility to hypertensive renal damage is markedly exacerbated in states characterized by preglomerular vasodilation and an impairment of the normally protective renal autoregulatory mechanisms, e.g. diabetes or chronic renal disease. Moreover, this pathophysiology gives rise to the prediction that prevention of hypertension-induced barotrauma will require blood pressure to be reduced well into the normotensive range in such patients, as is being recognized in the currently recommended blood pressure goals. Agents that block the renin-angiotensin system should be preferred as initial therapy as they may provide additional risk reductions and minimize the potassium and magnesium depletion associated with the diuretic use usually necessary to achieve the lower blood pressure targets. The current failure to achieve optimal blood pressure reductions may be contributing not only to the still escalating incidence of end-stage renal disease in diabetic patients, but also to their greatly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

### Optimal targets for blood pressure control in chronic kidney disease: the debate continues [^113pNdkq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Because advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often an exclusion criterion for large randomized trials of the management of hypertension, clinical decision making for these patients has relied on a few small, specific studies and much extrapolation. Several blood pressure treatment guidelines have recently been reissued. This review explores the applicability of the revised recommendations to CKD.

Recent Findings

Many new publications are meta-analyses, guidelines and debates about guidelines. New data from trials are scant. Three revised guidelines (KDIGO, JNC8, KHA-CARI) recommend a target of less than 140/90. Most antihypertensive drugs are equally effective - but this rule may not apply to advanced CKD. Proteinuric renal disease is seen as an exception; all three guidelines set a target of 130/80 and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (but not both) is preferred.

Summary

There is no shortage of new commentary and advice, but evidence strength and generalizability diminish as the kidneys fail and the impact of calcified vessels and salt and water overload increases. A risk-based approach to intervention may be no less valuable than targets. Clinical trials of individuals with advanced CKD will be needed to identify effective treatments and may see a resurgence of the role of spironolactone.

### The impact of hypertension on chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease is greater in men than women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Gxznr]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the leading public health problems that affect millions of women and men worldwide. Hypertension (HTN) is a crucial risk factor for the development of CKD, progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality. Accordingly, several guidelines recommend early detection and treatment of HTN to delay the disease's progression and reduce its complications in both sexes. However, the extent to which women and men with HTN are at a similar risk of developing CKD outcomes has not been extensively examined.

A recent study suggested that CKD's prevalence is higher in women than men, while another study indicated that the lifetime risk of ESRD is higher in men than women. A meta-analysis including more than 11,000 patients from 68 cohort studies of the sex-specific effect of CKD progression in patients with nondiabetic CKD suggested that women tend to progress to ESRD at a slower rate than men, irrespective of the aetiology. In contrast, a patient-level meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials that used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in 1860 patients with CKD, concluded that the rate of renal disease progression might be faster among women than in men. The differences in these studies' results may be attributed to using different definitions of outcomes, the different study designs, and variations in patient populations, especially given that no study was explicitly designed to examine sex differences.

Evidence for any clinically meaningful sex differences in relationships between HTN and CKD and ESRD could provide insight into mechanisms and optimal approaches for managing and treating raised blood pressure in both men and women. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the sex-specific association between prevalent HTN and CKD and ESRD incidence.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension, BP targets, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to lower office BP to < 130/80 mmHg in most patients with CKD (young patients, patients with an albumin/creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg/g, high cardiovascular risk patients) if tolerated.

### Representation of real-world adults with chronic kidney disease in clinical trials supporting blood pressure treatment targets [^1163Yp3y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Hypertension affects > 80% of adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and its treatment is a cornerstone of CKD management. The 2021 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for high blood pressure (BP) management lowered thresholds for diagnosis and treatment of hypertension from a BP treatment target of < 130/80 or < 140/90 mm Hg, depending on level of albuminuria, to a systolic BP < 120 mm Hg for all adults with CKD. These recommendations were largely based on findings of SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), which showed that intensive versus standard BP targets reduced mortality and cardiovascular events in nondiabetic participants with elevated cardiovascular risk. Additional support for this recommendation was based on the ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) trial demonstrating a reduction in stroke with intensive versus standard BP targets and a meta‐analysis demonstrating that intensive versus standard control of blood pressure lowered mortality in participants with CKD.

A major challenge of translating evidence to clinical practice is the assessment of generalizability, or how well the studies supporting guidelines reflect the patients to whom the findings will be applied. The underrepresentation of individuals with CKD in cardiovascular clinical trials is widely documented; however, less is known about how well trial participants with CKD represent real‐world adults with CKD. This concept, the population representativeness of trial participants, is a measure of the study sample's coverage of the target population. As a quantifiable metric, population representativeness can be used to assess the relevance of evidence in clinical practice and can inform how evidence is implemented in communities, health systems, and populations.

We aimed to evaluate the population representativeness of clinical trials supporting the 2021 KDIGO BP guidelines using data from 2 large integrated US health care systems, the Veterans Affairs (VA) and Kaiser Permanente of Southern California (KPSC). We sought to (1) determine the proportion of real‐world adults with CKD who meet the definition for elevated BP by the KDIGO guideline and would be recommended additional pharmacotherapy, (2) determine the proportion who would be eligible for enrollment in the BP trials that informed the guidelines, and (3) describe major reasons for trial ineligibility.

### Risk of chronic kidney disease in hypertensive patients with other metabolic conditions [^113yyRVi]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Using a retrospective cohort design and electronic medical records, we examined chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk over a 6-year period among hypertensive patients in relation to the presence of diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and/or high body mass index. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking status and baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR), hypertensive patients without other metabolic risk factors had a relative risk of CKD (versus normotensive patients) of 2.0 (95% CI 1.8–2.2); hypertensive patients with other metabolic conditions had adjusted relative risks ranging from 2.4 to 2.6 for those without comorbid diabetes, and from 3.3 to 5.5 for those with comorbid diabetes. Our study thus confirms prior research demonstrating elevated CKD risk in hypertensive patients, and suggests that this risk varies substantially in relation to other metabolic conditions, especially diabetes.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^116LFD1n]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Blood pressure treatment intensity — effects on kidney outcomes and adverse events — is summarized as follows: "Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews support more intensive BP treatment to reduce cardiovascular events but do not demonstrate a reduction in the rate of progression of kidney disease". Intensive treatment "may result in a modest reduction in glomerular filtration rate… and may be reversible", and "Electrolyte abnormalities are also more likely during intensive BP treatment".

### Blood pressure lowering and major cardiovascular events in people with and without chronic kidney disease: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117TMnXs]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease, most commonly defined by a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or abnormal concentrations of proteinuria, or both, is an important public health problem, affecting 10–15% of the adult general population. It is associated with an increased risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular disease. Individuals with early chronic kidney disease are more likely to experience a cardiovascular event than kidney failure, and precise and reliable evidence about the effects of strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease in this large population of patients is of great importance.

Blood pressure is an important determinant of the risk of cardiovascular disease in the general population. It is well established that interventions that lower blood pressure prevent cardiovascular events. Blood pressure is commonly raised in individuals with chronic kidney disease, and guidelines recommend lower blood pressure targets in this population than in people without chronic kidney disease. Several studies have also suggested particular benefits of drug classes acting through the renin-angiotensin system for the prevention of renal complications. The evidence that lowering blood pressure is beneficial for patients with chronic kidney disease as well as those without, however, remains limited, and the comparative efficacy of different regimens to lower blood pressure on the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with and without chronic kidney disease remains uncertain.

The Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaborationwas established to perform a series of prospectively defined overviews of randomised trials to investigate the effects of blood pressure lowering drugs on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, including assessments of the comparative effects of regimens between major patient subgroups. This analysis, prespecified in the original collaboration protocol, quantifies the proportional benefits of blood pressure lowering, and the comparative effects of different classes of blood pressure lowering drugs in individuals with and without chronic kidney disease.

### The kidney in arterial hypertension [^117Asmyq]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

The kidney facilitates the development of arterial hypertension and suffers its consequences. Once renal damage is clinically manifested, a clear increase in cardiovascular risk appears. The coincidence of renal and cardiovascular damage strengthens the need for therapies attempting the simultaneous protection of both the kidney and the cardiovascular system.
