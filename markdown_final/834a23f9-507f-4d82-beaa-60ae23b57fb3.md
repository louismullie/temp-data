## Question

What is the initial management of a patient with a suspected myocardial infarction presenting to the emergency department?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the step-by-step initial management of suspected myocardial infarction in the emergency department. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and ECG acquisition. Then, I should verify STEMI identification and reperfusion pathways. Next, I will consider non-STEMI evaluation with serial ECGs and troponin strategies. After that, I need to check risk stratification tools and their integration with accelerated diagnostic pathways. Then, I will review antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and adjunctive therapies, including analgesia and beta-blockade. Finally, I should confirm disposition pathways, special populations, and quality metrics, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities on arrival: secure ABCs, obtain a focused history, establish IV access, provide oxygen if hypoxic, and acquire a 12‑lead ECG within 10 minutes of first medical contact, because time-critical decisions hinge on this ECG and delays worsen outcomes [^113Wrfqd] [^117Y414Y] [^1135GFFy].

> Wait, let me verify STEMI criteria and the reperfusion fork in the road: STEMI is defined by new ST‑segment elevation in contiguous leads or new LBBB, and if STEMI is present, the default is immediate transfer for primary PCI with a system goal of first‑medical‑contact‑to‑device within 90 minutes; if transfer will exceed 90 minutes, fibrinolysis with subsequent transfer for PCI is appropriate, and early activation of the cath lab and direct‑to‑lab bypass of the ED reduce delays and improve outcomes [^113Wrfqd] [^115Sbgmd] [^1165ZhXH] [^114a8DRL].

> Hold on, I should verify the ECG strategy when the initial tracing is nondiagnostic: serial 12‑lead ECGs should be repeated at 15–30 minute intervals if symptoms persist or suspicion remains high, because about 11% of patients ultimately diagnosed with STEMI initially have a nondiagnostic ECG and most convert within 90 minutes; right‑sided leads are indicated for inferior MI to assess RV involvement, and posterior leads can unmask posterior STEMI [^1135GFFy] [^117Ttx6D] [^112JGPdy].

> Next, I should review troponin testing cadence and assay selection: if STEMI is not present, obtain baseline high‑sensitivity cardiac troponin and repeat at 1–2 hours for hs‑cTn or 3–6 hours for conventional assays, integrating results into a validated clinical decision pathway; hs‑cTn 0/1‑hour algorithms can safely rule out MI in a large proportion of patients with very low 30‑day MACE rates when applied correctly [^116f1Uy6] [^116JguhQ] [^116zsNfE] [^116Jcdkb].

> I need to ensure risk stratification is embedded early: the HEART score (History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin) and TIMI score help categorize risk, with HEART ≤ 3 identifying low‑risk patients suitable for accelerated pathways; however, I should double‑check that these tools are applied only to NSTE‑ACS presentations, as they are not validated for STEMI and should not delay reperfusion decisions [^113AnQkZ] [^114wLrdV] [^113v3P55].

> Let me consider accelerated diagnostic pathways next: in low‑risk patients with nonischemic ECGs and negative serial hs‑cTn, early discharge without inpatient testing is safe and reduces length of stay; the HEART Pathway and ESC 0/1‑hour algorithms have shown very low 30‑day MACE in ruled‑out cohorts, and real‑world implementation data support feasibility and safety when protocols are followed rigorously [^115kyxgn] [^1164zuS5] [^116Jcdkb] [^114QPkGz].

> But wait, what if the patient is intermediate or high risk: I should confirm that these patients merit observation, serial ECGs, and serial troponins, with cardiology consultation and consideration of early invasive evaluation; noninvasive testing is generally reserved for low‑risk patients after MI is excluded, and routine early CCTA or stress testing in low‑risk, MI‑excluded patients does not reduce 30‑day MACE and may increase downstream procedures [^111sLkhK] [^114tvaFc].

> I will now examine antiplatelet therapy: aspirin 162–325 mg chewed should be given immediately unless contraindicated; for NSTEMI, routine immediate P2Y12 inhibition in the ED is not mandated and can be deferred to cardiology, especially given bleeding risks and lack of outcome benefit from very early administration in some contexts, though selected high‑risk patients may benefit from earlier P2Y12 loading in coordination with the cath team [^112YTX1N] [^112KR39K] [^1147JcXG].

> Next, I should review anticoagulation: unfractionated heparin or low‑molecular‑weight heparin should be initiated in NSTEMI unless contraindicated, with fondaparinux as an alternative in certain regimens; glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are generally deferred until the cath lab or reserved for specific high‑risk scenarios due to bleeding risk and lack of clear early benefit in the ED [^117UghZY].

> Let me think about adjunctive care: provide nitroglycerin for ongoing chest pain if there is no RV infarct, hypotension, or phosphodiesterase‑5 inhibitor use; give morphine for persistent pain after nitrates; administer a beta‑blocker early if there is no heart failure, bradycardia, or hypotension; and ensure statin therapy is initiated or continued for secondary prevention [^112YTX1N].

> I should confirm disposition pathways: low‑risk patients with nonischemic ECGs and negative serial hs‑cTn can be discharged with appropriate follow‑up and return precautions; intermediate‑risk patients generally require observation and further testing; high‑risk patients or those with positive troponins warrant admission, guideline‑directed medical therapy, and consideration of early invasive management [^111sLkhK] [^116f1Uy6].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and pitfalls: in early presenters within 2–3 hours of symptom onset, sensitivity of hs‑cTn is lower, so serial testing is essential; in renal impairment, troponin elevations are common and do not negate the safety of accelerated pathways, though fewer patients will meet low‑risk criteria; in suspected type 2 MI, treat the precipitant, obtain echocardiography, and manage as presumed type 1 MI initially while addressing the underlying supply–demand mismatch [^1146mV3x] [^114UEpao] [^11429bEc].

> Next, I should review system quality metrics: track door‑to‑ECG time with a goal of ≤ 10 minutes, door‑to‑balloon time with a goal of ≤ 90 minutes for STEMI, and DIDO times for transfers with targets of 30–45 minutes; continuous audit and feedback loops are essential to sustain performance and reduce ischemic time [^113Wrfqd] [^1117du32] [^114a8DRL].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a single undetectable hs‑cTn at presentation could universally exclude MI, but I should correct that: while a very low hs‑cTn with nonischemic ECG and symptoms ≥ 3 hours can reasonably exclude MI, early presenters and those with ongoing symptoms still require serial testing to avoid false negatives and missed evolving infarctions [^116JguhQ] [^1146mV3x].

> To synthesize, the initial ED management of suspected MI hinges on immediate ECG within 10 minutes to identify STEMI and trigger reperfusion, serial ECGs and troponins with assay‑specific algorithms for NSTE‑ACS, structured risk stratification to guide disposition, timely antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy with attention to bleeding risk, and system‑level pathways that enable safe early discharge for low‑risk patients while ensuring rapid invasive care for high‑risk or STEMI patients [^113Wrfqd] [^116f1Uy6] [^111sLkhK] [^116Jcdkb].

Initial management of suspected MI in the ED centers on **immediate ECG within 10 minutes** [^117Y414Y] to detect STEMI and guide reperfusion [^116f1Uy6], alongside **serial high-sensitivity troponin** at 0 and 1–2 hours to rapidly rule in/out MI [^116JguhQ] [^116zsNfE]. Provide **aspirin 162–325 mg** [^113CjF7p] and **nitroglycerin** if not contraindicated, start IV access, continuous monitoring, and oxygen for hypoxia [^115cynDQ]. Risk-stratify with HEART or TIMI [^113AnQkZ] to determine disposition; low-risk patients with negative troponin and nonischemic ECG may be discharged with follow-up [^114tvaFc], while high-risk or positive troponin patients require admission and cardiology consultation [^111sLkhK]. Early anticoagulation and P2Y12 inhibition are indicated for NSTEMI/UA [^notfound], and STEMI requires immediate PCI or fibrinolysis if PCI is delayed [^113Wb39r].

---

## Immediate assessment and stabilization

- **Airway, breathing, circulation (ABCs)**: Ensure airway patency, adequate ventilation, and circulatory support [^notfound].

- **Vital signs and oxygen saturation**: Continuously monitor and correct abnormalities promptly [^114v8Yij].

- **Oxygen therapy**: Administer oxygen if SpO2 < 90%, respiratory distress, or high-risk features are present [^notfound].

---

## Electrocardiogram (ECG)

Obtain a **12-lead ECG within 10 minutes** of arrival [^1135GFFy] for all patients with suspected MI [^1135GFFy]. Interpret the ECG promptly to distinguish STEMI from NSTEMI/UA and guide management [^116f1Uy6]. If the initial ECG is nondiagnostic, repeat at 15–30 minute intervals or with symptom changes [^notfound].

---

## Cardiac biomarkers

Order **high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn)** at presentation and repeat at 1–2 hours [^116f1Uy6]; use the ESC 0/1-hour algorithm when available [^1135pxwh]. Interpret results using assay-specific cutoffs and delta changes to rule in/out MI [^116zsNfE].

## Initial pharmacological management

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Dose** | **Contraindications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Aspirin | All suspected MI | 162–325 mg chewable | - Allergy <br/> - Active bleeding [^notfound] |
| Nitroglycerin | - Chest pain <br/> - No hypotension | 0.4 mg SL q5min x3 | - SBP < 90 <br/> - RV infarct <br/> - PDE5 inhibitor use [^notfound] |
| Morphine | Persistent pain after nitrates | 2–4 mg IV q5–15min | - Allergy <br/> - Respiratory depression [^notfound] |
| Beta-blocker | - No contraindications <br/> - No heart failure | Metoprolol 5 mg IV q5min x3 | - Bradycardia <br/> - Hypotension <br/> - Heart failure [^notfound] |
| Anticoagulation | NSTEMI/UA | - Heparin <br/> - Enoxaparin <br/> - Fondaparinux | - Active bleeding <br/> - HIT [^notfound] |
| P2Y12 inhibitor | NSTEMI/UA | - Clopidogrel <br/> - Ticagrelor <br/> - Prasugrel | - Allergy <br/> - Active bleeding [^notfound] |

---

## Risk stratification

Use the **HEART score** (History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin) to stratify risk and guide disposition [^113AnQkZ] [^1154yGhs]. Alternatively, the **TIMI score** can be used for prognostication and management decisions [^113qtqCP].

---

## Disposition and further management

- **STEMI**: Immediate cardiology consultation; activate cath lab for primary PCI within 90 minutes [^113Wrfqd]; if PCI is unavailable, consider fibrinolysis [^113Wb39r].

- **NSTEMI/UA**: Admit to telemetry; cardiology consultation; early invasive strategy for high-risk patients [^111sLkhK].

- **Low-risk patients**: If hs-cTn is negative, ECG is nonischemic, and risk score is low, consider discharge with close follow-up [^114wLrdV] [^116JguhQ].

---

## Documentation and communication

Document the **history, exam, ECG, biomarkers, treatments, and disposition**. Communicate with cardiology, nursing, and the receiving team to ensure coordinated care [^116vBdfv].

---

Initial ED management of suspected MI requires **rapid ECG**, **serial hs-cTn**, early antithrombotic therapy, risk stratification, and timely disposition to reperfusion or observation, with documentation and communication to ensure safe, guideline-concordant care [^116f1Uy6].

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians addresses key issues in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes. A writing subcommittee conducted a systematic review of the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to answer the following clinical questions: (1) In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, can initial risk stratification be used to predict a low rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (2) In adult patients with suspected acute non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, can troponin testing within 3 hours of emergency department presentation be used to predict a low rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (3) In adult patients with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome in whom acute myocardial infarction has been excluded, does further diagnostic testing (eg, provocative, stress test, computed tomography angiography) for acute coronary syndrome prior to discharge reduce 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (4) Should adult patients with acute non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction receive immediate antiplatelet therapy in addition to aspirin to reduce 30-day major adverse cardiac events? Evidence was graded and recommendations were made based on the strength of the available data.

### Management of acute coronary syndrome [^115cynDQ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the most common complaints encountered in the emergency department is chest pain. In many evaluations, the leading diagnostic consideration is an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS refers to a spectrum of coronary artery pathologies, including unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The distinction between subtypes of ACS guides acute diagnostic and management decisions. Failure to diagnose and manage ACS properly is a frequent cause of medico-legal litigation. In this article, we review the initial identification and critical management steps in patients presenting to the emergency department with ACS.

Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS) in adult emergency department (ED) patients — initial risk stratification recommendations state: Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation ACS, the History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin (HEART) score can be used as a clinical prediction instrument for risk stratification, and a low score (≤ 3) predicts 30-day MACE miss rate within a range of 0% to 2%. Level C recommendations: In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation ACS, other risk-stratification tools, such as Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI), can be used to predict rate of 30-day MACE. Potential Benefit of Implementing the Recommendations includes decreased use of limited resources, and Potential Harm of Implementing the Recommendations is the potential for missed cases of preventable MI or death.

The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association last published evidence-based guidelines for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in 1999. In mid-2004, in recognition of the evolution and improvement of many of the most basic tenets of clinical management of STEMI since that time, an updated edition of the STEMI guidelines has been published. These guidelines offer many evidence-based recommendations that are pertinent to the out-of-hospital and emergency department care of STEMI patients, including initial evaluation, risk stratification, stabilizing management, and the choice between pharmacologic and mechanical revascularization. These are presented and discussed here.

Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) guideline application — scope and potential harm is clarified: If these guidelines are erroneously applied to patients with ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (ACS), there is the potential for increased mortality, and clinicians should recognize that this recommendation applies only to those patients with a diagnosis of NSTEMI.

High-sensitivity troponin algorithms — stepwise and 0/1-hour protocols and performance are detailed: A stepwise algorithm using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I enabled one third of patients to be ruled in or ruled out with the initial value and another one third ruled out with a 2-hour test, totaling 54.6% ruled out for acute MI within 2 hours with an NPV of 99.4% and sensitivity of 97.7% using a high-sensitivity troponin T test. A separate 0- and 1-hour algorithm with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T used rule-out thresholds of an initial level less than 12 ng/L and a 1-hour Δ less than 3 ng/L and rule-in thresholds of an initial level greater than 52 ng/L or a 1-hour Δ greater than 5 ng/L, achieving an NPV of 99.1% but sensitivity of 96.7%, meaning more than 3 patients of every 100 would have false-negative results.

Regarding quality improvement for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to healthcare system and hospital requirements, pre-hospital settings, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to ensure that:

- pre-hospital management of patients with a working diagnosis of STEMI is based on regional networks designed to deliver reperfusion therapy expeditiously and effectively, with efforts made to make primary PCI available to as many patients as possible

- patients transferred for primary PCI bypassing the emergency department and coronary care unit/ICU and are transferred directly to the catheterization laboratory

- emergency medical services transfer patients with suspected STEMI to a PCI-capable center bypassing non-PCI centers

- strategies are in place to facilitate the transfer of all patients with suspected ACS after resuscitated cardiac arrest directly to a hospital offering 24/7 primary PCI via one specialized emergency medical service

- ambulance teams are trained and equipped to identify ECG patterns suggestive of acute coronary occlusion and to administer initial therapy, including defibrillation and fibrinolysis when applicable

- all emergency medical services participating in the care of patients with suspected STEMI record and audit delay times and work together to achieve and maintain quality targets.

Emergency department non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS) after exclusion of acute myocardial infarction (MI) — testing and disposition: Level B recommendations state, "Do not routinely use further diagnostic testing (coronary CT angiography, stress testing, myocardial perfusion imaging) prior to discharge in low-risk patients in whom acute MI has been ruled out to reduce 30-day MACE". Level C recommendations state, "Arrange follow-up in 1 to 2 weeks for low-risk patients in whom MI has been ruled out. If no follow-up is available, consider further testing or observation prior to discharge (Consensus recommendation)". Level A recommendations are "None specified". Context includes 2014 AHA/ACC guidance that "It is reasonable for patients with possible ACS who have normal serial ECGs and cardiac troponins to have a treadmill ECG… or stress echocardiography before discharge or within 72 hours after discharge", and a randomized trial in which "all patients underwent 6-hour serial cardiac troponin T ruleout testing", showing 30-day major adverse cardiac events of "0.4%" with stress myocardial perfusion imaging versus "0.8%" with standard management (relative risk "0.50; 95% CI 0.13 to 2.00") and that imaging "did not significantly reduce 30-day MACE".

### Pitfalls in the emergency department diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction [^112rWYka]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The accurate assessment and triage of patients with potential ACS is a complex decision-making process based on information that is not entirely reliable. The knowledgeable EP recognizes that assessment of patients with chest pain requires an understanding of the various clinical presentations of ACS and high-risk patient types, as well as careful use of the available modalities to diagnose these syndromes efficiently while incurring minimal risk to the patients safety. The busy EP is faced with sick patients with chest pain daily, so that it behoove anyone in emergency medicine to familiarize themselves with these diagnostic pitfalls.

### Emergency department evaluation of the chest pain patient [^113BtLhw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The emergency physician must have a high degree of suspicion for myocardial ischemia in patients presenting with no obvious for their chest pain. The role of the emergency physician is to determine a relative risk for each patient and to order the appropriate studies to minimize the risk of missed myocardial infarction as well as to recognize acute ischemia or infarction and manage it aggressively. It is not possible to rule out myocardial ischemia or infarction subjectively. It is the opinion of these authors that some form of further testing should be performed on patients in all categories, except those determined to be at very low risk.

### Single vs serial measurements of cardiac troponin level in the evaluation of patients in the emergency department with suspected acute myocardial infarction [^112GR7Dz]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Do patients discharged from the emergency department after a single troponin test with negative results have similar outcomes to patients undergoing multiple troponin tests?

Findings

This cohort study found no significant difference in 30-day acute myocardial infarction or cardiac mortality between patients receiving a single troponin test with negative results and those who underwent serial troponin tests (single troponin test, 0.4% vs serial troponin tests, 0.4%).

Meaning

This study suggests that physician discretion to order serial or single troponin tests in managing emergency department patients suspected to have acute coronary syndrome appears safe and is a reasonable strategy to possibly improve efficiency without an adverse association with patient outcomes.

### Critical decision making in the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction and other acute coronary syndromes [^116UF3pX]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The decision-making process for emergency physicians in managing patients with signs or symptoms of AMI or unstable angina is quite different than that used by other specialists who might evaluate such patients in a less critical setting (e.g., a cardiologist seeing a private patient in an office or outpatient clinic environment). The emergency physician's evaluation must be highly focused and follow established principles of emergency medicine (Fig. 2). Although the evaluation and treatment of all patients must be individualized to some degree, increasing experience at high-volume centers nationally indicates that well-constructed institutional strategies, protocols, and critical pathways can help emergency physicians to provide consistent, cost-effective management of such patients.

Type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) initial management and evaluation — The text states that "whether the diagnosis is a type 1 or 2 MI, clinicians should generally manage the patient as presumed type 1 MI". After confirming type 2 MI, clinicians "should first identify and treat the precipitant of acute supply/demand mismatch", and "A structural evaluation of the heart with TTE should be performed to assess for regional wall motion abnormalities, valvular heart disease, and systolic dysfunction". For patients without recent CAD evaluation, "an anatomical or functional evaluation for CAD should be considered", and "For patients who are clinically stable and without ongoing ischemic symptoms, this can be deferred to the outpatient setting following discharge".

### Clinical practice guidelines in the emergency department [^113JxJvx]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Many professional societies publish clinical practice guidelines that pertain to the management of patients with specific diagnoses. This article explores clinical practice guidelines affecting emergency physicians, such as those published by the American College of Emergency Physicians and other medical specialty organizations, such as the American Heart Association. Examples of such guidelines include algorithms, such as those published in Advanced Cardiac Life Support, clinical decision rules, such as the Ottawa ankle rules, and pathways that describe the treatment of critical diseases such as acute myocardial infarction. This article discusses the relevance of these guidelines, algorithms, and protocols to the practicing emergency medicine specialist.

Clinical Perspective

Editorial, see p

There are > 20 million presentations of suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) each year in the United States alone, accounting for up to 10% of hospital visits and 40% of unscheduled admissions. Given that most patients do not have myocardial infarction (MI), the adoption of effective and safe pathways to rule out MI in the emergency department and avoid hospital admission would have a major effect on patient care and health care provision.

Cardiac troponin testing is an integral component of the assessment of patients with suspected ACS, with guidelines recommending serial testing to rule in and rule out MI. The development of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays with enhanced precision at very low concentrations permits quantification well below the 99th percentile diagnostic threshold for MI. This advance has led to innovative pathways to rule out MI more rapidly, either at presentation or within 3 hours, that have been incorporated into clinical practice guidelines. – However, these studies were observational, and there are few examples where the pathway guided patient care. The majority were modest in size, or enrolled selected low-risk patients, and therefore the true efficacy and safety of introducing these pathways into clinical practice remains uncertain.

Our aim was to determine the efficacy and safety of implementing an accelerated pathway where high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing is used to rule out MI at presentation in consecutive patients with suspected ACS.

Antiplatelet therapy for acute non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the emergency department — recommendation strength states that Level A recommendations are none specified, Level B recommendations are none specified, and Level C recommendations state that P2Y12 inhibitors and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may be given in the ED or delayed until cardiac catheterization. The policy question asked whether adult patients with acute NSTEMI should receive immediate antiplatelet therapy in addition to aspirin to reduce 30-day MACE, and the document notes that beyond aspirin the emergency physician does not need to make an immediate decision on these agents and can defer to local cardiologists, which may help avoid delays in transitions of care and increased costs and potential adverse effects from excessive ED use.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) definitions — adult emergency department population: This policy refers only to adult (> 18 years) patients with possible cardiac ischemia and excludes acute STEMI defined by the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, which requires ST elevation as > 0.1 mV in 2 contiguous leads with specific cut points in V2 - V3 of > 0.2mV in men > 40 years, > 0.25 mV in men less than 40 years, and > 0.15 mV in women; without these electrocardiographic changes, the goal is to diagnose NSTE ACS, and NSTEMI is defined by a significant Δ increase in troponin level without ST-segment elevation in the appropriate clinical context suggestive of myocardial ischemia.

### Multicentre analysis of current ST-elevation myocardial infarction acute care pathways [^112ELHgQ]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

The differences in care processes and accelerating factors are presented as independent factors, while in real life they may be inter-related. For example, when an interventional cardiologist trusts the diagnosis made by an ambulance nurse or coronary care unit nurse, no further discussion is required. This trust can in turn be influenced by the experience and qualification of the diagnostician and by the clarity of the patients' signs and symptoms. Low trust in the diagnosis might result in additional discussion or an additional stop at the emergency department for further diagnostic testing, prolonging the treatment delay. Consequently, in optimising the process, it is important to consider both process steps and accelerating factors.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have issued a "focused update" of their 2004 guidelines for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Several of the issues addressed involve new data and new recommendations on treatment decisions that may be made in the emergency department. In this review, we present the new recommendations that are pertinent to emergency medicine practice and comment on their potential implementation into an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to the timely care of the STEMI patient.

HEART score and HEART Pathway — low-risk cohort MACE rates and serial testing are characterized as follows: In a cohort using a single conventional troponin applied to greater than 2,400 patients, among those with a low-risk HEART score (36.4% of the entire cohort) the 30-day MACE rate was 1.7% with the upper range of the CI greater than 2%. A systematic review pooled 9 studies (> 11,000 patients) and reported a low-risk cohort 3.3% rate of MACE; because the HEART score has not consistently achieved a MACE rate less than 1%, the HEART Pathway includes a second troponin test at 3 hours. In a TIMI-stratified cohort of 8,815 adults, only patients with a TIMI score of 0 and a HEART score of 0 had a MACE risk of less than 1%. Additionally, among patients with a nonischemic ECG result and an initial undetectable high-sensitivity troponin T level, a 30-day MACE rate of 0.17% was found.

### PRospective evaluation of the European Society of Cardiology 0 / 1h-algorithm's safety and efficacy for triage of patients with suspected myocardial infarction (PRESC1SE-MI): rationale and design of a prospective international multicenter stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial [^1135pxwh]. American Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

International practice guidelines recommend the more rapid European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 0/1h-algorithm for the triage of patients with suspected myocardial infarction (MI) as the preferred option and consider the ESC 0/3h-algorithm as an alternative. However, many centers worldwide have not yet adopted the ESC 0/1h-algorithm in clinical practice due to uncertainty which approach best balances safety and efficacy.

Methods

PRESC1SE-MI (PRospective Evaluation of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1h-algorithm's Safety and Efficacy for Triage of Patients with Suspected Myocardial Infarction) is an international, investigator-initiated multicenter, stepped-wedge, cluster randomized controlled trial. At least 52'156 consecutive adult patients with non-traumatic acute chest discomfort and suspected MI presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) will be enrolled. Sites still using the ESC 0/3h-algorithm as standard-of-care will be randomized to implement the more rapid ESC 0/1h-algorithm at an early or late implementation step. During the validation phase, participating sites continue to use the ESC 0/3h-algorithm. The co-primary outcomes are a composite of type 1 MI or all-cause death at 30 days (safety), and the length of stay in the ED (efficacy). The trial is designed to show non-inferiority for safety and superiority for efficacy, with a power of at least 90%.

Conclusions

PRESC1SE-MI is the largest international multicenter trial to date evaluating the safety and the efficacy of the implementation of the more rapid ESC 0/1h-algorithm at late adopting centers across multiple countries and healthcare systems. Its findings have the potential to improve patient care and reduce healthcare costs.

Conventional troponin with the HEART Pathway — evidence summary: The HEART Pathway stratifies patients as low risk (score 0 to 3) or high risk (score ≥ 4) and tests conventional troponins at 0 and 3 hours; in a randomized trial, 282 patients were enrolled and among the 141 randomized to the HEART pathway, 66 were low risk, 56 were discharged at 3 hours, and none had MACE at 30 days, and a secondary analysis showed that when conventional troponin levels were negative at 0 and 3 hours among low-risk patients (HEART score 0 to 3) there was a 1% MACE miss rate and 99% sensitivity in 1,005 ACS patients from 18 U.S. sites.

Non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) — evidence on the immediacy of nonaspirin antiplatelet administration is limited because few studies isolate a single agent and most included aspirin and heparin; although 3 Class I studies 99–101 were included, a recommendation higher than level C was not made because none directly addressed immediacy, and as for the 2 Class II studies,102,103 neither showed a benefit from early intervention. Drug selection and route often hinges on the need for urgent cardiac catheterization and the potential for emergency cardiac bypass; it is not always apparent whether a diagnosed NSTEMI patient will proceed to catheterization, and the decision about selection and timing should be made in collaboration with local cardiovascular specialists. Future research focusing on nonaspirin antiplatelet agents in highest-risk NSTEMI — patients with ongoing chest pain, significant ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, or candidates for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — may help identify a subset in whom immediate administration in the emergency department (ED) improves patient-important outcomes. Disclosure notes state there were no relevant industry relationships disclosed by the subcommittee members for this topic.

Noninvasive cardiovascular diagnostic testing — objectives and target population are defined: the primary role of subsequent testing is for evaluation of patients classified as intermediate risk according to the initial CDP evaluation; low-risk patients have a very low event rate and can usually be discharged without in-hospital testing, whereas high-risk patients should usually be admitted and initiated on guideline-based therapies if type 1 MI is considered; goals are accurate diagnosis or exclusion of clinically significant CAD or other cardiovascular conditions, risk-stratification to determine which patients require immediate treatment versus those for whom it can be delayed or deferred, and identification of abnormalities such as nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis or left ventricular hypertrophy requiring follow-up, underscoring the importance of consistent post-test reporting.

### Treatment of patients with unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [^112P14SA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Emergency department (ED) management of patients who present with suspected unstable angina (UA) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is especially challenging. Therapies that demonstrate benefit in patients who experience proven disease may not be indicated in patients who present with suspected disease. The emergency practitioner must have a clear understanding of the benefit and harm of each therapy, allowing formulation of a simple approach to treatment selection based on disease presentation. This article reviews current literature and discusses the treatment recommendations from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) for patients who experience UA and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

TIMI score — emergency department chest pain risk stratification — A TIMI score of zero was 97.2% sensitive (95% CI 94.8% to 98.5%) for the study outcome, and in another nonconsecutive series of 1,666 patients with 219 (13%) having 30-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE), the sensitivity of either the original or modified TIMI score was 96% (95% CI 92% to 98%), not high enough in the authors' opinion to warrant widespread adoption. When combined with electrocardiogram (ECG) and normal point-of-care troponin testing on presentation, an initial TIMI score of zero was 99.6% sensitive (95% CI 97.4% to 100%) for subsequent myocardial infarction (MI) within 30 days, and a cutoff of zero with normal point-of-care troponin testing resulted in a MACE rate of 0.6%; limitations included lack of complete data for 80% and lack of firm follow-up for 28% of patients. With high-sensitivity troponins, reported sensitivities with a TIMI score of zero included 99.6% (95% CI 97.3% to 100%), 99.2% (95% CI 97.1% to 99.8%), and 99.4% (95% CI 96.5% to 100%); another series reported 100% (95% CI 94.3% to 100%) sensitivity for MI at 30 days. Despite these findings, a TIMI score of zero does not consistently reach the threshold of a 2% miss rate for 30-day MACE, and a TIMI score cutoff of greater than zero consistently performed better than 97% sensitivity in predicting 30-day MACE; however, the 95% CIs extended the lower bound to 90% in some studies.

American College of Cardiology emergency department chest pain pathway — applicability and exclusions are as follows: The content applies only to patients presenting to the ED with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia undergoing evaluation for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and it does not apply to patients with stable angina or those evaluated in settings other than the ED. This pathway is not applicable to patients with hemodynamic instability, significant heart failure, or other conditions that would mandate hospital admission. The document is focused on the rapid evaluation and disposition of patients with possible ACS in the ED and does not address the evaluation and management of patients with definite ACS or serve as a guide for the diagnosis or management of myocardial infarction (MI).

Prehospital assessment and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) emphasize early electrocardiography (ECG) and EMS-directed STEMI pathways. In patients with suspected ACS, a 12-lead ECG should be acquired and interpreted within 10 minutes of first medical contact (FMC) to identify patients with STEMI. If the initial ECG is nondiagnostic of STEMI, serial ECGs to detect potential ischemic changes should be performed, especially when clinical suspicion of ACS is high, symptoms are persistent, or the clinical condition deteriorates. For suspected ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), immediate emergency medical services (EMS) transport to a PCI-capable hospital for primary PCI (PPCI) is the recommended triage strategy, with an FMC-to-first-device time system goal of ≤ 90 minutes, and early advance notification of the receiving PCI-capable hospital by EMS personnel and activation of the cardiac catheterization team is recommended to reduce time to reperfusion.

### Management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in EDs [^112YTX1N]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Emergency department (ED) physicians are critical in the accurate diagnosis, efficient management, and treatment of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The initial reperfusion strategy involves the choice between mechanical reperfusion using primary percutaneous coronary intervention and pharmacologic treatment with fibrinolytics. The benefits of these approaches are time dependent, and practices vary according to institutional resources and local guidelines. Nevertheless, the need for early intervention and the use of certain therapies are well recognized. Therefore, ED physicians must be aware of all treatment options available, including the use of adjunctive therapies. Initial treatment should include beta-blockers, aspirin (or clopidogrel if aspirin is contraindicated), nitroglycerin, and analgesia, regardless of reperfusion strategy. Clopidogrel is now approved as an adjunctive therapy for patients undergoing fibrinolysis as their reperfusion therapy. Both unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin are feasible adjunctives in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing reperfusion therapy. In addition, multiple new antithrombin agents are being investigated. The choice adjunctive treatments should be based on specific patient populations and on the initial reperfusion strategy.

Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: None specified.

### Acute coronary syndromes: initial evaluation and risk stratification [^115J6EpD]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Chest pain, the second most frequent presenting complaint in the emergency department (ED), often poses a challenge to the physicians dealing with these patients owing to the wide spectrum of presentation of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). A majority of the patients presenting with chest pain are usually admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Despite the availability of modern-day tools for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), about 5% of patients with AMI are missed in the ED with subsequent associated morbidity and mortality and legal consequences. Several centers have adapted critical pathways derived from American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for the management of patients presenting with ACS. We now have some evidence suggesting adherence to the critical pathways derived from ACC/AHA guidelines will optimize the quality of patient care and probably result in better patient outcomes. This article reviews initial evaluation and the importance of risk stratification of the patients presenting with chest pain using the currently available clinical and diagnostic tools. Critical pathways derived from the ACC/AHA guidelines for various presentations of ACS are also reviewed.

### High-sensitivity troponin in the evaluation of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome: a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised controlled trial [^116meb5x]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays permit use of lower thresholds for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, but whether this improves clinical outcomes is unknown. We aimed to determine whether the introduction of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) assay with a sex-specific 99th centile diagnostic threshold would reduce subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.

Methods

In this stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised controlled trial across ten secondary or tertiary care hospitals in Scotland, we evaluated the implementation of an hs-cTnI assay in consecutive patients who had been admitted to the hospitals' emergency departments with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they presented with suspected acute coronary syndrome and had paired cardiac troponin measurements from the standard care and trial assays. During a validation phase of 6–12 months, results from the hs-cTnI assay were concealed from the attending clinician, and a contemporary cardiac troponin I (cTnI) assay was used to guide care. Hospitals were randomly allocated to early (n = 5 hospitals) or late (n = 5 hospitals) implementation, in which the high-sensitivity assay and sex-specific 99th centile diagnostic threshold was introduced immediately after the 6-month validation phase or was deferred for a further 6 months. Patients reclassified by the high-sensitivity assay were defined as those with an increased hs-cTnI concentration in whom cTnI concentrations were below the diagnostic threshold on the contemporary assay. The primary outcome was subsequent myocardial infarction or death from cardiovascular causes at 1 year after initial presentation. Outcomes were compared in patients reclassified by the high-sensitivity assay before and after its implementation by use of an adjusted generalised linear mixed model. This trial is registered with, number.

Findings

Between June 10, 2013, and March 3, 2016, we enrolled 48 282 consecutive patients (61 [SD 17] years, 47% women) of whom 10 360 (21%) patients had cTnI concentrations greater than those of the 99th centile of the normal range of values, who were identified by the contemporary assay or the high-sensitivity assay. The high-sensitivity assay reclassified 1771 (17%) of 10 360 patients with myocardial injury or infarction who were not identified by the contemporary assay. In those reclassified, subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death within 1 year occurred in 105 (15%) of 720 patients in the validation phase and 131 (12%) of 1051 patients in the implementation phase (adjusted odds ratio for implementation vs validation phase 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.61; p = 0.620).

Interpretation

Use of a high-sensitivity assay prompted reclassification of 1771 (17%) of 10 360 patients with myocardial injury or infarction, but was not associated with a lower subsequent incidence of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death at 1 year. Our findings question whether the diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction should be based on the 99th centile derived from a normal reference population.

During a validation phase of 6–12 months, results from the hs-cTnI assay were concealed from the attending clinician, and a contemporary cardiac troponin I (cTnI) assay was used to guide care. Hospitals were randomly allocated to early (n = 5 hospitals) or late (n = 5 hospitals) implementation, in which the high-sensitivity assay and sex-specific 99th centile diagnostic threshold was introduced immediately after the 6-month validation phase or was deferred for a further 6 months. Patients reclassified by the high-sensitivity assay were defined as those with an increased hs-cTnI concentration in whom cTnI concentrations were below the diagnostic threshold on the contemporary assay. The primary outcome was subsequent myocardial infarction or death from cardiovascular causes at 1 year after initial presentation. Outcomes were compared in patients reclassified by the high-sensitivity assay before and after its implementation by use of an adjusted generalised linear mixed model. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01852123.

Findings

Between June 10, 2013, and March 3, 2016, we enrolled 48282 consecutive patients (61 [SD 17] years, 47% women) of whom 10360 (21%) patients had cTnI concentrations greater than those of the 99th centile of the normal range of values, who were identified by the contemporary assay or the high-sensitivity assay. The high-sensitivity assay reclassified 1771 (17%) of 10360 patients with myocardial injury or infarction who were not identified by the contemporary assay. In those reclassified, subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death within 1 year occurred in 105 (15%) of 720 patients in the validation phase and 131 (12%) of 1051 patients in the implementation phase (adjusted odds ratio for implementation vs validation phase 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.61; p = 0.620).

Interpretation

Use of a high-sensitivity assay prompted reclassification of 1771 (17%) of 10360 patients with myocardial injury or infarction, but was not associated with a lower subsequent incidence of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death at 1 year. Our findings question whether the diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction should be based on the 99th centile derived from a normal reference population.

Synopsis — prehospital care for suspected acute coronary syndromes: "Rapid and coordinated prehospital care plays a critical role in the optimal management of patients with suspected ACS". "Patients with suspected ACS should be transported to the emergency department (ED) by emergency medical services (EMS)". "In contrast to transport by private vehicle, EMS transport allows for assessment, monitoring, and treatment of potentially life-threatening conditions such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest during transport to the ED". For initial on-scene evaluation, "trained prehospital personnel should obtain a focused history and physical examination (including assessment of vital signs) and obtain at least one 12-lead ECG".

Prehospital assessment and management — suspected acute coronary syndromes: In patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS), "a 12-lead ECG should be acquired and interpreted within 10 minutes of first medical contact (FMC) to identify patients with STEMI". In patients with suspected ACS whose initial ECG is nondiagnostic of STEMI, "serial ECGs to detect potential ischemic changes should be performed, especially when clinical suspicion of ACS is high, symptoms are persistent, or the clinical condition deteriorates". For suspected STEMI, "immediate emergency medical services (EMS) transport to a PCI-capable hospital for primary PCI (PPCI) is recommended; the recommended triage strategy, with an FMC-to-first-device time system goal of ≤ 90 minutes". Additionally, in suspected STEMI, "early advance notification of the receiving PCI-capable hospital by EMS personnel and activation of the cardiac catheterization team is recommended to reduce time to reperfusion".

### Outcome of applying the ESC 0 / 1-hour algorithm in patients with suspected myocardial infarction [^116Jcdkb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends the 0/1-h algorithm for rapid triage of patients with suspected non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI). However, its impact on patient management and safety when routinely applied is unknown.

Objectives

This study sought to determine these important real-world outcome data.

Methods

In a prospective international study enrolling patients presenting with acute chest discomfort to the emergency department (ED), the authors assessed the real-world performance of the ESC 0/1-h algorithm using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T embedded in routine clinical care and its associated 30-day rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (the composite of cardiovascular death and MI).

Results

Among 2,296 patients, non-ST-segment elevation MI prevalence was 9.8%. In median, 1-h blood samples were collected 65 min after the 0-h blood draw. Overall, 94% of patients were managed without protocol violations, and 98% of patients triaged toward rule-out did not require additional cardiac investigations including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T measurements at later time points or coronary computed tomography angiography in the ED. Median ED stay was 2 h and 30 min. The ESC 0/1-h algorithm triaged 62% of patients toward rule-out, and 71% of all patients underwent outpatient management. Proportion of patients with 30-day MACE were 0.2% (95% confidence interval: 03% to 0.5%) in the rule-out group and 0.1% (95% confidence interval: 0% to 0.2%) in outpatients. Very low MACE rates were confirmed in multiple subgroups, including early presenters.

Conclusions

These real-world data document the excellent applicability, short time to ED discharge, and low rate of 30-day MACE associated with the routine clinical use of the ESC 0/1-h algorithm for the management of patients presenting with acute chest discomfort to the ED.

### Single vs serial measurements of cardiac troponin level in the evaluation of patients in the emergency department with suspected acute myocardial infarction [^112pCHmg]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Chest pain is among the most common reasons for emergency department (ED) presentations. However, most patients are at low risk for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with low cardiac adverse outcomes rates. Biomarker testing with troponin levels is key in the initial assessment for ACS. Although serial troponin testing can improve the diagnosis of ACS in clinical practice, some patients deemed to be low risk are discharged after a single negative troponin test result.

Objective

To report the clinical outcomes of patients discharged after a single negative troponin test result compared with patients discharged after serial troponin measurements.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a retrospective cohort study of ED encounters from May 5, 2016, to December 1, 2017, across 15 community EDs within an integrated health care system in southern California. The study cohort includes 27 918 adult ED encounters in which patients were evaluated for suspected ACS with a HEART (history, electrocardiogram, age, risk factors, and troponin) score and an initial conventional troponin-I measurement below the level of detection (< 0.02 ng/mL). Statistical analysis was performed from December 1, 2019, to December 1, 2020.

Exposure

Single troponin test vs multiple troponin tests.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was acute myocardial infarction or cardiac mortality; secondary outcomes included coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention, invasive coronary angiography, and unstable angina within 30 days of discharge. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to evaluate the association between testing strategies and clinical outcomes.

Results

A total of 27 918 patient encounters (16 212 women [58.1%]; mean [SD] age, 58.7 [15.2] years) were included in the study. Of patients with an initial troponin measurement below the level of detection, 14 459 (51.8%) were discharged after a single troponin measurement, and 13 459 (48.2%) underwent serial troponin tests. After adjustment for cardiac risk factors and comorbidities, there was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome of acute myocardial infarction or cardiac mortality within 30 days between the 2 groups (single troponin, 56 [0.4%] vs serial troponin, 52 [0.4%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.96–2.07]). Patients discharged after a single troponin test had lower rates of coronary artery bypass graft (adjusted odds ratio, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.11–0.48]) and invasive coronary angiography (adjusted odds ratio, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.38–0.56]).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests that patients are routinely discharged from the ED after a single negative troponin test result, and when compared with serial troponin testing, a single troponin test appears safe based on current physician decision-making, with no difference in rates of 30-day cardiac mortality and acute myocardial infarction, which are low in both groups.

### Considerations for management of acute coronary syndromes during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic [^114TDUbE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Accumulating evidence suggests that influenza and influenza-like illnesses can act as a trigger for acute myocardial infarction. Despite these unprecedented times providers should not overlook acute coronary syndrome (ACS) guidelines, but may choose to modify the recommended approach in situations with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 disease. In this document, we suggest recommendations as to how to triage patients diagnosed with ACSs and provide with algorithms of how to manage the patients and decide the appropriate treatment options in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. We also address the inpatient logistics and discharge to follow-up considerations for the function of already established ACS network during the pandemic.

### Biochemical markers in the management of suspected acute myocardial infarction in the emergency department [^115PCg91]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare cardiac troponin T, myoglobin, CK, CKMB activity, CKMB mass and the initial electrocardiogram in the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction in the emergency department. Methods-Biochemical markers were measured at presentation in patients with a possible diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Based on the clinical notes, patients were grouped as "definite myocardial infarction" (n = 50), "definite no myocardial infarction" (n = 81) and "uncertain" (n = 96). Sensitivity and specificity and positive and negative predictive values were calculated using the 131 patients with definitely present or absent myocardial infarction.

Results

The initial electrocardiogram was more sensitive than any of the markers in the first six hours from symptom onset-sensitivity 74% (95%CI 61% to 88%). The positive predictive value of the initial electrocardiogram was 97% in the first six hours; the markers ranged from 47% to 67%. The negative predictive value of the initial electrocardiogram was 85% in the first six hours; the markers ranged from 61% to 70%. Four patients with non-diagnostic electrocardiograms presenting beyond six hours after pain onset had a myocardial infarct detected by at least three of the biochemical markers in each case.

Conclusions

The electrocardiogram is of more diagnostic use than biochemical markers in the first six hours after the onset of pain, but biochemical markers give additional positive diagnostic information in patients presenting later than this. The negative predictive accuracy of biochemical markers is too low for a single sample to be useful for excluding myocardial infarction in the first six hours after onset of symptoms.

### Introducing a chest pain pathway in the emergency department to improve quality of care for patients with possible cardiac chest pain [^112txYPE]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

The European Society of Cardiology define ACS as a clinical spectrum of disease, ranging from unstable angina (no myocardial damage but increased risk of myocardial infarction and subsequent complications), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI – some damage to myocardium), and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) which reflects a completely occluded coronary artery.

Diagnosis is made on the presence of an ischaemic ECG, suggestive clinical history, or the presence of circulating biomarkers of myocardial necrosis (Troponin). Two out of these three factors must be present to reach a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. However, forty to sixty per cent of people who are subsequently diagnosed with ACS present to the ED with an initial non-diagnostic ECG. Some of these patients will not have raised troponin initially, and those with unstable angina will not have elevated troponin at any point, unless they go on to develop an MI. This means that the only way these people can initially be recognised is through the history of the presenting complaint. The full extent of coronary artery disease is often not clear until the patient undergoes invasive investigations such as coronary angiography.

Difficulties in recognition of ACS and the subsequent inconsistencies in management of these patients are well known and challenge clinicians worldwide. DeBusk et al report that half of all patients presenting with chest pain are hospitalised to detect the ten per cent who have an ACS, but that this high admission rate still fails to identify the small percentage of patients with ACS that are discharged inappropriately.

Some tools are available for use in the ED, but many of these suppose knowledge of the various presentations of ACS, are based on populations with confirmed ACS, or are aimed at recognition of MI but not unstable angina. The Goldman score, TIMI score, GRACE score, and HEART scores were all trialled and found to be unhelpful. This is mainly because Goldman is outdated and does not have any criteria relating to unstable angina, which we did not want to miss. TIMI and GRACE were validated on cohorts of patients with confirmed ACS and rely on clinical parameters which do not relate to the presenting complaint, such as createnine and systolic blood pressure. We found that patients who were over 80 years with renal impairment and high systolic blood pressure were likely to be admitted whatever the nature of the chest pain.

### Implementing an early rule-out pathway for acute myocardial infarction in clinical practice [^1146mV3x]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Issues to consider when adopting an early rule-out pathway

If your hospital is using a contemporary sensitive cardiac troponin assay or a pathway that was developed prior to high-sensitivity testing, then based on the latest randomised clinical trials and guideline recommendations you should consider implementing an hs-cTn assay and a validated early rule-out pathway. Irrespective of the assay or approach there are some practical considerations to remember.

Involve a multidisciplinary team and prioritise education: Changing the care pathway requires collaboration between laboratory medicine, cardiology and both emergency and acute medicine specialties. Staff need to be aware of the clinical decision thresholds, strengths and limitations of the selected pathway, and follow-up arrangements to be considered for patients now ruled out in the emergency department.
Know your assay and monitor its performance: Knowledge of your cardiac troponin assay and its performance in routine use is essential. The analytical precision of any laboratory assay can vary, and where clinical decisions are being made based on very low concentrations the performance of the assay at these levels should be monitored regularly using an accredited quality assurance programme.
ECG takes priority: A 12-lead ECG should be performed within 10 min of presentation. Patients with ST segment elevation or clear signs of myocardial ischaemia are high risk and care should not be guided by early rule-out pathways. Decision-making using troponin measurements in these patients may delay treatment and is unreliable; one in four patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction have cardiac troponin concentrations below the optimised rule-in threshold at presentation as there is no perfusion of the myocardium.
Early presenters require serial testing: Careful consideration should be given to early presenters as the sensitivity of rule-out thresholds for myocardial infarction is reduced in patients presenting within 2 hours of symptom onset. In both the HiSTORIC and RAPID-TnT trials serial testing was recommended for patients presenting within 2 and 3 hours of symptom onset, respectively.
Know when not to incorporate clinical risk scores: Clinical risk scores should be considered to improve the safety of pathways using a single diagnostic threshold to rule in and rule out myocardial infarction. However, in early rule-out pathways that use separate rule-out and diagnostic thresholds, no risk score has been shown to improve diagnostic performance and all reduce effectiveness.
Consider how patients are selected for testing: The diagnostic performance of cardiac troponin is dependent on the patient population in which it is applied and the positive predictive value is substantially lower in patients without chest pain. Routine testing in unselected patients will increase the identification of non-ischaemic myocardial injury and limit the effectiveness of early rule-out pathways.
Understand the impact of renal impairment on performance: Cardiac troponin concentrations are often elevated in patients with renal impairment due to non-ischaemic myocardial injury rather than spurious elevation due to renal clearance and predict risk of major adverse cardiac events. Early rule-out pathways are safe in patients with renal impairment, but these pathways appropriately identify a smaller proportion of patients as low risk and suitable for discharge.
Patients in whom myocardial infarction is ruled out require assessment: The exclusion of myocardial infarction does not equate to immediate discharge, nor are diagnostic pathways a substitute for clinical assessment. Alternative diagnoses should be sought and follow-up considered in patients with symptoms suggestive of angina pectoris, particularly in those with stable intermediate cardiac troponin concentrations at risk of future cardiac events.

### 2000 ACC / AHA guidelines for the management of patients with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a practical summary for emergency physicians [^117Xroes]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

There have been numerous significant clinical advances in both the diagnosis and therapy of acute coronary syndrome during the past several years. Even the term "acute coronary syndrome" is a recent creation meant to expand clinical attention in patients with chest pain of coronary origin beyond identification of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and prompt initiation of reperfusion therapy and to include the evaluation and management of those patients with unstable angina (UA) or myocardial injury that does not cause ST-segment elevation. Many of these advances have been studied and first implemented outside the emergency department, leading some emergency physicians to be slow to embrace them, and leaving others without a viable practical option to use them outside of the cardiac catheterization laboratory or the coronary care unit. In September 2000, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued practice guidelines for the care of patients with UA and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The guidelines specifically address the diagnosis and management of UA and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in the ED, suggesting evidence-based standards for risk stratification, for the use of biologic markers of myocardial damage and other adjunctive diagnostic tests, and for the appropriate use of antiplatelet and antithrombin therapeutic agents. This article provides an overview of the ED-pertinent analyses and recommendations from the 93-page document. A commentary on the implementation of these recommendations in the ED follows in a separate article.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^112JPWow]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Modifications of TIMI score — among emergency department chest pain patients, an accelerated diagnostic pathway (ADP) using a modified TIMI of zero with ECG and troponin I at 0 and 2 hours resulted in greater early discharge with one missed MACE, and studies of repeat troponin testing and altered cutoffs showed variable sensitivity and specificity. A Class II trial randomized 542 patients to standard care versus ADP and the ADP enabled discharge within 6 hours more often (19% versus 11%) with one missed MACE in the ADP group (n = 270). In multicenter data with TIMI 0 to 2, sensitivity with conventional troponins at 0 and 2 hours was 83.9% (95% CI 66.3% to 94.5%), while adding a second troponin plus ECG at 2 hours yielded sensitivity 99.2% (95% CI 97.5% to 99.8%) for 30-day MACE. Modified TIMI cutoffs had mixed performance: at a cutoff of less than or equal to 3, sensitivity was 96.4% (95% CI 91.7% to 98.4%) with specificity 51%; at a cutoff of less than or equal to 2, sensitivity was 91% and specificity 54%; in a cohort of 1,758 emergency department patients, cutoffs of less than or equal to 1, less than or equal to 2, or less than 3 missed greater than 10% of 30-day MACE. Authors concluded that neither the original nor modified TIMI score is sufficiently sensitive at any score above zero to safely risk-stratify patients even with a normal ECG and troponin, and most authors recommended not relying on TIMI score alone, instead advocating brief observation with repeated troponin testing.

### Single vs serial measurements of cardiac troponin level in the evaluation of patients in the emergency department with suspected acute myocardial infarction [^115hcWPk]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large retrospective cohort study analyzing the safety of discharging patients after a single nondetectable conventional troponin level, we found that use of a single troponin measurement, when deemed appropriate by the clinician caring for the patient, was safe and not associated with differences in 30-day AMI or cardiac mortality. We also observed that patients discharged after a single troponin test had a lower rate of coronary artery bypass graft and a lower rate of invasive coronary angiography within 30 days.

The American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend serial cardiac troponin tests to identify and exclude myocardial infarction as well as to assess the acuity of a cardiac event in an individual with suspected ACS. Serial testing has been recommended by most to safely rule out AMI. Elevated troponin levels can be detected as early as 2 to 4 hours after the onset of symptoms and can be delayed for up to 8 to 12 hours. Several early studies have demonstrated that the slow increase and late peak of troponin levels make the conventional troponin assay vulnerable to missing early evolving AMI. However, most patients presenting to the ED with chest pain are at low risk for ACS and are below a 1% risk threshold of 30-day adverse events. Therefore, there may not be a benefit associated with repeated troponin testing for low-risk patients and those with prolonged symptoms, despite guideline recommendations. In our cohort, 51.8% of patients with an initial troponin evaluation did not undergo repeated troponin testing. In addition, among patients who did undergo repeated troponin testing, very few (66 [0.5%]) had a positive test result (troponin level > 0.5 ng/mL). Our results also demonstrate that, in clinical practice, the strategy of administering a single troponin test is safe when the test is performed along with a clinician's clinical assessment and risk stratification by the HEART score.

### Machine-learning for phenotyping and Prognostication of myocardial infarction and injury in suspected acute Coronary syndrome [^111BrGfG]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the emergency department (ED) is often protracted and resource intensive accounting for health system costs of over $1 billion/annum across Australia and over $3 billion/annum in the United States. While ED clinical work-up is necessary to exclude acute, life-threatening conditions, it is critical to recognize that up to 85% of these patients are not ultimately diagnosed with an ACS.

Widespread clinical adoption of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays has not necessarily made clinical decision-making easier with a substantial proportion of troponin elevations resulting from myocardial injury-related diagnoses other than type 1 myocardial infarction (T1MI). Patients with non-T1MI, including type 2-MI (T2MI), acute and chronic myocardial injury, previously may have been dismissed as having "troponinemia" (ie, elevated troponin considered to be benign), however prior evidence demonstrates non-T1MI diagnostic classifications to have a high risk of poor clinical outcomes at 1-year demanding a paradigm shift in clinical decision-making. Correct diagnostic phenotyping in clinical practice according to the latest iteration of the Universal Definition of MI (UDMI) is imperative to allow early differentiation of potential T1MI patients for timely administration of well-established evidence-based ACS pharmacotherapies and consideration of early invasive management. Furthermore, accurate delineation of non-T1MI cohorts will enable the establishment and maturation of an evidence-base aimed to improve clinical outcomes where practice currently remains evidence-free and largely consensus-based.,

Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a unique opportunity to support diagnosis and risk stratification in real-time clinical practice. Among the abundance of suspected ACS patients who present to EDs, utilizing an AI model for digital phenotyping of MI and myocardial injury could facilitate diagnosis and provide near-term risk assessment more accurately and consistently, thereby enabling improved clinical decision-making and robust evidence synthesis. The availability of electronic health record (EHR) data is ever-increasing in clinical practice and the capability of AI to process large data is hence advantageous in this clinical environment. The implementation of AI in clinical practice using real-time EHR data for clinical decision support may represent the next step in harnessing the benefits of EHR. Our aim was to develop machine learning (ML) models with a supervised learning approach with clinically acceptable capability to diagnose types of MI and myocardial injury at ED presentation and predict near-term events among suspected ACS patients.

### Introducing a chest pain pathway in the emergency department to improve quality of care for patients with possible cardiac chest pain [^115HzeWi]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Problem

Many patients present to the emergency department with chest pain. It is important to identify those patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, or evolving infarction). However, several problems exist in identification of these patients. Up to 60% of patients with ACS may present with a non-diagnostic ECG. Alternatively, ECG changes may be missed.

Many patients are admitted with suspected ACS, although prevalence is only 8–10% in an ED chest pain population. This causes the blocking of cardiology beds with many inappropriate admissions, and some patients can be missed, particularly if ECG changes are not noted or the patient presents with unstable angina. If a patient presents with increasing chest pain on exertion at progressively lower workload, but without pain at rest, this represents prodromal angina but may be mistaken as stable angina. Therefore, these patients could be inappropriately discharged when they may be in fact at risk of myocardial infarction.

Air Ambulance Services

EMS or communications centers should consider if an air ambulance is a better possibility for transfer than ground ambulance. Air ambulance services usually have advanced life support training and may be better prepared to offer more advanced levels of care than ground ambulances for safe transfer. Ground and air ambulance centers should know about unit availability, proximity, and reasonably accurate facility and travel time estimates, including total time needed from air ambulance request, arrival including pickup, flight time, and movement from landing pad to ED or directly to the specialty care unit. Time needed before and after flight can make air ambulance service slower than ground units, despite faster air travel times. Helicopter (air) ambulances or fixed‐wing planes can be useful but at significantly higher cost, although effect of transport mode on mortality reduction is unclear. Weather is often a crucial factor to consider in requesting an air ambulance. Stand‐alone communications centers may involve EMS agencies to help with these decisions.

The EMS agency or regional system‐of‐care QI committee is a suitable venue for development of policies to guide use of air versus ground ambulances for STAT TRANSFER. Decisions about use of air versus ground ambulances may affect a larger area and benefit from regional policies.

Responsibilities of the Referring Hospital

All acute care hospitals with an ED are STEMI‐capable facilities if they evaluate patients for suspected acute coronary syndrome. Referring hospitals have responsibilities for diagnosis and initial management of a patient with suspected STEMI who arrived by ambulance or self‐transport, including treatment for significant arrhythmias, hemodynamic instability, and airway compromise. Referring hospitals must develop timeline goals involving recognition, assessment, and primary care of potential transfer patients. Referring hospitals are responsible and must facilitate efficient transport by diagnosing STEMI early, with an ECG performed < 10 minutes from arrival, assessing the patient's acuity, deciding transfer to a higher level of cardiovascular care, and then requesting immediate STAT TRANSFER. A referring hospital is expected to manage a patient with STEMI with a DIDO time ≤ 30 to 45 minutes with minimum adherence of 90% predictability. Measurement of the DIDO in the referring hospital provides a framework to assess overall effectiveness and efficiency in the STAT TRANSFER process of care and should be shared with EMS and the SRC network.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on the management of patients with STEMI referred for primary PCI [^1165ZhXH]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2024). High credibility.

Operational guidance for STEMI activation and emergency department (ED) bypass indicates that transmission of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is helpful for review and planning but should not delay transportation; cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) team members should be expected to arrive at the CCL within 30 minutes and ideally 20 minutes after notification. Once a STEMI is confirmed on the initial ECG and there are no circumstances precluding emergent revascularization, the patient should be directly transported to the CCL; when feasible, patients presenting to a PCI-capable hospital via emergency medical services (EMS) should go directly to the CCL, bypassing the ED, a process associated with shorter times to treatment and better outcomes. In these situations, there is no need to obtain a repeat ECG if the ECG performed by EMS is diagnostic for STEMI.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — ECG acquisition and serial testing guidance emphasizes that timely ECG acquisition is imperative with a goal to obtain and interpret an ECG by a trained clinician within 10 minutes of presentation; an initial nondiagnostic 12-lead ECG does not rule out or exclude ACS; nondiagnostic ECGs should be compared with prior tracings and a repeat ECG should be obtained during the emergency department course to assess for evolving changes; and registry data show that 11% of patients ultimately diagnosed with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) had an initial ECG that was nondiagnostic, with 72.4% of those having a follow-up ECG diagnostic of STEMI within 90 minutes, while ST-segment depression in V1–V3 could indicate evolving posterior STEMI.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chest pain-possible acute coronary syndrome [^116MXEMW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chest pain is a frequent cause for emergency department visits and inpatient evaluation, with particular concern for acute coronary syndrome as an etiology, since cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Although history-based, electrocardiographic, and laboratory evaluations have shown promise in identifying coronary artery disease, early accurate diagnosis is paramount and there is an important role for imaging examinations to determine the presence and extent of anatomic coronary abnormality and ischemic physiology, to guide management with regard to optimal medical therapy or revascularization, and ultimately to thereby improve patient outcomes. A summary of the various methods for initial imaging evaluation of suspected acute coronary syndrome is outlined in this document. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Reperfusion strategies in the emergency treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^113Wb39r]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Prompt restoration of blood flow is the primary treatment goal in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to optimize clinical outcomes. The ED plays a critical role in rapid triage, diagnosis, and management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and in the decision about which of the 2 recommended reperfusion options, that is, pharmacologic and mechanical (catheter-based) strategies, to undertake. Guidelines recommend percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if the medical contact-to-balloon time can be kept under 90 minutes, and timely administration of fibrinolytics if greater than 90 minutes. Most US hospitals do not have PCI facilities, which means the decision becomes whether to treat with a fibrinolytic agent, transfer, or both, followed by PCI if needed. Whichever reperfusion approach is used, successful treatment depends on the ED having an integrated and efficient protocol that is followed with haste. Protocols should be regularly reviewed to accommodate changes in clinical practice arising from ongoing clinical trials.

Initial assessment for suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS) begins with ECG within 10 min (Class 1) and obtain cTn (Class 1). If ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is present, evaluate for reperfusion therapy (Section 5). If not STEMI, perform serial ECG to detect ischemia (Class 1) and serial cTn hs-cTn at 1–2 h or conventional cTn at 3–6 h (Class 1). A clinical decision pathway (CDP) is used to define risk, with categories including low risk, intermediate risk, and criteria met for NSTEMI or high risk; for the latter, initiate medical therapy (Section 4) and assess for invasive evaluation (Section 6.1).

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I and clinical risk scores in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^1154yGhs]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

The GRACE and TIMI scores were derived in patients with confirmed myocardial infarction and were designed to guide prognostication and management. These scores have been extrapolated for use as risk stratification tools in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, and both improved the performance of the ESC pathway. In contrast, both the HEART and EDACS scores were derived and validated in patients with suspected, not confirmed, myocardial infarction.

The HEART score has been shown to perform better than GRACE and TIMI in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. In this analysis, we demonstrate the greatest improvement in the safety of the ESC pathway when a HEART score of ≤ 3 was included. The ESC pathway and the HEART score appear synergistic, with the combination of strategies offering a better safety profile than either in isolation. Our observation is consistent with a recent meta-analysis of 11 217 patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, in whom a HEART score ≤ 3 gave a sensitivity of 96.7%. The current HEART score uses troponin as a categorical variable based on multiples of the upper reference limit. One option to improve the performance of the HEART score further would be to incorporate high-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentrations as a continuous marker of riskand to harness rather than omit this information to aid risk stratification. Similar improvements in the safety of the ESC pathway were observed when applied in conjunction with a low-risk EDACS score. However, this approach identified almost twice as many patients as low-risk. This observation may influence clinicians when considering which approach to implement in practice.

The High-STEACS pathway applies a cardiac troponin threshold of < 5 ng/L in conjunction with a nonischemic ECG as an initial risk stratification step, with serial testing at 3 hours in all other patients. This pathway performs well in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, and we demonstrate no improvement in safety with the addition of clinical risk scores. When applied in isolation, the High-STEACS pathway ruled out 1244 patients with 3 missed events (a miss rate of < 1 in 400 patients). The safety of pathways incorporating low concentrations of cardiac troponin for risk stratification is high and not improved by additional risk scores. One of the reasons this approach is so effective is that cardiac troponin concentrations are increased in patients with risk factors for acute coronary syndrome (such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or renal impairment) or in those with subclinical coronary or structural heart disease that may not be evident at presentation to the emergency department.–

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^115mYgm6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

High-sensitivity troponin validation and conventional-troponin comparisons show divergent performance in serial testing cohorts. A 4-year prospective observational study in 15 US emergency departments demonstrated a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.4% for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T below 6 ng/L and an NPV of 99.3% for a level less than 19 ng/L at 0 and 3 hours. In a prospective cohort substudy using repeated conventional troponin testing, only 1 MACE was identified among 215 low-risk patients with sensitivity 98.9% (95% CI 93.4% to 99.9%), and a subsequent formal validation did not identify any MACE among 177 patients (21%) deemed low risk. Additional Class III studies using high-sensitivity troponin reported very high sensitivity (> 98%) in certain low-risk cohorts. By contrast, secondary analyses using conventional troponin with a 2-hour accelerated diagnostic protocol (ADP) reported sensitivity 88.2% (95% CI 63.6% to 98.5%) and 83.9% (95% CI 66.3% to 94.5%) when obtained at presentation and 2 hours. Extending conventional troponin testing to 3 to 4 hours among non-high-risk patients with a negative result yielded only 1 MACE (0.26%) at 30 days.

### Early computed tomography coronary angiography in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome: randomised controlled trial [^112TiWSA]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Chest pain is one of the commonest complaints in patients presenting to the emergency department. These patients are evaluated for acute coronary syndrome with urgent diagnostic investigation so that those with acute myocardial infarction or at risk of acute myocardial infarction receive appropriate treatment promptly. Lack of clarity on the optimal diagnostic pathways, however, has led to the development of risk scores and the use of numerous functional and anatomical testing options to investigate for underlying coronary artery disease. Recent guidelines have proposed that patients at low or intermediate risk of coronary artery disease should undergo observation and further testing if acute coronary syndrome is suspected.

Several trials have explored the role of computed tomography (CT) coronary angiography in low risk patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain. The trials showed that CT coronary angiography increased rates of discharge from hospital and shortened length of stay compared with usual care. These findings are likely to apply only where usual care for patients at low risk involves high rates of admission and investigation. Participants were at low risk of coronary heart disease (< 10%) and consequently had low rates of cardiovascular events (0.1–0.8%), leading some to suggest that non-invasive testing was unnecessary and only clinical evaluation was required.

Although recommended in guidelinesas a potential strategy for subsequent investigation, the use of early CT coronary angiography in patients presenting with acute chest pain, who are at intermediate risk of acute coronary syndrome and subsequent clinical events, has not been investigated or established. This strategy could identify patients who would benefit from more rapid and appropriate therapeutic interventions, thus improving clinical outcomes. In those patients without disease, CT coronary angiography might reduce the need for invasive coronary angiography, shorten hospital stay, and avoid repeated admissions to hospital. If CT coronary angiography does not influence investigations, treatments, and outcomes of patients, however, it might increase the cost and risk without any clinical benefit. Our trial aimed to investigate the effect of early CT coronary angiography on the management and outcome of patients with suspected or a provisional diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome, presenting to the emergency department.

Patients with acute chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (not including STEMI) should be managed using clinical decision pathways (CDPs) that categorize patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk strata, with standardized troponin sampling intervals and incorporation of prior testing; specifically, recommended time intervals after the initial troponin sample collection (time zero) for repeat measurements are 1 to 3 hours for high-sensitivity troponin and 3 to 6 hours for conventional troponin assays, institutions should implement a CDP that includes a protocol for troponin sampling based on their particular assay, previous testing when available should be considered and incorporated into CDPs, and for patients with a normal ECG and symptoms suggestive of ACS that began at least 3 hours before ED arrival, a single hs-cTn concentration that is below the limit of detection on initial measurement (time zero) is reasonable to exclude myocardial injury.

4 Delays in Care

The guidelines explore the potential delays for patients presenting with STEMI. These include patient self‐presentation delay or emergency medical system (EMS) delay and systems of care delay within the receiving medical center, all adding to the total ischemic time. Analysis of these components may improve the delivery of care for patients with STEMI and will involve patient education for prompt presentation, the EMS system efficiency, the emergency room contact in the hospital, and transfer to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, ideally in under 90 min. The guidelines further detail the recommendations for patients presenting to a non‐PCI center, scheduling transfer to an appropriate more intensive level facility.

### Late outcomes of the RAPID-TnT randomized controlled trial: 0 / 1-hour high-sensitivity troponin T protocol in suspected ACS [^115MrrV4]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

High-sensitivity troponin assays are increasingly being adopted to expedite evaluation of patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes. Few direct comparisons have examined whether the enhanced performance of these assays at low concentrations leads to changes in care that improves longer-term outcomes. This study evaluated late outcomes of participants managed under an unmasked 0/1-hour high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) protocol compared with a 0/3-hour masked hs-cTnT protocol.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter prospective patient-level randomized comparison of care informed by unmasked 0/1-hour hs-cTnT protocol (reported to < 5 ng/L) versus standard practice masked hs-cTnT testing (reported to ≤ 29 ng/L) assessed at 0/3 hours and followed participants for 12 months. Participants included were those presenting to metropolitan emergency departments with suspected acute coronary syndromes, without ECG evidence of coronary ischemia. The primary end point was time to all-cause death or myocardial infarction using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for clustering within hospitals.

Results

Between August 2015 and April 2019, we randomized 3378 participants, of whom 108 withdrew, resulting in 12-month follow-up for 3270 participants (masked: 1632; unmasked: 1638). Among these, 2993 (91.5%) had an initial troponin concentration of ≤ 29 ng/L. Deployment of the 0/1-hour hs-cTnT protocol was associated with reductions in functional testing. Over 12-month follow-up, there was no difference in invasive coronary angiography (0/1-hour unmasked: 232/1638 [14.2%]; 0/3-hour masked: 202/1632 [12.4%]; P = 0.13), although an increase was seen among patients with hs-cTnT levels within the masked range (0/1-hour unmasked arm: 168/1507 [11.2%]; 0/3-hour masked arm: 124/1486 [8.3%]; P = 0.010). By 12 months, all-cause death and myocardial infarction did not differ between study arms overall (0/1-hour: 82/1638 [5.0%] versus 0/3-hour: 62/1632 [3.8%]; hazard ratio, 1.32 [95% CI, 0.95–1.83]; P = 0.10). Among participants with initial troponin T concentrations ≤ 29 ng/L, unmasked hs-cTnT reporting was associated with an increase in death or myocardial infarction (0/1-hour: 55/1507 [3.7%] versus 0/3-hour: 34/1486 [2.3%]; hazard ratio, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.05–2.46]; P = 0.030).

Conclusions

Unmasked hs-cTnT reporting deployed within a 0/1-hour protocol did not reduce ischemic events over 12-month follow-up. Changes in practice associated with the implementation of this protocol may be associated with an increase in death and myocardial infarction among those with newly identified troponin elevations.

### Association of a novel protocol for rapid exclusion of myocardial infarction with resource use in a US safety net hospital [^114QPkGz]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is implementation of a novel high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T protocol in patients with chest pain associated with less resource use and within acceptable safety parameters?

Findings

This cohort study of 31 543 emergency department encounters found that implementation of the protocol was associated with a shorter length of stay in the emergency department and a higher proportion of patients discharged. There was no difference in the rate of 30-day hospitalization for myocardial infarction or death.

Meaning

This or similar protocols that rapidly rule out myocardial infarction have the potential to reduce emergency department overcrowding and improve health care quality.

### Safely identifying emergency department patients with acute chest pain for early discharge [^112TF8cU]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The HEART Pathway (history, ECG, age, risk factors, and initial troponin) is an accelerated diagnostic protocol designed to identify low-risk emergency department patients with chest pain for early discharge without stress testing or angiography. The objective of this study was to determine whether implementation of the HEART Pathway is safe (30-day death and myocardial infarction rate < 1% in low-risk patients) and effective (reduces 30-day hospitalizations) in emergency department patients with possible acute coronary syndrome.

Methods

A prospective pre-post study was conducted at 3 US sites among 8474 adult emergency department patients with possible acute coronary syndrome. Patients included were ≥ 21 years old, investigated for possible acute coronary syndrome, and had no evidence of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction on ECG. Accrual occurred for 12 months before and after HEART Pathway implementation from November 2013 to January 2016. The HEART Pathway accelerated diagnostic protocol was integrated into the electronic health record at each site as an interactive clinical decision support tool. After accelerated diagnostic protocol integration, ED providers prospectively used the HEART Pathway to identify patients with possible acute coronary syndrome as low risk (appropriate for early discharge without stress testing or angiography) or non-low risk (appropriate for further in-hospital evaluation). The primary safety and effectiveness outcomes, death, and myocardial infarction (MI) and hospitalization rates at 30 days were determined from health records, insurance claims, and death index data.

Results

Preimplementation and postimplementation cohorts included 3713 and 4761 patients, respectively. The HEART Pathway identified 30.7% as low risk; 0.4% of these patients experienced death or MI within 30 days. Hospitalization at 30 days was reduced by 6% in the postimplementation versus preimplementation cohort (55.6% versus 61.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.71–0.87). During the index visit, more MIs were detected in the postimplementation cohort (6.6% versus 5.7%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12–1.65). Rates of death or MI during follow-up were similar (1.1% versus 1.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.58–1.33).

Conclusions

HEART Pathway implementation was associated with decreased hospitalizations, increased identification of index visit MIs, and a very low death and MI rate among low-risk patients. These findings support use of the HEART Pathway to identify low-risk patients who can be safely discharged without stress testing or angiography.

### Initial presenting electrocardiogram as determinant for hospital admission in patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain: a pilot investigation [^117TL5Bx]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Evaluation of chest pain accounts for millions of costly Emergency Department (ED) visits and hospital admissions annually. Of these, approximately 10–20% are myocardial infarctions (MI).

Hypothesis

Patients with chest pain whose initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is normal do not require hospital admission for evaluation and management of a possible myocardial infarction.

Methods

The medical records of a consecutive cohort of 250 patients who presented to the ED with chest pain and were admitted by the ED physician to a cardiology inpatient service of an academic tertiary care medical center were reviewed. Reasons for admission to hospital was to rule out an acute coronary syndrome, specifically, myocardial infarction. The initial ECG of each patient was evaluated for abnormalities and compared with the final diagnosis.

Results

Of the 75 patients presenting with normal ECGs (normal, upright T waves and isoelectric ST segments), 1 (1.3%) was subsequently diagnosed with a myocardial infarction by Troponin I elevation alone. Of the 55 patients presenting with abnormal ECGs but no clear evidence of ischemia [i.e., left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), left anterior hemiblock (LAH)], 2 (3.6%) were diagnosed with MI. Of the 48 patients presenting with abnormal ECGs questionable for ischemia (nonspecific ST and T wave changes that were not clearly ST segment elevation or depression), 7 (14.6%) were diagnosed with an MI. Of the 72 patients who presented with abnormal ECGs showing ischemia (acute ST segment elevation and/or depression), 39 (54.2%) were shown to have evidence for MI.

Summary

Patients who presented with normal ECGs (category 1) were extremely low risk for acute myocardial infarction. Patients with abnormal ECGs but no evidence of definite ischemia (category 2) had a relatively low incidence of MI. Patients with abnormal ECGs questionable for ischemia (category 3) had an intermediate risk of acute myocardial infarction. The majority of patients with abnormal ECGs demonstrating ischemia (category 4) were subsequently shown to evolve an acute myocardial infarction.

Conclusions

Patients with chest pain and initial ECGs with ST segment abnormalities suggestive or diagnostic for ischemia, should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Patients with ECGs that do not display acute ST segment changes are at a lower risk for acute myocardial infarction than those with acute ST segment changes and should be admitted on the basis of cardiac risk profile. (i.e., age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, known coronary artery disease, etc.) Patients with normal ECGs (category 1) are at extremely low risk, and it may be acceptable to consider further evaluation on an outpatient basis.

### Using historical cardiac troponins to identify patients at a high risk of myocardial infarction [^111Fqo8f]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays in clinical practice has improved the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) in emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain. Several hs-cTn-based algorithms for risk stratification exist, which help clinicians to triage patients towards rule-in or rule-out already at first presentation. Current guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) for the management of patients with a suspected non-ST segment acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) recommend the use of a 0-and-1-hour algorithm which identifies patients with an admission hs-cTnT concentration of ≥ 52 ng/L as having a high risk of MI, among whom prompt management and treatment are required.

Hs-cTnT measurements from prior visits are often available in patients presenting to the ED with symptoms suggestive of an acute MI. The clinical usefulness of incorporating previous hs-cTnT measurements is unclear, but merits further attention as they could potentially help to improve identification of patients who are at a high risk of MI.

Using a large cohort of patients with a primary report of chest pain in the ED, we sought to investigate if the change between a historical hs-cTnT concentration and the admission hs-cTnT could be used to improve early risk stratification for an evolving MI.

Acute coronary syndromes — ECG acquisition and repeat strategy emphasize that timely acquisition of an ECG is imperative in patients with a goal to obtain and interpret an ECG by a trained clinician within 10 minutes of presentation. An initial nondiagnostic 12-lead ECG does not "rule out" or exclude ACS, and a nondiagnostic ECG should be compared to prior ECGs, and a repeat ECG should be obtained during the ED course to assess for evolving changes; right-sided leads should be obtained in patients with a concern for inferior STEMI to evaluate for right ventricular involvement. In NCDR ACTION, 11% of patients ultimately diagnosed with STEMI had an initial ECG that was nondiagnostic, and 72.4% of those patients had a follow-up ECG diagnostic of STEMI within 90 minutes of their initial ECG.

### Acute coronary syndrome: current treatment… [^113Sp978]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

4 At the community level, local areas should create and maintain emergency medical service systems that support STEMI care. Initial care should include a full assessment of clinical symptoms and coronary artery disease risk factors, as well as 12-lead electrocardiography. Electrocardiographic findings that may reflect myocardial ischemia include changes in the PR segment, QRS complex, and the ST segment. 1 Part of the initial assessment also involves obtaining cardiac biomarkers that include troponin. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention is the recommended reperfusion method; therefore, all efforts should be made to transfer a patient with suspected STEMI to a PCI-capable hospital. If none is available within a 30-minute travel time, medical management should occur in the nearest emergency department. The goal of medical management is to administer fibrinolytic therapy within 30 minutes of first medical contact.
4.

Reperfusion Therapy After STEMI has been identified, the most appropriate strategy for reperfusion should be determined quickly. Reperfusion therapy should be administered to eligible patients with STEMI and symptom onset within the previous 12 hours. However, this comparative benefit is lost if treatment is delayed, which may occur if a patient's first medical contact is at a non–PCI-capable facility. Thus, emphasis should be placed on rapid reperfusion, regardless of strategy. In patients with STEMI who undergo PCI, the recommended goals for first medical contact to device time are 90 minutes for persons presenting to a PCI-capable hospital and 120 minutes for those presenting to a non–PCI-capable facility.
4. 4 Even in the absence of shock or heart failure in patients with evidence of failed reperfusion or reocclusion, urgent transfer for angiography is recommended. Evidence of failed reperfusion includes lack of resolution of ST elevation and persistent or recurrent chest pain.

Routine transfer to a PCI-capable hospital for angiography after successful fibrinolysis has been shown to improve outcomes in multiple trials and is recommended, ideally within 24 hours of fibrinolysis. 4, 9–12. 5 Patients can be categorized by risk factors and clinical stability into early invasive or ischemia-guided strategies. An early invasive strategy — diagnostic angiography followed by revascularization, as appropriate — is indicated for stabilized patients who are at high risk of coronary events, whereas an ischemia-guided approach is indicated for stabilized patients with lower risk scores and is based on patient and physician preferences.
