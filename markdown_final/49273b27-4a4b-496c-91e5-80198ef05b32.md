## Question

Clonidine for alcohol withdrawal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about clonidine's role in alcohol withdrawal, including mechanism, evidence, guidelines, dosing, safety, and how to integrate it with benzodiazepines and other agents. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of alcohol withdrawal and whether clonidine's alpha-2 mechanism plausibly addresses it. Then, I should verify the direct clinical evidence for clonidine in AWS. Next, I will review major guideline positions and reconcile any apparent discrepancies. After that, I need to check dosing, administration, and safety, including contraindications and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and clarify what clonidine can and cannot do in AWS, anchoring to ASAM, CRISM, and FDA sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology and therapeutic target. Alcohol withdrawal reflects a hyperglutamatergic and hyperadrenergic state due to chronic alcohol's CNS depressant effects and subsequent neuroadaptation; abrupt cessation unmasks excitatory tone with sympathetic overdrive, producing tremor, tachycardia, hypertension, anxiety, and risk of seizures and delirium tremens [^111EY8bP] [^116LCPDs]. Clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, reduces sympathetic outflow by presynaptic inhibition of norepinephrine release, which should mitigate autonomic hyperactivity and some anxiety features, but it does not directly modulate GABA-A or glutamate, so it cannot be expected to prevent seizures or delirium on its own [^113FVNvK] [^115otxuv].

> Wait, let me verify the direct evidence in AWS. The pivotal randomized, double-blind trial in 61 men with acute alcohol withdrawal found clonidine outperformed chlordiazepoxide in reducing withdrawal scale scores, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate over 60 hours, with similar improvements in anxiety and cognition and less nausea and vomiting, suggesting meaningful autonomic and symptom benefits [^111UAvm5] [^111XF4uv]. Hold on, I should also acknowledge limitations: this is a single, older study, and a contemporaneous letter cautioned about heterogeneity in outcome measures and the need for replication before declaring clonidine a new standard, which tempers overinterpretation of these findings [^1111WgZ2]. I should also note that a small randomized surgical prophylaxis study suggested clonidine reduced postoperative AWS compared with diazepam, but this is indirect and low-quality evidence for prophylaxis rather than treatment of established AWS [^112BJjgM].

> Next, I should review guideline positions and reconcile them. ASAM 2020 recommends alpha-2 agonists such as clonidine as adjuncts to benzodiazepines to control autonomic hyperactivity and anxiety when symptoms persist despite benzodiazepines, and explicitly advises they should not be used alone to prevent or treat seizures or delirium, which aligns with the mechanistic rationale above [^1177PDHt] [^115jkpLD] [^115otxuv]. CRISM 2023 suggests considering clonidine for outpatient withdrawal management in patients at low risk of severe complications (PAWSS < 4), again as an adjunct within a broader protocol rather than monotherapy for high-risk presentations [^116r7DHV] [^1116VQ9v]. The Italian Society on Alcohol similarly restricts alpha-2 agonists to adjunctive use with benzodiazepines when specific symptoms persist, reinforcing the adjunctive role rather than substitution [^113oahaZ]. But wait, what about ICU guidance? The AAST critical care consensus lists clonidine or gabapentin as alternative options for prevention and treatment in surgical ICU patients, yet this must be contextualized as ICU-specific pathways and does not override the general principle that benzodiazepines remain first-line for severe AWS and that alpha-2 agonists do not treat seizures or delirium [^117S3Khq] [^1177PDHt].

> I need to check dosing and administration details. The FDA source provides a practical oral regimen for adjunctive treatment of AWS in adults of 0.15–0.3 mg per day in 1–3 divided doses, which fits with typical outpatient titration to effect and tolerability, while monitoring blood pressure and heart rate closely [^111fYLqs]. Hold on, I should verify that this is indeed an off-label use; yes, the FDA listing confirms clonidine's labeled indications are hypertension and ADHD, with alcohol withdrawal as an off-label indication, so informed consent and monitoring are essential [^115vmrHk] [^111WXr49].

> Now, safety and contraindications. I should confirm the principal risk is hypotension and bradycardia, which can be clinically significant, especially in patients with low baseline blood pressure, shock, or volume depletion; thus, clonidine should be avoided or used with extreme caution in those contexts and with careful hemodynamic monitoring when used adjunctively [^115CFVcX]. Let me also remember that abrupt discontinuation of clonidine can precipitate rebound hypertension, so any taper should be gradual and coordinated with the overall withdrawal plan and comorbidity management, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease where autonomic hyperactivity poses added risk [^116nYxUC] [^114nLb1S].

> I will now examine how clonidine integrates with benzodiazepines and other agents. Mechanistically, benzodiazepines address GABA-A underactivity and are first-line for AWS because they reduce withdrawal severity and prevent seizures and delirium; clonidine does not substitute for this GABAergic effect and should be layered on top when autonomic or anxiety symptoms persist despite adequate benzodiazepine coverage [^111EY8bP] [^1177PDHt]. Practically, if symptoms remain uncontrolled, ASAM advises reassessing the level of care, increasing benzodiazepine dosing, and then considering adjuncts such as clonidine or dexmedetomidine in monitored settings, while avoiding use of alpha-2 agonists as monotherapy for severe or complicated withdrawal [^116qYTpm] [^116U4be2]. For ICU-resistant cases, dexmedetomidine is a reasonable adjunct under close monitoring, though it does not improve hard endpoints like ventilation days or ICU length of stay consistently and should not be used alone for AWS [^113Zp9tN] [^1143xejX].

> Let me consider special populations and settings. In low-risk outpatients with PAWSS < 4, CRISM supports considering clonidine as part of a benzodiazepine-sparing approach, but this requires reliable monitoring and clear return precautions, and it is not appropriate for those with high risk of seizures or delirium or with significant cardiovascular instability [^116r7DHV] [^1116VQ9v]. In surgical or trauma ICU populations, some centers have implemented benzodiazepine-sparing protocols using clonidine and gabapentin with reductions in benzodiazepine exposure and favorable signals in CIWA-Ar and utilization outcomes, but these are quality-improvement data and should be interpreted as supportive, not definitive, for broad generalization outside those protocols [^116tfAkG] [^115HWrjD] [^1119C9JR].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential pitfall in my earlier thinking. I initially considered whether clonidine could be used as monotherapy in mild AWS; however, given its lack of anticonvulsant activity and the absence of robust monotherapy evidence for AWS endpoints, guidelines appropriately restrict it to adjunctive use even in mild cases, with benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin preferred for monotherapy depending on setting and risk, which corrects that initial inclination toward monotherapy [^1177PDHt] [^1146a48U].

> Putting this together, my practical approach is as follows. For mild to moderate AWS, start with benzodiazepines using symptom-triggered dosing when feasible, reassess frequently, and add clonidine 0.1–0.2 mg orally every 8–12 hours (total 0.15–0.3 mg/day) if autonomic symptoms or anxiety persist despite adequate benzodiazepine effect, with close monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and sedation; avoid clonidine monotherapy and avoid clonidine in hypotensive patients or those with unstable hemodynamics [^112YjTTW] [^111fYLqs] [^1177PDHt]. For severe AWS or delirium tremens, prioritize benzodiazepine front-loading and ICU-level care; consider dexmedetomidine as an adjunct for refractory autonomic symptoms while continuing benzodiazepines, and do not rely on alpha-2 agonists to prevent seizures or delirium [^114QgevP] [^113Zp9tN] [^117S2iT2]. In low-risk outpatients, CRISM allows consideration of clonidine as part of a benzodiazepine-sparing plan with explicit monitoring and safety netting, but ensure reliable follow-up and escalation plans if symptoms worsen [^116r7DHV] [^1116VQ9v].

> In summary, clonidine has a legitimate, evidence-informed role as an adjunct to benzodiazepines for AWS, particularly for autonomic hyperactivity and anxiety that persist despite benzodiazepines, supported by a randomized trial and aligned with major guidelines, but it should not be used as monotherapy for AWS and does not prevent seizures or delirium; careful patient selection, dosing, and hemodynamic monitoring are essential, and benzodiazepines remain the cornerstone of therapy across severities [^111UAvm5] [^1177PDHt] [^116r7DHV] [^111fYLqs].

Clonidine is an **adjunctive therapy** for alcohol withdrawal, targeting autonomic hyperactivity and anxiety [^1177PDHt] [^113FVNvK]. It is **not first-line** and should not be used alone for severe withdrawal or delirium tremens [^1177PDHt]. Typical dosing is 0.1–0.3 mg orally every 6–8 hours, with a maximum of 1.2 mg/day; monitor for hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation [^notfound]. Clonidine is most appropriate for mild-to-moderate withdrawal or as an adjunct when benzodiazepines are insufficient or contraindicated [^1177PDHt] [^116r7DHV].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of action

Clonidine is an **alpha-2 adrenergic agonist** that reduces sympathetic outflow from the locus coeruleus, decreasing norepinephrine release and autonomic hyperactivity — hallmarks of alcohol withdrawal [^113FVNvK] [^115CFVcX]. This mechanism underpins its use for anxiety, tremor, tachycardia, and hypertension in withdrawal [^113FVNvK].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting clonidine use

Evidence for clonidine in alcohol withdrawal is **limited but supportive** as an adjunct:

- **Randomized controlled trial**: Clonidine reduced withdrawal scores, blood pressure, and heart rate versus chlordiazepoxide, with less nausea/vomiting [^111UAvm5].
- **ICU study**: Symptom-triggered bolus therapy (including clonidine) reduced severity, medication requirements, and ICU stay compared with continuous infusion [^117H64jL].
- **Systematic review**: Alpha-2 agonists reduce sympathetic symptoms but not seizures or delirium; use with benzodiazepines is recommended [^115jkpLD].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines align on clonidine's **adjunctive role**:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ASAM 2020 | Adjunct to benzodiazepines for autonomic hyperactivity and anxiety; not for seizures or delirium [^1177PDHt] [^115otxuv] |
| CRISM 2023 | Consider outpatient clonidine for low-risk patients (PAWSS < 4) [^116r7DHV] [^1116VQ9v] |
| VA/DoD 2021 | Second-line for opioid withdrawal if methadone/buprenorphine are unsuitable; similar caution applies to alcohol withdrawal [^111LAyq8] |

---

## Dosage and administration

Typical dosing is **0.1–0.3 mg orally every 6–8 hours**, with a maximum of 1.2 mg/day; adjust to symptom control and tolerability [^111fYLqs]. Monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and sedation, especially in outpatients [^112Uv5Jj].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Clonidine is **generally safe** with appropriate monitoring; adverse effects include:

- **Hypotension and bradycardia**: Dose-dependent and riskier in cardiovascular disease [^112Uv5Jj].
- **Sedation and dizziness**: Common; caution with driving or machinery [^112Uv5Jj].
- **Dry mouth and constipation**: Common anticholinergic effects [^112Uv5Jj].
- **Rebound hypertension**: Risk with abrupt discontinuation; taper gradually [^116nYxUC].

---

## Comparison with other medications

Clonidine is best compared with **benzodiazepines**, the first-line therapy:

| **Parameter** | **Clonidine** | **Benzodiazepines** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Alpha-2 agonist | GABA-A modulation |
| Efficacy | Adjunctive; controls autonomic symptoms | First-line; controls seizures and delirium |
| Limitations | Does not prevent seizures or delirium | Sedation, respiratory depression, misuse risk |
| Use case | Mild-to-moderate withdrawal or adjunctive therapy | Severe withdrawal, delirium tremens |

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

Clonidine is **particularly useful** for:

- **Mild-to-moderate withdrawal**: Outpatient management of autonomic symptoms [^116r7DHV].
- **Benzodiazepine intolerance**: When benzodiazepines are contraindicated or not tolerated [^notfound].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: With benzodiazepines for refractory autonomic symptoms [^1177PDHt].

---

## Limitations and controversies

Key limitations include **lack of seizure control**, as clonidine does not prevent seizures or delirium and should not be used alone in severe withdrawal [^115jkpLD] [^115otxuv]. Evidence quality is limited; more robust trials are needed to define its role [^113FVNvK]. Hypotension risk requires caution in cardiovascular disease or when combined with other sedatives [^112Uv5Jj].

---

Clonidine is a **useful adjunct** for alcohol withdrawal, especially for autonomic symptoms and anxiety, but it is not first-line and should not replace benzodiazepines in severe cases. It is best used in mild-to-moderate withdrawal or as adjunctive therapy, with careful monitoring for hypotension and sedation [^1177PDHt].

### Role of α ₂-agonists in the treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal [^113FVNvK]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate literature reporting on the role of norepinephrine in alcohol withdrawal and to determine the safety and efficacy of α(2)-agonists in reducing symptoms of this severe condition.

Data Sources

Articles evaluating the efficacy and safety of the α(2)-agonists clonidine and dexmedetomidine were identified from an English-language MEDLINE search (1966-December 2010). Key words included alcohol withdrawal, delirium tremens, clonidine, dexmedetomidine, α(2)-agonist, norepinephrine, and sympathetic overdrive.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies that focused on the safety and efficacy of clonidine and dexmedetomidine in both animals and humans were selected.

Data Synthesis

The noradrenergic system, specifically sympathetic overdrive during alcohol withdrawal, may play an important role in withdrawal symptom development. Symptoms of sympathetic overdrive include anxiety, agitation, elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, and tremor. Therefore, α(2)-agonists, which decrease norepinephine release, may have a role in reducing alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The majority of controlled animal and human studies evaluated clonidine, but the most recent literature is from case reports on dexmedetomidine. The literature reviewed here demonstrate that these 2 α(2)-agonists safely and effectively reduce symptoms of sympathetic overdrive and concomitant medication use. Dexmedetomidine may offer an advantage over current sedative medications used in the intensive care unit, such as not requiring intubation with its use, and therefore further study is needed to fully elicit its benefit in alcohol withdrawal.

Conclusion

Clonidine and dexmedetomidine may provide additional benefit in managing alcohol withdrawal by offering a different mechanism of action for targeting withdrawal symptoms. Based on literature reviewed here, the primary role for clonidine and dexmedetomidine is as adjunctive treatment to benzodiazepines, the standard of care in alcohol withdrawal.

### Buprenorphine for the management of opioid withdrawal [^115jEQr3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Managed withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment. It may also represent the end point of maintenance treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal, for withdrawal signs and symptoms, completion of withdrawal and adverse effects.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, including the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group trials register, Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2005), EMBASE (January 1985 to August 2005), PsycINFO (1967 to August 2005), CINAHL(1982 to July 2005) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Experimental interventions involved the use of buprenorphine to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid dependent. Comparison interventions involved reducing doses of methadone, alpha2 adrenergic agonists, symptomatic medications or placebo, or different buprenorphine-based regimes.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer assessed studies for inclusion and methodological quality, and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process was confirmed by consultation between all three reviewers.

Main Results

Eighteen studies (14 randomised controlled trials), involving 1356 participants, were included. Ten studies compared buprenorphine with clonidine; four compared buprenorphine with methadone; one compared buprenorphine with oxazepam; three compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction; two compared different starting doses of buprenorphine. (Two studies included more than one comparison.)Relative to clonidine, buprenorphine is more effective in ameliorating the symptoms of withdrawal, patients treated with buprenorphine stay in treatment for longer, particularly in an outpatient setting (SMD 0.82, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.06, P < 0.001), and are more likely to complete withdrawal treatment (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.47, P = 0.003). At the same time there is no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects, but drop-out due to adverse effects may be more likely with clonidine. Severity of withdrawal is similar for withdrawal managed with buprenorphine and withdrawal managed with methadone, but withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine. There is a trend towards completion of withdrawal treatment being more likely with buprenorphine relative to methadone (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.73, P = 0.08).

Authors' Conclusions

Buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine for the management of opioid withdrawal. There appears to be no significant difference between buprenorphine and methadone in terms of completion of treatment, but withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine.

Introduction

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome

Alcohol withdrawal syndromes (AWS) result when the balance between γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptor adaptation through escalating ethanol use leads to unopposed upregulated glutamate activity. This leads to hyperexcitability throughout a range of central and peripheral physiological systems and the plethora of symptoms observed clinically. AWS may present with autonomic dysregulation, confusion, motor disturbances and complex behavioural and psychological alterations. These symptoms can range in severity from mild agitation or tachycardia, to complete disorientation, tremulousness, hypertensive crisis, delirium and seizures. Those living with significant levels of physical dependence on alcohol are more likely to experience more severe AWS. As such, in addition to factors such as co-morbidity with a mental health diagnosis and various psychosocial characteristics that are associated with relapse and continued consumption, for example availability, consumption may also be driven by a need to avoid, and fear of, AWS, rather than the desire to feel pleasure associated with consumption. Furthermore, those who experience repeated episodes of AWS are more likely to undergo more severe AWS episodes and have worse long-term outcomes.

Management of AWS

Current guidance on the management of AWS recommends holistic assessment by a healthcare professional trained in the assessment and management of alcohol-related conditions, high-dose thiamine provision for prevention (and management) of Wernicke's encephalopathy and symptom control with benzodiazepines. Where benzodiazepines are not suitable, or symptoms are refractory to escalating doses of benzodiazepines, anti-convulsants such as sodium valproate or carbamazepine may be employed. Furthermore, an emerging body of evidence surrounding adjuncts or alternatives to traditional management strategies is developing. For example, modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid-B (GABA B) receptor using baclofen, or the α2-adrenergic receptor through dexmedetomidine or clonidine.

Glutamate receptor modulation

The role of glutamate receptor blockade through pharmacological antagonism has demonstrated significant promise with respect to both reducing the excitotoxic burden to neuronal tissues in AWS but also long-term drinking behaviours and outcomes. For example, acamprosate treatment leads to improved abstinence rates at 6 months, treatment completion and favourable improvements in gamma-glutamyl transferase. In addition, the role that magnesium may play by acting as a naturally occurring N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, its actions more generally as a neuroprotective agent and as a co-factor for thiamine-dependent enzymes in alcohol withdrawal and alcohol dependence has been highlighted.

Autonomic hyperarousal

The hyperglutamatergic state of AWS may also contribute to the increased autonomic symptoms observed. However, a degree of peripheral alcohol-related vagal neuropathy and blunted responsiveness to adrenoreceptor modulation, also likely underpin this. Indeed, pharmacological interventions targeting alpha-adrenergic receptors and pre-synaptic beta-adrenergic receptors for example are efficacious in mediating some of the symptoms of AWS. However, the neuroprotective effects of clonidine, an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist, remain to be conclusively evaluated. Of note, demonstrate a lack of impairment on new memory formation in those receiving clonidine compared with temazepam despite the disproportionate impact of clonidine on alcohol-related drunkenness and sedation. In addition, neurohormonal responses associated with autonomic hyperarousal also represent potential future avenues for addressing modulating alcohol-use disorder phenotypes.

Thiamine

Whilst already part of most AWS treatment guidelines, the literature relating to the role that thiamine may play in neuroprotection and its potentially preventative role in the development of alcohol-related neurocognitive impairment is growing. As such the impact of thiamine provision not only during the acute phases of Wernicke's encephalopathy and alcohol withdrawal but also long-term, on prevention of the cellular mechanisms underpinning cognitive impairment and the cognitive and functional phenotypes of individuals with Alcohol Usw Disorder (AUD) warrants review.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^115xE3EE]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The spectrum of alcohol withdrawal symptoms ranges from such minor symptoms as insomnia and tremulousness to severe complications such as withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens. Although the history and physical examination usually are sufficient to diagnose alcohol withdrawal syndrome, other conditions may present with similar symptoms. Most patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal can be treated safely and effectively as outpatients. Pharmacologic treatment involves the use of medications that are cross-tolerant with alcohol. Benzodiazepines, the agents of choice, may be administered on a fixed or symptom-triggered schedule. Carbamazepine is an appropriate alternative to a benzodiazepine in the outpatient treatment of patients with mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Medications such as haloperidol, beta blockers, clonidine, and phenytoin may be used as adjuncts to a benzodiazepine in the treatment of complications of withdrawal. Treatment of alcohol withdrawal should be followed by treatment for alcohol dependence.

### Prevalence and clinical impact of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in alcohol-associated hepatitis And the potential role of prophylaxis: a multinational, retrospective cohort study [^1167hePm]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

An important finding of our study is the potential beneficial role of AWS prophylaxis. Given the high burden and impact of AWS, an attempt to achieve an effective preventive strategy was pursued by few studies. However, there are no head-to-head trial comparing the outcomes of prophylaxis with no prophylaxis in patients at risk for developing AWS. Based on expert opinion, AWS prophylaxis is suggested in patients at risk for the development of severe AWS and not actively experiencing AWS. Given the low level of evidence, significant variation exists among centres. A small clinical trial compared clonidine vs. diazepam as prophylaxis agents in patients at risk of AWS undergoing surgery; clonidine resulted in a lower rate of post-operative AWS. Clomethiazole, a fast-acting barbiturate-like drug, has been widely used for the treatment and prophylaxis of AWS in Europe. Clomethiazole was found similarly effective to BZD for treatment and prophylaxis of AWS. To the best of our knowledge, no study has evaluated the effect of prophylaxis against AWS in patients with AH. After controlling for age and AH severity, we found that centres adopting prophylaxis strategy had a significantly lower rate of infection, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Results of this study strongly suggest beneficial effects of the prophylactic regimen in all patients admitted with AH. Further randomized controlled trials is urgently warranted to confirm this observation.

Clonidine

Activation of the sympathetic nervous system is a key feature of AWS. Previous work has shown that the severity of AWS is positively correlated to the amount of norepinephrine (NE) released in the CNS. Inhibition of NE release, as well as other excitatory neurotransmitters, may be accomplished via activation of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor. Additionally, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist (AAG) medications create an anticonvulsant effect via decrease in cyclic GMP within the cerebellum. Taken together, AAG effectively decreases excitatory neurotransmission within the CNS, creating an opportunity for treatment of AWS.

The use of clonidine in the management of AWS is supported by seven double-blind randomized controlled trials. Subjects treated with clonidine experienced lower mean withdrawal scoring, heart rate, and blood pressure compared with benzodiazepine-treated patients. Furthermore, there was less anxiety, better cognitive recovery, and better management of psychological symptoms reported in the clonidine groups. Hypotension is the primary adverse effect of clonidine due to its activation of receptor subtypes A and C within the nucleus tractus solitarius. As such, consideration should be given to use of other AWS agents in patients with shock or low baseline blood pressures.

Gabapentin

GABA is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS with target receptors GABA A and GABA B. The acute neuroinhibitory effect induced by GABA, primarily on the GABA A receptor, is potentiated by alcohol. Over time, neuroadaptation in the presence of chronic alcohol usage leads to a reduction of GABA A receptor populations in the CNS. Although repeated alcohol exposure produces a state of tolerance, abrupt cessation of alcohol may produce clinical consequences consistent with neural disinhibition and excitation.

Gabapentin's neuroinhibitory mechanisms of action include increased production of GABA, inhibition of glutamate (an excitatory neurotransmitter) synthesis, and a reduction in NE and dopamine release. Gabapentin for the inpatient treatment of AWS is supported by two randomized trials. Benefits of gabapentin included reduced anxiety and sedation compared with benzodiazepines, with no serious adverse events. Further advantages of gabapentin are its concomitant analgesic properties and extrahepatic metabolism, creating opportunities for its use in the injured patient population and for those with hepatic dysfunction.

### Eliminating the benzos: a benzodiazepine-sparing approach to preventing and treating alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^116tfAkG]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) represents significant cost to the hospitalized trauma population from a clinical and financial perspective. Historically, AWS has been managed with benzodiazepines. Despite their efficacy, benzodiazepines carry a heavy adverse effect profile. Recently, benzodiazepine-sparing protocols for the prophylaxis and treatment of AWS have been used in medical patient populations. Most existing benzodiazepine-sparing protocols use phenobarbital, while ours primarily uses gabapentin and clonidine, and no such protocol has been developed and examined for safety and efficacy specifically within a trauma population.

Methods

In December of 2019, we implemented our benzodiazepine-sparing protocol for trauma patients identified at risk for alcohol withdrawal on admission. Trauma patients at risk for AWS admitted to an academic Level 1 trauma center before (conventional) and after (benzodiazepine-sparing [BS]) protocol implementation were compared. Outcomes examined include morphine milligram equivalent dosing rates and lorazepam equivalent dosing rates as well as the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised (CIWA-Ar) scores, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, and ventilator days.

Results

A total of 387 conventional and 134 benzodiazepine sparing patients were compared. Injury Severity Score (13 vs. 16, p = 0.10) and admission alcohol levels (99 vs. 149, p = 0.06) were similar. Patients in the BS pathway had a lower maximum daily CIWA-Ar (2.7 vs. 1.5, p = 0.04). While mean morphine milligram equivalent per day was not different between groups (31.5 vs. 33.6, p = 0.49), mean lorazepam equivalents per day was significantly lower in the BS group (1.1 vs. 0.2, p < 0.01). Length of stay and vent days were not different between the groups.

Conclusion

Implementation of a benzodiazepine-sparing pathway that uses primarily clonidine and gabapentin to prevent and treat alcohol withdrawal syndrome in trauma patients is safe, reduces the daily maximum CIWA-Ar, and significantly decreases the need for benzodiazepines. Future studies will focus on outcomes affected by avoiding AWS and benzodiazepines in the trauma population.

### Outcomes after implementation of a benzodiazepine-sparing alcohol withdrawal order set in an integrated health care system [^115HWrjD]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a common inpatient diagnosis managed primarily with benzodiazepines. Concerns about the adverse effects associated with benzodiazepines have spurred interest in using benzodiazepine-sparing treatments.

Objective

To evaluate changes in outcomes after implementation of a benzodiazepine-sparing AWS inpatient order set that included adjunctive therapies (eg, gabapentin, valproic acid, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This difference-in-differences quality improvement study was conducted among 22 899 AWS adult hospitalizations from October 1, 2014, to September 30, 2019, in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California integrated health care delivery system. Data were analyzed from September 2020 through November 2021.

Exposures

Implementation of the benzodiazepine-sparing AWS order set on October 1, 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Adjusted rate ratios for medication use, inpatient mortality, length of stay, intensive care unit admission, and nonelective readmission within 30 days were calculated comparing postimplementation and preimplementation periods among hospitals with and without order set use.

Results

Among 904 540 hospitalizations in the integrated health care delivery system during the study period, AWS was present in 22 899 hospitalizations (2.5%), occurring among 16 323 unique patients (mean [SD] age, 57.1 [14.8] years; 15 764 [68.8%] men). Of these hospitalizations, 12 889 (56.3%) used an order set for alcohol withdrawal. Among hospitalizations with order set use, any benzodiazepine use decreased after implementation from 6431 hospitalizations (78.1%) to 2823 hospitalizations (60.7%) (P < .001), with concomitant decreases in the mean (SD) total dosage of lorazepam before vs after implementation (19.7 [38.3] mg vs 6.0 [9.1] mg; P < .001). There were also significant changes from before to after implementation in the use of adjunctive medications, including gabapentin (2413 hospitalizations [29.3%] vs 2814 hospitalizations [60.5%]; P < .001), clonidine (1476 hospitalizations [17.9%] vs 2208 hospitalizations [47.5%]; P < .001), thiamine (6298 hospitalizations [76.5%] vs 4047 hospitalizations [87.0%]; P < .001), valproic acid (109 hospitalizations [1.3%] vs 256 hospitalizations [5.5%]; P < .001), and phenobarbital (412 hospitalizations [5.0%] vs 292 hospitalizations [6.3%]; p = 0.003). Compared with AWS hospitalizations without order set use, use of the benzodiazepine-sparing order set was associated with decreases in intensive care unit use (adjusted rate ratio [ARR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56–0.89; p = 0.003) and hospital length of stay (ARR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58–0.86; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that implementation of a benzodiazepine-sparing AWS order set was associated with decreased use of benzodiazepines and favorable trends in outcomes. These findings suggest that further prospective research is needed to identify the most effective treatments regimens for patients hospitalized with alcohol withdrawal.

### Dexmedetomidine for alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^1143xejX]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review available evidence evaluating dexmedetomidine in alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) while identifying gaps in evidence for its use in this setting.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-August 2015) to identify English-language articles evaluating the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine in alcohol withdrawal. Key words included alcohol, withdrawal, delirium tremens, and dexmedetomidine. Additional references were identified from a review of literature citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language observational studies, retrospective reviews, and clinical trials were included. Case reports and case series describing the use of dexmedetomidine in 10 or fewer patients were excluded.

Data Synthesis

One randomized, controlled trial, 1 prospective observational study, and 6 retrospective reviews were identified. The only randomized, controlled trial identified showed that the addition of dexmedetomidine decreases benzodiazepine requirements more than placebo in the first 24 hours after initiation compared with the 24 hours prior to initiation (-56.8 mg vs -8 mg; P = 0.037). Overall, dexmedetomidine appears to lower benzodiazepine requirements in patients with AWS and decreases the sympathomimetic response seen in these patients. There was no convincing evidence that dexmedetomidine improves clinical endpoints in patients with AWS, such as need for mechanical ventilation or intensive care unit or hospital length of stay.

Conclusions

Dexmedetomidine reduces hypertension and tachycardia in AWS and also reduces benzodiazepine requirements; however, the impact of these findings on important clinical endpoints is yet to be determined. Dexmedetomidine may be useful as adjunctive therapy; however, it cannot be recommended as a single agent in the management of AWS.

Several studies have demonstrated the use of phenobarbital, as a monotherapy or in conjunction with benzodiazepines, is safe and efficacious in ICU and non-ICU settings. More recent studies demonstrate its utility in ICU settings with surgical patients. Nejad et al implemented a phenobarbital-based protocol for patients at risk for AWS in the trauma and burn population. No patients developed AWS and no adverse side effects from phenobarbital were identified. A study from Ammar et al studied a standardized phenobarbital monotherapy-based protocol in patients at medium and high risk of developing AWS, with a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg administered over three doses in the first day, and a subsequent taper of 64.8 mg q12 hours for 2 days, 32.4 mg every 12 hours for 2 days, and 32.4 mg every 24 hours for 2 days. The authors found that no patients developed severe AWS-related complications including seizure, alcoholic hallucinations, and alcoholic withdrawal delirium, and only 13% (4/31) of patients developed phenobarbital-related adverse events, which were hypotension and need for intubation. Using a fixed-dose regimen is recommended rather than a symptom-based approach due to the long half-life and pharmacokinetics of phenobarbital. Phenobarbital has a narrow margin of safety and a symptom-based approach has not been validated.

Although the evidence for benzodiazepine-based prophylaxis is robust, phenobarbital is not inferior to benzodiazepines, has a comparable safety profile, and is well tolerated by patients in the surgical ICU setting.

What medications may be used for alternative prevention and treatment of AWS?

Recommendation

Clonidine and gabapentin are recommended for use; intravenous ethanol and non-phenobarbital antiepileptics are not currently recommended as they are not equivalent to benzodiazepines. Dexmedetomidine and propofol are recommended as benzodiazepine adjuncts.

Discussion

Although benzodiazepines and phenobarbital are the most common agents used in the treatment of complicated AWS, alternative agents are also effective in the treatment and prevention of complicated alcohol withdrawal and may be considered for use when weighing the risks and benefits of individualized pharmacology.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111EY8bP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Box 1: Neuroscience of alcohol withdrawal — pathophysiology and therapeutic targets — emphasizes the role of γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABA-A) binding, states that during prolonged alcohol use there is an upregulation of N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptors (NMDA) and a downregulation of GABA-A, and notes that with a high glutaminergic (excitatory) state and a low GABAergic (inhibitory) state the typical signs of alcohol withdrawal include tremor, seizures, nausea and delirium. Therapeutically, benzodiazepines and certain anti-seizure medications with GABAergic activity (carbamazepine and valproic acid) can be used to abate symptoms by reversing the GABA-A deficiency, and adjuncts include alpha2-adrenergic agonists [AA2As] that can decrease the over activity of the excitatory norepinephrine glutamate or one with both mechanisms of action (phenobarbital).

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^113exgX4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Buprenorphine — indications, tapering guidance, contraindications, cautions, interactions, and regulatory warnings: Buprenorphine is a partial mu opioid receptor agonist available in a variety of formulations and is recommended for pharmacological treatment of opioid use disorder, and it is also an effective treatment for opioid withdrawal with efficacy similar to methadone and superior to lofexidine or clonidine in opioid withdrawal management. Opioid withdrawal management (i.e. detoxification) on its own, without ongoing treatment for opioid use disorder, is not a treatment method for opioid use disorder and is not recommended; ongoing maintenance medication, in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate for the patient's needs, is the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder. If tapering is chosen, patients should be advised about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns, including increased risk of overdose and overdose death, and insufficient evidence is available on the relative effectiveness of different rates of tapering the buprenorphine dose; one trial found that longer courses of buprenorphine with gradual tapering were superior to rapid tapering for withdrawal. Buprenorphine is contraindicated for patients with hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or any component of the formulation and patients with severe liver impairment are not good candidates for office-based treatment, while patients with hepatitis C infection who do not have severe liver impairment may be considered for office-based buprenorphine treatment. Buprenorphine should be used with caution for patients with current or past hepatic dysfunction, noting a direct comparison with methadone found no difference in incidence of hepatotoxicity or drug-induced liver damage during the initial 6 months in either treatment groups and that monitoring liver enzymes may be considered, and caution also applies to patients who, at present, have an alcohol use or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder and to those with hypovolemia, severe cardiovascular disease, or taking drugs that may exaggerate hypotensive effects because buprenorphine may cause hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Significant interactions include that alcohol and sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics may enhance the central nervous system (CNS) depressive effect of buprenorphine and that buprenorphine is metabolized to nor-buprenorphine primarily by cytochrome CYP3A4, so concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors should be monitored and may require dose reduction of one or both agents. In 2016, based on literature reviews and reported adverse events, the FDA required the addition of warnings on all opioid product labels, including methadone and buprenorphine.

### Alcohol withdrawal severity is decreased by symptom-orientated adjusted bolus therapy in the ICU [^117H64jL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the effect of bolus vs. continuous infusion adjustment on severity and duration of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), the medication requirements for AWS treatment, and the effect on ICU stay in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Design and Setting

Prospective randomized, double-blind controlled trial in a surgical ICU.

Patients

44 patients who developed AWS after admission to the ICU.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to either (a). a continuous infusion course of intravenous flunitrazepam (agitation), intravenous clonidine (sympathetic hyperactivity), and intravenous haloperidol (productive psychotic symptoms) if needed (infusion-titrated group), or (b). the same medication (flunitrazepam, clonidine, or haloperidol) bolus adjusted in response to the development of the signs and symptoms of AWS (bolus-titrated group).

Measurements and Results

The administration of "as-needed" medication was determined using a validated measure of the severity of AWS (Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Assessment). Although the severity of AWS did not differ between groups initially, it significantly worsened over time in the infusion-titrated group. This required a higher amount of flunitrazepam, clonidine, and haloperidol. ICU treatment was significantly shorter in the bolus-titrated group (median difference 6 days) due to a lower incidence of pneumonia (26% vs. 43%).

Conclusions

We conclude that symptom-orientated bolus-titrated therapy decreases the severity and duration of AWS and of medication requirements, with clinically relevant benefits such as fewer days of ventilation, lower incidence of pneumonia, and shorter ICU stay.

### Alpha2 adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal [^112YKvFY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Withdrawal (detoxification) is necessary prior to drug-free treatment. It may also represent the end point of long-term treatment such as methadone maintenance. The availability of managed withdrawal is essential to an effective treatment system.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of alpha2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine) to manage opioid withdrawal in terms of withdrawal signs and symptoms, completion of withdrawal and adverse effects.

Search Strategy

Multiple electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Australian Medical Index, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register) were systematically searched. Reference lists of retrieved studies, reviews and conference abstracts were handsearched and relevant pharmaceutical companies contacted.

Selection Criteria

Controlled trials comparing alpha2 adrenergic agonists with reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or placebo, or comparing different alpha2 adrenergic agonists to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed by consultation between all four reviewers.

Main Results

Twenty-two studies, involving 1709 participants, were included. Eighteen were randomised controlled trials; for the remaining studies allocation was by participant choice in two, one used alternate allocation and in one the method of allocation was unclear. Twelve studies compared a treatment regime based on an alpha2 adrenergic agonist with one based on reducing doses of methadone. Diversity in study design, assessment and reporting of outcomes limited the extent of quantitative analysis. For the comparison of alpha2 adrenergic agonist regimes with reducing doses of methadone, there were insufficient data for statistical analysis, but withdrawal intensity appears similar to, or marginally greater with alpha2 adrenergic agonists, while signs and symptoms of withdrawal occur and resolve earlier in treatment. Participants stay in treatment longer with methadone. No significant difference was detected in rates of completion of withdrawal with adrenergic agonists compared to reducing doses of methadone, or clonidine compared to lofexidine. Clonidine is associated with more adverse effects (low blood pressure, dizziness, dry mouth, lack of energy) than reducing doses of methadone. Lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine.

Reviewers' Conclusions

No significant difference in efficacy was detected for treatment regimes based on the alpha2 adrenergic agonists clonidine and lofexidine, and those based on reducing doses of methadone over a period of around 10 days, for the management of withdrawal from heroin or methadone. Participants stay in treatment longer with methadone regimes and experience less adverse effects. The lower incidence of hypotension makes lofexidine more suited to use in outpatient settings than clonidine. There are insufficient data available to support a conclusion on the efficacy of other alpha2 adrenergic agonists.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^116yUKWU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — glossary core terms define abstinence, provider roles, therapy types, assessment dimensions, and substance use terminology as follows: Abstinence is the voluntary refraining from alcohol and other substances, and the use of FDA‑approved medication for substance use disorder is consistent with abstinence. Addiction specialist physicians include addiction medicine physicians and addiction psychiatrists. Adjunct therapy is a pharmaceutical drug used with a primary pharmaceutical to assist the primary treatment, whereas monotherapy is the use of a single drug to treat a disorder or disease. The ASAM Criteria uses six dimensions to define a holistic biopsychosocial assessment for service and treatment planning. Patients is intentionally broad and encompasses anyone who receives care for a substance use disorder in a specialty addiction treatment center or other healthcare setting. Pharmacotherapy is therapy using pharmaceutical drugs. Recovery capital refers to the breadth and depth of internal and external resources that can be drawn upon to initiate and sustain recovery from alcohol and other drug problems. Substance use refers to the use of psychotropic substances, which may include illegal drugs, medications or alcohol, and does not refer to nicotine. Substance use disorders are marked by a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms indicating continued use despite significant problems, with diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5, and the term replaces what was included as substance dependence and substance abuse in the DSM-4.

### Alpha ₂-adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal [^1138Czbm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment or as the endpoint of long-term substitution treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo, reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications, or an alpha2-adrenergic agonist regimen different to the experimental intervention, for the management of the acute phase of opioid withdrawal. Outcomes included the withdrawal syndrome experienced, duration of treatment, occurrence of adverse effects, and completion of treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1946 to November week 2, 2015), EMBASE (January 1985 to November week 2, 2015), PsycINFO (1806 to November week 2, 2015), Web of Science, and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing alpha2-adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine, tizanidine) with reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or placebo, or comparing different alpha2-adrenergic agonists to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were opioid dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

We included 26 randomised controlled trials involving 1728 participants. Six studies compared an alpha2-adrenergic agonist with placebo, 12 with reducing doses of methadone, four with symptomatic medications, and five compared different alpha2-adrenergic agonists. We assessed 10 studies as having a high risk of bias in at least one of the methodological domains that were considered. We found moderate-quality evidence that alpha2-adrenergic agonists were more effective than placebo in ameliorating withdrawal in terms of the likelihood of severe withdrawal (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.57; 3 studies; 148 participants). We found moderate-quality evidence that completion of treatment was significantly more likely with alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.84; 3 studies; 148 participants). Peak withdrawal severity may be greater with alpha2-adrenergic agonists than with reducing doses of methadone, as measured by the likelihood of severe withdrawal (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.73; 5 studies; 340 participants; low quality), and peak withdrawal score (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.22, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.46; 2 studies; 263 participants; moderate quality), but these differences were not significant and there is no significant difference in severity when considered over the entire duration of the withdrawal episode (SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.49; 3 studies; 119 participants; moderate quality). The signs and symptoms of withdrawal occurred and resolved earlier with alpha2-adrenergic agonists. The duration of treatment was significantly longer with reducing doses of methadone (SMD -1.07, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.83; 3 studies; 310 participants; low quality). Hypotensive or other adverse effects were significantly more likely with alpha2-adrenergic agonists (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.10; 6 studies; 464 participants; low quality), but there was no significant difference in rates of completion of withdrawal treatment (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05; 9 studies; 659 participants; low quality). There were insufficient data for quantitative comparison of different alpha2-adrenergic agonists. Available data suggest that lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine.

Authors' Conclusions

Clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo for the management of withdrawal from heroin or methadone. We detected no significant difference in efficacy between treatment regimens based on clonidine or lofexidine and those based on reducing doses of methadone over a period of around 10 days, but methadone was associated with fewer adverse effects than clonidine, and lofexidine has a better safety profile than clonidine.

### Buprenorphine for managing opioid withdrawal [^114wpoAW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Managed withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment or as the endpoint of substitution treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of buprenorphine versus tapered doses of methadone, alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists, symptomatic medications or placebo, or different buprenorphine regimens for managing opioid withdrawal, in terms of the intensity of the withdrawal syndrome experienced, duration and completion of treatment, and adverse effects.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 11, 2016), MEDLINE (1946 to December week 1, 2016), Embase (to 22 December 2016), PsycINFO (1806 to December week 3, 2016), and the Web of Science (to 22 December 2016) and handsearched the reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of interventions using buprenorphine to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid dependent. Comparison interventions involved reducing doses of methadone, alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists (clonidine or lofexidine), symptomatic medications or placebo, and different buprenorphine-based regimens.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 27 studies involving 3048 participants. The main comparators were clonidine or lofexidine (14 studies). Six studies compared buprenorphine versus methadone, and seven compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction. We assessed 12 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one of seven domains of methodological quality. Six of these studies compared buprenorphine with clonidine or lofexidine and two with methadone; the other four studies compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction. For the comparison of buprenorphine and methadone in tapered doses, meta-analysis was not possible for the outcomes of intensity of withdrawal or adverse effects. However, information reported by the individual studies was suggestive of buprenorphine and methadone having similar capacity to ameliorate opioid withdrawal, without clinically significant adverse effects. The meta-analyses that were possible support a conclusion of no difference between buprenorphine and methadone in terms of average treatment duration (mean difference (MD) 1.30 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.11 to 10.72; N = 82; studies = 2; low quality) or treatment completion rates (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.20; N = 457; studies = 5; moderate quality). Relative to clonidine or lofexidine, buprenorphine was associated with a lower average withdrawal score (indicating less severe withdrawal) during the treatment episode, with an effect size that is considered to be small to moderate (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.43, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.28; N = 902; studies = 7; moderate quality). Patients receiving buprenorphine stayed in treatment for longer, with an effect size that is considered to be large (SMD 0.92, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.27; N = 558; studies = 5; moderate quality) and were more likely to complete withdrawal treatment (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.06; N = 1264; studies = 12; moderate quality). At the same time there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects, but dropout due to adverse effects may be more likely with clonidine (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.15; N = 134; studies = 3; low quality). The difference in treatment completion rates translates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), indicating that for every four people treated with buprenorphine, we can expect that one additional person will complete treatment than with clonidine or lofexidine. For studies comparing different rates of reduction of the buprenorphine dose, meta-analysis was possible only for treatment completion, with separate analyses for inpatient and outpatient settings. The results were diverse, and we assessed the quality of evidence as being very low. It remains very uncertain what effect the rate of dose taper has on treatment outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

Buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine or lofexidine for managing opioid withdrawal in terms of severity of withdrawal, duration of withdrawal treatment, and the likelihood of treatment completion. Buprenorphine and methadone appear to be equally effective, but data are limited. It remains possible that the pattern of withdrawal experienced may differ and that withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine. It is not possible to draw any conclusions from the available evidence on the relative effectiveness of different rates of tapering the buprenorphine dose. The divergent findings of studies included in this review suggest that there may be multiple factors affecting the response to the rate of dose taper. One such factor could be whether or not the initial treatment plan includes a transition to subsequent relapse prevention treatment with naltrexone. Indeed, the use of buprenorphine to support transition to naltrexone treatment is an aspect worthy of further research. Most participants in the studies included in this review were male. None of the studies reported outcomes on the basis of sex, preventing any exploration of differences related to this variable. Consideration of sex as a factor influencing response to withdrawal treatment would be relevant research for selecting the most appropriate type of intervention for each individual.

### Outcomes after implementation of a benzodiazepine-sparing alcohol withdrawal order set in an integrated health care system [^1119C9JR]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

As a learning hospital system that seeks to systematically evaluate the association of inpatient intervention with patient outcomes, we sought in this quality improvement study to evaluate outcomes after implementation of a quality improvement initiative using a BZD-sparing order set for AWS designed to reduce BZD exposure across 21 community-based hospitals. Compared with AWS hospitalizations with no order set implementation, BZD-S order set implementation was associated with a decrease in BZD administration and an increase in use of clonidine, gabapentin, phenobarbital, thiamine, and valproic acid. There were also favorable trends in all outcomes, with a statistically significant decrease in ICU use and LOS in our primary analysis. Taken together, these findings represent new evidence to inform the treatment of AWS, a condition in which the standard of care has a limited evidence base and has changed little over several decades.

While many individuals have postulated that BZD reduction may be associated with improved outcomes in AWS, prior studies included smaller cohorts and focused on symptom-based outcomes with adjunctive AWS agents rather than on other hospital outcomes. In addition, most studies have examined the isolated outcomes associated with a single therapy rather than a combination of treatments. Nonetheless, the use of protocolized approaches has been recommended and put into practice primarily in academic medical centers. Large-scale outcomes studies including multiple therapies in community-based practice settings remain poorly described.

Based on a multidisciplinary collaboration among diverse clinical specialties, the KPNC BZD-S order set contained a bundle of features, including educational information on AWS timing, a severity scale, thiamine dosing, several adjunctive agents, and reduced BZD dosing scales. The use of AWS adjunctive agents increased with a concurrent decrease in use and dose of BZDs. However, it should be noted that decreased BZD use was present before BZD-S order set implementation in 2018 and were also seen in AWS hospitalizations without order set use. These preexisting decreases may be associated with changing inpatient practice designed to limit BZD negative sequelae among inpatients and may not be associated with order set implementation alone. In addition, BZDs were still administered in most AWS episodes, particularly among patients with medium and high CIWA-Ar scores, suggesting that these drugs continue to play an important role in AWS treatment.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of withdrawal delirium, benzodiazepines, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to use an established dosing protocol as a guide when treating alcohol withdrawal delirium, but individualize dosing regimens based on the patient's signs and symptoms. Administer IV symptom-triggered or fixed-dose front loading in patients with alcohol withdrawal delirium. Consider switching to oral symptom-triggered treatment, if on IV medication, once light somnolence is achieved and the patients is calm and cooperative.

### Promising strategies for the prevention of alcohol-related brain damage through optimised management of acute alcohol withdrawal: a focussed literature review [^111ZJfB6]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acamprosate is recommended by various bodies to form a part of management plans when addressing moderate or severe drinking behaviours and reducing relapse. When incorporated into management regimens of alcohol withdrawal, acamprosate may lead to a later first relapse compared with those managed with placebo. Furthermore, demonstrate that acamprosate, when included as a part of detoxification that confers no additional harm or relapse risk compared with placebo. In addition to forming part of relapse prevention plans, based on the information above, various lines of evidence suggest that when initiated early in withdrawal (and in addition to thiamine and benzodiazepines), or ideally prior to the onset of symptoms, acamprosate may offer neuroprotective, and neurorestorative benefits (through improved sleep architecture) with respect to the development of ARBD, conferring longer-lasting protection, manifested by preservation of cognitive function.

Collectively the data we have reviewed demonstrate the impact that hyperglutamatergic tone has on neuronal function during AWS. We highlight the potential role that glutamate receptor antagonism through acamprosate for example, may play in the protection of the brain during AWS and the prevention of signs and symptoms of ARBD, long-term. In order to facilitate this translation to clinical practice, further research is required in clinical populations to investigate the long-term neurocognitive outcomes and recovery of function of patients prescribed acamprosate as part of their alcohol withdrawal management plan. Additionally, a risk-benefit exercise focussed on both the feasibility of prescribing acamprosate in the context of acute illness where renal and hepatic function may be impaired, and where capacity to consent to engage with the treatment alongside the recommended psychological intervention may be suboptimal.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114E3L4E]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy, outpatient, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate pharmacotherapy patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of withdrawal while away from the outpatient treatment setting, such as a history of withdrawal episodes of at least moderate severity and being within the window for the development of symptoms in the time course of withdrawal. Administer benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin for monotherapy. Administer at least a single dose of benzodiazepine followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity as another strategy. Reassess patients frequently over the next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication if the risk of developing worse withdrawal is unknown.

### Alpha2-adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal [^114vX3iC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment or as the endpoint of long-term substitution treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo, reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or with comparison of different alpha2-adrenergic agonists, for the management of the acute phase of opioid withdrawal. Outcomes included the intensity of signs and symptoms and overall withdrawal syndrome experienced, duration of treatment, occurrence of adverse effects and completion of treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 7, 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to July week 4, 2013), EMBASE (January 1985 to August week 1, 2013), PsycINFO (1806 to July week 5, 2013) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing alpha2-adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine, tizanidine) with reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or placebo, or comparing different alpha2-adrenergic agonists to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were opioid dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. All review authors decided on inclusion and confirmed the overall process.

Main Results

We included 25 randomised controlled trials, involving 1668 participants. Five studies compared a treatment regimen based on an alpha2-adrenergic agonist with placebo, 12 with a regimen based on reducing doses of methadone, four with symptomatic medications and five compared different alpha2-adrenergic agonists. Alpha2-adrenergic agonists were more effective than placebo in ameliorating withdrawal in terms of the likelihood of severe withdrawal (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.57, 3 studies, 148 participants). Completion of treatment was significantly more likely with alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.84, 3 studies, 148 participants). Alpha2-adrenergic agonists were somewhat less effective than reducing doses of methadone in ameliorating withdrawal symptoms, as measured by the likelihood of severe withdrawal (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.73, 5 studies, 340 participants), peak withdrawal score (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.22, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.46, 2 studies, 263 participants) and overall withdrawal severity (SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.49, 3 studies, 119 participants). These differences were not statistically significant. The signs and symptoms of withdrawal occurred and resolved earlier with alpha2-adrenergic agonists. The duration of treatment was significantly longer with reducing doses of methadone (SMD -1.07, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.83, 3 studies, 310 participants). Hypotensive or other adverse effects were significantly more likely with alpha2-adrenergic agonists (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.10, 6 studies, 464 participants) but there was no significant difference in rates of completion of withdrawal treatment (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05, 9 studies, 659 participants). There were insufficient data for quantitative comparison of different alpha2-adrenergic agonists. Available data suggest that lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine.

Authors' Conclusions

Clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo for the management of withdrawal from heroin or methadone. No significant difference in efficacy was detected for treatment regimens based on clonidine or lofexidine, and those based on reducing doses of methadone over a period of around 10 days but methadone is associated with fewer adverse effects than clonidine, and lofexidine has a better safety profile than clonidine.

### Pharmacological therapies for management of opium withdrawal [^1112aWZh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacologic therapies for management of heroin withdrawal have been studied and reviewed widely. Opium dependence is generally associated with less severe dependence and milder withdrawal symptoms than heroin. The evidence on withdrawal management of heroin might therefore not be exactly applicable for opium.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of various pharmacologic therapies for the management of the acute phase of opium withdrawal.

Search Methods

We searched the following sources up to September 2017: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, regional and national databases (IMEMR, Iranmedex, and IranPsych), main electronic sources of ongoing trials, and reference lists of all relevant papers. In addition, we contacted known investigators to obtain missing data or incomplete trials.

Selection Criteria

Controlled clinical trials and randomised controlled trials on pharmacological therapies, compared with no intervention, placebo, other pharmacologic treatments, different doses of the same drug, and psychosocial intervention, to manage acute withdrawal from opium in a maximum duration of 30 days.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 13 trials involving 1096 participants. No pooled analysis was possible. Studies were carried out in three countries, Iran, India, and Thailand, in outpatient and inpatient settings. The quality of the evidence was generally very low. When the mean of withdrawal symptoms was provided for several days, we mainly focused on day 3. The reason for this was that the highest severity of opium withdrawal is in the second to fourth day. Comparing different pharmacological treatments with each other, clonidine was twice as good as methadone for completion of treatment (risk ratio (RR) 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.69 to 2.38; 361 participants, 1 study, low-quality evidence). All the other results showed no differences between the considered drugs: baclofen versus clonidine (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.80; 66 participants, 1 study, very low-quality evidence); clonidine versus clonidine plus amantadine (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.24; 69 participants, 1 study); clonidine versus buprenorphine in an inpatient setting (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.20; 1 study, 35 participants, very low-quality evidence); methadone versus tramadol (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.37; 1 study, 72 participants, very low-quality evidence); methadone versus methadone plus gabapentin (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.43; 1 study, 40 participants, low-quality evidence), and tincture of opium versus methadone (1 study, 74 participants, low-quality evidence). Comparing different pharmacological treatments with each other, adding amantadine to clonidine decreased withdrawal scores rated at day 3 (mean difference (MD) -3.56, 95% CI -5.97 to -1.15; 1 study, 60 participants, very low-quality evidence). Comparing clonidine with buprenorphine in an inpatient setting, we found no difference in withdrawal symptoms rated by a physician (MD -1.40, 95% CI -2.93 to 0.13; 1 study, 34 participants, very low-quality evidence), and results in favour of buprenorpine when rated by participants (MD -11.80, 95% CI -15.56 to -8.04). Buprenorphine was superior to clonidine in controlling severe withdrawal symptoms in an outpatient setting (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.64; 1 study, 76 participants). We found no difference in the comparison of methadone versus tramadol (MD 0.04, 95% CI -2.68 to 2.76; 1 study, 72 participants) and in the comparison of methadone versus methadone plus gabapentin (MD -2.20, 95% CI -6.72 to 2.32; 1 study, 40 participants). Comparing clonidine versus buprenorphine in an outpatient setting, more adverse effects were reported in the clonidine group (1 study, 76 participants). Higher numbers of participants in the clonidine group experienced hypotension at days 5 to 8, headache at days 1 to 8, sedation at days 5 to 8, dizziness and dry mouth at days 1 to 10, and nausea at days 1 to 9. Sweating was reported in a significantly higher number of participants in the buprenorphine group at days 1 to 10. We found no difference between groups for all the other comparisons considering this outcome. Comparing different dosages of the same pharmacological detoxification treatment, a high dose of clonidine (1 to 1.2 mg/day) did not differ from a low dose of clonidine (0.5 to 0.6 mg/day) in completion of treatment in an inpatient setting (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.19; 1 study, 68 participants), however a higher number of participants with hypotension was reported in the high-dose group (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.98). Gradual reduction of methadone was associated with more adverse effects than abrupt withdrawal of methadone (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.02 to 4.94; 1 study, 20 participants, very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Results did not support using any specific pharmacological approach for the management of opium withdrawal due to generally very low-quality evidence and small or no differences between treatments. However, it seems that opium withdrawal symptoms are significant, especially at days 2 to 4 after discontinuation of opium. All of the assessed medications might be useful in alleviating symptoms. Those who receive clonidine might experience hypotension.

### Baclofen for alcohol withdrawal [^11747j9S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a distressing and life-threatening condition that usually affects people who are alcohol dependent when they discontinue or decrease their alcohol consumption. Baclofen shows potential for rapidly reducing symptoms of severe AWS in people with alcoholism. Treatment with baclofen is easy to manage and rarely produces euphoria or other pleasant effects, or craving for the drug. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review first published in 2011 and last updated in 2017.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of baclofen for people with AWS.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to June 2019: the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. We also searched registers of ongoing trials. We handsearched the references quoted in the identified trials, and sought information from researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and relevant trial authors about unpublished or uncompleted trials. We placed no restrictions on language.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating baclofen versus placebo or any other treatment for people with AWS. We excluded uncontrolled, non-randomised, or quasi-randomised trials. We included both parallel group and cross-over studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included four RCTs with 189 randomised participants (one RCT new for this update). None of the included studies reported the primary outcomes of alcohol withdrawal seizures, alcohol withdrawal delirium, or craving. For the comparison of baclofen and placebo (1 study, 31 participants), there was no evidence of a difference in Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised (CIWA-Ar) scores in eight-hour periods from days one to five (very low-quality evidence). For the comparison of baclofen and diazepam (2 studies, 85 participants), there was no evidence of a difference in change from baseline to days 10 to 15 on CIWA-Ar scores (very low-quality evidence, meta-analysis was not performed due to insufficient data). In one study (37 participants), there was no evidence of a difference in participants with at least one adverse event (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10 to 0.10; very low-quality evidence), dropouts (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.10; very low-quality evidence), and dropouts due to adverse events (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.10; very low-quality evidence). For the comparison of baclofen and chlordiazepoxide (1 study, 60 participants), there was no evidence of a difference in difference from baseline to nine-day decremental fixed-dose intervention: CIWA-Ar scores (mean difference (MD) 1.00, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.30; very low-quality evidence), global improvement (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.23; very low-quality evidence), 14/60 participants with adverse events (RD 2.50, 95% CI 0.88 to 7.10; very low-quality of evidence), dropouts (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; very low-quality evidence), and dropouts due to adverse events (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; very low-quality evidence). None of the RCTs provided information on random sequence generation or allocation concealment, therefore, we assessed them at unclear risk of bias. Two RCTs were not of double-blind design and had a high risk of bias in blinding (Addolorato 2006; Girish 2016). One RCT had more than 5% dropouts with high risk of attrition bias (Lyon 2011). We could not assess reporting bias as none of the prepublished protocols were available.

Authors' Conclusions

No conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy and safety of baclofen for the management of alcohol withdrawal because we found insufficient and very low-quality evidence.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of withdrawal while away from the ambulatory treatment setting should be provided with pharmacotherapy, with benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin appropriate for monotherapy. Providing at least a single dose of benzodiazepine followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity is also appropriate, and if the risk is unknown patients should be reassessed frequently over the next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114PxKWV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Supportive care — Recommendation V.5 states that "Supportive care is a critical component of alcohol withdrawal management". It specifies that "Frequent reassurance, re-orientation to time and place, and nursing care are recommended non-pharmacological interventions", that "Patients with severe alcohol withdrawal should be cared for in an evenly lit, quiet room", and that "Patients should be offered hope and the expectation of recovery".

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^116Cb1Fv]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists for opioid withdrawal — clonidine dosing and comparative considerations are detailed as follows: Clonidine is generally used at doses of 0.1–0.3 mg every 6–8 hours, with a maximum dose of 1.2 mg daily, and is often combined with non-narcotic symptomatic medications. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are more effective than placebo in reducing severe withdrawal and in improving rates of treatment retention and completion. Comparative data indicate lofexidine and clonidine appear similarly effective, with hypotension occurring less frequently with lofexidine; therefore, lofexidine should be the preferred choice for outpatient withdrawal management where monitoring and management of hypotension are more difficult. Other agents such as guanfacine (available in the U.S.) can also be used off-label as an alternative to clonidine.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114sN6vQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM Alcohol Withdrawal Management guideline — scope, audience, and qualifying statements emphasizes that while the guideline focuses primarily on alcohol withdrawal management, alcohol withdrawal management alone is not an effective treatment for alcohol use disorder, and withdrawal management should not be conceptualized as a discrete clinical service but rather as a component in the process of initiating and engaging patients in treatment for alcohol use disorder. The intended audience is clinicians, mainly physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, who provide alcohol withdrawal management in specialty and non-specialty addiction treatment settings, including primary care and emergency departments, intensive care and surgery units in hospitals, and the guideline also notes utility for administrators, insurers, and policymakers. The guideline is intended to aid clinicians in their clinical decision making and patient management, states that clinical decision making should involve consideration of the quality and availability of expertise and services in the community wherein care is provided, directs that clinicians should make every effort to promote the patient's understanding of, and adherence to, prescribed and recommended treatments, and that patients should be informed of the risks, benefits, and alternatives to a particular treatment and should be an active partner in shared decision making whenever feasible; recommendations in this Practice Guideline do not supersede any federal or state regulations.

### Outcomes after implementation of a benzodiazepine-sparing alcohol withdrawal order set in an integrated health care system [^1115e81D]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

In this quality improvement study, we conducted a retrospective evaluation of a quality improvement project for AWS in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) integrated health care delivery system, which serves 4.4 million members across 21 hospitals. This study was deemed to not be human participants research and exempt from institutional review board review and informed consent by the KPNC research determination officer. This study is reported following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Development of a BZD-Sparing AWS Order Set

In 2015, KPNC physicians noted the potential for BZD-associated complications in 2 existing AWS order sets, one directed toward patients not in the intensive care unit (ICU) and another toward patients in the ICU (eTable 1 in the Supplement), which included only BZDs for prophylaxis or treatment. Physicians launched a quality -improvement project to incorporate literature-supported adjunctive treatments for AWS, including anticonvulsants (eg, carbamazepine, gabapentin, and valproic acid) and α-2 adrenergic agonists (eg, clonidine and dexmedetomidine) for prophylaxis and management of AWS. This work group comprised specialists from addiction medicine, critical care, hospital medicine, and consultation-liaison psychiatry who identified potential treatments for patients with AWS through evaluation of the scientific literature and review of local pilot projects. The work group developed a revised BZD-S order set for AWS through an iterative, consensus-based approach that streamlined AWS treatment for the ward and ICU while seeking to decrease overall BZD use. The order set was approved by the hospital medicine chiefs committee, a hospital order set content governance committee, and, lastly, the hospital medical executive committee for implementation across all hospital sites as a quality improvement initiative on October 1, 2018.

### Intrathecal and oral clonidine as prophylaxis for postoperative alcohol withdrawal syndrome: a randomized double-blinded study [^112BJjgM]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

In this study, we evaluated the effect of intrathecal and oral clonidine as supplements to spinal anesthesia with lidocaine in patients at risk of postoperative alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). We hypothesized that clonidine would have a prophylactic effect on postoperative AWS. Forty-five alcohol-dependent patients (daily ethanol intake > 60 g) scheduled for transurethral resection of the prostate were double-blindly randomized into three groups. All patients received hyperbaric lidocaine 100 mg intrathecally. The diazepam group (DiazG) was premedicated with diazepam 10 mg orally; the intrathecal clonidine group (Clon(i/t)G) received a placebo (saline) tablet and clonidine 150 microg intrathecally; and the oral clonidine group (Clon(p/o)G) received clonidine 150 microg orally. For patients diagnosed with AWS, the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised scale, was used. Twelve patients in the DiazG had symptoms of AWS, compared with two in the Clon(i/t)G and one in the Clon(p/o)G. The median Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised scale, score was 12 in the DiazG versus 1 in the clonidine-treated groups. Two patients in the DiazG had severe delirium. Patients receiving oral clonidine had a slightly decreased mean arterial blood pressure 6–12 h after spinal anesthesia (P < 0.05); patients in the DiazG had a hyperdynamic circulatory reaction 24–72 h after surgery. In conclusion, preoperative clonidine 150 microg, intrathecally or orally, prevented significant postoperative AWS in ethanol-dependent patients.

Implications

In this randomized, double-blinded study, clonidine 150 microg both intrathecally and orally prevented postoperative alcohol-withdrawal symptoms in alcohol-dependent men. The effect was superior to that with a single dose of diazepam 10 mg orally.

### Alpha2-adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal [^112KkVJF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment or as the end point of long-term substitution treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of alpha2-adrenergic agonists to manage opioid withdrawal.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966-July 2008), EMBASE (January 1985–2008 Week 31), PsycINFO (1967 to 7 August 2008) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Controlled trials comparing alpha2-adrenergic agonists with reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or placebo, or comparing different alpha2-adrenergic agonists to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were opioid dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed by consultation between all authors.

Main Results

Twenty-four studies, involving 1631 participants, were included. Twenty-one were randomised controlled trials. Thirteen studies compared a treatment regime based on an alpha2-adrenergic agonist with one based on reducing doses of methadone. Diversity in study design, assessment and reporting of outcomes limited the extent of quantitative analysis. Alpha2-adrenergic agonists are more effective than placebo in ameliorating withdrawal, and despite higher rates of adverse effects, are associated with significantly higher rates of completion of treatment. For the comparison of alpha2-adrenergic agonist regimes with reducing doses of methadone, there were insufficient data for statistical analysis, but withdrawal intensity appears similar to or marginally greater with alpha2-adrenergic agonists, while signs and symptoms of withdrawal occur and resolve earlier. Participants stay in treatment longer with methadone. No significant difference was detected in rates of completion of withdrawal with adrenergic agonists compared to reducing doses of methadone, or clonidine compared to lofexidine. Clonidine is associated with more adverse effects than reducing doses of methadone. Lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine

Authors' Conclusions

Clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo for the management of withdrawal from heroin or methadone. No significant difference in efficacy was detected for treatment regimes based on clonidine or lofexidine, and those based on reducing doses of methadone over a period of around 10 days but methadone is associated with fewer adverse effects than clonidine, and lofexidine has a better safety profile than clonidine.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^11762QRr]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — evidence on symptom-triggered care and risk: Previous guidelines and reviews indicate that patients experiencing mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA-Ar score < 10) who are at minimal risk of worsening symptoms can be safely treated with monitored supportive care alone, and research has demonstrated that patients who never reach a CIWA-Ar score ≥ 10 and thus do not receive medication in accordance with a symptom-triggered protocol are not at higher risk of adverse events than patients who received medication through a fixed-dose protocol; in addition, patients receiving medications through a symptom triggered protocol require less medication overall and experience a shorter duration of treatment. Patients experiencing moderate or severe withdrawal (e.g. CIWA-Ar scores ≥ 10) should receive pharmacotherapy, and moderate to severe withdrawal at treatment baseline has been identified as a risk factor for developing more severe withdrawal during the course of treatment.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to benzodiazepines, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to prefer symptom-triggered benzodiazepine dosing (conducted by trained personnel) at short-term observational settings with continuous monitoring; use front loading while under clinical supervision or fixed dosing with additional as-needed medication as another option. Prefer symptom-triggered benzodiazepine dosing in inpatient settings; consider using fixed dosing according to a scheduled taper if symptom-triggered treatment cannot be used.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

2025 High Blood Pressure Guideline — Table 11 — medications and other substances that may cause elevated blood pressure details management strategies: For alcohol, options include abstinence or limit alcohol to ≤ 1 drink daily for women and ≤ 2 drinks daily for men. For caffeine, limit caffeine intake to < 300 mg/d, and avoid more than 1 cup daily in patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension. For decongestants, use for shortest duration possible and avoid in severe or uncontrolled hypertension, with consideration of alternative therapies (nasal saline, intranasal corticosteroids, antihistamines) as appropriate. For NSAIDs and acetaminophen, avoid systemic NSAIDs when possible, limit acetaminophen to less than 4 g/d, and consider alternative analgesics (e.g., topical NSAIDs) depending on indication and risk. For sudden withdrawal of central-acting sympathetic drugs such as clonidine and tizanidine, recommend avoiding oral clonidine for treatment of hypertension whenever possible and tapering upon discontinuation; use cyclobenzaprine or other muscle relaxants instead of tizanidine. For amphetamines, discontinue or decrease dose and consider behavioral therapies or nonstimulants (such as guanfacine) for ADHD. For antidepressants, consider alternative agents (e.g. SSRIs) depending on indication and avoid tyramine-containing foods with MAOIs. For atypical antipsychotics, discontinue or limit use when possible, consider behavior therapy where appropriate, recommend lifestyle modification (Section 5.1 "Lifestyle and Psychosocial Approaches"), and consider alternative agents associated with lower risk of weight gain, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. For immunosuppressants, consider converting to tacrolimus, which may be associated with fewer effects on BP. For oral contraceptives, use low-dose agents (e.g., 20–30 mcg ethinyl estradiol) or a progestin-only form, or consider alternative forms of birth control (barrier, abstinence, nonhormonal IUD), and avoid use in women with uncontrolled hypertension. For androgen deprivation therapy, avoid or limit use when possible and consider alternative chemotherapy.

### Outcomes after implementation of a benzodiazepine-sparing alcohol withdrawal order set in an integrated health care system [^111pdxA6]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The revised BZD-S order set included cascading order set options based on 3 risk categories using a clinician's determination of risk of complicated AWS based on the Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale (PAWSS)or clinical severity based on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised (CIWA-Ar)scale. PAWSS scores risk factors from patient history and clinical evidence (possible score range, 0–10). CIWA-Ar measures clinical severity based on 10 alcohol withdrawal symptoms (possible score range, 0–67). The categories represented clinical pathways, including observation, prevention or active withdrawal, and severe or complex withdrawal in the ICU (Table 1). Patients with low risk for AWS (ie, PAWSS score < 4) and low severity (ie, CIWA-Ar score < 8) could be placed on the observation pathway and given supportive treatment with thiamine and multivitamins. Patients at high risk for AWS (ie, PAWSS score ≥ 4) or those who were experiencing active AWS (ie, CIWA-Ar score ≥ 8 and < 15) could be placed into the prevention or active withdrawal pathway. Treatment options in this pathway included anticonvulsants (ie, gabapentin or valproic acid) and an α-agonist (ie, clonidine) as primary treatment, with BZDs as needed for breakthrough AWS (ie, CIWA-Ar score ≥ 15). Finally, patients presenting with severe AWS (ie, CIWA-Ar score ≥ 15) or those not responsive to other pathways were treated based on the severe and complex withdrawal pathway in the ICU. This included an option for dexmedetomidine, which requires frequent monitoring of cardiovascular adverse effects. Each successive clinical pathway incorporated orders from the less severe pathways.

### Baclofen for alcohol withdrawal [^111dzsj5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Baclofen shows potential for rapidly reducing symptoms of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) in people with alcoholism. Treatment with baclofen is easy to manage and rarely produces euphoria or other pleasant effects, or craving for the drug. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2015, Issue 4.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of baclofen for people with AWS.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to March 2017: the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. We also searched registers of ongoing trials. We handsearched the references quoted in the identified trials, and sought information from researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and relevant trial authors about unpublished or uncompleted trials. We placed no restrictions on language.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating baclofen versus placebo or any other treatment for people with AWS. We excluded uncontrolled, non-randomised, or quasi-randomised trials. We included both parallel group and cross-over studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included three RCTs with 141 randomised participants. We did not perform meta-analyses due to the different control interventions. For the comparison of baclofen and placebo (1 study, 31 participants), there was no significant difference in Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised (CIWA-Ar) scores (very low quality evidence). For the comparison of baclofen and diazepam (1 study, 37 participants), there was no significant difference in CIWA-Ar scores (very low quality evidence), adverse events (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10 to 0.10; very low quality evidence), dropouts (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.10; very low quality evidence), and dropouts due to adverse events (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.10; very low quality evidence). For the comparison of baclofen and chlordiazepoxide (1 study, 60 participants), there was no significant difference in CIWA-Ar scores (mean difference (MD) 1.00, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.30; very low quality evidence), global improvement (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.23; very low quality evidence), adverse events (RD 2.50, 95% CI 0.88 to 7.10; very low quality of evidence), dropouts (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; very low quality evidence), and dropouts due to adverse events (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

No conclusions can be drawn about the efficacy and safety of baclofen for the management of alcohol withdrawal because we found insufficient and very low quality evidence.

### Buprenorphine for the management of opioid withdrawal [^112Hj3sv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Managed withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment or as the end point of substitution treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal, for withdrawal signs and symptoms, completion of withdrawal and adverse effects.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2008), EMBASE (January 1985 to 2008 Week 31), PsycINFO (1967 to 7 August 2008) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of interventions involving the use of buprenorphine to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid dependent. Comparison interventions involved reducing doses of methadone, alpha(2)-adrenergic agonists, symptomatic medications or placebo, or different buprenorphine-based regimes.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author assessed studies for inclusion and methodological quality, and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process was confirmed by consultation between all authors.

Main Results

Twenty-two studies involving 1736 participants were included. The major comparisons were with methadone (5 studies) and clonidine or lofexidine (12 studies). Five studies compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction. Severity of withdrawal is similar for withdrawal managed with buprenorphine and withdrawal managed with methadone, but withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine. It appears that completion of withdrawal treatment may be more likely with buprenorphine relative to methadone (RR 1.18; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.49, P = 0.18) but more studies are required to confirm this. Relative to clonidine or lofexidine, buprenorphine is more effective in ameliorating the symptoms of withdrawal, patients treated with buprenorphine stay in treatment for longer (SMD 0.92, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.27, P < 0.001), and are more likely to complete withdrawal treatment (RR 1.64; 95% CI 1.31 to 2.06, P < 0.001). At the same time there is no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects, but drop-out due to adverse effects may be more likely with clonidine.

Authors' Conclusions

Buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine or lofexidine for the management of opioid withdrawal. Buprenorphine may offer some advantages over methadone, at least in inpatient settings, in terms of quicker resolution of withdrawal symptoms and possibly slightly higher rates of completion of withdrawal.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114vJM3F]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy, outpatient, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to consider initiating preventative pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting (at the discretion of providers with extensive experience in management of alcohol withdrawal) for patients at risk of severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications of alcohol withdrawal. Administer benzodiazepines as first-line therapy to reduce the signs and symptoms of withdrawal including the incidence of seizure and delirium. Administer phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use) as an alternative option. Administer phenobarbital or transfer patients to a more intensive level of care if benzodiazepines are contraindicated.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^112XaVAG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Medications in opioid withdrawal — strategy overview describes two main strategies: the provision of gradually tapering doses of opioid agonists, typically methadone or buprenorphine, and the use of alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (FDA-approved lofexidine, and off-label use of clonidine) with other non-narcotic medications to reduce withdrawal symptoms; both are superior to no treatment with respect to withdrawal severity and treatment completion. Methadone and buprenorphine are generally more effective in reducing the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and in patients that are quite anxious about the symptoms of the abstinence syndrome, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists may be preferred. Evidence cited indicates methadone tapers or alpha-2 adrenergic agonists result in similar severity of withdrawal symptoms, buprenorphine may be more effective than alpha-2-adrenergic agonists in terms of withdrawal severity, duration, and treatment completion, managing withdrawal with alpha-2 adrenergic agonists may enable a more rapid initiation if treatment with naltrexone is planned, and buprenorphine and methadone appear to be similarly effective although data are limited.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113S6ohj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — pharmacotherapy prophylaxis (Recommendations IV.13 and IV.14) notes that patients at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or concomitant alcohol withdrawal may be treated in ambulatory settings at the discretion of providers with extensive experience in management of alcohol withdrawal, and such patients should be provided with preventative pharmacotherapy. Benzodiazepines are first-line treatment because of their well-documented effectiveness in reducing the signs and symptoms of withdrawal including the incidence of seizure and delirium. Phenobarbital is an appropriate alternative in Level 2-WM settings for providers experienced with its use; for patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, phenobarbital (in Level 2-WM settings by providers experienced with its use) or transfer to a more intensive level of care are appropriate options. A front loading regimen is recommended for patients at high risk of severe withdrawal syndrome. Providing at least a single dose of preventative medication is appropriate for patients at lower levels of risk who have: a history of severe or complicated withdrawal; an acute medical, psychiatric, or surgical illness; severe coronary artery disease; displaying signs or symptoms of withdrawal concurrent with a positive blood alcohol content.

### Buprenorphine for the management of opioid withdrawal [^117CVqv3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Managed withdrawal (detoxification) is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment. It may also represent the end point of long-term opioid replacement treatment such as methadone maintenance. The availability of managed withdrawal is essential to an effective treatment system.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal, in terms of withdrawal signs and symptoms, completion of withdrawal and adverse effects.

Search Strategy

Multiple electronic databases (including Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Australian Medical Index, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register) were systematically searched to October 2003. Reference lists of retrieved studies, reviews and conference abstracts were handsearched.

Selection Criteria

Controlled trials comparing buprenorphine with reducing doses of methadone, alpha2 adrenergic agonists, symptomatic medications or placebo, or comparing different buprenorphine-based regimes, to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid dependent.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed by consultation between all three reviewers. Included studies were assessed for methodological quality. Meta-analysis was undertaken where possible, with sensitivity analyses used to assess the impact of methodological quality.

Main Results

Thirteen studies (10 RCTs), involving 744 participants, met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Seven studies compared buprenorphine with clonidine; 3 compared buprenorphine with methadone; 1 compared buprenorphine with oxazepam; 2 compared rapid and slow rates of tapering buprenorphine dose; 1 compared 3 different starting doses of buprenorphine. For groups treated with buprenorphine, withdrawal severity was less than that in groups treated with clonidine; peak severity was similar to those treated with methadone, but withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine. Withdrawal is probably more severe when doses are tapered rapidly following a period of maintenance treatment. Buprenorphine is associated with fewer adverse effects than clonidine, and completion of withdrawal is significantly more likely with buprenorphine (Relative Risk 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.13, 1.62). In the two available studies, there was no statistically significant difference in rates of completion of withdrawal for buprenorphine compared to methadone in reducing doses. Completion of withdrawal following buprenorphine maintenance treatment may be more likely when doses are reduced gradually.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine for the management of opioid withdrawal. There appears to be no significant difference between buprenorphine and methadone in terms of completion of withdrawal, but withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine. Many aspects of treatment protocol and relative effectiveness need to be investigated further in order to determine the most effective way of using buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal.

- To our knowledge, this is the first reported comparison of clonidine with benzodiazepine in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In a double-blind trial, 61 men experiencing acute alcohol withdrawal were randomly assigned to receive clonidine or chlordiazepoxide over a 60-hour treatment period. Clonidine was more effective than chlordiazepoxide at reducing alcohol withdrawal scale scores, systolic blood pressures, and heart rates over the entire study period. Clonidine was as good as chlordiazepoxide at improving Cognitive Capacity Screening Exam, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and Self-Rating Scale scores. Adverse drug reactions reported by each group were similar, though less nausea and vomiting were observed in the clonidine group.

Clonidine may represent a new alternative agent for the management of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Impact of clonidine on alcohol withdrawal States… [^1111WgZ2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — In a recent issue of the Archives, 1 Baumgartner and Rowen reported that clonidine was as effective as chlordiazepoxide in relieving signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The major goals of treating patients who are experiencing alcohol withdrawal should include reducing patient discomfort, alleviating dangerous signs of withdrawal, preventing morbid sequellae, and preparing the alcoholic to accept treatment for his/her disease. Though Baumgartner and Rowen suggest that "clonidine should be further investigated and seriously considered in the pharmacotherapy of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome, " a thorough examination of these goals may reveal that clonidine does not yet deserve this acclaim. There has been no agreement among investigators as to how to objectively and standardly assess reduction in patient discomfort during trials of therapy for alcohol withdrawal syndromes.

2 None of the studies testing the effectiveness of clonidine have used the same outcome measures. These. Stock C. Impact of Clonidine on Alcohol Withdrawal States. Arch Intern Med. 1988; 148: 241–245.
