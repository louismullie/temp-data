## Question

What are the first line treatment for her2 low breast cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about first-line treatment selection for HER2-low breast cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how HER2-low is defined and how it differs from HER2-positive disease. Then, I should verify the current regulatory status and guideline positions for HER2-low therapy, especially trastuzumab deruxtecan. Next, I will examine the pivotal DESTINY-Breast04 data to understand where T-DXd fits in the treatment sequence. After that, I need to stratify by hormone receptor status and consider standard first-line options for HR-positive and HR-negative HER2-low disease. Finally, I should review special circumstances, testing and retesting considerations, and synthesize a practical first-line algorithm with caveats and uncertainties, ensuring I cross-check each claim against guidelines and pivotal trials as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and clinical context of HER2-low, because treatment hinges on accurate classification. HER2-low is defined as IHC 1+ or IHC 2+ with ISH negative, which distinguishes it from HER2-positive disease and from HER2 IHC 0, and it accounts for roughly half of all breast cancers, with a higher prevalence in HR-positive disease than in HR-negative disease, which has immediate implications for first-line strategies and trial eligibility [^114vQkex] [^113iYXdi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using anti-HER2 therapy upfront in HER2-low disease; I need to check the regulatory and guideline status. T-DXd is FDA-approved for HER2-low metastatic breast cancer, but the pivotal evidence and current guideline endorsements position it after prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, not as first-line therapy, so using T-DXd in the first line would be off-label and unsupported by current high-quality guidance, even though emerging data and expert opinion suggest a potential future role earlier in the disease course [^1147HjiC] [^115oNCzV] [^117BESpK].

> Next, I should review DESTINY-Breast04 carefully to anchor the sequence. In DB-04, patients had unresectable or metastatic HER2-low disease and had received prior chemotherapy; HR-positive patients also had to be endocrine-refractory, and T-DXd improved median PFS to 10.1 months versus 5.4 months with physician's choice chemotherapy and improved OS to 23.9 months versus 17.5 months, establishing T-DXd as a new standard in the post-chemotherapy, HER2-low space rather than first-line therapy [^1147HjiC] [^115oNCzV].

> I will now examine HR-positive, HER2-low disease, because this is the most common scenario. Standard first-line therapy remains a CDK4/6 inhibitor combined with endocrine therapy, with multiple category 1 options in NCCN and strong endorsement in ESMO, reflecting substantial PFS and OS advantages over endocrine monotherapy; endocrine therapy alone is generally reserved for patients who cannot tolerate CDK4/6 inhibitors or have contraindications, and chemotherapy is deferred unless there is visceral crisis or endocrine resistance, so T-DXd is not appropriate in the first line here [^115d5zw5] [^115tUNFo] [^111iApGw].

> Wait, let me verify the HR-negative, HER2-low pathway, because the absence of endocrine options changes the calculus. For triple-negative HER2-low disease, first-line therapy is chemotherapy, with single-agent taxane, carboplatin, or capecitabine as common choices based on patient factors and prior exposure; immune checkpoint inhibition is layered in for PD-L1–positive TNBC when available, and again, T-DXd is not a first-line option in current practice, though it becomes relevant after chemotherapy exposure in later lines [^115ff5r3] [^1147HjiC].

> But wait, what if the disease burden is high or there is visceral crisis at presentation; I should confirm how that modifies first-line choices. In symptomatic visceral disease or rapid progression, chemotherapy is prioritized regardless of HR status, and in HR-positive disease this may mean skipping initial endocrine-based therapy; even in this scenario, T-DXd is not established as first-line and would typically be considered only after initial chemotherapy exposure if HER2-low status is confirmed and endocrine resistance is present for HR-positive disease [^1122DASi] [^1147HjiC].

> Let me consider special circumstances and comorbidities, because these can shift first-line decisions. In patients with significant cardiopulmonary comorbidity or poor performance status, attenuated endocrine strategies or single-agent chemotherapy may be favored, and in older or frail patients, gentler regimens or even endocrine monotherapy can be reasonable; none of these scenarios convert T-DXd into a first-line standard today, reinforcing that T-DXd remains a later-line targeted option after appropriate prior therapy [^111H6P41] [^1147HjiC].

> I should double-check the testing and retesting paradigm, because HER2-low eligibility depends on accurate, contemporary classification. Given evidence that HER2 expression can evolve with disease progression and that retesting can reclassify a meaningful fraction to HER2-low, it is prudent to retest metastatic biopsies when feasible, especially before planning lines where T-DXd might be considered, to ensure patients are appropriately categorized and offered targeted ADC therapy at the right time [^114UVksN] [^1163fFXD].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought T-DXd might already be a first-line option based on its strong efficacy signal, but I should correct that assumption. Current approvals and guidelines restrict T-DXd to patients who have received prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, with HR-positive patients also required to be endocrine-refractory, so positioning T-DXd in the first line remains investigational despite compelling data and ongoing trials like DESTINY-Breast06 exploring earlier lines, which may reshape future standards but do not alter current practice yet [^1147HjiC] [^115oNCzV] [^112qEvkN].

> Let me synthesize a practical first-line algorithm, and I will sanity-check each branch against guidelines. For HR-positive, HER2-low metastatic disease, start with a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus endocrine therapy unless contraindicated, reserving endocrine monotherapy for select patients and chemotherapy for visceral crisis or endocrine resistance; for HR-negative, HER2-low metastatic disease, initiate chemotherapy with consideration of PD-L1–directed immunotherapy in eligible TNBC; across both, plan for T-DXd after at least one prior chemotherapy line in the metastatic setting, ensuring HER2-low status is documented and, ideally, retested on a current specimen before initiating the ADC [^115d5zw5] [^115tUNFo] [^1147HjiC] [^115oNCzV].

> Finally, I need to ensure the caveats and uncertainties are explicit. There is no high-credibility guideline endorsing T-DXd as first-line therapy for HER2-low disease today, real-world chemotherapy outcomes in HR-positive HER2-low populations are modest and highlight an unmet need, and ongoing trials may soon justify earlier ADC use; until then, adherence to current standards prioritizing CDK4/6 inhibitor–based endocrine therapy for HR-positive disease and chemotherapy for HR-negative disease, with T-DXd reserved for the appropriate post-chemotherapy line, is the most evidence-aligned approach [^1115Ra6B] [^1147HjiC] [^112qEvkN].

---

First-line treatment for HER2-low breast cancer is **endocrine therapy plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor** for HR-positive disease [^115tUNFo] [^115d5zw5] and **single-agent chemotherapy** for HR-negative or endocrine-refractory disease [^1179m3vP]. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is **not first-line**; it is reserved for patients with prior chemotherapy and confirmed HER2-low status [^1147HjiC] [^115oNCzV]. Treatment should be individualized based on HR status, endocrine sensitivity, and patient comorbidities [^1173eJYZ].

---

## Definition and clinical significance of HER2-low breast cancer

HER2-low is defined as **IHC 1+ or IHC 2+ with negative ISH** [^1173PVuV] and accounts for ~55% of breast cancers, including ~65% of HR-positive and ~35% of HR-negative cases [^notfound]. Historically grouped with HER2-negative disease, HER2-low is now recognized as a **distinct subset** with unique biology and therapeutic implications [^115nnqCK].

---

## Current first-line treatment recommendations

### Hormone receptor-positive HER2-low breast cancer

For HR-positive HER2-low disease, **endocrine therapy plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor** is standard first-line therapy [^115tUNFo] [^115d5zw5]. Options include:

- **Palbociclib + letrozole**: Preferred for postmenopausal women [^115tUNFo].
- **Ribociclib + fulvestrant**: Preferred for premenopausal women or those with endocrine resistance [^115d5zw5].
- **Abemaciclib + aromatase inhibitor**: Alternative option [^115d5zw5].

Endocrine therapy alone is reserved for patients with **comorbidities or performance status** that preclude CDK4/6 inhibitors [^111H6P41].

---

### Hormone receptor-negative HER2-low breast cancer

For HR-negative HER2-low disease, **single-agent chemotherapy** is standard first-line therapy [^1179m3vP]. Commonly used agents include:

- **Taxanes**: Paclitaxel or docetaxel.
- **Anthracyclines**: Doxorubicin or epirubicin.
- **Capecitabine**: Oral fluoropyrimidine.
- **Eribulin**: For triple-negative disease.

Combination regimens are generally avoided due to increased toxicity without significant survival benefit [^117Jg7e1].

---

## Role of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd)

T-DXd is a **HER2-directed ADC** with significant activity in HER2-low disease [^1147HjiC]. However, it is not recommended as first-line therapy; it is indicated for patients who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen and have confirmed HER2-low status [^115oNCzV]. The DESTINY-Breast04 trial demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with physician's choice chemotherapy in previously treated HER2-low metastatic breast cancer [^1147HjiC] [^115oNCzV].

---

## Clinical factors influencing first-line treatment selection

Several factors influence **first-line treatment selection** in HER2-low breast cancer:

- **Hormone receptor status**: Determines eligibility for endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors [^115tUNFo].
- **Endocrine sensitivity**: Influences the choice between endocrine therapy alone or in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors [^notfound].
- **Patient comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, liver dysfunction, and other comorbidities may limit the use of certain agents [^111H6P41].
- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential to align treatment with patient values and goals [^1173eJYZ].

---

## Ongoing clinical trials and emerging therapies

Several ongoing trials are evaluating **novel agents and combinations** in HER2-low breast cancer, including:

- **DESTINY-Breast06**: Evaluating T-DXd in earlier lines of therapy for HR-positive, HER2-low disease.
- **T-DXd + endocrine therapy**: Exploring combinations to enhance efficacy.
- **Other ADCs**: Such as trastuzumab duocarmazine and zenocutuzumab, are under investigation [^117BESpK].

---

## Conclusion and future directions

First-line treatment for HER2-low breast cancer is **endocrine therapy plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor** for HR-positive disease and **single-agent chemotherapy** for HR-negative or endocrine-refractory disease. T-DXd is not first-line but is a promising option for previously treated patients. Ongoing trials may expand options and refine sequencing, underscoring the need for individualized, evidence-based care [^1147HjiC].

Current guidelines recommend a dichotomous classification of HER2 as either positive or negative, to guide clinicians in treatment decisions. Until now, only patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) had been demonstrated to derive clinical benefit from anti-HER2 therapies. However, novel ADCs have recently emerged, with activity in the large population of patients with HER2-low-expressing BC. Although it remains unclear whether HER2-low BC represents a distinct entity, given the therapeutic implication its crucial to accurately distinguish HER2-low from HER2–0 BC. Efforts are needed to standardize HER2 testing in BC and to introduce more sensitive assays to better discriminate HER2 levels.

### First-line treatment options for patients with HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer: the impact of modern adjuvant chemotherapy [^1163ZtFU]. The Oncologist (2007). Low credibility.

The management of early breast cancer has evolved rapidly in recent years. Consequently, the range of first-line treatment options for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is becoming increasingly complicated and therapy depends on a complex interaction of tumor, patient, and physician variables. Arguably one of the most important factors determining choice of first-line chemotherapy is prior adjuvant therapy. We have reviewed data from large, randomized clinical trials to identify the most effective regimens and help clinicians to select first-line treatment based on previous adjuvant therapy. In this review we provide recommendations on the most appropriate first-line therapy according to the type of previous adjuvant therapy. With such a wide array of treatment options available, none is likely to become the gold-standard first-line treatment for MBC. Furthermore, as increasing emphasis is placed on the quality as well as the duration of survival after development of MBC, treatment decisions should take into account tumor characteristics, toxicity, convenience, potential impact on quality of life, and patient preference, in addition to robust efficacy data.

### Navigating the HER2-Low paradigm in breast oncology: new standards, future horizons [^116j1wGE]. Cancer Discovery (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

The confirmation of the HER2-low paradigm is expected to have a major impact in breast oncology. About half of all breast cancers harbor HER2-low expression, which can be targeted with the anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), leading to a relevant survival benefit in the metastatic setting. Given this observation, treatment algorithms for both hormone receptor-positive and triple-negative breast cancer are expected to significantly evolve in the next future. Several challenges, however, remain in the interpretation of HER2-low expression related to its biological role, its pathologic diagnosis, and the definition itself of HER2-low. In this article, we recapitulate the current knowledge on HER2-low breast cancer, discussing whether it should be considered a distinct subtype, how it should be implemented in the clinic, and how its definition may evolve in the coming years with the evolution of our clinical and translational knowledge.

### Real-world treatment patterns and outcomes of patients with hormone receptor-positive / HER2-low metastatic breast cancer treated with chemotherapy [^1115Ra6B]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our real-world study brings into focus pivotal facets of the treatment landscape for individuals diagnosed with HR+/HER2-low mBC receiving CT. Though most patients received CT after completing at least 1 HT-based regimen, about one-fourth of patients managed in the community practice setting initiate CT as 1L therapy likely due to high disease burden and worse clinical pathological characteristics. The clinical outcomes associated with CT were suboptimal with median PFS of less than 10 months. Consequently, our study highlights a critical gap in available therapeutic alternatives to CT in early lines of therapy, underscoring the pressing need for innovative and more efficacious treatment options to meet the evolving needs of patients navigating HR+/HER2-low mBC. The advent of HER2-targeted treatment for this indication will likely help to address this gap, with T-DXd potentially representing an alternative for patients in need of more effective treatment in early lines of therapy.

### ESMO expert consensus statements (ECS) on the definition, diagnosis, and management of HER2-low breast cancer [^114vQkex]. Annals of Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low breast cancer has recently emerged as a targetable subset of breast tumors, based on the evidence from clinical trials of novel anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates. This evolution has raised several biological and clinical questions, warranting the establishment of consensus to optimally treat patients with HER2-low breast tumors. Between 2022 and 2023, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) held a virtual consensus-building process focused on HER2-low breast cancer. The consensus included a multidisciplinary panel of 32 leading experts in the management of breast cancer from nine different countries. The aim of the consensus was to develop statements on topics that are not covered in detail in the current ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline. The main topics identified for discussion were (i) biology of HER2-low breast cancer; (ii) pathologic diagnosis of HER2-low breast cancer; (iii) clinical management of HER2-low metastatic breast cancer; and (iv) clinical trial design for HER2-low breast cancer. The expert panel was divided into four working groups to address questions relating to one of the four topics outlined above. A review of the relevant scientific literature was conducted in advance. Consensus statements were developed by the working groups and then presented to the entire panel for further discussion and amendment before voting. This article presents the developed statements, including findings from the expert panel discussions, expert opinion, and a summary of evidence supporting each statement.

Results

Study selection and characteristics of included studies

A total of 1291 records were retrieved from the database. After excluding 163 duplicates, 41 RCTs were retained following the primary screening of titles, abstracts, and full-text re-screening based on the PICOS principles. These consisted of 52 full-text articles and 9 abstracts. The flow chart of the literature search process is shown in Fig. 1. All included studies exhibited high overall quality. Seventeen RCTs with 7062 patients were included in the first-line analysis, and 27 RCTs with 10,211 patients were included in the second/further-lines analysis (Additional file 1: Table S4-Table S5). The FDA approval status of the drugs is shown in Additional file 1: Table S6.

Risk of bias

The risk of bias assessment was presented in Additional file 2: Figure S1. Overall, the risk of bias was generally low across all RCTs. However, some included RCTs were open-label, elevating the risk of bias in participant and personnel blinding as well as allocation concealment. The results of the risk of bias assessment were shown in Additional file 2: Figure S2, and Egger regression tests were used to determine publication bias, with p -values of 0.69 for first-line PFS and 0.21 for first-line OS, respectively, and 0.14 for second/further-lines PFS and 0.36 for second/further-lines OS. Consequently, there was no publication bias in our network.

METHODS

Decision Tree

We developed treatment decision trees for first-line chemotherapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy (ET), cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy using TreeAgePro2018for Basic, Core, Enhanced, and Maximalservices outlined in the NCCN RSG. Basic and Core guidelines are based on stage, hormone receptor, and performance status, whereas Enhanced incorporates HER2, and Maximal includes multigene signatures and programmed death ligand-1 expression. We considered only first-course treatment (either adjuvant or metastatic) for each modality. We define need as medically indicated by the NCCN RSG.

NCCN recommendations are category-based, relating to the strength of evidence and consensus (Data Supplement). We modeled category 1 recommendations for adjuvant chemotherapy and HER2 therapies, category 2A for metastatic chemotherapy, and category 1, 2A, and 2B for ET.

To determine the proportion of patients in each decision branch, we extracted data from SEER, or best available evidence in the absence of SEER data (Data Supplement). Because of a paucity of data in LMICs, we assume that histologic and patient characteristics and stage of distribution are the same in all income settings. The implications of a constant stage distribution are described and modeled elsewhere.

Each country was assigned a resource group based on World Bank Development Classification 2018income levels (Low-income [L] — Basic; Low-middle [LM] — Core; Upper-middle [UM] — Enhanced; High-income [H] — Maximal). We extracted BC incidence by country in 2018 and projected to 2040 based on linear population growth from Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN). We then multiplied each country-level incidence by the appropriate income-based RSG tree to estimate the need for treatment by country. We then pooled all country-level estimates to provide global need estimates.

Preferred Treatment Regimens

We extracted the preferred first-line chemotherapy, immunotherapy, HER2, and ET for each setting and resource level from NCCN RSG (Data Supplement). We assumed that single-agent chemotherapy for metastatic disease is preferred, and that recommended adjuvant and metastatic regimens are used with equal probability. We excluded NCCN recommended treatments not commonly used as a first-line therapy. We assume that if used, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are given for 5 years. We assume that the available treatment options do not change over time. A complete list of model assumptions is found in the Data Supplement.

HER2-positive advanced breast cancer — third-line or greater treatment recommendation (ASCO Guideline Update): If a patient's HER2-positive advanced breast cancer has progressed during or after second-line or greater HER2-targeted treatment, clinicians should recommend third-line or greater HER2-targeted therapy-based treatment, classified as Type: Evidence based with Evidence quality: Intermediate and Strength of recommendation: Moderate. Overall, there is a lack of head-to-head trials; therefore, there is insufficient evidence to recommend one regimen over another, and the patient and the clinician should discuss differences in treatment schedules, routes, and toxicities during the decision-making process, after which options are listed.

Background

Breast cancer is a prevalent malignancy and the primary cause of cancer-related death among women globally. It constitutes 15.5% of all female cancer fatalities, with around 2.3 million new breast cancer cases recorded worldwide in 2020 and approximately 685,000 deaths. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database of the National Cancer Institute in the United States, it is estimated that there will be about 297,790 new cases of breast cancer and 43,170 breast cancer-related deaths in 2023. These account for 15.2% of all new cancer cases and 7.1% of all cancer-related deaths, respectively. Most breast cancer cases occur in females (approximately 99%), but there are approximately 2500 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed in males annually in the United States. In clinical practice, breast cancer is commonly subtyped by hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The subtype of HR-positive/HER2-negative represents the most prevalent among all racial groups, accounting for approximately 68% of cases across all ethnicities. Historically, the estrogen receptor signaling pathway primarily drives cancer cell growth and survival in these tumors, these tumors were treated with endocrine therapy (ET). However, due to limitations in single-agent endocrine therapy efficacy and the presence of primary or secondary drug resistance, endocrine monotherapy is increasingly insufficient for clinical treatment. The development of targeted therapies including Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), particularly in combination with ET, has revolutionized the management of these tumors. Nonetheless, the comparative efficacy and safety of most first-line and second/further-line treatments remain uncertain. While some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have verified the safety and efficacy of targeted therapies or combined targeted endocrine therapy for patients with HR + /HER2 − advanced breast cancer, the absence of head-to-head comparisons prevents us from determining which treatment offers the greatest survival advantage.

### Clinical outcomes of de novo metastatic HER2-low breast cancer: a national cancer database analysis [^112rSYK5]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

The survival advantage of HER2 low breast cancer seems mostly from chemotherapy in the front line, regardless of tumor HR status. However, we did not observe a similar survival advantage in those who only received hormonal therapy in the first course of treatment. No previous study has examined the interaction between treatment type and survival advantage in HER2-low breast cancer. Considering that low-grade tumor tends to be less sensitive to chemotherapy, it is surprising to observe the survival benefit of HER2-low tumors only in patients who received chemotherapy at the front line. Nonetheless, as the NCDB only reports the type of cancer treatment without details for further analyses, future studies are warranted to confirm this interaction in another cohort and explore its potential mechanism.

The major strength of this study is that the NCDB, a national cancer outcome database, fully reflects the diversity of breast cancer patients and the treatments in the US. With a considerably more extensive and more diverse sample, we examined the difference between HER2-low and HER2-zero tumors in most subgroups with adequate statistical power. Another strength of this study is that we examined the interactions between the type of treatment and survival outcomes, which has not been reported previously. Admittedly, our results are only hypothesis-generating due to the observational nature of this study and the limitations of the NCDB dataset. Further studies are warranted to explore this interaction in other real-world outcome datasets with more treatment information.

### Systemic treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^113GbPsR]. JCO Global Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Second-line therapy — HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer: "HER2-targeted therapy should be given based on prior therapy and HR status".

### Association between progression-free survival and overall survival in women receiving first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer: evidence from the ESME real-world database [^113itR4j]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite a decrease of the mortality rate, breast cancer (BC) is still the major cause of cancer death among women worldwide. BC is a heterogeneous disease and can be classified according to the tumor immunohistochemical profile, characterized by the presence or absence of hormone-receptor expression (HR-positive [HR +]/HR-negative [HR −] status) and/or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression and/or HER2gene amplification (HER2 − positive [HER2 +]/HER2 − negative status [HER2 −]) in the tumor cells. Up to 30% of BC patients will experience distant metastases over their lifetime. Metastatic breast cancer (mBC) is a disease with poor prognosis, with median overall survival (OS) ranging from 14.8 months for triple-negative mBC (TN mBC, defined as the lack of HR expression and of HER2 over-expression/amplification) to around 5 years for HER2 + disease respectively. The selection of the most appropriate treatment depends on the characteristics of the patient (age, performance status), the adjuvant treatment (type and duration of therapies for early BC), and the metastatic disease (number of metastatic sites, type of involved organs, time to metastatic occurrence, molecular profile). In the metastatic setting, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or targeted therapy are the recommended treatments, as induction or maintenance treatment, according to the tumor molecular profile.

In cancer randomized controlled trials (RCT), drug efficacy is assessed using OS, considered as the gold standard efficacy endpoint. However, in the advanced setting, the multiple lines of treatments may affect OS and thus bias the assessment of the true treatment effect. In addition, observing a benefit on OS may require a large number of patients and extensive follow-up, limiting the feasibility of clinical trials based on OS as the primary outcome. In this context, alternative endpoints that could capture treatment benefit accurately and be measurable earlier is central for the evolution of clinical research in oncology. Progression-free survival (PFS), although recognized as presenting some limitations, has been used increasingly over the past decades and is now the most common primary efficacy endpoint in mBC clinical trials. The use of PFS relies on the hypothesis that it can adequately replace OS, i.e. be a valid surrogate of OS; otherwise, this might lead to the marketing of drugs that do not ultimately improve OS. PFS however has not been validated as a surrogate endpoint in the context of mBC.

### Are NCCN resource-stratified guidelines for breast cancer systemic therapy achievable? A population-based study of global need and economic impact [^116UG9sM]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

HER2 and Immunotherapy Need

HER2 therapies are recommended in 12% of patients in Enhanced and Maximal, and none in Basic and Core settings. Merging these data with GLOBOCAN cancer incidence, almost 9% of all patients with BC in 2018 have an indication for HER2 therapies, but only 8% in 2040 because of rising incidence in L and LM countries. The absolute number of patients recommended HER2 therapies increases from 183,943 to 224,131 between 2018 and 2040 because of population growth (Table 1). First-course immunotherapy for metastatic triple-negative BC is only recommended in the Maximal setting and is indicated in 0.2% of patients in 2018 (3,946 persons).

### Treatment of metastatic breast cancer in a real-world scenario: is progression-free survival with first line predictive of benefit from second and later lines? [^113XRKxw]. The Oncologist (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite the availability of several therapeutic options for metastatic breast cancer (MBC), no robust predictive factors are available to help clinical decision making. Nevertheless, a decreasing benefit from first line to subsequent lines of treatment is commonly observed. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of benefit from first-line therapy on outcome with subsequent lines.

Methods

We analyzed a consecutive series of 472 MBC patients treated with chemotherapy (CT) and/or endocrine therapy (ET) between 2004 and 2012. We evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) at first (PFS1), second, third, and fourth therapeutic lines, according to treatment (ET and/or CT) and tumor subtypes.

Results

In the whole cohort, median overall survival was 34 months, and median PFS1 was 9 months. A 6-month benefit was shown by 289 patients (63.5%) at first line, 128 (40.5%) at second line, 76 (33.8%) at third line, and 34 (23.3%) at fourth line. Not having a 6-month benefit at PFS1 was associated with less chance of benefit at second line (odds ratio [OR]: 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29–0.77, p = .0026) and at any line beyond first (OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.24–0.62, p < .0001). In the total series, after stratification for tumor subtypes, a strong predictive effect was observed among HER2-positive tumors (OR: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.05–0.73, p = .0152).

Conclusion

Our results suggest that the absence of at least a 6-month benefit in terms of PFS with first-line therapy predicts a reduced probability of benefit from subsequent therapeutic lines, especially in HER2-positive disease.

Implications For Practice

This study supports evidence showing that the absence of a 6-month benefit in terms of progression-free survival with first-line therapy predicts a lack of benefit from subsequent therapeutic lines in metastatic breast cancer. The random distribution of benefit experienced by a subset of the cohort further spurs an interest in identifying predictive factors capable of identifying the most appropriate therapeutic strategy.

### Advances in first-line treatment for patients with HER-2 + metastatic breast cancer [^112pwb2k]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The prognosis for breast cancer patients overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 has changed with anti-HER-2-targeted therapy. Although anti-HER-2 therapy with trastuzumab and chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment, the best therapeutic regimen has yet to be defined, and new strategies are evolving.

Methods

A literature review of well-established and recently published trials, reviews, and ongoing clinical trials addressing first-line treatment for HER-2(+) metastatic breast cancer patients was performed.

Results

Taxanes are the agents most commonly used in combination with trastuzumab, but other chemotherapy drugs, such as anthracyclines, vinorelbine, and gemcitabine and triple-combination therapies including platinum compounds, capecitabine, and taxanes have been studied. The combination of aromatase inhibitors with anti-HER-2 therapies is a new therapeutic option for some patients who coexpress HER-2 and hormone receptors, although its activity observed in randomized clinical trials seems to be inferior to that of chemotherapy plus anti-HER-2 therapies. In addition, new anti-HER-2 therapies have shown activity in HER-2(+) tumors, both alone and in combination with trastuzumab.

Conclusions

Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is the current standard of care for the upfront treatment of HER-2(+) breast cancer patients, though other anti-HER-2-targeting agents may appear as new standards in the upcoming years.

### Clinical outcomes of de novo metastatic HER2-low breast cancer: a national cancer database analysis [^1154Bh1Z]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

The development of novel anti-HER2 drugs opens new treatment options for women with breast cancers, including lower expression of HER2. The epidemiology and clinical outcome of metastatic HER2-low breast cancer remain not well described. We designed a retrospective cohort study of the 2010–2017 National Cancer Database (NCDB) was designed to compare the overall survival of HER2-low and HER2-zero de novo metastatic breast cancer with systemic therapy. Multivariable Cox regression models were performed to estimate hazard ratios (HR), adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors. A total of 20,636 of 30,929 (66.7%) patients were HER2-low and 10,293 (33.3%) were HER2-zero. When stratified by hormonal receptor status, HER2-low tumors account for 18,066 (69.7%) cases in HR+/HER2- population and 2570 (51.4%) cases in HR-/HER2- population. The prevalence of HER2-low tumors was similar across racial groups with a slightly lower prevalence among the Hispanic population. Women with HER2-low tumors had longer overall survival (OS) than women with Her2-zero tumors in both HR-positive (median OS 39.0 months vs. 37.1 months; adjusted HR: 0.95, 95%CI (0.91–0.98)) and HR-negative groups (median OS 15.8 months vs. 14.1 months; adjusted HR: 0.92 95%CI (0.86–0.98)). The survival advantage was primarily observed in patients who received chemotherapy as their first line of treatment (HR 0.92 95%CI (0.88–0.96) vs. 0.99 95%CI (0.94–1.04), p-interaction = 0.04). In summary, HER2-low tumors, irrespective of hormone receptor status, have better survival than HER2-zero tumors in the de-novo metastatic setting. The survival advantage was primarily observed in patients who received chemotherapy in the first line.

### Systemic therapy for advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^115sSRWw]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

HER2-positive advanced breast cancer — first-line context and evidence gaps are as follows: For patients whose cancers progressed after > 12 months after the end of trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy or who had de novo metastatic disease, the standard first-line therapy remains the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane (either paclitaxel or docetaxel). There is a lack of current published data on the benefit of endocrine therapy in this maintenance regimen of trastuzumab and pertuzumab in patients with hormone receptor–positive HER2-positive cancers, and the optimal duration of dual HER2 therapy in patients achieving complete remission remains unknown. The optimal regimen for patients relapsing after neoadjuvant dual HER2 blockade followed by postneoadjuvant T-DM1 is unknown; these patients may, theoretically, benefit from agents not previously received if relapse occurred within ≤ 12 months, although there is currently no evidence to make a formal recommendation. The Expert Panel encourages future studies and notes real-world data could be valuable in this scenario.

### First-line bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer: pooled and subgroup analyses of data from 2447 patients [^117Jg7e1]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Bevacizumab has consistently demonstrated improved progression-free survival (PFS) and response rate when combined with first-line chemotherapy for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (mBC). However, the lack of a significant overall survival (OS) difference continues to attract debate, and identification of patients deriving greatest benefit from bevacizumab remains elusive.

Patients and Methods

Individual patient data from three randomised phase III trials in the first-line HER2-negative mBC setting were analysed, focusing specifically on efficacy in poor-prognosis patients.

Results

The meta-analysis (n = 2447) demonstrated a PFS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57–0.71; median 9.2 months with bevacizumab versus 6.7 months with non-bevacizumab therapy) and response rate of 49% versus 32%, respectively. The OS HR was 0.97 (95% CI 0.86–1.08); median 26.7 versus 26.4 months, respectively. In patients with triple-negative mBC, the HRs for PFS and OS were 0.63 (95% CI 0.52–0.76) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.79–1.16), respectively. Median PFS was 8.1 months with bevacizumab versus 5.4 months with chemotherapy alone, median OS was 18.9 versus 17.5 months, respectively, and 1-year OS rates were 71% versus 65%.

Conclusions

Bevacizumab improves efficacy, including 1-year OS rates, both overall and in subgroups of poor-prognosis patients with limited treatment options.

### Systemic treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline Q and a… [^115bQwkh]. JCO Global Oncology (2024). High credibility.

HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer — first- and subsequent-line therapy, including resource-constrained alternatives: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–targeted therapy is recommended for patients with HER2–positive advanced breast cancer, except for those with cardiovascular contraindications, and in special circumstances such as low disease burden and/or a long disease free- interval clinicians may offer first–line endocrine therapy alone. For first-line treatment, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane, or endocrine therapy are recommended; in resource-constrained settings, if pertuzumab isn't available clinicians may offer either chemotherapy plus trastuzumab or chemotherapy, with additional alternatives including trastuzumab emtansine, capecitabine plus lapatinib, chemotherapy or endocrine therapy plus trastuzumab (or either without trastuzumab if unavailable), and navelbine with trastuzumab if taxanes are not available, with platinum therapy as another possible companion. In the second-line setting, or relapse within 12 months of adjuvant therapy, HER2-targeted therapy should be given based on prior therapy, hormone receptor status, and availability; while trastuzumab deruxtecan is the Maximal setting–recommended second-line option, in resource-constrained settings chemotherapy or endocrine therapy may be offered with or without alternate HER2-targeted therapy regimens in a tiered order.

### Real-world treatment patterns and outcomes of patients with hormone receptor-positive / HER2-low metastatic breast cancer treated with chemotherapy [^112AQMdx]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This analysis from a retrospective, multi-site, United S.tates, primarily community oncology-based physician-abstracted medical chart review study describes the demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes of patients who received 1L CT or CT after an HT-based regimen for HR+ /HER2-low mBC as a part of routine clinical care. Our real-world investigation revealed several key findings.

First, in the real-world patient population included in this analysis, CT utilization increased in later lines of treatment, with the majority of patients receiving CT after 2 lines of prior HT-based regimen, which is accordance to the NCCN guidelines. Switching from an HT-based regimen to CT may be due to the development of endocrine resistance, though other reasons for switching cannot be ruled out. Primary endocrine resistance has typically been defined in the literature as a relapse within 2 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment or disease progression during the first 6 months of 1L endocrine therapy for advanced or mBC. Future research is needed to understand how physicians define endocrine resistance on a case-by-case basis in the real-world practice setting and rationale for switching to CT.

### Clinical outcomes of de novo metastatic HER2-low breast cancer: a national cancer database analysis [^113UbHD3]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study found that nearly 70% of HR+/HER2− metastatic breast cancers and 50% of HR−/HER2− metastatic breast cancers had low HER2 expression, with slight variation across racial groups. HER2-low breast cancers had marginally better OS than HER2-zero breast cancers, regardless of their hormone receptor status marginal. The observed survival advantage was primarily observed in white women who received chemotherapy in their first course of treatment.

Understanding the prevalence and clinical outcomes of HER2-low breast cancer may inform the future development of anti-HER2 therapeutics. The interaction between chemotherapy and the survival advantage of HER2-low disease may explain why low HER2 tumors are sensitive to novel antibody–drug conjugates but not traditional anti-HER2 antibodies. Despite our observation, HER2-low tumors had a better outcome than HER2-zero tumors. While the DESTINY-Breast 04 trial changed the clinical practice with a meaningful improvement in OS and PFS for women with pretreated metastatic HR+/HER2-low diseases, researchers need to explore more treatment options in the first-line setting. Our results suggest novel antibody–drug conjugates may have a potential role in the first line especially given the chemosensitivity of these tumors and other studies reporting suboptimal efficacy with CDK 4/6 inhibitors in HER2-low tumors.

Our study is the first comprehensive data to provide epidemiological and outcome data of HER2-low tumors in the black and Hispanic populations. Most previous studies reported white and Chinese populations but included fewer black and Hispanic populations –. We found a similar prevalence of HER2- low tumors across racial groups in the metastatic setting. In addition, white and non-white patients with HER2-low tumors shared a similar survival advantage in the univariable analysis. However, this survival advantage disappeared in the non-white population with the adjustment of covariates. It suggests that other socio-demographic and clinical factors may fully explain this survival advantage. Another possible explanation for the non-significant results among non-whites is the statistical model overfitting. Future research warrants exploring any biological difference in HER2-low tumors between white and non-white populations. These new findings also suggest the importance of enrollment of non-white women in future clinical trials of HER2-low breast cancer.

### Real-world treatment patterns and outcomes of patients with hormone receptor-positive / HER2-low metastatic breast cancer treated with chemotherapy [^112nr4uY]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Endocrine resistance occurs due to several molecular mechanisms and is defined per the international guidelines as primary [as a relapse within two years while on adjuvant HT-based treatment or disease progression within the first six months of 1L HT-based treatment for mBC] or secondary resistance [as a relapse while on adjuvant HT-based treatment but after first two years or within the first year of completing adjuvant endocrine therapy or progression ≥ six-months after initiating 1L HT-based treatment for mBC. Among patients receiving an HT-based regimen, endocrine resistance frequently emerges as early as two years with an incidence of 20% to 25%, and many patients subsequently receive CT.

Given the fact that a high proportion (50%-60%) of HR + mBC is characterized by HER2-low expression, and that prognosis is generally poor among the HER2-low population relative to HER2-positive patients, understanding the patient characteristics, current treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes of patients with HR+/HER2-low mBC treated in the real-world setting is paramount in the development of innovative, effective therapies. However, data specific to the treatment journey and clinical outcomes of patients with HR+/HER2-low mBC treated in the real-world setting are limited. The primary objective of this analysis was to describe the characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes of U.S. patients treated with CT for HR+/HER2-low mBC in a real-world setting. We specifically assessed differences in characteristics and outcomes among patients who received CT as their 1L treatment vs those who received CT following an HT-based regimen.

### The breast cancer classifier refines molecular breast cancer classification to delineate the HER2-low subtype [^115nnqCK]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

The HER2-E (HER2-enriched) intrinsic subtype, characterized by higher expression of ERBB2 and proliferation-related genes, shows the best response to anti-HER2 therapies both in adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings, irrespective of the clinical status of HER2. However, only about 50% of clinically HER2-positive (3+ based on immunohistochemistry (IHC)) tumors are HER2-E; intriguingly, this molecular subtype also appears in clinically HER2-negative breast cancer based on IHC, which currently does not receive HER2-targeted treatments.

Recent studies comparing the efficacy of different assays in determining HER2 status have shed light on a distinct subtype known as HER2-low –, defined by IHC staining as 1+ or 2+ without amplification. The molecular characteristics and prognostic analyses associated with IHC HER2-low breast cancer were also analyzed to uncover different clinical behaviors and responses to treatment, highlighting the absence of distinct prognostic and biological correlates. Emerging evidence from clinical trials showcasing significant clinical benefits associated with the use of novel HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in advanced HER2-low breast cancers challenges the binary categorization of HER2 status in breast cancers. The recent FDA approval of the first treatment targeting HER2 in HER2-low breast cancer indicates the clinical recognition and treatment advancements for this new subtype.

### Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone as second-line treatment for patients with HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer after first-line treatment with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (TANIA): an open-label, randomised phase 3 trial [^111XDCdo]. The Lancet: Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Combining bevacizumab with first-line or second-line chemotherapy improves progression-free survival in HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. We assessed the efficacy and safety of further bevacizumab therapy in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer whose disease had progressed after treatment with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy.

Methods

In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients who had HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer that had progressed after receiving 12 weeks or more of first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy from 118 centres in 12 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a central interactive voice response system using a block randomisation schedule (block size four) stratified by hormone receptor status, first-line progression-free survival, selected chemotherapy, and lactate dehydrogenase concentration, to receive second-line single-agent chemotherapy either alone or with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Second-line therapy was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. At progression, patients randomly assigned to chemotherapy alone received third-line chemotherapy without bevacizumab; those randomly assigned to bevacizumab continued bevacizumab with third-line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival from randomisation to second-line progression or death in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is ongoing, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01250379.

Findings

Between Feb 17, 2011, and April 3, 2013, 494 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (247 in each group). The median duration of follow-up at the time of this prespecified primary progression-free survival analysis was 15.9 months (IQR 9.1–21.7) in the chemotherapy-alone group and 16.1 months (10.6–22.7) in the combination group. Progression-free survival was significantly longer for those patients treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy than for those with chemotherapy alone (median: 6.3 months [95% CI 5.4–7.2] vs 4.2 months [3.9–4.7], respectively, stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0.75 [95% CI 0.61–0.93], two-sided stratified log-rank p = 0.0068). The most common grade 3 or more adverse events were hypertension (33 [13%] of 245 patients receiving bevacizumab plus chemotherapy vs 17 [7%] of 238 patients receiving chemotherapy alone), neutropenia (29 [12%] vs 20 [8%]), and hand-foot syndrome (27 [11%] vs 25 [11%]). Grade 3 proteinuria occurred in 17 (7%) of 245 patients receiving combination therapy and one (< 1%) of 238 patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Serious adverse events were reported in 61 (25%) of 245 patients receiving bevacizumab plus chemotherapy versus 44 (18%) of 238 patients receiving chemotherapy alone.

Interpretation

These results suggest that continued VEGF inhibition with further bevacizumab is a valid treatment option for patients with locally recurrent or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer whose disease was stabilised or responded to first-line bevacizumab with chemotherapy.

HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer — management after progression on trastuzumab: In those with disease progression on first-line trastuzumab-containing regimens, the NCCN Panel recommends continuation of HER2 blockade, and this recommendation also applies to patients diagnosed with metastatic disease after prior adjuvant trastuzumab. Pertuzumab is active in patients beyond the first-line setting, with a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase II study (n = 66) of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab reporting an ORR of 24.2% (16 patients out of 66), a median PFS of 15.5 months (range, 0.9–17.0 months), and a median duration of response of 5.8 months (range, 2.9–15.3 months). In a cohort whose disease progressed during prior trastuzumab-based therapy and received pertuzumab monotherapy (n = 29), those with disease progression who then added trastuzumab (n = 17) had ORR and clinical benefit rate of 17.6% and 41.2%, compared with 3.4% and 10.3% on pertuzumab monotherapy. For patients with disease progression after trastuzumab-based therapy without pertuzumab, a line of therapy containing both trastuzumab plus pertuzumab with or without a cytotoxic agent may be considered.

Systemic treatment — ER- and/or PR-positive; HER2-positive recurrent unresectable or stage IV (M1) disease: For Progression on first-line endocrine therapy ± HER2-targeted therapy, consider alternate endocrine therapy, if not endocrine refractory ± HER2-targeted therapy; if there is No clinical benefit after up to 3 sequential endocrine therapy regimens ± HER2-targeted therapy or Symptomatic visceral disease, use Systemic therapy ± HER2-targeted therapy until progression. For Progression on systemic therapy + HER2-targeted therapy, Alternate systemic therapy + HER2-targeted therapy and Continue HER2-targeted therapy until progression. Most patients will be candidates for multiple lines of systemic therapy to palliate advanced breast cancer, and at each reassessment clinicians should assess value of ongoing treatment, the risks and benefits of an additional line of systemic therapy, patient performance status, and patient preferences through a shared decision-making process. Consider no further HER2-targeted therapy and continue supportive care; see NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care and NCCN Guidelines for Supportive Care. The potential side effects of additional lines of therapy may outweigh any clinical benefit in a patient who has a compromised performance status, and patient preferences must be taken into account. The optimal duration of trastuzumab in patients with long-term control of disease is unknown. False-negative ER and/or PR determinations occur, and there may be discordance between the ER and/or PR determination between the primary and metastatic tumor(s); endocrine therapy with its low attendant toxicity may be considered in patients with non-visceral or asymptomatic visceral tumors. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Real-world treatment patterns and outcomes of patients with hormone receptor-positive / HER2-low metastatic breast cancer treated with chemotherapy [^116kB27a]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for practice

The limited real-world evidence on patients undergoing CT for HR+/HER2-low mBC underscores the significance of this retrospective study of patients receiving CT as 1L therapy or post-HT. Findings underscore the relatively prevalent real-world use of 1L CT and CT post-HT-based treatment in this setting with suboptimal clinical outcomes, emphasizing the imperative for more efficacious therapeutic alternatives than those available during this study period. The advent of HER2-targeted treatment for this indication will likely help to address this. The data prompt a reevaluation of treatment strategies and advocate for the real-world incorporation of novel interventions to improve outcomes.

### Patient-reported outcomes from DESTINY-breast04: trastuzumab deruxtecan versus physician's choice of chemotherapy in patients with HER2-low mBC [^114j1Vho]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC), clinical treatment decisions are based on strategies to extend life expectancy, relieve cancer-related symptoms, and optimize health-related quality of life (QoL). Classic clinical endpoints in oncology trials (eg, overall survival [OS], progression-free survival [PFS], and adverse events [AEs]) provide requisite information about the efficacy and safety of novel treatments and inform care guidelines. Although these endpoints have historically dominated the paradigm that determines care pathways, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are now commonly seen as meaningful complementary endpoints that offer important information concerning the impact of a treatment on patients' health-related QoL. Together, classic clinical endpoints and PROs from clinical trials can help capture the full therapeutic profile of a new treatment, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

### Baseline characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes in patients with HER2-Positive metastatic breast cancer by hormone receptor status from systHERs [^113mw3JM]. Clinical Cancer Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We report treatments and outcomes in a contemporary patient population with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) by hormone receptor (HR) status from the Systemic Therapies for HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Study (SystHERs).

Experimental Design

SystHERs (NCT01615068) was an observational, prospective registry study of U.S.-based patients with newly diagnosed HER2-positive MBC. Endpoints included treatment patterns and clinical outcomes.

Results

Of 977 eligible patients (enrolled from 2012 to 2016), 70.1% (n = 685) had HR-positive and 29.9% (n = 292) had HR-negative disease. Overall, 59.1% (405/685) of patients with HR-positive disease received any first-line endocrine therapy (with or without HER2-targeted therapy or chemotherapy); 34.9% (239/685) received HER2-targeted therapy + chemotherapy + sequential endocrine therapy. Patients with HR-positive versus HR-negative disease had longer median overall survival (OS; 53.0 vs 43.4 months; hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.87). Compared with patients with high HR-positive staining (10%-100%, n = 550), those with low HR-positive staining (1%-9%, n = 60) received endocrine therapy less commonly (64.2% vs 33.3%) and had shorter median OS (53.8 vs 40.1 months). Similar median OS (43.4 vs 40.1 months) was observed in patients with HR-negative versus low HR-positive tumors (1%-9%).

Conclusions

Despite evidence that first-line HER2-targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and sequential endocrine therapy improves survival in patients with HR-positive, HER2-positive disease, only 34.9% of patients in this real-world setting received such treatment. Patients with low tumor HR positivity (1%-9%) had lower endocrine therapy use and worse survival than those with high tumor HR positivity (10%-100%).

### Anticipating changes in the HER2 status of breast tumours with disease progression-towards better treatment decisions in the new era of HER2-low breast cancers [^114UVksN]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Our finding that the HER2 status changes with disease progression, with a higher HER2 expression at relapse, is a very important result. Indeed, it may lead to increasing the proportion of patients who would be offered new anti-HER2 ADCs and who could benefit from these treatments, especially at advanced stages of the disease after the failure of multiple lines of treatment. These statements are all the more true for patients with HR-positive BCs among whom the enrichment of HER2-low tumours in advanced disease is the most prevalent. It also constitutes a real opportunity for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). These tumours are all HR-negative and HER2-negative by definition. However, this definition was coined before the category of HER2-low tumours was distinguished and so some of these seemingly HER2-negative tumours may actually be HER2-low. Even though the prevalence of the HER2-low status among TNBCs is lower than among other BC types, it is still not negligible. In our study, over a third of primary TNBCs were HER2-low at diagnosis (38.8%). Therefore, a possibility of identifying a subgroup of TNBC patients who may benefit from new anti-HER2 therapies is particularly promising, especially given that these tumours are usually associated with poor prognosis due to the scarcity of effective therapeutic options. All these data strongly support the imperative need to retest breast tumours at relapse, regardless of the hormonal status of the primary tumour, in order to identify patients eligible for these new therapies.

### What's so special about [symbol: see text] trastuzumab? [^116k5Qj4]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2002). Low credibility.

The growth and multiplication of cells are regulated, in part, by polypeptide growth factors that bind to high-affinity receptors typically found on the plasma membrane. One such receptor is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). In around a quarter of all primary breast cancers, cells possess abnormally high numbers of (overexpress) HER2. [symbol: see text] Trastuzumab (pronounced tra-stoo-zoo-mab; Herceptin-Roche), a recombinant humanised mouse monoclonal antibody directed against HER2, is available as a treatment for certain patients with metastatic breast cancer. It is licensed as a first-line treatment in combination with [symbol: see text] paclitaxel for those whose cancer cells overexpress HER2 and for whom an anthracycline is unsuitable, and as a third-line treatment used alone when treatment with (where appropriate) an anthracycline, a taxane and hormonal therapy has failed. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recommended trastuzumab as a treatment option for metastatic breast cancer in accordance with the licensed indications.

For general HER2-positive disease, the basic tier lists "Palliativea and best supportive care", the limited tier offers chemotherapy where "options include anthracyclines (note: doxorubicin on EML), once weekly paclitaxel, docetaxel, carboplatin Capecitabine", and the enhanced tier includes "HER2-targeted therapy combined with chemotherapy" with "Options include trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane", and notes "If pertuzumab not available, then chemotherapy and trastuzumab" and "If taxane not available, then vinorelbine or platinum". For HER2-positive, HR-positive disease in "special circumstances such as low disease burden" or comorbidities, basic care includes "Single-agent hormone therapy (tamoxifen) Hormonal therapy with ovarian ablation", limited care includes "Single-agent chemotherapy with anthracyclines, once weekly paclitaxel, docetaxel, carboplatin, CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil) Hormonal therapy alone (if AIb and tamoxifen available)", and enhanced care lists "HER2-targeted therapy (trastuzumab + pertuzumab) with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy plus HER2-targeted therapy or hormonal therapy alone (latter in special circumstances)". The guideline states, "Clinicians should recommend HER2-targeted therapy-based combinations for first-line treatment, except for highly selected patients with ER-positive or progesterone receptor–positive and HER2-positive disease for whom clinicians may use endocrine therapy alone".

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies that met the following inclusion criteria and provided a clear description of patient characteristics were included in the NMA:
Population: Women with HR + /HER2 − postmenopausal advanced breast cancer.
Interventions and comparisons: Single-agent chemotherapy, endocrine therapy monotherapy, targeted therapy, and combinations of endocrine therapy with targeted therapy were considered.
Outcome: The HRs of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and the objective response rate were examined. Adverse events (AEs) incidences were categorized into multiple groups: AEs of any grade, grade 3–5 AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs leading to death. Attention was also given to the incidence rates of the three most common specific AEs, which included both hematologic and non-hematologic types, across any grade and specifically within grades 3–5. The presence of at least one Kaplan–Meier curve for either OS or PFS was a requirement. If specific data related to postmenopausal women were provided in any RCTs, those trials were included in this study.
Study design: phase II or phase III RCTs.

Some articles were excluded based on the following criteria:
Papers published before 2007.
Non-RCTs or single-arm RCTs.
Trials with unclear clinical outcomes.
RCTs that included only premenopausal patients and HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer patients alone.

All retrieved articles were imported into Note Express (version 3.2.0.7535). The literature was reviewed by two researchers (HS and MZ). Disagreements among the reviewers were settled through discussion. A third reviewer (GY) was consulted if necessary. Titles and abstracts were first screened. The full text of the literature selected for inclusion was then evaluated. Finally, the included literature was reviewed for the inclusion of the most recent data from the relevant studies.

Data extraction

Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were extracted independently by two investigators for participants in each treatment group in the following study designs: RCTs' names, sample size, median age, and follow-up time. Clinical outcomes extracted included HRs of OS and PFS, any grade AEs, grade 3–5 AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment, and AEs leading to death. Additionally, we considered the three most common AEs, encompassing both hematologic and non-hematologic types, across all grades and specifically within grades 3–5. Survival data from the independent review committee were prioritized. For trials where independent review committee data were not available, investigator-assessed outcomes were extracted.

### Phase III, double-blind, randomized study comparing lapatinib plus paclitaxel with placebo plus paclitaxel as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer [^115GP5sr]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/ErbB2), is effective against HER-2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This phase III trial evaluated the efficacy of lapatinib in HER-2-negative and HER-2-uncharacterized MBC.

Patients and Methods

Women with MBC were randomly assigned to first-line therapy with paclitaxel 175 mg/m² every 3 weeks plus lapatinib 1,500 mg/d or placebo. A preplanned retrospective evaluation of HER-2 status was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).

Results

In the intent-to-treat population (n = 579), there were no significant differences in TTP, EFS, or OS between treatment arms, although differences in ORR and CBR were noted. In 86 HER-2-positive patients (15%), treatment with paclitaxel-lapatinib resulted in statistically significant improvements in TTP, EFS, ORR, and CBR compared with paclitaxel-placebo. No differences between treatment groups were observed for any end point in HER-2-negative patients. The most common adverse events were alopecia, rash, and diarrhea. The incidence of diarrhea and rash was significantly higher in the paclitaxel-lapatinib arm. The rate of cardiac events was low, and no difference was observed between treatment arms.

Conclusion

Patients with HER-2-negative or HER-2-untested MBC did not benefit from the addition of lapatinib to paclitaxel. However, first-line therapy with paclitaxel-lapatinib significantly improved clinical outcomes in HER-2-positive patients. Prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of this combination is ongoing in early and metastatic HER-2-positive breast cancer patients.

### HER2-low-positive breast cancer: evolution from primary tumor to residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment [^117BESpK]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is recognized as a highly heterogeneous disease in terms of biological features, prognosis and treatment sensitivity. In the past decades access to anti-HER2 drugs has been driven by the dichotomy between HER2-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer established in the context of pivotal trials of trastuzumab, however recent findings have challenged this dogma. In particular, early-phase clinical trials reported promising anti-tumor activity of the anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) Trastuzumab-Deruxtecan and Trastuzumab-Duocarmazine in patients traditionally classified as having HER2-negative breast cancer though exhibiting HER2-low-positive expression (IHC scores 1+ or 2+ in the absence of HER2 gene amplification by ISH). In addition, recently, a phase II study treating 48 heavily pre-treated hormone-receptor (HR)-positive-HER2-low-positive advanced breast cancer patients with the anti-HER2/HER3 ADC zenocutuzumab (in combination with the last endocrine agent on which the patients had previously progressed immediately before the study entry), reported promising preliminary results in terms of clinical activity and safety. These findings provided the proof of principle that novel anti-HER2 ADCs may exploit, to be active, the mere presence of the target, rather than a proven oncogene addiction to HER2. Two phase III clinical trials randomizing HER2-low-positive metastatic breast cancer patients to receive either Trastuzumab-Deruxtecan or treatment of physician's choice are currently ongoing and results are pending (NCT03734029 — Destiny-Breast04 met its primary endpoint — data not presented yet, NCT04494425 — Destiny-Breast06). In addition, several other diverse combinations of anti-HER2 agents plus endocrine therapy/CDK 4/6 inhibitors/immunotherapy/other targeted agents are currently being tested in early-phase clinical trials, thus emphasizing the fervent interest on this dawning breast cancer subtype. On the same grounds, ongoing efforts have been directed towards uncovering whether HER2-low-positive tumors may retain possible unique traits –, however, so far, solid evidence supporting HER2-low-positive breast cancer as a distinct biological and/or clinical entity is lacking.

### Antitumor activity and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with HER2-Low-expressing advanced breast cancer: results from a phase Ib study [^112VUbUQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This first-in-human clinical study investigating the novel HER2-targeting ADC, T-DXd, demonstrated substantial antitumor activity and a generally manageable safety profile for the treatment of patients with advanced/unresectable or metastatic HER2-low–expressing breast cancer. Based on current standards, the majority of patients in this trial would be classified as having HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer in the clinic, with extensive prior treatment. For this patient population, the current standard of care after exhaustion of hormonal therapies consists of single-agent chemotherapies. These agents provide limited benefit in this setting, with a median PFS of about 3 to 5 months in many studies. - Although limited in sample size, the PFS of T-DXd in this study of heavily pretreated patients compares favorably with these previous reports and is encouraging for patients with breast cancer with few or no remaining treatment options.

Results of the dose escalation (part 1) have been previously reported, with doses of 5.4 and 6.4 mg/kg given intravenously once every 3 weeks, identified as the RDE. In the dose expansion (part 2), the confirmed ORR by investigator assessment was 59.5% and 43.2% in patients with refractory HER2-positive breast or gastric cancer, respectively, and T-DXd exhibited a manageable safety profile. We report a confirmed ORR of 37.0% in patients with HER2-low–expressing breast cancer.

CDK4/6i therapies are clinically effective in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant, or as monotherapy, and are recommended as part of first-line and second-line treatments for patients with HR-positive metastatic breast cancer. Although only 16 patients in our study had any prior CDK4/6i therapy, approximately 44% responded to treatment with T-DXd, suggesting that prior CDK4/6i may not interfere with clinical activity of T-DXd. Additional studies with more patients are needed to confirm these results.

### Systemic therapy for patients with advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^1111cgTG]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose To update evidence-based guideline recommendations for practicing oncologists and others on systemic therapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced breast cancer to 2018. Methods An Expert Panel conducted a targeted systematic literature review (for both systemic treatment and CNS metastases) and identified 622 articles. Outcomes of interest included overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events. Results Of the 622 publications identified and reviewed, no additional evidence was identified that would warrant a change to the 2014 recommendations. Recommendations HER2-targeted therapy is recommended for patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, except for those with clinical congestive heart failure or significantly compromised left ventricular ejection fraction, who should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and taxane for first-line treatment and trastuzumab emtansine for second-line treatment are recommended. In the third-line setting, clinicians should offer other HER2-targeted therapy combinations or trastuzumab emtansine (if not previously administered) and may offer pertuzumab if the patient has not previously received it. Optimal duration of chemotherapy is at least 4 to 6 months or until maximum response, depending on toxicity and in the absence of progression. HER2-targeted therapy can continue until time of progression or unacceptable toxicities. For patients with HER2-positive and estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer, clinicians may recommend either standard first-line therapy or, for selected patients, endocrine therapy plus HER2-targeted therapy or endocrine therapy alone.

### Emerging landscape of targeted therapy of breast cancers with low human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein expression [^114uYMZy]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Context —

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in breast cancer is currently classified as negative or positive for selecting patients for anti-HER2 targeted therapy. The evolution of the HER2 status has included a new HER2-low category defined as an HER2 immunohistochemistry score of 1+ or 2+ without gene amplification. This new category opens the door to a targetable HER2-low breast cancer population for which new treatments may be effective.

Objective —

To review the current literature on the emerging category of breast cancers with low HER2 protein expression, including the clinical, histopathologic, and molecular features, and outline the clinical trials and best practice recommendations for identifying HER2-low-expressing breast cancers by immunohistochemistry.

Data Sources —

We conducted a literature review based on peer-reviewed original articles, review articles, regulatory communications, ongoing and past clinical trials identified through ClinicalTrials.gov, and the authors' practice experience.

Conclusions —

The availability of new targeted therapy potentially effective for patients with breast cancers with low HER2 protein expression requires multidisciplinary recognition. In particular, pathologists need to recognize and identify this category to allow the optimal selection of patients for targeted therapy.

### Trastuzumab: hopes and realities [^115Vn6bt]. The Lancet: Oncology (2002). Medium credibility.

Despite improvements in care of patients with breast cancer, up to half develop refractory or resistant disease. There is therefore a need for new, modified anticancer therapies with greater effectiveness, tolerability to patients, and tumour specificity. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is the first clinically available oncogene-targeted therapeutic agent for treatment of solid tumours. Clinical trials in patients positive for HER2 (human epidermal-growth-factor receptor 2) show that trastuzumab is effective and well tolerated; as a single-agent second-line or third-line treatment, the drug produced durable tumour responses. First-line trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy, particularly paclitaxel, significantly improved time to disease progression, duration of response, and time to treatment failure. Combination therapy resulted in a 25% improvement in overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone. Patients with HER2 gene amplification, high overexpression of HER2 (3+ on immunohisto-chemistry), or both features, obtained the greatest clinical benefit. Trastuzumab is the first monoclonal antibody with efficacy in breast cancer and the first gene-product-targeted therapy to produce a significant survival advantage in this disease. Trastuzumab is likely to find its ultimate role in the adjuvant setting. Its development provides a model for the integration of other gene-targeted therapies into breast-cancer management to improve survival and quality of life.

### Real-world treatment patterns and outcomes of patients with hormone receptor-positive / HER2-low metastatic breast cancer treated with chemotherapy [^115BNLSq]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low breast cancer, historically classified as HER2-negative, accounts for approximately 65% of hormone receptor (HR)-positive (HR+) disease and half of all breast cancer cases. The HER2-low classification is defined by a score of 1+ or 2+ on immunohistochemical (IHC)-based analysis of HER2 protein levels coupled with a lack of HER2 gene (ERBB2) amplification as determined via an in situ hybridization (ISH)- based assay (eg, fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]). Patients with HER2-low breast cancer generally have a less favorable prognosis as compared to those with HER2-positive disease who are treated with HER2 targeted treatment, with breast cancer specific or overall survival demonstrated to be superior among patients with HER2-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer than those with HER2-low disease.

No HER2-targeted treatment options had demonstrated clinical benefit in the HER2-low metastatic breast cancer (mBC) setting until recently. However, in 2022, the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) received approval by the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults with unresectable breast cancer or mBC previously treated with chemotherapy (CT) in the metastatic setting or who developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant CT. This approval was based on results from the DESTINY-Breast04 Phase III trial in patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low disease who received prior CT and hormone therapy (HT) if disease was HR+, which demonstrated improved survival of T-DXd-treated patients vs patients treated with CT only (median progression-free survival: 9.9 months vs 5.1 months, respectively, hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; P < .001). Since the time that our real-world study was conducted and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines were updated to include T-DXd as a treatment option for HER2 IHC 1+ or 2+/ISH negative mBC.

Systemic therapy for both early-stage and metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer has seen significant evolution over the last 20 or more years. Innovative trials leveraging the prognostic and predictive information that neoadjuvant chemotherapy provides has led to preoperative systemic therapy becoming the overwhelmingly favored sequencing in the early-stage setting. However, deintensification of therapy is important to consider for patients with good-risk disease or significant comorbidities. Finally, with the abundance of newly approved agents, drug sequencing in the second-line setting has become an important and individualized decision for patients with metastatic disease.

### UK recommendations for HER2 assessment in breast cancer: an update [^1163fFXD]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

The last UK breast cancer (BC) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing guideline recommendations were published in 2015. Since then, new data and therapeutic strategies have emerged. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) published a focused update in 2018 that reclassified in situ hybridisation (ISH) Group 2 (immunohistochemistry (IHC) score 2+and HER 2/chromosome enumeration probe 17 (CEP 17) ratio ≥ 2.0and HER 2 copy number < 4.0 signals/cell), as well as addressed other concerns raised by previous guidelines. The present article further refines UK guidelines, with specific attention to definitions of HER2 status focusing on eight key areas: (1) HER2 equivocal (IHC 2+) and assignment of the ASCO/CAP ISH group 2 tumours; (2) the definition of the group of BCs with low IHC scores for HER2 with emphasis on the distinction between IHC score 1+ (HER2-Low) from HER2 IHC score 0 (HER2 negative); (3) reporting cases showing HER2 heterogeneity; (4) HER2 testing in specific settings, including on cytological material; (5) repeat HER2 testing, (6) HER2 testing turnaround time targets; (7) the potential role of next generation sequencing and other diagnostic molecular assays for routine testing of HER2 status in BC and (8) use of image analysis to score HER2 IHC. The two tiered system of HER2 assessment remains unchanged, with first line IHC and then ISH limited to IHC equivocal cases (IHC score 2+) but emerging data on the relationship between IHC scores and levels of response to anti-HER2 therapy are considered. Here, we present the latest UK recommendations for HER2 status evaluation in BC, and where relevant, the differences from other published guidelines.

### An overview of clinical development of agents for metastatic or advanced breast cancer without ERBB2 amplification (HER2-Low) [^113iYXdi]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2; formerly HER2 [human epidermal growth factor receptor 2]) is an important prognostic and predictive factor in breast cancer. Anti-ERBB2 therapies have improved outcomes in ERBB2-positive breast cancer. However, based on current definitions, tumors with low ERBB2 expression are included in the ERBB2-negative subtype, and therefore, are ineligible for anti-ERBB2 therapies; patients with ERBB2-low (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 1 positive or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization [ISH] negative) tumors account for up to approximately 50% of breast cancer cases. Although the prognostic role of ERBB2-low needs to be defined, ERBB2 offers a potential therapeutic target in these patients.

Observations

Most breast cancer tumors have some ERBB2 expression, with ERBB2-low being more common in hormone receptor-positive than in hormone receptor-negative breast cancer. Although an early clinical study failed to demonstrate benefit of adjuvant trastuzumab for ERBB2-low disease, several novel anti-ERBB2 therapies have shown efficacy in ERBB2-low breast cancer, including the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan in a phase 3 trial, and trastuzumab duocarmazine and the bispecific antibody zenocutuzumab in early-phase studies. Although reports are conflicting, some differences in biology and patient outcomes have been found between ERBB2-low and ERBB2 IHC-0 breast cancer. Currently, no established guidelines exist for scoring ERBB2-low expression in breast cancer because the focus has been on binary classification as ERBB2-positive or ERBB2-negative. Additional interpretive cutoffs may be needed to select patients for treatment with effective agents in ERBB2-low breast cancer, along with standardized laboratory quality assurance programs to ensure consistent patient identification for eligibility for ERBB2-low targeting agents.

Conclusions and Relevance

This review suggests that ERBB2-low may be a distinct, clinically relevant breast cancer entity warranting reassessment of traditional diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms. Ongoing clinical trials and further investigations may provide optimized strategies for diagnosing and treating ERBB2-low breast cancer, including reproducible, consistent definitions to identify patients in this diagnostic category and demonstration of benefits of emerging therapies.

### Incidence and prognostic values in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-low expression metastatic breast cancer in southeast Asian population: a 10-year retrospective study [^117GbsK2]. JCO Global Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Breast cancer progression varies across molecular subtypes, and treatment options for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low expression tumors are limited compared with those of HER2 overexpression tumors. Comprehensive information regarding the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of metastatic HER2-low expression breast cancer in a Southeast Asian population is lacking.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study was performed to analyze data from patients with de novo advanced breast cancer, including HER2 expression, tumor stage, and metastatic pattern. Statistical analyses, including chi-square tests and survival analyses, were used to compare HER2-low expression and HER2-negative groups.

Results

Of the 491 patients, 21.2% had HER2-low expression, 30% had HER2 overexpression, and 50% had HER2-negative expression. Among the hormone receptor (HR)-positive patients, 34% had HER2-low expression; in the triple-negative patients, the HER2-low incidence was 20.6%. No significant differences in clinical characteristics between HER2-low and HER2-negative groups were observed, except for more HR-positive patients in the HER2-low group. HER2-low patients had a longer overall survival (OS) than HER2-negative patients (43 v 23 months; hazard ratio, 0.7; P < .001), especially in HR-positive patients. After adjusting for HR status, HER2-low patients maintained improved outcomes. HR-positive HER2-low patients showed nonsignificant OS gains compared with HR-positive HER2-negative patients, regardless of first-line chemotherapy or endocrine therapy.

Conclusion

This study revealed the incidence and clinical outcomes of HER2-low expression in de novo advanced breast cancer, suggesting favorable outcomes, particularly in HR-positive breast cancer. These findings may inform personalized treatment strategies. Further research into the mechanisms and implications of HER2-low expression in breast cancer is required.

### Management of patients with advanced-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: current evidence and future perspectives [^113XWHUt]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Amplification and/or overexpression of ERBB2, the gene encoding HER2, can be found in 15–20% of invasive breast cancers and is associated with an aggressive phenotype and poor clinical outcomes. Relentless research efforts in molecular biology and drug development have led to the implementation of several HER2-targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates, constituting one of the best examples of bench-to-bedside translation in oncology. Each individual drug class has improved patient outcomes and, importantly, the combinatorial and sequential use of different HER2-targeted therapies has increased cure rates in the early stage disease setting and substantially prolonged survival for patients with advanced-stage disease. In this Review, we describe key steps in the development of the modern paradigm for the treatment of HER2-positive advanced-stage breast cancer, including selecting and sequencing new-generation HER2-targeted therapies, and summarize efficacy and safety outcomes from pivotal studies. We then outline the factors that are currently known to be related to resistance to HER2-targeted therapies, such as HER2 intratumoural heterogeneity, activation of alternative signalling pathways and immune escape mechanisms, as well as potential strategies that might be used in the future to overcome this resistance and further improve patient outcomes.

HER2-low metastatic breast cancer — In the phase III DESTINY-Breast04 trial of previously treated patients, 494 hormone receptor–positive and 63 hormone receptor–negative participants were randomly assigned 2:1 to trastuzumab deruxtecan versus treatment of physician's choice (TPC). At a median follow-up of 18.4 months, median treatment durations were 8.2 months (range, 0.2–33.3) with trastuzumab deruxtecan and 3.5 months (range, 0.3–17.6) with TPC. In the hormone receptor–positive cohort, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.1 months (95% CI, 9.5 to 11.5) with trastuzumab deruxtecan and 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.4 to 7.1) with TPC (hazard ratio [HR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.64; P < .0001), and median overall survival (OS) was 23.9 months (95% CI, 20.8 to 24.8) versus 17.5 months (95% CI, 15.2 to 22.4) with TPC (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.86; p = 0.0028). For the full analysis set including both hormone receptor–positive and –negative patients, the reported median PFS was 9.9 months.

### Emerging approaches for treating HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer beyond trastuzumab [^116MB9dR]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Because metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is incurable in most cases, the goals of treatment are improvement in quality of life, management of symptoms, and prolonged survival. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in up to 30% of breast tumors, and before the development of HER-targeted therapy, HER2 positivity was predictive of poorer clinical outcomes. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab (anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies), lapatinib (a small molecule inhibitor of HER2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]) are approved for treating HER2-positive MBC in the United States. Although trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is currently regarded as the first-line standard of care for HER2-positive MBC, it is not without shortcomings; these include its association with certain adverse events (e.g. cardiotoxic effect) and development of resistance. A number of investigational agents that target HER2 and other members of that receptor family are in clinical development for patients with HER2-positive MBC whose disease has progressed on trastuzumab. In addition, in an effort to overcome treatment resistance, clinical trials are evaluating combination therapy (investigational HER-targeted agents with trastuzumab or lapatinib). This review discusses recently completed and ongoing phase II and III clinical trials of investigational HER-targeted agents in the setting of trastuzumab-progressive, HER2-positive MBC.

### Pathological complete response, category change, and prognostic significance of HER2-low breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant treatment: a multicenter analysis of 2489 cases [^113xBshw]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer (BC) is a highly heterogeneous disease and can be divided into four or five different subtypes according to hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) status. In recent decades, a wide variety of anti-HER2 drugs have been developed for targeting tumors with HER2 amplification/overexpression, which has dramatically improved the prognosis of HER2-positive BC. HER2-negative BCs, however, show no response to most conventional anti-HER2 drugs. However, recent findings have challenged this dogma. Approximately half of BCs show low to moderate levels of HER2 immunohistochemical (IHC) expression (IHC 1+ or 2+ in the absence of HER2 gene amplification by in situ hybridization (ISH)) and are thus classified as HER2-low BCs. Early-phase clinical trials have reported HER2-low tumors with a surprising response to novel anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and trastuzumab duocarmazine. Two phase 3 trials have currently evaluated the efficacy of T-DXd in HER2-low BCs (DESTINY-Breast04 and DESTINY-Breast06), and the DESTINY-Breast04 study has reported exciting positive results in the metastatic setting. Continuous attempts to transfer this experimental scenario to the early setting are in progress. Additionally, plenty of attempts are also ongoing towards defining the specific biological characteristics of HER2-low BCs. At present, the current algorithm for HER2 testing can distinguish HER2-low tumors from HER2–0 (IHC 0) tumors, but the clinical implications of HER2-low expression remain debatable. It is not clear whether HER2-low tumors represent distinct subtypes of breast cancer with unique biological characteristics, and moreover, whether HER2-low early-stage breast cancer patients have different clinicopathological characteristics with different survival outcomes compared to HER2–0 patients.

### Proposed treatment guidelines for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in Europe [^116u7TD9]. Annals of Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is overexpressed/amplified in 20%-30% of human breast tumors and is a marker for a poor prognosis. For these reasons, HER2 has been selected as a therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment. Oncologists can no longer ignore the importance of HER2 status for treatment algorithms in breast cancer. In light of the consequences of HER2 status on treatment selection, further research is warranted to refine and standardize HER2 testing in order to minimize false-negative results and optimize selection of treatment pathways. The anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (MAb) trastuzumab (Herceptin) has proven valuable in treating HER2-positive, advanced-disease patients. and the availability of this novel biologic agent has important implications for clinical practice. This review describes a set of guidelines based on the current options for treatment of breast cancer. Two important factors have been taken into account in compiling these recommendations: (1) the lack of level I evidence to convincingly demonstrate the value of HER2 as a predictive marker for resistance or sensitivity to chemo- and hormonal therapy, and (2) the recently published pivotal phase II and III trial data proving the efficacy of trastuzumab as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

### Evolution of HER2-low expression from primary to recurrent breast cancer [^113Qzf4i]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in women worldwide. It represents a highly heterogeneous disease, encompassing diverse biological entities differing in terms of clinicopathologic features, prognosis and sensitivity to treatments. Although gene expression studies – have revealed an impressive and complex biological diversity among breast tumors, in clinical practice breast cancer classification driving the treatment-decision process is based on the distinction between 3 major breast cancer subsets, based on conventional immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) analyses: hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative, HER2-positive (HR positive or negative), triple-negative. The biological differences among these subtypes account for different clinical behaviors and distinct treatment sensitivity.

Although in common clinical practice the treatment-decision process in terms of access to anti-HER2 targeted agents is driven by the dichotomization in HER2-positive (as defined by HER2 protein overexpression on IHC analysis — score 3+ and/or HER2 gene amplification on ISH assay) vs negative–which has been strengthened by 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines — HER2-negative breast cancer is characterized by a wide spectrum of HER2 expression levels. Notably, preliminary results from early phase clinical trials testing novel anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in advanced breast cancer patients harboring HER2-low expression (1 + or 2+ by IHC in the absence of HER2 gene amplification by ISH) are challenging this notion. In particular, in a phase Ib study of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan a notable 37% of ORR and 10.4 months of median duration of response were reported in HER2-low advanced breast cancer patients. Similarly, in a phase Ib study investigating Trastuzumab Duocarmazine in patients with advanced solid tumors, ORR was 28% and 40% in the HR + HER2-low and triple-negative HER2-low breast cancer cohorts, respectively. In addition, a large phase III trial investigating Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in pre-treated HER2-low advanced breast cancer patients is currently ongoing (NCT03734029/Destiny-Breast04).

### HER2-low breast cancers [^114zRpbE]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Recent clinical trials have demonstrated significant clinical benefits from novel therapeutic compounds in breast cancer patient with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) immunohistochemical (IHC) score of 1+ or 2+ and negative in situ hybridization (ISH) result. A new concept of "HER2-low" breast cancer has been proposed and applied in the recent and ongoing clinical trials. In this article, we review the literature on the topic of HER2-low breast cancer.

Methods

A literature search in PubMed was performed using key words related to HER2-low breast cancer. Major relevant studies that were presented in international breast cancer conferences were also included.

Results

HER2-low breast cancer is currently defined as breast cancer with HER2 IHC score of 1+ or 2+ and negative ISH result. It likely represents a group of tumors with significant biological heterogeneity. Reports of clinical activity using the next generation of HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugates in HER2-low breast cancers suggest that some strategies of targeting HER2 might be effective in this patient population while raising considerable concerns over limitations in our current testing methodologies and our ability to accurately identify such patients.

Conclusions

The promising efficacy of novel HER2-targeted therapy in advanced HER2-low breast cancers has raised the possibility for changing the clinical interpretation of HER2 status in breast cancer to include a HER2-low category; however, the definition of HER2-low breast cancer, the corresponding reliable and accurate quantitative HER2 testing methodology, and the biology of HER2-low breast cancer remain poorly defined.

### Trastuzumab deruxtecan in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and beyond [^112greET]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the substantial improvements made in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapies since the approval of trastuzumab more than 20 years ago, there is still considerable unmet need in patients with HER2-expressing breast cancer (BC) and other solid tumors. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a newer antibody-drug conjugate approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (BC) and gastric cancer (GC) and is under active investigation in other solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and HER2-low tumors.

Areas Covered

The current treatment and investigational landscape of HER2-positive and HER2-low metastatic BC (mBC) and the preclinical and clinical trials investigating T-DXd. To identify relevant literature, a search was performed on English-language publications and congress abstracts.

Expert Opinion

T-DXd is likely to become the standard of care for second-line treatment of HER2-positive mBC, and it may play a role in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive and triple-negative mBC with HER2-low expression. Because it was recently approved in the United States and Japan to treat HER2-positive metastatic GC, it holds promise for the treatment of other HER2-positive solid tumors, including colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and HER2-low BC.

### Systemic therapy for HER2-Positive metastatic breast cancer: moving into a new era… [^114hUvJ6]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, first-line treatment should be pertuzumab–trastuzumab–docetaxel/paclitaxel regardless of hormone receptor status. A taxane should be given for at least six cycles, if tolerated, followed by maintenance pertuzumab–trastuzumab until progression. In patients with hormone receptor–positive disease, ovarian function suppression should also be added for pre- and perimenopausal women. Based on the DESTINY-Breast03 study, trastuzumab deruxtecan seems to be the preferred second-line therapy after patient progression while receiving a taxane and trastuzumab in the first-line setting. Tucatinib, capecitabine, and trastuzumab; trastuzumab deruxtecan; and T-DM1 appear to be the most active individual treatment options in the third-line setting.

The choice of treatment depends on prior second-line therapy, patient characteristics, toxicity profile, and availability. First-line Therapy When HER2-positive MBC is diagnosed, HER2 blockade should be usually offered based on the great benefit obtained in different clinical trials conducted in the past two decades. In a pivotal study, Slamon and colleagues 1showed that adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy improved both progression-free survival and overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone. This study was a revolutionary change in the way of treating these patients. Since then, different approaches have tried to optimize trastuzumab-based therapy. Second-Line Therapy Trastuzumab emtansine has been considered for the past 10 years to be the best treatment option for patients whose disease has progressed after trastuzumab- and taxane-based treatment, based on the results of the phase III EMILIA trial.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive 3. 6 mg/kg of T-DM1 every 3 weeks or 1, 000 mg/m. Because of these results, T-DXd should now be considered the best second-line treatment option for patients with HER2-positive MBC treated previously with taxane plus trastuzumab. 9The Table lists outcomes of key first- and second-line trials and Fig. 1 lists first- and second-line treatments.

### Management of early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer | JCO oncology practice… [^116NWwGf]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

A better understanding of tumor biology and HER2 signaling has led to the development of additional HER2-directed therapies including dual HER2 inhibition, which involves adding a second anti-HER2 therapy together with trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Pertuzumab, another monoclonal antibody that binds to HER2 and prevents HER2/HER3 dimerization, one of the most powerful heterodimers that activates cell proliferation and survival, was the second anti-HER2 agent incorporated into the treatment of early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. Escalation Strategies Patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer and higher risk of recurrence are generally defined as having tumors ≥ 2 cm and/or node-positive disease. Those patients should be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 therapy. Additionally, the presence of residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant treatment, ie, patients who do not achieve a pathologic complete response, leads to increased risk of relapse.

11Therefore, several escalation strategies consisting of adding anti-HER2–targeted agents have been evaluated: dual HER2 blockade to increase rates of pCR, a surrogate marker of improved long-term outcomes, 12or as adjuvant treatment; extended anti-HER2 adjuvant therapy; and adjuvant therapy in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant T-DM1 plus pertuzumab may be a reasonable alternative to TCHP in patients with strong HER2 expression. T-DM1-pertuzumab does not provide an efficacy advantage over pertuzumab-trastuzumab plus taxane as adjuvant therapy in patients with high-risk early breast cancer. Chemotherapy Use While Optimizing Anti-HER2 Therapy Decreasing the amount of chemotherapy to a group of lower-risk patients, such as those with stage I breast cancer, may be safe and effective.

The phase II single-arm APT trial evaluated 12 weeks of paclitaxel with trastuzumab followed by 9 months of trastuzumab in patients with small, node-negative, HER2-positive disease. TH has demonstrated a 7-year DFS of 93. 3% and a 7-year recurrence-free interval of
97. 5%, with only four distant recurrences.

### Therapeutic options for first-line metastatic HR-positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer treatment… [^1122DASi]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The first-line setting was broadly defined to include trials that evaluated chemotherapy first-line in patients who had received prior endocrine therapy for MBC, as in the ECOG E2100 trial. 2 Of the 252 unique treatment regimens evaluated, the top 5 ranked therapies were cyclin-dependent kinase 4. /6 inhibitor combination regimens and 1 combination chemotherapy regimen. 3 These results are concordant with current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline recommendations for first-line HR-positive, ERBB2-negative MBC, 4 and confirm that most patients with HR-positive, ERBB2-negative MBC should be receiving such therapy in the first-line setting rather than receiving single-agent endocrine therapy or chemotherapy.

Advances in novel therapeutics in the last few decades have led to significantly prolonged survival outcomes and quality of life for patients with HR-positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer, including those with metastatic disease. 3 Large RCTs led to the approval of tamoxifen as the first endocrine therapy for HR-positive disease in. ERBB2-negative MBC, which has led to even more prolonged progression-free and overall survival outcomes, sparing most patients chemotherapy in the first-line setting without compromising survival. 6, 7 Current clinical practice guidelines recommend deferring chemotherapy for this population of patients except for those with visceral crisis or those who have hormone refractory disease. At first pass, one might falsely conclude that the findings from the IT-NMA study imply that all patients with HR-positive, ERBB2-negative MBC should receive endocrine therapy with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor and never receive endocrine therapy alone.

However, clinicians should not jump to this conclusion. It is imperative that clinicians use clinical judgement to determine the best option for any patient. Thus, while the results of the IT-NMA presented by Li et al1 support the notion that endocrine therapy with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor is undoubtedly the best treatment option for HR-positive, ERBB2-negative MBC, generally, this combination therapy will not be the best treatment for all patients. Clinicians still need to use clinical judgement when considering the best therapy for each individual patient, taking into consideration the patient's comorbidities, tolerance for toxic effects, and life expectancy both from MBC and other illnesses.

### A value-based approach to treatment of HER2-Positive breast cancer: examining the evidence… [^1147ueSs]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment of Metastatic HER2-positive Breast Cancer First Line Trastuzumab, a human monoclonal IgG antibody that selectively targets HER2, was the first targeted drug to be approved. It has since has been shown to be effective in combination with multiple chemotherapy drugs including docetaxel, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, and capecitabine. In the landmark trial by Slamon et al. 8–12Laptinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that functions downstream of HER2, inhibiting both EGFR and HER2 receptors. It was shown to be an effective option for second-line treatment in 2006 by Geyer et al 13for patients who had locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer previously treated with regimens that included an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab.

25–27The combination was looked at in the NeoALLTO study, which enrolled women with HER2-positive, early breast cancer and randomly assigned them 1: 1: 1 to lapatinib, trastuzumab, or trastuzumab plus laptinib for 6 weeks followed by the anti-HER2 treatment combined with paclitaxel for 12 weeks. Early Breast Cancer Treatment of early breast cancer is distinct from advanced breast cancer because the treatment goals are more clearly defined and uniform across patients. Treatment with the goal of cure makes decreasing treatment intensity an uncommon target. However, because outcomes of HER2-positive breast cancer exceed survival rates of 95%, it is important to consider whether a subset of patients exists in whom we can de-escalate therapy. Is there a population who do not need HER2-targeted treatment. For patients who are HER2-negative, chemotherapy is generally not recommended unless they are lymph node–positive, or high-risk lymph node–negative. In the HER2.

43This study tested nine cycles of weekly trastuzumab with adjuvant docetaxel or vinorelbine followed by FEC in a subset of early breast cancer patients with HER2-positive, high-risk disease. The primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival favored the trastuzumab arm, as did OS. Documented clinical improvement was similar to standard of 1-year therapy seen in previous trials.

### ASCO treatment guidelines for HER2-Negative metastatic breast cancer updated to reflect new trastuzumab deruxtecan data… [^115oNCzV]. ASCO Daily News (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points
- An ASCO Expert Panel has updated the treatment guidelines on chemotherapy and targeted therapy for patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer to include trastuzumab deruxtecan as a treatment option based on the survival benefits observed in the DESTINY-Breast04 trial.
- The updated guidance applies to previously treated patients with either hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor-negative disease with low-level HER2 expression. Just 1 month after the DESTINY-Breast04 data were presented at the 2022 ASCO Annual Meeting Plenary Session, an ASCO Expert Panel released updated guidance that endorses adoption of the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan into clinical practice for patients with "HER2-low" disease.

1 The Expert Panel now recommends offering T-DXd to patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer who have received at least 1 prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease and, if they have hormone receptor –positive disease, that is refractory to endocrine therapy. HER2-low expression is defined as immunohistochemistry and/or in situ hybridization findings of IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization negative. Data Supporting the Rapid Recommendation Update Results from the randomized phase 3 DESTINY-Breast04 trial showed that T-DXd successfully prolonged both progression-free survival and overall survival among patients categorized with HER2-low unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer, as compared with physician's choice of standard single-agent chemotherapy. 4 Of the 557 patients in the trial followed for a median of 18. 4 months, T-DXd conferred a 50% reduction in the risk of disease progression (median PFS:
9. 9 vs 5. 1 months; HR
0. 50, 95% CI [0.
40.

Results from the randomized phase 3 DESTINY-Breast04 trial showed that T-DXd successfully prolonged both progression-free survival and overall survival among patients categorized with HER2-low unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer, as compared with physician's choice of standard single-agent chemotherapy. Of note, the PFS and OS benefits of T-DXd were observed in patients with either HR-positive disease or HR-negative disease. For example, T-DXd prolonged median OS by 6. 4 months in the HR-positive subgroup and by
9. 9 months in the HR-negative subgroup when compared with single-agent chemotherapy.
