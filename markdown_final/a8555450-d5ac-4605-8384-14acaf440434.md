## Question

How is chlamydia treated in men?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis infection in men. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the first-line regimen and its evidence base. Then, I should verify appropriate alternatives and when they apply. Next, I will stratify by anatomical site of infection. After that, I need to check partner management and follow-up. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm while ensuring screening, coinfection considerations, and special populations are addressed.

> Let me first confirm the first-line recommendation for uncomplicated urogenital chlamydia in men. The CDC 2021 guidelines state doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as the preferred regimen for adolescents and adults, which aligns with WHO 2024 and European BASHH/IUSTI guidance, and is supported by randomized data showing higher efficacy versus azithromycin in controlled settings, so doxycycline is my default unless there is a reason to deviate [^115msv8Y] [^112rxawj] [^116DM3VU].

> Now, I should review alternatives for clinical flexibility. The CDC includes azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose and levofloxacin 500 mg daily for 7 days as alternatives, while WHO suggests azithromycin 1 g when doxycycline is unavailable or adherence to a multidose regimen is a serious concern; but I need to ensure these are used judiciously given stewardship concerns and comparative efficacy gaps, especially since macrolide use can drive resistance in other pathogens, so I will reserve azithromycin for select urogenital scenarios with adherence risk or tetracycline intolerance [^116JhKDN] [^112rxawj] [^113Hysc3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about azithromycin being an interchangeable alternative across all sites. I will now examine site-specific efficacy, and for rectal infection the evidence is clear: doxycycline outperforms azithromycin, with RCTs showing markedly higher microbiologic cure rates for doxycycline, so I should avoid azithromycin if rectal infection is diagnosed or suspected based on exposure history or symptoms, which is also reflected in WHO and BASHH/IUSTI recommendations [^114mwK7e] [^116RiVmX] [^116mijhP] [^1176tfnV].

> Next, I should review pharyngeal infection management. Let me verify the limited but evolving guidance: WHO recommends doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days for oropharyngeal chlamydia, and BASHH/IUSTI similarly prioritizes doxycycline, though data are sparse; if doxycycline is unavailable, azithromycin 1 g single dose may be considered, but I need to be cautious and ensure site-specific NAAT confirmation and follow-up if symptoms persist [^116mijhP] [^1176tfnV] [^111Bmg9H].

> I need to check patient-specific factors that influence regimen choice. For patients with high adherence potential, doxycycline remains preferred; when adherence is uncertain, such as in emergency department settings where directly observed single-dose therapy can mitigate nonadherence, azithromycin may be pragmatic for urogenital infection only; in tetracycline allergy, azithromycin is reasonable for urogenital disease, whereas for suspected rectal disease I should still try to secure doxycycline if at all possible due to efficacy; HIV status does not change the chlamydia regimen; and if Mycoplasma genitalium coinfection is suspected in the NGU context, an extended azithromycin regimen may be warranted per IUSTI guidance, recognizing this is a separate pathogen-specific pathway [^116ja2Y8] [^116JhKDN] [^115msv8Y] [^112XqvT2].

> Let me consider partner management because reinfection risk is substantial. The CDC recommends evaluating and presumptively treating sex partners from the preceding 60 days, and if no partner in that window, the most recent partner should be treated; expedited partner therapy is permissible in many jurisdictions, but I should confirm local rules and note CDC's caution in MSM due to the need for comprehensive STI evaluation; European guidance advises managing contacts within 6 months, and I should also ensure counseling to abstain from sex for 7 days after completion of therapy and until all partners are treated, alongside testing for other STIs including gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV [^115msv8Y] [^113RgwHs] [^117JWi1A] [^115U8EcQ] [^112kAmHX].

> I should double-check the follow-up plan to avoid unnecessary testing yet capture reinfections. Routine test-of-cure is not recommended for uncomplicated urogenital or rectal chlamydia treated with first-line regimens, but all patients should be retested at approximately 3 months to detect reinfection; as a reminder to avoid conflation, a test-of-cure at 7–14 days does apply to pharyngeal gonorrhea, not chlamydia, and I need to make that distinction clear in counseling and documentation [^113vm2gT] [^115msv8Y] [^111JhmdE].

> Next, I should review diagnostic considerations to ensure accurate site coverage. For men, first-void urine is recommended for NAAT-based urogenital testing, and if receptive anal or oral exposure is reported, rectal and pharyngeal NAATs should be obtained because site-specific detection guides therapy and public health action; I need to ensure correct specimen timing for urine and proper collection technique for extragenital swabs to minimize false negatives [^1165mEsB] [^115msv8Y].

> Let me think about special populations and screening practices that can influence detection and management. For MSM, rectal chlamydia is often asymptomatic and prevalent, so annual screening is advised and doxycycline is strongly preferred for any rectal infection; for adolescents and young men, BASHH/IUSTI supports annual testing under 25, whereas USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient to recommend routine screening in men, so I should use clinical judgment and risk-based approaches; for persons with HIV, the same chlamydia regimens apply with consideration for more frequent STI screening due to higher acquisition risk [^115xvj86] [^112VTdKq] [^1148rAQg].

> But wait, what if gonorrhea coinfection has not been excluded at presentation. I should confirm that current CDC gonorrhea guidance recommends ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once for uncomplicated infection, and if chlamydia has not been excluded, add doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days, which conveniently covers chlamydia first-line as well; I need to ensure allergy assessment and weight-based adjustments per gonorrhea guidance where applicable [^114Pgxq1].

> I will now synthesize a practical algorithm, while pausing to verify each branch aligns with the evidence. For uncomplicated urogenital chlamydia in men, first-line doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days; if adherence is a serious issue or doxycycline is contraindicated, azithromycin 1 g single dose can be used for urogenital infection only; for rectal or pharyngeal infection, use doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days given the superior cure rates at the rectal site and limited but supportive guidance for the pharyngeal site; ensure partner management and 3‑month retesting, and avoid routine test‑of‑cure for uncomplicated infections treated appropriately [^115msv8Y] [^112rxawj] [^114mwK7e] [^116mijhP].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also emphasize antimicrobial stewardship and counseling. Because azithromycin contributes to resistance pressures in other organisms, I need to ensure its use is targeted, reinforce 7-day sexual abstinence after treatment completion and until all partners are treated, discuss adverse effects and adherence strategies for doxycycline, and document screening for concomitant STIs with appropriate vaccinations and prevention counseling where relevant, including HIV prevention when indicated [^113Hysc3] [^115U8EcQ] [^112kAmHX].

---

The preferred treatment for chlamydia in males is **doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days** [^115msv8Y] [^112rxawj]. An alternative is **azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose** [^112rxawj] when doxycycline is unavailable or adherence is a concern [^116JhKDN]. For rectal infections [^116RiVmX], **doxycycline is superior** to azithromycin [^114mwK7e]. Patients should abstain from sex for 7 days after completing treatment [^115U8EcQ] and until partners have been treated. Retest at 3 months [^115msv8Y] and treat all partners from the past 60 days [^113Hysc3].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

### First-line treatment

The preferred regimen is **doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days** [^112rxawj] [^115msv8Y].

---

### Alternative treatment

When doxycycline is unavailable or adherence is a concern [^112rxawj], **azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose** is recommended [^116JhKDN].

---

### Special considerations

For **rectal infections** [^114mwK7e], doxycycline is significantly more effective than azithromycin [^116RiVmX]; if **gonorrhea coinfection** has not been excluded, treat with ceftriaxone 500 mg IM plus doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days.

---

## Patient adherence and follow-up

Emphasize **adherence** [^116ja2Y8] by ensuring patients complete the full course of antibiotics to prevent recurrence and complications. For **follow-up testing**, routine test-of-cure is not required [^113vm2gT] for uncomplicated infections, but retesting at 3 months is recommended due to high reinfection rates [^111SgVdL].

---

## Management of sexual partners

Ensure **partner notification** [^114hFFTG] so that all sexual partners within the past 60 days are notified, tested, and treated to prevent reinfection and further transmission [^1129TQbY]. Consider **expedited partner therapy (EPT)** [^115bDiGx] for heterosexual partners when partner evaluation is not possible; it is not routinely recommended for MSM due to concerns about missed concurrent infections [^113RgwHs].

---

## Potential complications of untreated chlamydia in males

Untreated chlamydia in males can lead to significant complications, including:

- **Epididymitis**: Inflammation of the epididymis, potentially causing infertility [^1148rAQg].

- **Prostatitis**: Inflammation of the prostate gland.

- **Reactive arthritis**: Joint inflammation associated with chlamydia infection [^1174Fzn6].

- **Increased HIV risk**: Higher susceptibility to HIV infection [^1148rAQg].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Condom use**: Consistent and correct use of condoms significantly reduces transmission risk [^115bDiGx].

- **Regular screening**: Annual screening for sexually active men, particularly MSM and those with multiple partners.

- **Patient education**: Counseling on safe sexual practices and the importance of adherence to treatment regimens [^113eJj3S].

## Summary table: treatment of chlamydia in males

| **Regimen** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Doxycycline | 100 mg orally twice daily | 7 days | First-line treatment |
| Azithromycin | 1 g orally single dose | Single dose | Alternative treatment |
| Ceftriaxone + doxycycline | 500 mg IM + 100 mg orally twice daily | 7 days | Gonorrhea coinfection |

---

The preferred regimen is **doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days** [^115msv8Y]; an alternative is **azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose** [^112rxawj]. Ensuring adherence, partner management [^114hFFTG], and retesting at 3 months [^111SgVdL] are essential to prevent reinfection and complications.

### Doxycycline versus azithromycin for the treatment of rectal chlamydia in men who have sex with men: A randomized controlled trial [^114mwK7e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Azithromycin and doxycycline are both recommended treatments for rectal Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection, but observational studies suggest that doxycycline may be more effective.

- **Methods**: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared azithromycin (single 1-g dose) versus doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 7 days) for the treatment of rectal CT in men who have sex with men (MSM) in Seattle and Boston. Participants were enrolled following a diagnosis of rectal CT in clinical care and underwent repeated collection of rectal swabs for nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) at study enrollment, and at 2 weeks and 4 weeks postenrollment. The primary outcome was microbiologic cure (CT-negative NAAT) at 4 weeks. The complete case (CC) population included participants with a CT-positive NAAT at enrollment and a follow-up NAAT result; the intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized participants.

- **Results**: Among 177 participants enrolled, 135 (76%) met CC population criteria for the 4-week follow-up visit. Thirty-three participants (19%) were excluded because the CT NAAT repeated at enrollment was negative. Microbiologic cure was higher with doxycycline than azithromycin in both the CC population (100% [70 of 70] vs. 74% [48 of 65]; absolute difference, 26%; 95% confidence interval, 16–36%; P < .001) and the ITT population (91% [80 of 88] vs. 71% [63 of 89]; absolute difference, 20%; 95% CI, 9–31%; P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: A 1-week course of doxycycline was significantly more effective than a single dose of azithromycin for the treatment of rectal CT infection.

### Azithromycin or doxycycline for asymptomatic rectal chlamydia [^116RiVmX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Rectal chlamydia is a common bacterial sexually transmissible infection among men who have sex with men. Data from randomized, controlled trials are needed to guide treatment.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind trial conducted at five sexual health clinics in Australia, we randomly assigned men who have sex with men and who had asymptomatic rectal chlamydia to receive doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 7 days) or azithromycin (1-g single dose). Asymptomatic chlamydia was selected as the trial focus because more than 85% of men with rectal chlamydia infection are asymptomatic, and clinical guidelines recommend a longer treatment course for symptomatic infection. The primary outcome was a negative nucleic acid amplification test for rectal chlamydia (microbiologic cure) at 4 weeks.

- **Results**: From August 2016 through August 2019, we enrolled 625 men (314 in the doxycycline group and 311 in the azithromycin group). Primary outcome data were available for 290 men (92.4%) in the doxycycline group and 297 (95.5%) in the azithromycin group. In the modified intention-to-treat population, a microbiologic cure occurred in 281 of 290 men (96.9%; 95% confidence interval, 94.9 to 98.9) in the doxycycline group and in 227 of 297 (76.4%; 95% CI, 73.8 to 79.1) in the azithromycin group, for an adjusted risk difference of 19.9 percentage points (95% CI, 14.6 to 25.3; P < 0.001). Adverse events that included nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting were reported in 98 men (33.8%) in the doxycycline group and in 134 (45.1%) in the azithromycin group (risk difference, -11.3 percentage points).

### Routine treatment versus selective treatment for individuals reporting contact with sexual partners with chlamydia: A before-and-after study [^113Hysc3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are increasing in many regions around the world, highlighting their continued significance as a global public health challenge. Each year, there are 374 million new cases of STIs, with an estimated 128.5 million cases of Chlamydia trachomatis, making it the most common bacterial STI globally. International guidelines on managing chlamydia contacts vary. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment for sexual partners within 60 days of symptom onset or chlamydia diagnosis and even beyond 60 days for the most recent partner. British guidelines recommend empirical treatment for male cases with urethral symptoms and for contacts within 4 weeks; for all other cases, contacts within the last 6 months should be treated. Although many international guidelines emphasize the importance of testing and confirmatory diagnostics for chlamydia contacts, they continue to recommend presumptive treatment.

Concerns over antimicrobial resistance in STIs have been increasing. Although antibiotic resistance in chlamydia is relatively uncommon, the overprescription and misuse of antibiotics such as doxycycline and azithromycin may foster resistance in other pathogens, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium, as well as non-STI bacteria. Recent studies have shown that N gonorrhoeae has developed significant resistance to azithromycin, leading to treatment challenges. Similarly, M genitalium demonstrates increasing resistance to azithromycin, complicating treatment options.

### Chlamydial and gonococcal infections: Screening, diagnosis, and treatment [^111SgVdL]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are increasing in the United States. Because most infections are asymptomatic, screening is key to preventing complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility and decreasing community and vertical neonatal transmission.

All sexually active people with a cervix who are younger than 25 years and older people with a cervix who have risk factors should be screened annually for chlamydial and gonococcal infections. Sexually active men who have sex with men should be screened at least annually. Physicians should obtain a sexual history free from assumptions about sex partners or practices.

Acceptable specimen types for testing include vaginal, endocervical, rectal, pharyngeal, and urethral swabs, and first-stream urine samples. Uncomplicated gonococcal infection should be treated with a single 500-mg dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone in people weighing less than 331 lb (150 kg). Preferred chlamydia treatment is a seven-day course of doxycycline, 100 mg taken by mouth twice per day.

All nonpregnant people should be tested for reinfection approximately three months after treatment, or at the first visit in the 12 months after treatment. Pregnant patients diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea should have a test of cure four weeks after treatment.

### Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections [^1114RL75]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for *Chlamydia trachomatis* infection, and more specifically in relation to indications for screening, the WHO 2025 guidelines recommend considering screening for *N. gonorrhoeae* and/or *C. trachomatis* in the following asymptomatic populations:

- **Pregnant patients**: During antenatal visits in settings with high prevalence and where resources and capacity are available.

- **Sexually active adolescents and young patients (10–24 years old)**: In settings with high prevalence and available resources and capacity.

- **Sex workers**: Accessing healthcare services.

- **Men who have sex with men (MSM)**: Accessing healthcare services.

### 2015 European guideline on the management of Chlamydia trachomatis infections [^1165mEsB]. International Journal of STD & AIDS (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chlamydia trachomatis infection, particularly in connection with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), the BASHH/IUSTI 2016 guidelines recommend using first-void urine specimens for men. These should be up to 20 mL and sampled at least 1 hour after previous urination. For women, vulvo-vaginal swabs are recommended, which can be either healthcare worker-collected or self-collected. These are considered the first choice for diagnosing urogenital chlamydial infections using NAATs.

### It's time to expand chlamydia treatment for gay and bisexual men [^113RgwHs]. Annals of Family Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Expedited partner therapy involves prescribing sexually transmitted infection (STI) treatment for a patient's partner(s) without seeing the partner. It is approved for heterosexual partners of patients with chlamydia in most states. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends against expedited partner therapy in men who have sex with men (MSM), citing limited data in this population and concerns that expedited partner therapy could discourage comprehensive STI testing, thereby driving increased HIV transmission.

In this piece, we describe the case of a 33-year-old gay man on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) whose cycle of chlamydia reinfection might have been prevented by expedited partner therapy. His case highlights how new HIV prevention strategies — including PrEP and treatment as prevention — challenge the assumption that all MSM with chlamydia are at risk for HIV. Until more data on expedited partner therapy in MSM are available, clinicians should incorporate characteristics of patients' sexual networks in weighing the risks and benefits of expedited partner therapy.

### Treatment of uncomplicated genital Chlamydia trachomatis infections in adults [^116mdQdw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

To prepare the 2001 sexually transmitted disease treatment guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recently published articles and abstracts concerning advances in the treatment of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis genital infections in adults were reviewed. Questions about treatments were posed and answered according to the results of efficacy studies and clinical trials. Recent studies have continued to demonstrate the similar efficacy of doxycycline and azithromycin. Because compliance with doxycycline remains a concern, administration of single-dose azithromycin therapy in the clinic presents a potential advantage for patients whose adherence is questionable. Because few systematically collected data have been published concerning the safety and efficacy of azithromycin use in pregnancy, the guidelines continue to recommend treatment with erythromycin or amoxicillin. Nevertheless, because of azithromycin's less frequent side effects and improved adherence, increasing numbers of obstetricians in the United States are using azithromycin to treat pregnant women with uncomplicated C. trachomatis infections.

### Screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116m2b3q]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). High credibility.

This update of previous U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations addresses screening for chlamydia (2007) and gonorrhea (2005).

- **Methods**: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infections in asymptomatic patients from studies published since its last reviews and also considered evidence from previous recommendations and reviews.

- **Population**: This recommendation applies to all sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant women.

- **Recommendations**: The USPSTF recommends screening for chlamydia in sexually active females aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection. (B recommendation) Similarly, the USPSTF recommends screening for gonorrhea in sexually active females aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men. (I statement)

### Azithromycin versus doxycycline for urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection [^116DM3VU]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection remains prevalent and causes substantial reproductive morbidity. Recent studies have raised concern about the efficacy of azithromycin for the treatment of chlamydia infection.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized trial comparing oral azithromycin with doxycycline for the treatment of urogenital chlamydia infection among adolescents in youth correctional facilities to evaluate the noninferiority of azithromycin (1 g in one dose) to doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 7 days). The treatment was directly observed. The primary endpoint was treatment failure 28 days after treatment initiation, with treatment failure determined on the basis of nucleic acid amplification testing, sexual history, and outer membrane protein A (OmpA) genotyping of C. trachomatis strains.

- **Results**: Among the 567 participants enrolled, 284 were randomly assigned to receive azithromycin, and 283 were randomly assigned to receive doxycycline. A total of 155 participants in each treatment group (65% male) made up the per-protocol population. There were no treatment failures in the doxycycline group. In the azithromycin group, treatment failure occurred in 5 participants (3.2%; 95% confidence interval, 0.4 to 7.4%). The observed difference in failure rates between the treatment groups was 3.2 percentage points, with an upper boundary of the 90% confidence interval of 5.9 percentage points, which exceeded the prespecified absolute 5-percentage-point cutoff for establishing the noninferiority of azithromycin.

- **Conclusions**: In the context of a closed system, the information indicates that doxycycline is more effective for treating urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection compared to azithromycin.

### Standard treatment regimens for nongonococcal urethritis have similar but declining cure rates: A randomized controlled trial [^114RE7kW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). High credibility.

Azithromycin or doxycycline is recommended for nongonococcal urethritis (NGU); recent evidence suggests their efficacy has declined. We compared azithromycin and doxycycline in men with NGU, hypothesizing that azithromycin was more effective than doxycycline.

- **Methods**: From January 2007 to July 2011, English-speaking males aged 16 years and older, attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic in Seattle, Washington, with NGU (visible urethral discharge or ≥ 5 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per high-power field [PMNs/HPF]), were eligible for this double-blind, parallel-group superiority trial. Participants received active azithromycin (1 g) plus placebo doxycycline or active doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 7 days) plus placebo azithromycin. Urine was tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), Ureaplasma urealyticum biovar 2 (UU-2), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) using nucleic acid amplification tests. Clinical cure (< 5 PMNs/HPF with or without urethral symptoms and absence of discharge) and microbiologic cure (negative tests for CT, MG, and/or UU-2) were determined after three weeks.

- **Results**: Of 606 men, 304 were randomized to azithromycin and 302 to doxycycline; CT, MG, TV, and UU-2 were detected in 24%, 13%, 2%, and 23%, respectively. In modified intent-to-treat analyses, 172 of 216 (80%; 95% confidence interval, 74%-85%) receiving azithromycin and 157 of 206 (76%; 95% CI, 70%-82%) receiving doxycycline experienced clinical cure (P = 0.40). In pathogen-specific analyses, clinical cure did not differ by arm, nor did microbiologic cure differ for CT (86%).

### Screening recommendations for chlamydia and gonorrhea [^113Rnb2r]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Dermatologists diagnose and treat sexually transmitted infections with varying frequency and have an opportunity to monitor at-risk individuals for chlamydia and gonorrhea. What are the recommended screening guidelines for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men and women in the United States?

While the evidence for screening men for chlamydia and gonorrhea remains insufficient at this time, all sexually active females younger than 25 years and all older women at risk for infection should be screened for both chlamydia and gonorrhea.

### Diagnosis and treatment of chlamydia trachomatis infection [^1166ZV3i]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis infection most commonly affects the urogenital tract. In men, the infection usually is symptomatic, with dysuria and a discharge from the penis. Untreated chlamydial infection in men can spread to the epididymis. Most women with chlamydial infection have minimal or no symptoms, but some develop pelvic inflammatory disease. Chlamydial infection in newborns can cause ophthalmia neonatorum. Chlamydial pneumonia can occur at one to three months of age, manifesting as a protracted onset of staccato cough, usually without wheezing or fever. Treatment options for uncomplicated urogenital infections include a single 1-g dose of azithromycin orally, or doxycycline at a dosage of 100 mg orally twice per day for seven days. The recommended treatment during pregnancy is erythromycin base or amoxicillin. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend screening for chlamydial infection in women at increased risk of infection and in all women younger than 25 years.

### Genital chlamydia trachomatis infections clear more slowly in men than women, but are less likely to become established [^114sDsya]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Rigorous estimates for clearance rates of untreated chlamydia infections are important for understanding chlamydia epidemiology and designing control interventions but were previously only available for women.

- **Methods**: We used data from published studies of chlamydia-infected men who were retested at a later date without having received treatment. Our analysis allowed new infections to take one of three courses, each clearing at a different rate. We determined which of these three models had the most empirical support.

- **Results**: The best-fitting model had two courses of infection in men, as was previously found for women: "slow-clearing" and "fast-clearing". Only 68% (57%-78%) (posterior median and 95% credible interval [CrI]) of incident infections in men were slow-clearing, versus 77% (69%-84%) in women. The slow clearance rate in men (based on six months' follow-up) was 0.35 (0.05–1.15) year⁻¹ (posterior median and 95% CrI), corresponding to a mean infection duration of 2.84 (0.87–18.79) years. This compares to 1.35 (1.13–1.63) years in women.

- **Conclusions**: Our estimated clearance rate is slower than previously assumed. Fewer infections become established in men than in women, but once established, they clear more slowly. This study provides an improved description of chlamydia's natural history to inform public health decision-making. We describe how further data collection could reduce uncertainty in estimates.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis infections in adolescents and adults: Summary of evidence reviewed for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^115YS2VH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

To prepare for the development of the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, the CDC convened a committee of expert consultants in June 2019 to discuss recent abstracts and published literature on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of sexually transmitted infections. This paper summarizes the key questions, evidence, and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections in adolescents and adults that were reviewed and discussed for consideration in developing the guidelines. The evidence reviewed mostly focused on efficacy of doxycycline and azithromycin for urogenital, rectal, and oropharyngeal CT infection, CT risk factors in women, performance of CT nucleic acid amplification tests on self-collected meatal specimens in men, and performance of newer CT point-of-care tests.

### Genital chlamydia trachomatis: an update [^116KSji4]. The Indian Journal of Medical Research (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Chlamydia trachomatis infection:

- **Definition**: C. trachomatis infection is a common bacterial STI characterized primarily by urethritis in males and endocervicitis in females.

- **Pathophysiology**: The obligate intracellular bacteria C. trachomatis is responsible for the disease and may be transmitted through oral, vaginal, or anal sex.

- **Disease course**: The most common manifestations include urethritis in men and mucopurulent cervicitis, urethritis, and endometritis in women. Disease progression may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which in pregnancy results in premature delivery and puerperal and neonatal infections.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: C. trachomatis infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of perinatal mortality (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.15–2.94).

### Screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1148rAQg]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Chlamydia and gonorrhea are among the most common sexually transmitted infections in the US. Infection rates are highest among adolescents and young adults of both sexes. Chlamydial and gonococcal infections in women are usually asymptomatic and may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and its associated complications. Newborns of pregnant individuals with untreated infections may develop neonatal chlamydial pneumonia or gonococcal or chlamydial ophthalmia. Infections in men may lead to urethritis and epididymitis. Both types of infections can increase the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant individuals, to update its 2014 recommendation.

The USPSTF recommends screening for asymptomatic, sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant individuals. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for chlamydia in all sexually active women aged 24 years or younger, and in women aged 25 years or older who are at increased risk for infection, provides a moderate net benefit. Similarly, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for gonorrhea in the same demographic has a moderate net benefit. However, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in men.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^111JhmdE]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). High credibility.

A test-of-cure is unnecessary for persons with uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with any of the recommended or alternative regimens; however, for persons with pharyngeal gonorrhea, a test-of-cure is recommended using culture or nucleic acid amplification tests 7–14 days after initial treatment, regardless of the treatment regimen. Because reinfection within 12 months ranges from 7% to 12% among persons previously treated for gonorrhea, persons who have been treated for gonorrhea should be retested 3 months after treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest within 12 months after initial treatment.

### Chlamydia (uncomplicated, genital) [^111oCJDC]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Low credibility.

Genital chlamydia is the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) in developed countries. In women, infection occurs most commonly between the ages of 16 and 19 years.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of antibiotic treatment for men and non-pregnant women with uncomplicated genital chlamydial infection? What are the effects of antibiotic treatment for pregnant women with uncomplicated genital chlamydial infection? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 24 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions:
	- **Penicillins**: amoxicillin, ampicillin, pivampicillin
	- **Macrolides**: azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin
	- **Tetracyclines**: doxycycline, lymecycline, minocycline, tetracycline

### Genital chlamydia trachomatis infections clear more slowly in men than women, but are less likely to become established [^112FTa3c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

We used a mixture-of-exponentials model for the duration of untreated chlamydia infection in men. The model allows for any new infection to take one of several courses, each with a different clearance rate. Each infection thus belongs to one category or "class". Within each class, durations of infection are exponentially distributed with a mean equal to the reciprocal of the clearance rate for that class. To determine the appropriate number of classes, we compared the fit to the data of models comprised of one, two, and three classes. We also investigated a model in which clearance rates had a continuous Gamma distribution, rather than falling into discrete classes.

The model also recognizes different study types. Clinic-based studies recruit individuals who present for testing, perhaps because symptoms have recently developed or due to contact with an infected person. They, therefore, represent recent exposures and incident infections. Screening studies recruit members of the general population, who are more representative of prevalent infections. The proportion of detected infections belonging to faster-clearing infection classes is lower in screening studies than in patients seeking care after exposure to infection because these short infections clear quickly and, thus, are less common in the pool of prevalent infections.

We used three published literature reviews to identify relevant studies in which chlamydia-infected men were retested at a later date, having received no treatment in the interim. We updated these searches to cover the period since the original review but found…

### Screening for chlamydial infection: An evidence update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^114Jac4n]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chlamydial infection is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection in the United States, with an estimated 3 million new cases annually. In 2001, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended that clinicians screen all sexually active women at increased risk for infection for Chlamydia trachomatis.

- **Purpose**: To summarize a systematic evidence review commissioned by the USPSTF in preparation for an update of its 2001 recommendation.

- **Data sources**: English-language articles identified in PubMed between July 2000 and July 2005. Additional articles were identified through bibliographic reviews and discussions with experts. A total of 452 articles were identified.

- **Study selection**: Explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for each of three key questions. For studies of screening in nonpregnant women at increased risk, the review was limited to randomized, controlled trials. For other groups, both randomized, controlled studies and nonrandomized, prospective, controlled studies were included.

- **Data abstraction**: Using standardized forms, staff of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality abstracted data on study design, setting, sample, randomization, blinding, results, and harms.

- **Data synthesis**: Only one new study met the inclusion criteria. This poor-quality study of the effectiveness of screening for chlamydial infection among nonpregnant women at increased risk found that screening was associated with a lower prevalence of chlamydial infection and fewer reported cases of pelvic inflammatory disease at a one-year follow-up.

- **Limitations**: None.

### Chlamydial and gonococcal infections in infants and children [^113XfHNL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The recommendations for the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines regarding the diagnosis and treatment of gonococcal and Chlamydia trachomatis infections in infants and children remain essentially the same as the 2006 guidelines. There are no new data on the diagnosis or treatment of neonatal chlamydial or gonococcal infections. New data on the efficacy of neonatal ocular prophylaxis are limited. Two recent studies from Iran and Brazil suggest that povidone-iodine may not be effective for the prevention of chlamydial or gonococcal ophthalmia. Prenatal screening and treatment of pregnant women, shown to be very effective in preventing neonatal gonococcal ophthalmia, remains the most effective strategy for preventing neonatal chlamydial infection.

### Screening for chlamydial infection: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116RtDFN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). High credibility.

This text is an update of the 2001 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations about screening sexually active adolescents and adults for chlamydial infection.

- **Methods**: The USPSTF evaluated the benefits, such as improved fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and reduced infection transmission, against the harms like anxiety, relationship problems, and unnecessary treatment resulting from false-positive results. These evaluations are based on their 2001 recommendations and a systematic review of English-language articles published between July 2000 and July 2005.

- **Recommendations**: Screen for chlamydial infection in all sexually active nonpregnant young women aged 24 years or younger, and in older nonpregnant women who are at increased risk (A recommendation). Screen for chlamydial infection in all pregnant women aged 24 years or younger, and in older pregnant women who are at increased risk (B recommendation). Do not routinely screen for chlamydial infection in women aged 25 years or older, regardless of pregnancy status, if they are not at increased risk (C recommendation). Evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydial infection in men (I statement).

### Genital chlamydia trachomatis infections clear more slowly in men than women, but are less likely to become established [^112d1ovN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The studies were of moderately good quality. Most were prospective follow-up of infected patients. While older studies were often randomized clinical trials with a placebo arm, in more recent studies, the only patients who were not treated presumptively were those without indications or infection risk factors such as urethritis or an infected partner. Several studies had less than 100% follow-up, and patients with persistent symptoms may have been more likely to return, causing a bias toward slow clearance rates. Potential confounders, which would have opposing effects, are unreported treatment and reinfection in the interval between the first and second tests. However, both of these would be expected to be rare over the periods of observation. Studies of chlamydia reinfection in heterosexual men after treatment have estimated rates of around 10% per year. These studies provide the best evidence available to inform estimates of the clearance rate of untreated infection.

### Re-evaluating the treatment of nongonococcal urethritis: Emphasizing emerging pathogens — a randomized clinical trial [^114j81XK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) is a common chlamydia-associated syndrome in men; however, Trichomonas vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium are associated with its etiology and should be considered in approaches to therapy. We sought to determine whether the addition of tinidazole, an anti-trichomonal agent, to the treatment regimen would result in higher cure rates than those achieved with treatment with doxycycline or azithromycin alone. A secondary aim was to compare the efficacy of doxycycline therapy and with that of azithromycin therapy.

- **Methods**: Randomized, controlled, double-blinded phase IIB trial of men with NGU. Participants were randomized to receive doxycycline plus or minus tinidazole or azithromycin plus or minus tinidazole and were observed for up to 45 days.

- **Results**: The prevalences of Chlamydia trachomatis, M. genitalium, and T. vaginalis were 43%, 31%, and 13%, respectively. No pathogens were identified in 29% of participants. Clinical cure rates at the first follow-up visit were 74.5% (111 of 149 patients) for doxycycline-containing regimens and 68.6% (107 of 156 patients) for azithromycin-containing regimens. By the final visit, cure rates were 49% (73 of 149 patients) for doxycycline-containing regimens and 43.6% (68 of 156 patients) for azithromycin-containing regimens. There were no significant differences in clinical response rates among the treatment arms; however, the chlamydia clearance rate was 94.8% (55 of 58 patients) for the doxycycline arm and 77.4% (41 of 53 patients) for the azithromycin arm (P = 0.011).

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^117Q6o29]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). High credibility.

During 2018, CDC staff members and subject matter experts identified essential questions regarding gonorrhea treatment to update the 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines. A literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Medline databases conducted for January 2013–May 2019 using the parameters (gonorrhea[MeSH]) OR (gonococcal[all fields] OR gonorrhea[all fields] OR "Neisseria gonorrhoeae"[all fields]) AND (treatment[MeSH] OR antibiotic[MeSH] OR therapy) generated more than 2,200 abstracts. Titles and abstracts were assessed, and 248 clinically relevant articles were reviewed. Abstracts from STD conferences held during 2015–2018 and on the National Institutes of Health clinical trials website were also reviewed.

GISP susceptibility data from January 2013 to May 2019 were reviewed. GISP monitors gonorrhea antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in the United States through monthly testing of urethral isolates from 25 symptomatic men in each of 25 to 30 STD specialty care clinics. Regional laboratories conduct antimicrobial susceptibility testing by agar dilution to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for selected antimicrobials. Although the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) has not established N. gonorrhoeae resistance breakpoints for ceftriaxone, cefixime, or azithromycin, CLSI categorizes isolates with MICs of ≤ 0.25 μg/mL as susceptible for ceftriaxone and cefixime, and those with MICs of ≤ 1.00 μg/mL as susceptible for azithromycin. To identify isolates with elevated MICs, GISP uses the following "alert values" to identify potential emerging resistance: MIC ≥ 0.125 μg/mL for ceftriaxone and ≥ 0.25 μg/mL for azithromycin.

### Interventions to prevent sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection [^115bDiGx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Treatment Guidelines were last updated in 2006. To update the "Clinical Guide to Prevention Services" section of the 2010 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines, recent scientific literature was reviewed with a focus on interventions designed to prevent the acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Major interval developments include the following:

- **Licensure and uptake**: Immunization against genital human papillomavirus has increased.
- **Validation of prevention tools**: Male circumcision has been validated as a potent prevention tool against the acquisition of HIV and some other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
- **Vaccine challenges**: A promising HIV vaccine candidate failed to afford protection against HIV acquisition.
- **Antiretroviral use**: Encouragement for the use of antiretroviral agents as pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV and herpes simplex virus.
- **Partner management emphasis**: Enhanced emphasis on expedited partner management and rescreening for persons infected with Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
- **Behavioral interventions**: Recognition that behavioral interventions will be needed to address a new trend of sexually transmitted hepatitis C among men who have sex with men.
- **Availability of preventive tools**: A modified female condom is now available.

A range of preventive interventions is needed to reduce the risks of acquiring STIs, including HIV infection, among sexually active people. A flexible approach targeted to specific populations should integrate combinations of biomedical, behavioral, and structural interventions. These would ideally involve an array of prevention contexts.

### Antibiotics for treating urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in men and non-pregnant women [^116rpnxv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

The genital infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) globally. The infection is mainly asymptomatic in women; thus, it can produce infertility and chronic pelvic pain. In men, the infection is primarily symptomatic but can evolve into prostatitis. Clinical practice guidelines for CT urogenital infections do not provide any specific recommendation regarding which antibiotic to use as a first option.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic treatment for CT genital infection in men and non-pregnant women.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections' (STI) Information Specialist developed the electronic searches in databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS) and trial registers. We searched studies published from inception to June 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We included parallel, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of men and sexually-active, non-pregnant women with CT infection (urethritis or uterine cervicitis or asymptomatic), diagnosed by cell culture for CT, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), or antigen-based detection methods, who had been treated with any of the antibiotic regimens recommended by any of the updated 2013 CT Guidelines.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Four review authors screened evidence according to selection criteria and independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Two authors developed the 'Summary of findings' tables. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis model for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect.

The Australian STI guidelines recommend presumptive treatment if sexual contact occurred within the last two weeks or if there is a risk that the individual may not be able to receive treatment later due to their circumstances. However, a previous study in Melbourne revealed that only 40% of females, 36% of heterosexual males, and 24% of men who have sex with men (MSM) who reported to be chlamydia contacts tested positive for chlamydia, indicating that more than half of these individuals are not infected and may receive unnecessary antibiotic treatment.

To enhance antibiotic stewardship, the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC) revised its treatment policy and discontinued routine treatment for all chlamydia contacts on 5 December 2019, switching to selective treatment management. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical management after switching from routine treatment to selective treatment for individuals reporting contact with sexual partners with chlamydia.

### Screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infections: Updated evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^117UiPzo]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

The 2014 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement supported the effectiveness of screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea in asymptomatic, sexually active women 24 years or younger and in older women at increased risk for infection, although evidence for screening in men was insufficient.

The objective was to update the 2014 USPSTF review on screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infection in adults and adolescents, including those who are pregnant.

Data sources included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Ovid MEDLINE (from January 1, 2014, through May 28, 2020), with surveillance through May 21, 2021.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials and observational studies of screening effectiveness, accuracy of risk stratification and alternative screening methods, accuracy of tests, and screening harms were considered.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: One investigator abstracted data while a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed study quality.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Evaluated were complications of infection; transmission or acquisition of infection; diagnostic accuracy of anatomical site-specific testing and collection methods; and screening harms.

Results from twenty-seven studies (N = 179,515) indicated that chlamydia screening, compared with no screening, was significantly associated with a reduced risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in 2 of 4 trials and with reduced hospital-diagnosed PID (0.24% vs. 0.38%; relative risk, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.4–1.0]), but not with clinic-diagnosed PID or epididymitis, in the largest trial.

### Screening for genital chlamydia infection [^111KQp9d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Genital infections caused by *Chlamydia trachomatis* are the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infections worldwide. Screening sexually active young adults to detect and treat asymptomatic infections might reduce chlamydia transmission and prevent reproductive tract morbidity. This is particularly important for preventing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women, which can cause tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects and safety of chlamydia screening versus standard care on chlamydia transmission and infection complications in pregnant and non-pregnant women and in men.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, DARE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science electronic databases up to 14 February 2016, together with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also handsearched conference proceedings, contacted trial authors, and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adult women (non-pregnant and pregnant) and men comparing a chlamydia screening intervention with usual care and reporting on a primary outcome (e.g. *C. trachomatis* prevalence, PID in women, epididymitis in men, or incidence of preterm delivery). We included non-randomised controlled clinical trials if there were no RCTs for a primary outcome.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion.

### Azithromycin versus doxycycline for the treatment of genital chlamydia infection: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111t7zEM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

There has been recent debate questioning the efficacy of azithromycin for the treatment of urogenital chlamydia infection. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of 1 g azithromycin with 100 mg doxycycline taken twice daily for 7 days for the treatment of urogenital chlamydia infection.

- **Methods**: Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane reviews, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched until 31 December 2013. Randomized controlled trials comparing azithromycin with doxycycline for the treatment of genital chlamydia, with evaluation of microbiological cure within 3 months of treatment, were included. Sex, diagnostic test, follow-up time, attrition, patient symptomatic status, and microbiological cure were extracted. The primary outcome was the difference in efficacy at final follow-up. Study bias was quantitatively and qualitatively summarized.

- **Results**: Twenty-three studies were included, evaluating 1147 and 912 patients for azithromycin and doxycycline, respectively. We found a pooled efficacy difference in favor of doxycycline of 1.5% (95% confidence interval, -0.1% to 3.1%; I² = 1.9%; p = 0.435; random effects) to 2.6% (95% CI, 0.5%-4.7%; fixed effects). Subgroup analyses showed that the fixed effects pooled efficacy difference for symptomatic men was 7.4% (95% CI, 2.0%-12.9%), and the random effects was 5.5% (95% CI, -1.4% to 12.4%).

- **Conclusions**: There may be a small increased efficacy of up to 3% for doxycycline compared with azithromycin for the treatment of urogenital chlamydia.

### Screening and management of genital chlamydial infections [^112RyXNx]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Chlamydial genital infection is common and asymptomatic in most cases. National screening efforts, developed to educate practitioners, expand screening, and link testing to local health laboratories, are not meeting the needs of populations at great risk of disease, including young racial/ethnic minority women and sexual minorities. The development and availability of newer diagnostics will likely make chlamydia testing more efficient and widely available for patients and providers. Practitioners are reminded to have a low threshold to offer testing and presumptive treatment to patients deemed at high risk of disease, particularly those who are challenging to engage in care.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chlamydia trachomatis infection, specifically with respect to NAATs, the BASHH/IUSTI 2016 guidelines recommend against testing semen specimens. This is due to the strong correlation between first-void urine positivity and semen positivity, the ease of obtaining first-void urine, and the difficulty in excluding the possibility that C. trachomatis detected in semen is not solely from the urethra.

### Chlamydia (uncomplicated, genital) [^1129bpZq]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Low credibility.

Genital chlamydia is the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted disease (STD) in resource-rich countries. In women, infection occurs most frequently between the ages of 16 and 19 years.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of antibiotic treatment in men, non-pregnant women, and pregnant women with uncomplicated genital chlamydia infection? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 24 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions:
	- **Penicillins**: amoxicillin, ampicillin, pivampicillin
	- **Macrolides**: azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin
	- **Fluoroquinolones**: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin, trovafloxacin
	- **Tetracyclines**: doxycycline, lymecycline, minocycline, tetracycline
	- **Other antibiotics**: clindamycin, rifampicin

### Routine treatment versus selective treatment for individuals reporting contact with sexual partners with chlamydia: A before-and-after study [^112wbpPh]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

For chlamydia contacts, the recommended treatment regimen for uncomplicated genital or oropharyngeal infections was originally a single dose of azithromycin 1 g orally. However, as of 29 October 2020, this was changed to doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days following a randomized controlled trial showed doxycycline is superior to azithromycin for anorectal chlamydia treatment. During the selective treatment period, clients were generally provided with a prescription for chlamydia treatment (hereafter "delayed script"), but they were advised not to fill the prescription or take the medication until they received a positive chlamydia test result. Delayed scripts were only provided during the routine treatment period in special circumstances (e.g. clients attending MSHC late and our pharmacy was closed, or upon request).

In this analysis, we included all chlamydia contacts aged 16 years and older, across all genders (male, female, transgender, other), who visited MSHC during the study period. We excluded chlamydia contacts who had already received antibiotic treatment from another service before attending MSHC and those who were also contacts of gonorrhea, syphilis, and/or Mycoplasma genitalium, as the clinical care and management might vary due to the need to manage STIs other than chlamydia. We also reviewed medical records on a subset of data from both the routine (12 July to 29 November 2019) and selective (13 July to 30 November 2020) treatment periods to examine reasons for treatment given before test results. All contacts were tested for chlamydia on the day of their visit.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^112dvmQM]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Low credibility.

Continued support of gonorrhea prevention and control efforts remains fundamental, and preventing antibiotic resistance is crucial. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ceftriaxone indicate that a 500 mg dose in an average-weight U.S. adult achieves sufficiently high serum levels for an adequate duration to eradicate infection, even with broad pharmacokinetic variability. The high frequency of pharyngeal gonorrhea, with substantial underscreening, and the increased understanding of wide individual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability have contributed to the recommendation for the increased ceftriaxone dose. These recommendations also include a test-of-cure for persons with pharyngeal gonorrhea to ensure eradication or detection of a possible treatment failure.

Emerging antimicrobial resistance affects gonorrhea treatment recommendations and other STIs. The CDC recommends ceftriaxone monotherapy for treatment because N. gonorrhoeae remains highly susceptible to ceftriaxone, while azithromycin resistance is increasing, and prudent use of antimicrobial agents supports limiting their use. Continuing to monitor for the emergence of ceftriaxone resistance through surveillance and health care providers' reporting of treatment failures will be essential to ensuring continued efficacy of recommended regimens.

### Analysis of patient adherence to filling emergency department discharge prescriptions for empiric treatment of chlamydia [^116ja2Y8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) represent an enormous public health burden in the United States. Emergency departments (EDs) are a significant source of medical care, particularly for vulnerable patient populations. Guidelines for the treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis have evolved and now recommend doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as the primary regimen for adults. However, the single-dose azithromycin regimen can be given during the ED visit, while the new regimen has nonadherence hurdles. The purpose of this study will be to determine the rate of ED discharge prescription pickups of doxycycline for Chlamydia trachomatis infection at two discharge pharmacies.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective chart review of information contained in the electronic medical record (EMR) from August 1, 2021 - July 31, 2022. Adult patients who present to the two EDs in the healthcare system and those who received empiric antibiotic treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis infection prior to, or at, ED discharge will be included. Patients who are pregnant, less than 18 years old, those without a Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid amplification test during their ED visit, or patients whose antibiotic treatment prescription was sent to a pharmacy other than the two primary discharge pharmacies at the respective medical centers will be excluded. The primary outcome of this study will be determining the rate of emergency department (ED) discharge prescription pickups of doxycycline for empiric treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection at two discharge pharmacies.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis infections in adolescents and adults: Summary of evidence reviewed for the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines [^112bDYfo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015).

In preparation for the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Guidelines, the CDC convened an advisory group in 2013 to examine recent abstracts and published literature addressing the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of STDs. This article summarizes the key questions, evidence, and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection in adolescents and adults considered in the development of the 2015 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines.

The evidence reviewed primarily focused on CT infection risk factors in women, the clinical significance of oropharyngeal CT detection, acceptability and performance of CT testing on self-collected specimens in men, performance of CT point-of-care tests, efficacy of recommended and investigational CT infection treatments, and the timing of test of cure following CT infection treatment in pregnant women.

### Chlamydia and gonorrhea [^116H6pUh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea and chlamydia rates have risen to record-high levels in the United States over the past decade. Because these infections are often asymptomatic, effective clinical management relies on screening of asymptomatic patients, particularly women younger than 25 years and men who have sex with men. If undetected and untreated, gonorrhea and chlamydia can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain, and can facilitate HIV acquisition and transmission. Primary care providers need to be aware of recent changes in recommended treatments for both infections.

### Chlamydia trachomatis infections: screening, diagnosis, and management [^114J5FVY]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis is a gram-negative bacterium that infects the columnar epithelium of the cervix, urethra, and rectum, as well as non-genital sites such as the lungs and eyes. This bacterium is the cause of the most frequently reported sexually transmitted disease in the United States, responsible for more than 1 million infections annually. Most individuals with this infection are asymptomatic. Untreated infection can lead to serious complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy in women, and epididymitis and orchitis in men. Both men and women can experience chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis.

Treatment of uncomplicated cases should include azithromycin or doxycycline. Screening is recommended for all women younger than 25 years, all pregnant women, and women who are at increased risk of infection. Currently, screening is not recommended for men. In neonates and infants, the bacterium can cause conjunctivitis and pneumonia. Adults may also experience conjunctivitis caused by chlamydia. Trachoma is an ocular infection caused by chlamydia and is endemic in the developing world.

### Update on the epidemiology, screening, and management of Chlamydia trachomatis infection [^1174Fzn6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis infection ("chlamydia") is the most commonly diagnosed bacterial sexually transmitted infection globally, occurring in the genitals (urethra or vagina/cervix), rectum, or pharynx. If left untreated in women, genital chlamydia can ascend into the upper genital tract causing pelvic inflammatory disease, increasing their risk for ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. In men, chlamydia can cause epididymitis and proctitis. However, chlamydia is asymptomatic in over 80% of cases. This article provides an update on the epidemiology, natural history, and clinical manifestations of chlamydia in adults and discusses the approaches to its management and control policy.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^116iURSx]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Low credibility.

Combination therapy, using a highly effective gonococcal therapeutic agent with cotreatment for chlamydia, has been recommended since 1985. In 2007, based on data from CDC's Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) indicating widely disseminated quinolone-resistant gonococcal strains in the United States, CDC no longer recommended fluoroquinolones for treatment, leaving cephalosporins as the only remaining recommended antimicrobial class. Availability of sensitive C. trachomatis nucleic acid amplification tests was widespread by 2010, but CDC recommended gonococcal dual therapy with a cephalosporin (ceftriaxone 250 mg IM or cefixime 400 mg orally) and either azithromycin or doxycycline to reflect concerns regarding emerging gonococcal resistance.

By 2011, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefixime necessary to inhibit N. gonorrhoeae growth in vitro were increasing. In 2012, cefixime was no longer a recommended gonococcal regimen, with ceftriaxone and azithromycin combination therapy being the only recommended regimen for uncomplicated gonorrhea. Since the publication of the 2015 Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Guidelines, concerns regarding antimicrobial stewardship have increased, especially the impact of antimicrobial use on the microbiome and data indicating azithromycin resistance (elevated MICs) for gonorrhea and other organisms. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling has also affected the understanding of optimal antimicrobial dosing for N. gonorrhoeae treatment. This update provides the rationale for the change in gonorrhea treatment.

### Prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases: an update [^1175cE4i]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently published revised guidelines for the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. One new treatment strategy is the use of azithromycin as a primary, rather than alternative, medication for pregnant women with Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection continues to increase in the United States; therefore, quinolones are no longer recommended for treatment of this infection. Expedited partner therapy gives physicians another option when addressing the need to treat partners of persons diagnosed with N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis infection. Tinidazole is now available in the United States and can be used to manage trichomoniasis, including trichomoniasis resistant to metronidazole. Shorter courses of antiviral medication can be used for episodic therapy of genital herpes. Because of increasing resistance, close follow-up is required if azithromycin is used as an alternative treatment in the management of primary or secondary syphilis. Unexpected increases in the rates of lymphogranuloma venereum have occurred in The Netherlands, and physicians should remain vigilant for symptoms of this disease in the United States.

### Duration of untreated, uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis genital infection and factors associated with chlamydia resolution: A review of human studies [^114WMwSV]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The majority of Chlamydia trachomatis genital infections in humans are asymptomatic and without clinical evidence of complications at the time of diagnosis. The natural history of chlamydial infection in humans, including the duration of infection and factors influencing resolution of infection, is not yet completely understood. This is, in part, attributable to the inherent challenges and ethical considerations in studying untreated chlamydia in humans. An improved understanding of the natural history of chlamydia in humans has implications for chlamydia screening and treatment recommendations.

In April 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened an advisory group for the Chlamydia Immunology and Control Expert Advisory Meeting, where studies related to chlamydia natural history, pathogenesis, and immunobiology were reviewed. Gaps in our knowledge that would have implications for prevention and control of C. trachomatis infection were identified. This article summarizes the key questions posed and the evidence reviewed on the duration of untreated, uncomplicated genital chlamydial infection in humans and the factors associated with chlamydia resolution.

### Update to CDC's treatment guidelines for gonococcal infection, 2020 [^114Pgxq1]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). High credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcal infections) have increased by 63% since 2014 and are a cause of sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility, and can facilitate transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Effective treatment can prevent complications and transmission, but N. gonorrhoeae's ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance influences treatment recommendations and complicates control.

In 2010, the CDC recommended a single 250 mg intramuscular (IM) dose of ceftriaxone and a single 1 g oral dose of azithromycin for the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, and rectum as a strategy for preventing ceftriaxone resistance and treating possible coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis. Increasing concern for antimicrobial stewardship and the potential impact of dual therapy on commensal organisms and pathogens, in conjunction with the continued low incidence of ceftriaxone resistance and the increased incidence of azithromycin resistance, has led to reevaluation of this recommendation.

This report, which updates previous guidelines, recommends a single 500 mg IM dose of ceftriaxone for the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, and pharyngeal gonorrhea. If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, treatment with doxycycline (100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days) is recommended. Continuing to monitor the emergence of ceftriaxone resistance through surveillance and healthcare providers' reports is essential.
