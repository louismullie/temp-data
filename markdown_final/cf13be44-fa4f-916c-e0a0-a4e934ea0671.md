## Question

Medication for hypertensive urgency in the elderly

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medication management for hypertensive urgency in the elderly. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying definitions and distinguishing hypertensive urgency from emergency. Then, I should verify the overarching principle of avoiding rapid BP reduction. Next, I will review guideline-based treatment targets and time course for elderly patients. After that, I need to check which medication classes and combinations are preferred in older adults, including frailty considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and highlight special situations and monitoring needs, making sure each assertion is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate urgency with emergency. Hypertensive urgency is severe elevation of blood pressure, typically ≥ 180/110 mmHg, without acute target organ damage, whereas hypertensive emergency includes the same BP thresholds plus evidence of acute end-organ injury and mandates parenteral therapy with close monitoring; this distinction drives entirely different management pathways, so I need to ensure I'm not mixing them up.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "treating the number". The core principle for hypertensive urgency is to avoid rapid BP reduction because it does not improve short-term outcomes and may precipitate cerebral or coronary hypoperfusion; instead, reinstitute or intensify oral therapy and allow BP to drift down over 24–48 hours with close follow-up, reserving parenteral agents for emergencies only [^7165ec6e] [^d112dd24].

> Next, I should review treatment targets in older adults, and I need to be careful to align with age-specific guidance. For patients aged 65–79 years, a primary goal of < 140/80 mmHg is reasonable, with consideration of < 130/80 mmHg if well tolerated; for patients aged ≥ 80 years, a more conservative target of 140–150 mmHg systolic is advised, with caution if diastolic is already < 70 mmHg, and in those ≥ 85 or with moderate-to-severe frailty, even more lenient targets such as < 140/90 mmHg may be appropriate; importantly, treatment should not be withdrawn solely due to age if tolerated [^1e77ee2b] [^42885b54] [^b42b9e1e] [^d42d28d2] [^285c22a6].

> I will now examine medication choices, and I should double-check class preferences in the elderly. In most non-frail older adults, initiating a two-drug combination is favored to achieve faster control; preferred combinations pair a renin–angiotensin system blocker (ACE inhibitor or ARB) with either a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, while avoiding beta-blockers or alpha-blockers as first-line in those ≥ 85 or with frailty unless there is a compelling indication; in frail or very elderly patients, monotherapy with cautious titration may be safer, and orthostatic hypotension should be screened and managed proactively [^2141ea9f] [^b9d02365] [^e768f47a] [^50fb5c9d].

> Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: I initially thought "start low, go slow" meant delaying treatment for days, but that's not correct; "start low, go slow" refers to using lower initial doses and titrating more gradually in older adults to mitigate falls, syncope, and renal injury, while still initiating therapy promptly and planning close follow-up within 24–48 hours to adjust the regimen and reassess tolerance [^37c1409b] [^7165ec6e].

> Let me consider special situations so I don't miss important modifiers. If there is a suggestion of primary aldosteronism, it is reasonable to avoid RAAS-modifying agents temporarily while obtaining screening labs, but if the patient is symptomatic or there is concern for impending organ damage, do not withhold needed therapy; instead, interpret results in the context of ongoing treatment and consider agents with minimal RAAS interaction if screening integrity is a priority [^ed31612e] [^0f6549e5] [^75cd082e].

> I should confirm the practical, stepwise approach and make sure it aligns with evidence. First, confirm accurate BP with repeated measurements and exclude target organ damage; second, if the patient is already on antihypertensives, reinforce adherence and adjust existing therapy rather than adding short-acting agents; third, if treatment-naïve or under-treated, start a two-drug combination at low doses in non-frail patients or a single agent in frail patients; fourth, arrange follow-up within 1–2 weeks to titrate and add a third agent if needed; fifth, educate on home BP monitoring and orthostatic precautions, and screen for frailty and falls risk in those ≥ 85 [^7165ec6e] [^2141ea9f] [^3de85b1b] [^498b4470].

> But wait, what if the patient presents to the ED or office and someone proposes clonidine loading for rapid control? I need to ensure I counsel against short-acting agents like immediate-release clonidine or sublingual nifedipine for hypertensive urgency because of rebound hypertension, oversedation, and ischemic risk; instead, favor long-acting oral agents and avoid parenteral therapy unless there is evolving organ injury or a compelling perioperative/NPO indication where carefully selected parenteral options may be used with monitoring [^03850778] [^35cd3de0] [^de8afb48].

> Finally, I should double-check that my synthesis preserves the key takeaways. In elderly patients with hypertensive urgency, do not aggressively lower BP acutely; reinstate or intensify oral therapy with guideline-directed combinations, start low and titrate slowly, individualize targets by age and frailty, and ensure close follow-up; this approach reduces harm from rapid BP drops while addressing long-term cardiovascular risk, and it is consistent with contemporary ACC/AHA and ESH/ESC guidance [^7165ec6e] [^1e77ee2b] [^2141ea9f].

---

For hypertensive urgency in the elderly, **oral agents are preferred** [^7165ec6e] and **rapid BP reduction should be avoided** [^2ae3a846] to prevent ischemic events. Start with low-dose, long-acting agents such as amlodipine, lisinopril, or chlorthalidone, and titrate slowly over days to weeks [^37c1409b]. Avoid short-acting nifedipine, clonidine, and parenteral drugs unless absolutely necessary [^03850778] [^7165ec6e]. Monitor closely for orthostatic hypotension, renal function, and electrolytes, and reassess within 24–48 hours [^50fb5c9d] [^566501e2] [^6958f478].

---

## Pharmacological management principles

- **Avoid rapid BP reduction**: Rapid lowering can cause cerebral, coronary, or renal ischemia; aim for a gradual reduction over 24–48 hours [^2ae3a846].

- **Oral agents preferred**: Use oral medications; avoid parenteral agents unless oral therapy is not feasible or tolerated [^7165ec6e].

- **Start low, titrate slowly**: Begin at low doses and titrate slowly to minimize adverse effects and orthostatic hypotension [^37c1409b].

---

## Recommended medications

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Rationale in elderly** |
|-|-|-|
| Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) | - Amlodipine <br/> - Felodipine | - Effective <br/> - Well tolerated <br/> - Low risk of orthostatic hypotension [^notfound] |
| Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) | - Lisinopril <br/> - Enalapril | - Effective <br/> - Beneficial in CKD and diabetes <br/> - Monitor renal function and potassium [^a4680c5c] |
| Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) | - Losartan <br/> - Valsartan | - Alternative to ACEis <br/> - Lower cough risk <br/> - Monitor renal function and potassium [^notfound] |
| Thiazide-like diuretics | - Chlorthalidone <br/> - Indapamide | - Effective for isolated systolic hypertension <br/> - Monitor electrolytes and renal function [^notfound] |
| Beta-blockers | - Metoprolol <br/> - Carvedilol | Use only with compelling indications (e.g. CAD, heart failure) [^b9d02365] |

---

## Medications to avoid or use with caution

- **Short-acting nifedipine**: Risk of rapid BP drop and ischemic events; avoid [^35cd3de0].

- **Clonidine**: Short-acting; risk of rebound hypertension and sedation; avoid [^03850778].

- **Parenteral agents**: Generally avoid unless oral therapy is not feasible or tolerated [^7165ec6e].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Assess at each visit; adjust therapy if present [^50fb5c9d].

- **Renal function and electrolytes**: Monitor regularly, especially with ACEis, ARBs, and diuretics [^notfound].

- **Follow-up**: Reassess within 24–48 hours to ensure BP is declining appropriately and to adjust therapy [^c62d4913].

---

## Special considerations

Frailty warrants **individualized targets and slower titration** [^498b4470] [^37c1409b]. Comorbidities should guide agent selection — for example, use ACEis/ARBs for CKD or diabetes and beta-blockers for CAD or heart failure [^a4680c5c]. Patient education should emphasize adherence, home BP monitoring, and recognition of symptoms of hypotension or adverse effects [^566501e2].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Oral agents**: Preferred; avoid rapid BP reduction [^7165ec6e].

- **Start low, titrate slowly**: Minimize adverse effects and orthostatic hypotension [^37c1409b].

- **Preferred agents**: CCBs, ACEis, ARBs, thiazide-like diuretics [^00ddcc1a].

- **Avoid**: Short-acting nifedipine, clonidine, and parenteral agents unless necessary [^03850778] [^7165ec6e].

- **Monitor**: Orthostatic hypotension, renal function, electrolytes, and reassess within 24–48 hours [^50fb5c9d] [^c62d4913].

---

In elderly patients with hypertensive urgency, **oral agents with gradual titration** are preferred; avoid rapid BP reduction and monitor closely for adverse effects and orthostatic hypotension [^7165ec6e] [^2ae3a846].

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^7dbb8153]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertensive urgency (HU) is defined as systolic blood pressure of at least 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of at least 110 mmHg, without associated end-organ damage. Patients with HU may be completely asymptomatic or may present with symptoms such as headache, epistaxis, faintness, malaise, psychomotor agitation, nausea, or vomiting.

Up to 65 million Americans have hypertension; about 1% will have an episode of HU during their lives. The prevalence of HU in emergency room (ER) or office settings is estimated at 3–5%. In a recent cohort study, cardiovascular events were found to occur in less than 1% of patients within a 6-month period.

Guidance for immediate management of HU is unclear, since there is no consensus on the optimal target for acute blood pressure reduction or the time frame for achieving a normal blood pressure range. Most patients receive drug therapy for elevated blood pressure within the first 48 h of presentation. – Knowledge of the effectiveness and safety of different medication choices and associated comorbidities is crucial for clinicians, especially generalists.

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize evidence of the benefits and harms associated with antihypertensive medications used to treat HU in adults, either in the clinic or ER. This systematic review is intended for a broad audience, including clinicians — especially general internists — along with policymakers and funding agencies, professional societies developing clinical practice guidelines, patients and their care providers, and researchers.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^709ef022]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertensive urgency (HU), defined as acute severe uncontrolled hypertension without end-organ damage, is a common condition. Despite its association with long-term morbidity and mortality, guidance regarding immediate management is sparse. Our objective was to summarize the evidence examining the effects of antihypertensive medications to treat.

Methods

We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Embase through May 2016. Study selection: We evaluated prospective controlled clinical trials, case–control studies, and cohort studies of HU in emergency room (ER) or clinic settings. We initially identified 11,223 published articles. We reviewed 10,748 titles and abstracts and identified 538 eligible articles. We assessed the full text for eligibility and included 31 articles written in English that were clinical trials or cohort studies and provided blood pressure data within 48 h of treatment. Studies were appraised for risk of bias using components recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. The main outcome measured was blood pressure change with antihypertensive medications. Since studies were too diverse both clinically and methodologically to combine in a meta-analysis, tabular data and a narrative synthesis of studies are presented.

Results

We identified only 20 double-blind randomized controlled trials and 12 cohort studies, with 262 participants in prospective controlled trials. However, we could not pool the results of studies. In addition, comorbidities and their potential contribution to long-term treatment of these subjects were not adequately addressed in any of the reviewed studies.

Conclusions

Longitudinal studies are still needed to determine how best to lower blood pressure in patients with HU. Longer-term management of individuals who have experienced HU continues to be an area requiring further study, especially as applicable to care from the generalist.

### Current diagnosis and management of hypertensive emergency [^6958f478]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

The appropriate and timely evaluation and treatment of patients with severely elevated blood pressure is essential to avoid serious adverse outcomes. Most importantly, the distinction between a hypertensive emergency (crisis) and urgency needs to be made. A sudden elevation in systolic (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that is associated with acute end organ damage (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or renal) is defined as a hypertensive crisis or emergency. In contrast, acute elevation in SBP and/or DBP not associated with evidence of end organ damage is defined as hypertensive urgency. In patients with a hypertensive emergency, blood pressure control should be attained as expeditiously as possible with parenteral medications to prevent ongoing and potentially permanent end organ damage. In contrast, with hypertensive urgency, blood pressure control can be achieved with the use of oral medications within 24–48 hours. This paper reviews the management of hypertensive emergencies.

CONCLUSION

Additional longitudinal studies are needed to determine how best to safely decrease blood pressure in patients with HU. Larger and longer-term studies are also needed, including participants with other common comorbidities. Such research would hopefully provide more guidance to improve both short- and long-term cardiovascular outcome.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: failing to consider primary aldosteronism in the initial evaluation of hypertension, hypertensive urgency, and hypertensive emergency [^ed31612e]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS

(1) If primary aldosteronism screening is warranted, and the patient remains asymptomatic and without complications of hypertension, consider withholding a new antihypertensive regimen until blood samples can be obtained.
(2) For patients who are symptomatic (e.g. hypertensive emergency) or exhibit complications of hypertension, do not discontinue ongoing efforts to manage hypertension. Instead, interpret primary aldosterone screening results in the context of medication effects.
(3) Patients should be referred to endocrinology or hypertension specialists like nephrology or cardiology. However, which specialty should preferentially manage primary aldosteronism might differ based on the institution and available resources.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate combination BP-lowering treatment in most patients with confirmed HTN (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg) as initial therapy. Prefer combining a renin-angiotensin system blocker (either an ACEi or an ARB) with a dihydropyridine CCB or diuretic. Avoid initiating combination treatment in patients aged ≥ 85 years, and patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, moderate-to-severe frailty, or elevated BP (SBP 120–139 mmHg or DBP 70–89 mmHg) with a concomitant indication for treatment.

- high-normal BP and very high cardiovascular risk

- frailty and/or advanced age.

Study Selection

Studies that 1) reported on adults with HU who received pharmacologic therapy in outpatient settings (clinic or ER) and 2) reported initial and subsequent blood pressure values within 48 h of medication administration were reviewed. Studies were excluded if they included animals, pediatric or pregnant patients, or the presence of acute end-organ damage. Because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibits the use of nifedipine for acute management of elevated blood pressure, articles that included only this drug were also excluded (532 studies).

Primary outcome(s): Given the lack of consensus regarding the blood pressure reduction goal when treating HU, most studies did not report dichotomous outcomes. The primary measures of treatment efficacy were reduction in SBP, DBP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP; in mmHg) within 48 h of pharmacologic treatment.

Secondary outcomes: We extracted adverse effects including headache, dizziness, dry mouth, hypotension, stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, pulmonary edema, arrhythmia, renal impairment, new-onset proteinuria, and hospitalization. None of the studies reported on cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.

Data extraction: Using standardized Excel forms, four groups of two investigators each (JLW, AJC, KO, DJ, CLC, AA, BB, CH) independently extracted data including the author, country, year, study type, setting, sample size, demographics, medications, details of treatment, primary outcome, adverse effects, and initial and subsequent blood pressure values. The team calculated MAP values when not explicitly calculated by the authors.

Two members of the team independently graded the strength of clinical data and subsequent recommendations for treatment of patients with HU according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine levels of evidence. Any discrepancies were resolved after a joint review and discussion with a third reviewer. Levels of evidence were as follows: level 1A, systematic reviews (with homogeneity of randomized clinical trials); level 1B, individual randomized clinical trials (with narrow confidence intervals); level 2A, systematic reviews (with homogeneity of cohort studies); and level 2B, individual cohort studies (including low-quality randomized clinical trials). Grades of recommendation are as follows: A = consistent level 1 studies; B = consistent level 2 or 3 studies, or extrapolations from level 1 studies; C = level 4 studies or extrapolations from level 2 or 3 studies; and D = level 5 evidence or inconsistent or inconclusive studies of any level. Studies with a high loss to follow-up were flagged.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^8e65a4d5]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, existing guidelines provide few recommendations as to the management of those with markedly elevated BP absent a hypertensive emergency, leading to questions on who warrants diagnostic testing to look for end-organ injury, how much acute pain or anxiety may contribute to BP in the ED, when initiation or titration of antihypertensive medications is indicated, or how to manage patients with no reliable outpatient follow-up. Emergency clinicians continue to use outdated and incorrect diagnoses such as "hypertension urgency", a term that implies the need for "something" to be done in the ED setting, despite lack of sound basis in the literature, including current international guidelines.

Other Topics

Both guidelines provide recommendations for follow-up intervals, with the ACC/AHA CPG suggesting 1 year for reevaluation of adults with a normal BP, 3 to 6 months for those treated with nonpharmacological therapy, and 1 month after initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy followed by 3 to 6 months after meeting the BP goal. The ESC/ESH CPG suggests follow-up within the first 2 months after the initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy, with the caveat that the interval should depend on the severity of hypertension and urgency to achieve BP control. After the desired BP target has been achieved, an interval of a few months is suggested for BP monitoring and 2 years for reassessment of risk factors and evidence of asymptomatic target organ damage. The ESC/ESH CPG recommends achieving BP control within 3 months of initiating therapy, further emphasizing the need to consider initial therapy with combination drugs in most patients to achieve rapid BP control.

Both guidelines provide detailed guidance for detection and management of secondary hypertension, definition and management of resistant hypertension, hypertensive urgencies and emergencies, masked and white coat hypertension, hypertension in older adults, men and women, persons of different race/ethnicity, and patients with various comorbidities and conditions, including heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, CKD, peripheral vascular disease, DM and metabolic syndrome, aortic disease, and pregnancy.

Both guidelines focus considerable attention on strategies to improve adherence to therapy, emphasizing the advantage of single-pill combinations to improve adherence and overcome therapeutic inertia, and team-based care. Both guidelines also focus on implementation, that is, models for delivery of care, use of health information technology, improving quality of care, health literacy, access to care, social and community services, and a patient-specific plan of care. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for treatment of isolated systolic hypertension, and it recommends reserving device-based treatments of hypertension for research settings. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for managing concomitant CVD risk with specific recommendations for the use of statins, antiplatelet drugs, and oral anticoagulation (in atrial fibrillation), whereas the ACC/AHA largely defers to other ACC/AHA guidelines that cover these topics. Last, both guidelines identify gaps in evidence and provide a summary key message (ESC/ESH) or BP treatment thresholds and goals (ACC/AHA).

### What is new and different in the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension? [^64832e9a]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2024, the European Society of Cardiology released a new guideline for the management of elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension. The guideline introduced a new BP categorization: (1) nonelevated (office BP < 120/70 mmHg) for which drug treatment is not recommended, (2) elevated (120–139/70–89 mmHg) for which drug treatment is recommended based on cardiovascular disease risk and follow-up BP level, and (3) hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg) for which prompt confirmation and drug treatment are recommended in most individuals. The initial default systolic BP treatment target is 120 to 129 mmHg; however, relaxed targets (BP as low as reasonably achievable) are recommended in case of treatment intolerance, adults ≥ 85 years, symptomatic orthostasis, moderate-to-severe frailty, or limited life expectancy. Here, we summarize what is new and different in the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines, relative to other major international hypertension guidelines in Europe and America. Our aim is to reconcile any uncertainty clinicians may have about implementing these various guidelines in patient care.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: failing to consider primary aldosteronism in the initial evaluation of hypertension, hypertensive urgency, and hypertensive emergency [^0f6549e5]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is frequently treated as essential hypertension. However, secondary causes of hypertension should be considered, because distinct treatments are used for different causes of hypertension. Primary aldosteronism is considered a candidate for the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Despite the effects of many antihypertensive agents on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, ongoing efforts to manage hypertension should not be discontinued solely for the purposes of screening. If a patient presents with new or untreated hypertension, screening should be considered before starting antihypertensive agents that could affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

### Hypertensive crises: challenges and management [^64f74f1d]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects > 65 million people in the United States and is one of the leading causes of death. One to two percent of patients with hypertension have acute elevations of BP that require urgent medical treatment. Depending on the degree of BP elevation and presence of end-organ damage, severe hypertension can be defined as either a hypertensive emergency or a hypertensive urgency. A hypertensive emergency is associated with acute end-organ damage and requires immediate treatment with a titratable short-acting IV antihypertensive agent. Severe hypertension without acute end-organ damage is referred to as a hypertensive urgency and is usually treated with oral antihypertensive agents. This article reviews definitions, current concepts, common misconceptions, and pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of patients with acutely elevated BP as well as special clinical situations in which BP must be controlled.

Risk of Bias Assessment

For controlled trials, we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool. For cohort studies, we used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess study quality.

Data Synthesis

We could not combine results statistically because of heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures. Furthermore, studies often lacked clearly defined primary outcomes. Therefore, we qualitatively synthesized results by antihypertensive medication class and created tables summarizing the evidence across all studies reviewed.

Introduction

Hypertension represents a significant global public health challenge and is widely recognized as a condition that markedly elevates the risk of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases, including stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. In Asia, including Japan, the increasing prevalence of hypertension, attributable to lifestyle changes and population aging, underscores the urgency of early diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention. Public and occupational health examinations are conducted to facilitate the early identification of individuals at risk of hypertension. For patients with hypertension, the next step involves individual risk profile-based customization of treatment strategies.

Major international guidelines on hypertension, such as the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) guideline and 2024 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, recommend immediate pharmacotherapy initiation in older adults and patients with a high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, identified through risk assessment tools. However, the optimal age for initiating pharmacotherapy in younger patients or those with low-to-moderate risk of cardiovascular events remains unknown. This constitutes a knowledge gap regarding the age-appropriate timing of pharmacotherapy initiation in non-elderly and relatively low-risk patients with hypertension. However, the duration of untreated hypertension is associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular events, and to optimize treatment strategies, it is important to understand how age and time to treatment initiation affect cardiovascular outcomes.

This study aimed to assess the impact of the time to initiation of antihypertensive therapy on the occurrence of cardiovascular events by age-stratified analysis using data from a nationwide health claims database.

WHY YOU MIGHT THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO MANAGE HYPERTENSION WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR PRIMARY ALDOSTERONISM

Given the frequency with which clinicians encounter hypertension and its complications, it can be habitual to initiate therapeutic interventions without considering that hypertension may be secondary to another pathophysiologic process. For hospitalists, the inpatient setting may further discourage screening of primary aldosteronism. Because intensive blood pressure management in hospitalized adults is associated with greater risk of adverse events, hospitalists may not be inclined to consider additional workup or treatment of hypertension. Moreover, hypertension due to primary aldosteronism could respond at least partially to common first‐line antihypertensive agents, thereby inducing a false sense of security. Primary aldosteronism screening aims to identify renin‐independent aldosterone overproduction. Multiple antihypertensive medications (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta‐blockers, diuretics) that frequently serve as first‐line agents for essential hypertension interact with the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). Providers could therefore be concerned that use of these medications could potentially confound the diagnostic evaluation of primary aldosteronism.

Hypertensive emergencies — risk and approach for severe hypertension without target organ damage: Patients with hypertensive emergencies experience a high in-hospital mortality rate of 10% with a 1-year cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rate of 20% to 30%. In contrast, patients with severe hypertension without evidence of acute target organ damage (previously called hypertensive urgency) should not have aggressive BP lowering in the short-term or be given parenteral antihypertensive drug therapy, and reinstitution or intensification of oral antihypertensive medications, preferably in the outpatient setting, is recommended for these patients.

### Management of inpatient elevated blood pressures: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^05e5900b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of elevated blood pressure (BP) during hospitalization varies widely, with many hospitalized adults experiencing BPs higher than those recommended for the outpatient setting.

Purpose

To systematically identify guidelines on elevated BP management in the hospital.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Guidelines International Network, and specialty society websites from 1 January 2010 to 29 January 2024.

Study Selection

Clinical practice guidelines pertaining to BP management for the adult and older adult populations in ambulatory, emergency department, and inpatient settings.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently screened articles, assessed quality, and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved via consensus. Recommendations on treatment targets, preferred antihypertensive classes, and follow-up were collected for ambulatory and inpatient settings.

Data Synthesis

Fourteen clinical practice guidelines met inclusion criteria (11 were assessed as high-quality per the AGREE II [Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II] instrument), 11 provided broad BP management recommendations, and 1 each was specific to the emergency department setting, older adults, and hypertensive crises. No guidelines provided goals for inpatient BP or recommendations for managing asymptomatic moderately elevated BP in the hospital. Six guidelines defined hypertensive urgency as BP above 180/120 mm Hg, with hypertensive emergencies requiring the addition of target organ damage. Hypertensive emergency recommendations consistently included use of intravenous antihypertensives in intensive care settings. Recommendations for managing hypertensive urgencies were inconsistent, from expert consensus, and focused on the emergency department. Outpatient treatment with oral medications and follow-up in days to weeks were most often advised. In contrast, outpatient BP goals were clearly defined, varying between 130/80 and 140/90 mm Hg.

Limitation

Exclusion of non-English-language guidelines and guidelines specific to subpopulations.

Conclusion

Despite general consensus on outpatient BP management, guidance on inpatient management of elevated BP without symptoms is lacking, which may contribute to variable practice patterns.

### Management of perioperative hypertensive urgencies with parenteral medications [^de8afb48]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the major risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease such as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. This risk is well known to extend into the perioperative period. Although most perioperative hypertension can be managed with the patient's outpatient regimen, there are situations in which oral medications cannot be administered and parenteral medications become necessary. They include postoperative nil per os status, severe pancreatitis, and mechanical ventilation. This article reviews the management of perioperative hypertensive urgency with parenteral medications.

Methods

A PubMed search was conducted by cross-referencing the terms "perioperative hypertension", "hypertensive urgency", "hypertensive emergency", "parenteral anti-hypertensive", and "medication". The search was limited to English-language articles published between 1970 and 2008. Subsequent PubMed searches were performed to clarify data from the initial search.

Results

As patients with hypertensive urgency are not at great risk for target-organ damage (TOD), continuous infusions that require intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring and intraarterial catheters seem to be unnecessary and a possible misuse of resources.

Conclusions

When oral therapy cannot be administered, patients with hypertensive urgency can have their blood pressure (BP) reduced with hydralazine, enalaprilat, metoprolol, or labetalol. Due to the scarcity of comparative trials looking at clinically significant outcomes, the medication should be chosen based on comorbidity, efficacy, toxicity, and cost.

### Evaluation and treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension [^536bfb18]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Poorly controlled hypertension is a common finding in the outpatient setting. When patients present with severely elevated blood pressure (i.e., systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or greater, or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or greater), physicians need to differentiate hypertensive emergency from severely elevated blood pressure without signs or symptoms of end-organ damage (severe asymptomatic hypertension). Most patients who are asymptomatic but have poorly controlled hypertension do not have acute end-organ damage and, therefore, do not require immediate workup or treatment (within 24 hours). However, physicians should confirm blood pressure readings and appropriately classify the hypertensive state. A cardiovascular risk profile is important in guiding the treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension; higher risk patients may benefit from more urgent and aggressive evaluation and treatment. Oral agents may be initiated before discharge, but intravenous medications and fast-acting oral agents should be reserved for true hypertensive emergencies. High blood pressure should be treated gradually. Appropriate, repeated follow-up over weeks to months is needed to reach desired blood pressure goals.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: failing to consider primary aldosteronism in the initial evaluation of hypertension, hypertensive urgency, and hypertensive emergency [^75cd082e]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, if suspicion for primary aldosteronism is high enough to warrant screening, ongoing management of hypertension should not be discontinued solely for maximizing screening accuracy. Instead, the provider should conduct primary aldosteronism screening and interpret the results in the context of the patient's current medications. Conversely, it may be reasonable to withhold treatment or consider the use of antihypertensive medications with minimal RAAS interaction for a short period in those with new asymptomatic and uncomplicated hypertension.

In instances of hypertensive urgency, when symptoms related to hypertensive emergency are absent, screening for primary aldosteronism can occur. In cases of hypertensive emergency, medications such as verapamil and hydralazine may be useful before obtaining the needed laboratory samples. These practices would improve the integrity of primary aldosteronism screening, thereby guiding patients toward targeted treatment selection and improved health outcomes.

WHY MANAGING HYPERTENSION WITHOUT CONSIDERING PRIMARY ALDOSTERONISM IS NOT HELPFUL

Various causes of hypertension (i.e. secondary hypertension) have distinct treatments, and indiscriminately treating as essential hypertension could lead to a delay in appropriate diagnosis and treatment. In a survey study of patients with primary aldosteronism, approximately 30% of patients were found to have primary aldosteronism 1–3 years after they were diagnosed with hypertension; over half of patients had a delay of greater than 3 years. A retrospective study found that half of patients with hypokalemic primary aldosteronism experienced delays in diagnosis, with a median delay of 4.5 years. Missed diagnosis and delayed treatment of primary aldosteronism is particularly dangerous, as patients with primary aldosteronism are at higher risk for cardiovascular events and renal dysfunction compared to those with essential hypertension at similar blood pressure levels. This heightened risk is attributed to aldosterone‐mediated end‐organ damage resulting in endothelial dysfunction, vascular remodeling, fibrosis, and oxidative stress. Hundemer et al. found that compared to patients with essential hypertension, those with suppressed renin activity had excess risk for cardiovascular events and mortality with hazard ratio (HR) 2.83. Those who were adequately treated with unsuppressed renin had no significant excess risk.

Effective therapies for primary aldosteronism differ from those of essential hypertension. For example, primary aldosteronism due to bilateral disease is treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (e.g. spironolactone or eplerenone), which are not typical first‐line agents for management of essential hypertension. Similarly, primary aldosteronism due to unilateral disease can be effectively managed with adrenalectomy, which would not be appropriate for essential hypertension. Timely diagnosis allows for targeted medical and/or surgical management, which can help patients achieve blood pressure goals, reduce risk for cardiovascular events, reduce left ventricular mass, improve hypokalemia, improve kidney function, and reduce risk for all‐cause mortality.

Classification and management of blood pressure for adults aged 18 years or older detail categories, lifestyle modification, and initial drug therapy. Normal is defined as systolic < 120 mm Hg and diastolic < 80 mm Hg with lifestyle modification to encourage. Prehypertension is 120–139 mm Hg systolic or 80–89 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications no antihypertensive drug is indicated. Stage 1 hypertension is 140–159 mm Hg systolic or 90–99 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications initial therapy is thiazide-type diuretics for most; may consider ACE inhibitor, ARB, β-blocker, CCB, or combination. Stage 2 hypertension is ≥ 160 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 100 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications initial therapy is a 2-drug combination for most (usually thiazide-type diuretic and ACE inhibitor or ARB or β-blocker or CCB). With compelling indications, use drug(s) for the compelling indications, with other antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, ACE inhibitor, ARB, β-blocker, CCB) as needed. Treatment is determined by highest BP category. Treat patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes to BP goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Initial combined therapy should be used cautiously in those at risk for orthostatic hypotension.

### Clinical review: the management of hypertensive crises [^b019de15]. Critical Care (2003). Low credibility.

Hypertension is an extremely common clinical problem, affecting approximately 50 million people in the USA and approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. Approximately 1% of these patients will develop acute elevations in blood pressure at some point in their lifetime. A number of terms have been applied to severe hypertension, including hypertensive crises, emergencies, and urgencies. By definition, acute elevations in blood pressure that are associated with end-organ damage are called hypertensive crises. Immediate reduction in blood pressure is required only in patients with acute end-organ damage. This article reviews current concepts, and common misconceptions and pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of patients with acutely elevated blood pressure.

### 2014 guideline for management of high blood pressure… [^7564c7a7]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In adults with hypertension, does initiating antihypertensive pharmacologic therapy at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes. In adults with hypertension, does treatment with antihypertensive pharmacologic therapy to a specified BP goal lead to improvements in health outcomes. In adults with hypertension, do various antihypertensive drugs or drug classes differ in comparative benefits and harms on specific health outcomes.

In the general population aged ≥ 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure at systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal SBP < 150 mm Hg and goal DBP < 90 mm Hg. In the population aged ≥ 18 years with diabetes, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP at SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal SBP < 140 mm Hg and goal DBP < 90 mm Hg. In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker.

For ages 18 through 29 years, Expert Opinion – Grade E Recommendation 2 is based on high-quality evidence from 5 DBP trials that demonstrate improvements in health outcomes among adults aged 30 through 69 years with elevated BP. 13–18 Initiation of antihypertensive treatment at a DBP threshold of 90 mm Hg or higher and treatment to a DBP goal of lower than 90 mm Hg reduces cerebrovascular events, heart failure, and overall mortality.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^a3f592a1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this systematic review of HU, the optimal choice of antihypertensive agent remains unclear (level 2B). Many agents demonstrated blood pressure-lowering benefit: captopril, labetalol, clonidine, amlodipine, verapamil, nitrendipine, isradipine, nifedipine, nitroglycerin, hydralazine, chlorthalidone, furosemide, diazoxide, nitroprusside, and fenoldopam. Other drugs that lowered blood pressure but are unavailable in the U.S. include lacidipine, ketanserin, and urapidil. Clinical choices in the setting of HU seemed to broaden as we conducted our extensive literature search. Side effects ranged from mild (dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting, dry mouth, mild tachycardia, and sedation) to severe (hypotension, transient ischemic attack, uremia, and acute pulmonary edema).

Most studies limited data collection to the first few hours after initial presentation, which is not sufficient to assess morbidity and mortality. Studies were too clinically and methodologically diverse for a meta-analysis, and those that met our criteria for this systematic review included few patients. Most studies excluded patients with significant comorbidities, such as chronic kidney impairment; however, HU is a common complication in patients with associated comorbidities. In light of these factors, the generalizability of our findings is limited. Most studies that met our inclusion criteria provided only surrogate endpoint data, i.e. blood pressure lowering, and were short-term, lacking long-term morbidity and/or mortality outcomes, and providing statistical power only for differences in blood pressure lowering.

Our comprehensive systematic review regarding treatment of outpatient HU includes office and ER settings, limiting data to short-term observations of blood pressure (less than 24 h). This review also included studies based on blood pressure cut-offs, allowing us to distinguish studies that were mislabeled as urgencies or emergencies.

### Management of patients with hypertensive urgencies and emergencies: a systematic review of the literature [^edc749d9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertensive urgencies and emergencies are common clinical occurrences in hypertensive patients. Treatment practices vary considerably to because of the lack of evidence supporting the use of one therapeutic agent over another. This paper was designed to review the evidence for various pharmacotherapeutic regimens in the management of hypertensive urgencies and emergencies, in terms of the agents' abilities to reach predetermined "safe" goal blood pressures (BPs), and to prevent adverse events.

Methods

medline was searched from 1966 to 2001, and the reference lists of all the articles were retrieved and searched for relevant references, and experts in the field were contacted to identify other relevant studies. The Cochrane Library was also searched. Studies that were eligible for inclusion in this review were systematic reviews of randomized control trials (RCTs) and individual RCTs, all-or-none studies, systematic reviews of cohort studies and individual cohort studies, and outcomes research. No language restrictions were used.

Results

None of the trials included in this review identified an optimal rate of BP lowering in hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. The definitions of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies were not consistent, but emergencies always involved target end-organ damage, and urgencies were without such damage. Measures of outcome were not uniform between studies. The 4 hypertensive emergency and 15 hypertensive urgency studies represented 236 and 1,074 patients, respectively. The evidence indicated a nonsignificant trend toward increased efficacy with urapidil compared to nitroprusside for hypertensive emergencies (number needed to treat [NNT] for urapidil to achieve target BP, 12; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], number of patients needed to harm [NNH], 5 to NNT, 40 compared to nitroprusside). Several medications were efficacious in treating hypertensive urgencies, including: nicardipine (NNT for nicardipine compared to plabebo, 2 in one study [95% CI, 1 to 5] and 1 in another [95% CI, 1 to 1]); lacidipine (NNT, 2; 95% CI, 1 to 8 for lacidipine vs nifedipine) or urapidil (NNT for urapidil compared to enalaprilat and nifedipine, 4; 95% CI, 3 to 6); and nitroprusside and fenoldopam (all patients reached target BP in 2 studies). The studies reported 2 cases of cerebral ischemia secondary to nifedipine.

Conclusions

Many effective agents exist for the treatment of hypertensive crises. Because of the lack of large randomized controlled trials, many questions remain unanswered, such as follow-up times and whether any of the studied agents have mortality benefit.

### Implementing a policy and protocol on managing patients with hypertensive urgencies [^03850778]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The use of short-acting agents, such as clonidine, for hypertensive urgency has been shown to worsen outcomes and, therefore, should be avoided in the office.

Objectives

The primary objective was to achieve decreased rates of clonidine orders for immediate treatment of asymptomatic hypertension in the office. The secondary objective was to determine if reduced use leads to a decline in poor outcomes.

Methods

This was an observational cohort study evaluating a protocol and algorithm developed by clinical pharmacists on the appropriate management of hypertensive urgencies. The protocol included the provision of avoiding short-acting antihypertensives (ie, clonidine). Preintervention and postintervention reports were generated to determine the number of times clonidine was ordered in the office. Electronic health charts were also reviewed for documentation of poor outcomes related to clonidine administration within 1 week of the hypertensive urgency visit date.

Results

In the preintervention cohort, 106 (17.4%) orders of clonidine were captured compared with 73 (10.6%) in the postintervention group (P = 0.001). Of the patients who were administered clonidine, 7 patients in the preintervention group were advised to go to the emergency department (ED) for additional hypertensive management, 2 of whom were subsequently hospitalized; 9 patients were advised to go to the ED in the postintervention group, and no patient was subsequently hospitalized. No adverse effects were documented from in-office clonidine administration in either cohort of patients.

Conclusion

The hypertensive urgency protocol and education reduced the number of clonidine orders and hospital admissions. The increase in ED referrals needs further assessment.

### Hypertension guidelines in elderly patients: is anybody listening? [^b787b561]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Previous guidelines for the management of uncomplicated hypertension in elderly patients have recommended diuretic agents and then beta-blockers. We examined trends in the initial treatment choice for elderly people with hypertension and the effects of a government-sponsored program to publish and disseminate a simplified version of the national guidelines for the treatment of hypertension to all physicians in Ontario, Canada.

Subjects and Methods

Linked administrative databases containing information on the more than 1.2 million elderly residents in Ontario were used. Time series analysis was performed to determine prescribing trends from 1993 to 1998 for patients who began antihypertensive medication for the treatment of hypertension and to examine the effects of the simplified guidelines that were distributed in July of 1995.

Results

Diuretic agents were the most commonly prescribed medications, with annual rates from 35% to 38% (P = 0.59) throughout the study. Beta-blocker prescribing rose from 12% to 16% (P < 0.01), whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prescribing rose from 27% to 32% (P < 0.01). Prescriptions for calcium channel blockers dropped significantly, from 23% to 14% (P < 0.01). However, the publication and dissemination of the Ontario hypertension guidelines had no statistically significant effects on the proportion of patients who began treatment with a diuretic agent (P = 0.55), beta-blocker, (P = 0.32), ACE inhibitor (P = 0.09), or calcium channel blocker (P = 0.07).

Conclusion

The dissemination of simplified practice guidelines for hypertension did not have notable effects on prescribing patterns in Ontario.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^a4680c5c]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

When evaluating treatment, we categorize for classes of drugs and did not record the exact doses of all drugs for management of all patients during the follow-up.

Thirdly the results cannot be generalized to other settings as these data were collected at a single department. However, several observational available studies have shown a high rate of cardiovascular events not only in patients with hypertensive emergencies but also with hypertensive urgencies.

In conclusion, we have underscored the importance of organizing comprehensive research efforts to improve current knowledge in this growing group of high-risk patients, hoping that in the future, we will be able to provide better overall care and improve cardiovascular outcome.

### Hypertensive urgency: an emergency department pipeline to primary care pilot study [^c8c53c34]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal triage of patients with hypertensive urgency (HU) in the emergency department (ED) is not well established. 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension (HTN) guidelines recommend treatment initiation and follow-up within 1 week. Objectives of our pilot study were to evaluate feasibility and impact of directly connecting ED patients with HU to outpatient HTN management on blood pressure (BP) control and ED utilization.

Methods

ED patients with HU and no primary care physician were scheduled by a referral coordinator for an initial appointment in a HTN clinic embedded within a primary care practice. BP control and ED utilization over the subsequent 90 days were tracked and compared with BP at time of the referral ED visit, and ED utilization in the 90 days preceding referral.

Results

Data are reported for the first 40 referred patients. Average time to first visit was 7.8 days. Mean age was 51 years (range 28–76), 75% were African-American, and mean pooled 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk was 20.8%. Mean BP declined from 198/116 mm Hg at ED visit to 167/98 mm Hg at HTN clinic visit 1 to 136/83 by 6 weeks and was sustained at 90 days. Total ED visits for the group decreased from 61 in the 90 days prior to referral, to 18 in the 90 days after the first HTN clinic visit.

Conclusions

In this pilot study, coordinated referral between the ED and primary care provides safe, timely care for this high ASCVD risk population and leads to sustained reductions in BP and ED utilization.

### Poor guideline adherence in a real-world evaluation of hypertensive emergency management [^7cddbfdd]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association define hypertensive emergency (HTN-E) as a systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure greater than 120 mmHg with evidence of end-organ damage (EOD). Based on expert opinion, current guidelines recommend antihypertensive therapy to reduce blood pressure (BP) at specific hourly rates to reduce progression of EOD, outlined by four criteria. Our goal was to describe compliance with guideline recommendations for early management of HTN-E and to analyze safety outcomes related to pharmacologic intervention.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review including patients presenting to the emergency department with HTN-E between September 2016 and August 2020. We excluded patients with a compelling indication for altered therapeutic goals (e.g. acute aortic dissection, hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, and pheochromocytoma). The primary outcome was complete adherence with guideline recommendations in the first 24 h.

Results

Of 758 screened records, 402 were included. Mean age was 54 years and majority Black race (72%). Overall, total adherence was poor (< 1%): 30% received intravenous therapy within 1 h, 64% achieved 1-h BP goals, 44% achieved 6-h goals, and 9% had appropriate 24-h maintenance BP. Hypotensive events (N = 67) were common and antihypertensive-associated EOD (N = 21) did occur. Predictors of hypotension include treatment within 1 h and management with continuous infusion medication.

Conclusions

Current practice is poorly compliant with guideline criteria and there are risks associated with recommended treatments. Our results favor relaxing the expert opinion-based recommendations.

### JNC 8 guidelines for the management of hypertension in… [^5d59f71b]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In the general population, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg or higher in adults 60 years and older, or 140/90 mm Hg or higher in adults younger than 60 years.
- In patients with hypertension and diabetes, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, regardless of age.
- Initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, or ARB in the general nonblack population or a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker in the general black population.
- If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased, or a second medication should be added.

In the general population of adults 60 years and older, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when the systolic pressure is 150 mm Hg or higher, or when the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or higher. Patients should be treated to a target systolic pressure of less than 150 mm Hg and a target diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. Treatment does not need to be adjusted if it results in a systolic pressure lower than 140 mm Hg, as long as it is not associated with adverse effects on health or quality of life. There is no evidence that treating patients with CKD to a lower blood pressure goal slows the progression of the disease. Similarly, there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials showing that treatment to a systolic pressure of less than 140 mm Hg improves health outcomes in adults with diabetes and hypertension.

Pharmacologic Treatment In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial anti-hypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial treatment should include a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker. If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased or a second medication should be added. Blood pressure should be monitored and the treatment regimen adjusted until the target blood pressure is reached.

### Hypertensive emergencies: diagnosis and management [^0c43fd95]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment of hypertension is preventive medicine. This principle applies in the emergency room as well as the clinic. However, there are crucial contrasts between these two care settings related to specific goals of management for real emergencies and nonemergency conditions. In the emergency room, rapid triage is necessary to separate those who can safely be sent home for future clinic assessment from those who require immediate interventions including short stays in 24-hour observation units or hospitalization for more serious problems. This review focuses on decisions related to hypertension management in the emergency room and over brief periods of observation and treatment. Strategy is supported by evidence-based considerations whenever possible. Where outcome studies are not available, we rely on the rationale derived from relevant clinical research.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^35cd3de0]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A limitation of this review is that it evaluated only English-language reports. However, Morrison et al.found no evidence of a systematic bias from language restrictions in systematic review-based meta-analyses in conventional medicine. We attempted to minimize publication bias by searching the gray literature; we may have missed negative or small(er) studies.

The most recent systematic review of HU, by Souzain 2008, included studies in outpatient and inpatient settings. Their Cochrane Review was limited to randomized controlled trials of calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Although they excluded commonly used agents (e.g. clonidine, hydralazine, and labetalol), many other reviews have demonstrated a benefit in blood pressure reduction from these agents. Side effects were problematic mainly for nifedipine and clonidine.

Intravenous medications, although effective, carry added costs, and therefore we do not recommend them; many available oral agents are appropriate alternatives. Some studies included in this review evaluated diuretics. However, since HU may be associated with hypovolemia, some recommend avoiding diuretics unless intravascular volume overload is present. –

For HU, current data suggest that a 30-min rest may significantly decrease blood pressure. However, many studies in this review did not have patients rest for 30 min prior to intervention.

Most medications used in reports we review here were short-acting. Lowering blood pressure too rapidly in patients with HU may be harmful. In their review, Kessler and Joudehnoted that there appears to be no benefit in attaining goal blood pressure within hours to days, and that findings from the VALUE trialsuggest that lowering blood pressure within a 6 month-period may be a better approach. Therefore, avoidance of rapid-acting agents such as clonidine and nifedipine should be considered.

Other studies have used long-acting antihypertensive agents which have demonstrated morbidity and mortality benefits in hypertension outcomes trials. One such study, conducted by Grassi et al.evaluated the long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the ACE inhibitor perindopril in slowly lowering blood pressure toward goal for patients with HU. This study did not meet the inclusion criteria of our review, since it did not report changes in blood pressure within 48 h of treatment.

### Treatment of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies with oral clonidine loading and titration… [^c62d4913]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Houston MC. Treatment of Hypertensive Emergencies and Urgencies With Oral Clonidine Loading and Titration: A Review. Arch Intern Med. 1986; 146: 586–589. doi: 10.1001/archinte.1986.00360150236029
- Oral clonidine hydrochloride rapid titration or loading is a safe, effective method to control severe elevations of blood pressure in hypertensive crisis in many clinical situations. An initial oral dose of 0. 1 to
0. 2 mg of clonidine hydrochloride followed by hourly doses of 0. 05 or
0. 1 mg until goal blood pressure is attained that does not reduce perfusion to critical organs, or a total of 0. 7 mg is given, will achieve a significant reduction in blood pressure in 93% of patients.

A smooth, rapid, predictable reduction in blood pressure, patient comfort, lower overall cost, reduced requirement for close observation, intravenous lines, and hospitalization, and a small incidence of clinically significant side effects make oral clonidine rapid titration an attractive oral antihypertensive agent for patients with hypertensive urgencies and in some carefully selected patients with hypertensive emergencies. Immediate outpatient follow-up within 24 hours is mandatory in all patients who are not hospitalized to adjust the dose of antihypertensive medications.

JNC 8 — Recommendation 9 (treatment strategy and titration) states that the main objective of hypertension treatment is to attain and maintain goal blood pressure (BP). If goal BP is not reached within a month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug from one of the classes in recommendation 6 (thiazide-type diuretic, CCB, ACEI, or ARB), and the clinician should continue to assess BP and adjust the treatment regimen until goal BP is reached. If goal BP cannot be reached with 2 drugs, add and titrate a third drug from the list provided; do not use an ACEI and an ARB together in the same patient. If goal BP cannot be reached using the strategy in recommendation 6 because of a contraindication or the need to use more than 3 drugs to reach goal BP, antihypertensive drugs from other classes can be used. Expert Opinion – Grade E.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^8eb2328e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^3f95558f]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Another important consideration is race in antihypertensive medication selection. African American patients have higher risk of treatment resistant hypertension and are more likely to require more agents for adequate control. To this end, current guidelines promote the use of dual drug antihypertensive drug therapy. Recommended treatment is a combination drug therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker combined with a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic.

Our recommendations are consistent with the 2013 American College of Emergency Physicians' (ACEP) clinical policy which, based on expert opinion and panel consensus, states that in order to gradually lower BP and/or facilitate chronic BP management, "emergency physicians may choose to initiate hypertension treatment for markedly elevated BP" (defined as SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg based on expert opinion). The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines similarly note that prompt management of very high BP is important to limit the risk of target-organ damage. Additionally, clinicians should consider factors such as poor primary care follow-up, geriatric patients, or patients at greater risk for adverse outcomes from elevated hypertension such as African American patients in making ED prescribing decisions. Prescribing antihypertensive medication in the ED setting is effective and can be done safely. Additional resources include mobile health follow-up and engagement, home BP monitor, and community health workers.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients presenting with hypertensive urgency in the office setting [^d112dd24]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

The prevalence and short-term outcomes of hypertensive urgency (systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg) are unknown. Guidelines recommend achieving blood pressure control within 24 to 48 hours. However, some patients are referred to the emergency department (ED) or directly admitted to the hospital, and whether hospital management is associated with better outcomes is unknown.

Objectives

To describe the prevalence of hypertensive urgency and the characteristics and short-term outcomes of these patients, and to determine whether referral to the hospital is associated with better outcomes than outpatient management.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study with propensity matching included all patients presenting with hypertensive urgency to an office in the Cleveland Clinic Healthcare system from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2013. Pregnant women and patients referred to the hospital for symptoms or treatment of other conditions were excluded. Final follow-up was completed on June 30, 2014, and data were assessed from October 31, 2014, to May 31, 2015.

Exposures

Hospital vs ambulatory blood pressure management.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) consisting of acute coronary syndrome and stroke or transient ischemic attack, uncontrolled hypertension (≥ 140/90 mm Hg), and hospital admissions.

Results

Of 2 199 019 unique patient office visits, 59 836 (4.6%) met the definition of hypertensive urgency. After excluding 851 patients, 58 535 were included. Mean (SD) age was 63.1 (15.4) years; 57.7% were women; and 76.0% were white. Mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 31.1 (7.6); mean (SD) systolic blood pressure, 182.5 (16.6) mm Hg; and mean (SD) diastolic blood pressure, 96.4 (15.8) mm Hg. In the propensity-matched analysis, the 852 patients sent home were compared with the 426 patients referred to the hospital, with no significant difference in MACE at 7 days (0 vs 2 [0.5%]; P = 0.11), 8 to 30 days (0 vs 2 [0.5%]; P = 0.11), or 6 months (8 [0.9%] vs 4 [0.9%]; P > .99). Patients sent home were more likely to have uncontrolled hypertension at 1 month (735 of 852 [86.3%] vs 349 of 426 [81.9%]; P = 0.04) but not at 6 months (393 of 608 [64.6%] vs 213 of 320 [66.6%]; P = 0.56). Patients sent home had lower hospital admission rates at 7 days (40 [4.7%] vs 35 [8.2%]; P = 0.01) and at 8 to 30 days (59 [6.9%] vs 48 [11.3%]; P = 0.009).

Conclusions and Relevance

Hypertensive urgency is common, but the rate of MACE in asymptomatic patients is very low. Visits to the ED were associated with more hospitalizations, but not improved outcomes. Most patients still had uncontrolled hypertension 6 months later.

### Under pressure: treatment of acute severe hypertension (hypertensive crisis) [^c161b883]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute severe hypertension encompasses a spectrum of severe blood pressure elevations that can progress to end organ damage if left unmanaged. Understanding the presentations of various acute hypertensive scenarios can help guide interventional radiologists in recognizing clinical symptoms, signs, and selecting effective management strategies. The timely administration of antihypertensive agents is critical to prevent the detrimental effects associated with hypertensive emergencies. The preferred approach to achieve optimal blood pressure control and the desired target blood pressure range may vary based on the hypertensive scenario and patient-specific factors.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^9923f10b]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines revising the diagnosis threshold for hypertension and goal BP to 130/80 mm Hg among high-risk patientsadds to the importance of identifying and addressing elevated BP in the ED, particularly for ED patients without access other sources of care. While there is considerable evidence linked to long-term outcomes that guide non-ED assessment and management of nonemergent BP elevations, evidence to inform ED care is still evolving. The 2013 ACEP clinical policy writing group articulated this noting significant gaps in evidence regarding ED hypertension screening, management of nonemergent elevated BP, antihypertensive medication initiation or titration, and timing of follow-up to improve short- and long-term outcomes while minimizing risks of adverse events.

While the ACC/AHA guidelines have traction in the United States, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines have noted differences in defining hypertension and targets for treatment. The ESC/ESH guidelines define hypertension as ≥ 140/90 mm Hg and target treatment based on age and risk. For patients with BP 130–139/85–89 mm Hg, ESC/ESH guidelines recommend lifestyle change and consideration of drug treatment, particularly if patients have high cardiovascular risk. For patients ≤ 80 years who have BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, drug treatment is indicated. For patients > 80 years, ESC/ESH guidelines recommend drug treatment for SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg. If patients tolerate treatment to maintain BP < 140/90 mm Hg, further lowering targets a DBP < 80 mm Hg and SBP based on age (SBP target 120–129 mm Hg if age < 65 years, 130–139 mm Hg if 65–79 years, and 130–139 mm Hg as tolerated in those > 80 years). For patients with known coronary artery disease, therapy is targeted to maintain BP < 130/80 mm Hg. Both guidelines have similar recommendations for BP measurement, lifestyle modifications, and recommended medications. Both recommend strong consideration for single-pill combination antihypertensive medications.

### How well are we managing and monitoring high blood pressure? [^150434de]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We will summarize the latest available data on hypertension control levels in different populations throughout the world, and review the factors that appear to contribute to the widespread lack of blood pressure control in identified hypertensive patients.

Recent Findings

Population surveys throughout the world indicate that the proportion of hypertensive patients with blood pressure controlled to below 140/90 mmHg ranges from 5% in Taiwan to 25% in the United States. Studies in the US have shown that the majority of hypertensive patients classified as uncontrolled have diastolic pressure below 90 mmHg with mild systolic elevation in the 140–160 mmHg range, and that these blood pressure levels rarely elicit a treatment intensification action by the physician. The results of the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering to Prevent Heart Attack Trial indicate that it is feasible to maintain average blood pressures on treatment to levels well below 140/90 mmHg in elderly hypertensive patients in primary care settings. Although the literature on automated blood pressure measurement and comparisons between office blood pressure and home blood pressure continues to grow, there has been little attention paid to practicing physicians' attitudes and beliefs about different blood pressure measurement methods, or to the feasibility of standardizing blood pressure measurement in typical practice settings.

Summary

The experience in the US indicates that widely publicized treatment guidelines recommending blood pressure control targets and choice of first-line agents may have little influence on practicing physicians, even when based on solid evidence from clinical trials. Controversies in the literature regarding treatment targets, appropriate drug choices, and blood pressure monitoring methods are likely to delay improvements in overall population control.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^b2511742]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

2014 Hypertension Guideline (JNC 8) — methodology and scope compared with JNC 7: The panel defined critical questions with a methodology team and focused analyses on randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence, including an initial systematic review and subsequent panel review according to a standardized protocol. Definitions of hypertension and prehypertension were not addressed but thresholds for pharmacological treatment were defined; lifestyle modifications were recommended by endorsing the Lifestyle Work Group. Drug therapy recommended selection among 4 specific medication classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEI] or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB], calcium channel blocker [CCB], or diuretics) and doses based on RCT evidence, with specific medication selections for racial, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetic subgroups. The evidence review addressed a limited number of high-priority questions, and the report was reviewed by experts, including those affiliated with professional and public organizations and federal agencies, with no official sponsorship inferred.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^807a661f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

High-value care in hypertension for adults aged 60 years or older — most patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 150 mm Hg or greater who receive antihypertensive medications will benefit, with acceptable harms and costs, from treatment to a blood pressure (BP) target of less than 150/90 mm Hg. When prescribing drug therapy, clinicians should select generic formulations over brand-name drugs, which have similar efficacy, reduced cost, and therefore better adherence, and clinicians should consider the patient's treatment burden. Because some patients may have falsely elevated readings in clinical settings ("white-coat hypertension"), it is important to ensure accurate BP measurement before initiating or changing treatment of hypertension, and the most accurate measurements come from multiple BP measurements made over time.

### Severe asymptomatic hypertension: evaluation and treatment [^2ae3a846]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects one-third of Americans and is a significant modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, renal disease, and death. Severe asymptomatic hypertension is defined as severely elevated blood pressure (180 mm Hg or more systolic, or 110 mm Hg or more diastolic) without symptoms of acute target organ injury. The short-term risks of acute target organ injury and major adverse cardiovascular events are low in this population, whereas hypertensive emergencies manifest as acute target organ injury requiring immediate hospitalization. Individuals with severe asymptomatic hypertension often have preexisting poorly controlled hypertension and usually can be managed in the outpatient setting. Immediate diagnostic testing rarely alters short-term management, and blood pressure control is best achieved with initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive therapy. Aggressive lowering of blood pressure should be avoided, and the use of parenteral medications is not indicated. Current recommendations are to gradually reduce blood pressure over several days to weeks. Patients with escalating blood pressure, manifestation of acute target organ injury, or lack of compliance with treatment should be considered for hospital admission.

### A practical approach to hypertension management in diabetes [^c5ea5947]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Recent trends suggest to target treatment when BP is greater than 140/90. When achieved without undue treatment burden, BP targets of less than 130/80 mmHg may be appropriate for certain individuals with diabetes, like the young, with albuminuria, and/or those with hypertension and one or more additional atherosclerotic CV disease risk factors. Tighter targets of less than 140/90 mmHg in patients 70–80 years old and of less than 150/90 in the elderly (more than 80 years old) seem appropriate. Initiate combination therapy if not at goal or if initial BP is greater than 160/100.

ACEI/ARBs are the most effective drugs for treating hypertension in diabetes, in the absence of contraindications. Calcium antagonists or diuretics are probably appropriate as second-line agents. Newer antidiabetes medications such as SGLT2i have antihypertensive properties and may help in treatment decision-making and choices. Once the BP target is achieved, antihypertensive drugs should be continued in order to promote CV risk reduction. Future trials are needed to determine the appropriate BP targets for patients with diabetes.

Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to assess for orthostatic hypotension in old patients, even in the absence of symptoms. Consider down-titrating or discontinuing BP-lowering drugs in patients with orthostatic hypotension.

### Comparing the clinical efficacy of resting and antihypertensive medication in patients of hypertensive urgency: a randomized, control trial [^accdc74f]. Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypertensive urgency is defined as a severe elevation of blood pressure (BP) without target organ damage. In emergency room, hypertensive urgency has been conventionally managed by antihypertensive medication. However, there has been increasing concern for the safety of antihypertensive medication in hypertensive urgency. Thus, this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of resting and antihypertensive medication in managing hypertensive urgency.

Methods

For 138 hypertensive urgency patients admitting in emergency room of Veterans Health Service (VHS) medical center, a single-center, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Hypertensive urgency patients were randomly allocated into one group out of resting group and antihypertensive medication (telmisartan) group at admission. We serially checked their BP every 30min for 2h, and evaluated change levels and decline of BP. Primary end point of the study was mean BP reduction from 10 to 35%. Additionally, change and decline of SBP and DBP were serially compared over 2h.

Result

The rate of individuals approaching primary end point was 68.5% in rest group and 69.1% in medication group (P = 0.775). The change levels of BP for 2h had no significant difference in SBP (P = 0.882) and DBP (P = 0.411) between resting group and medication group. The decline of BP after 2h also did not show any statistical difference in both SBP (P = 0.065) and DBP (P = 0.032) between both groups.

Conclusion

There was no significant difference between resting and antihypertensive medication in reducing BP of hypertensive urgency patients. This finding suggests the clinical efficacy of resting in managing hypertensive urgency.

### Clinical features in the management of selected hypertensive emergencies [^376693b7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

A hypertensive emergency is a clinical diagnosis that is appropriate when marked hypertension is associated with acute target-organ damage; in this setting, lowering of blood pressure (BP) is typically begun within hours of diagnosis. For hypertensive urgency with no acute target-organ damage, BP lowering may occur over hours to days. A hypertensive emergency may present with cardiac, renal, neurologic, hemorrhagic, or obstetric manifestations, but prompt recognition of the condition and institution of rapidly acting parenteral therapy to lower BP (typically in an intensive care unit) are widely recommended. For aortic dissection, the systolic BP target is lower than 120 mm Hg, to be achieved during the first 20 minutes using a beta-blocker (typically esmolol) and a vasodilator to reduce both shear stress on the aortic tear and the BP, respectively. Otherwise, sodium nitroprusside is the agent with the lowest acquisition cost and longest record of successful use in hypertensive emergencies; however, it is metabolized to toxic thiocyanate and cyanide. Other attractive agents include fenoldopam mesylate, nicardipine, and labetalol; in pregnant women, magnesium and nifedipine are used commonly. Most authors suggest a reduction in mean arterial pressure of approximately 10% during the first hour and a further 10% to 15% during the next 2 to 4 hours; hypoperfusion can result if the BP is lowered too suddenly or too far (eg, into the range of < 140/90 mm Hg). Oral antihypertensive therapy can usually be instituted after 6 to 12 hours of parenteral therapy, and the patient moved out of the intensive care unit, when consideration should be given to screening for secondary causes of hypertension. Long-term follow-up to ensure adequate control of hypertension is necessary to prevent further target-organ damage and recurrence of another hypertensive emergency.

Personalized treatment

As mentioned, initiation and titration of antihypertensive therapy can be done from the ED, but there is reluctance to do so on the part of emergency medicine clinicians. Yet, this is a relatively simple and potentially highly effective strategy that ED clinicians can use to improve the BP control of their patients. It is also a simple strategy to overcome clinical inertia or the "bystander effect". The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines recommend maximizing the dose of antihypertensive medication and then adding addition medication. Understanding the anticipated BP-lowering effect using tools like the therapeutic intensity score can be used to give providers feedback regarding their prescribing practices and help guide emergency medicine clinicians who seek to do more than simply refer patients on to the next station of care. The therapeutic intensity score provides a quantifiable estimate of the anticipated impact of antihypertensive therapy, particularly in the setting of multiple antihypertensive medications.

With the steady increase in ED visits and the high proportion of patients with elevated BP, the opportunity for recognition and interventions is shifting from the realm of outpatient medicine and becoming incorporated into the practice of emergency medicine. These opportunities require emergency medicine physicians to be familiar with the definitions of hypertension, the distinction between nonemergent hypertension and hypertensive emergencies, and the treatment for all BP elevations. The ED can serve as a critical partner in systems-level efforts to reduce the morbidity associated with poor hypertension control, particularly in underserved communities.
