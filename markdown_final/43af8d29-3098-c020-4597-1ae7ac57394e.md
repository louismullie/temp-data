## Question

Dose for Lakelma hyperkalemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the dosing of Lokelma (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) for hyperkalemia, including initial treatment, maintenance, special populations, administration, and monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled dosing for adults. Then, I should verify the onset of action and whether it is appropriate for acute management. Next, I will review maintenance titration and the dose range. After that, I need to check special dosing for hemodialysis patients. I will then confirm administration details and drug interaction precautions. Finally, I should integrate guideline context and safety monitoring, and close with a concise dosing summary that aligns with evidence and labels.

> Let me first confirm the labeled adult dosing for initial treatment. The FDA prescribing information recommends 10 grams orally three times daily for up to 48 hours, administered as a suspension in water, which establishes the standard acute regimen in adults with hyperkalemia [^535cf636] [^c881ffc7].

> Wait, let me verify the onset and magnitude of effect so I don't overstate its role in emergencies. In the pivotal phase 3 trial, 10 g three times daily reduced mean serum potassium by about 0.7 mEq/L at 48 hours, with reductions observable as early as 1 hour, but the label explicitly states Lokelma should not be used as emergency treatment for life-threatening hyperkalemia due to delayed onset, so I should emphasize that it is not a substitute for calcium, insulin/dextrose, or dialysis in severe cases [^2a638123] [^899cb7df] [^b493e082].

> Next, I should review maintenance dosing and titration. After the initial 48-hour course, the recommended maintenance dose is 10 g once daily, with dose adjustments based on serum potassium at weekly intervals or longer in 5 g increments within a range of 5 g every other day up to 15 g daily, and the dose should be decreased or discontinued if potassium falls below the desired target range [^535cf636] [^c881ffc7].

> Hold on, I should verify the hemodialysis-specific regimen because it differs. For patients on chronic hemodialysis, Lokelma is dosed only on non-dialysis days, typically starting at 5 g once daily with consideration of 10 g once daily if baseline potassium is greater than 6.5 mEq/L, and the maintenance range is 5 to 15 g once daily on non-dialysis days with reassessment after one week and dose changes based on pre-dialysis potassium after the long interdialytic interval [^535cf636] [^37c744c8].

> I need to ensure administration details are precise. Each dose should be mixed with approximately 3 tablespoons of water, stirred well, and consumed immediately; if powder remains, more water should be added, stirred, and drunk until no powder remains, and other oral medications should be separated by at least 2 hours before or after Lokelma to avoid binding interactions [^535cf636].

> Let me consider the clinical context and guideline positioning so I don't miss important nuances. UKKA guidance supports sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for persistent hyperkalemia in adults with CKD stage 3b–5 or heart failure on suboptimal RAAS inhibitors, and for acute management of moderate to severe hyperkalemia, but it should be initiated by specialists and continued in primary care, with discontinuation if RAAS inhibitors are stopped; AAFP prefers SZC over sodium polystyrene sulfonate due to better efficacy and safety, and KDIGO emphasizes that newer binders can facilitate continuation of RAAS inhibitors at target doses [^d0832aae] [^ac97d2f0] [^8a41aa1c] [^b6dde71f] [^52182027] [^22e4581c] [^4e41cad2].

> I should double-check safety and monitoring so recommendations are balanced. Edema is dose-related and more frequent at 15 g daily, particularly in patients prone to fluid overload, and hypokalemia can occur, so serum potassium should be monitored frequently during initiation and titration, with dose reduction or discontinuation if potassium drops below the target range; in hemodialysis patients, watch for intercurrent illness that increases hypokalemia risk and adjust accordingly [^cca5eb43] [^535cf636].

> But wait, what if someone asks about using a single 15 g dose acutely instead of 10 g TID. The KBindER trial protocol evaluated a one-time 15 g dose to assess maximal acute impact, but this is investigational and not the FDA-labeled regimen, so I should not generalize that approach outside a trial setting and should stick to the labeled 10 g TID for 48 hours followed by maintenance dosing [^bdca981b] [^535cf636].

> Let me synthesize a concise, clinically usable summary. For adults with hyperkalemia, give 10 g orally three times daily for up to 48 hours, then transition to 10 g once daily and titrate by 5 g increments within 5 g every other day to 15 g daily based on serum potassium, with more frequent monitoring during changes; in chronic hemodialysis, dose only on non-dialysis days starting at 5–10 g once daily and titrate to 5–15 g to achieve pre-dialysis potassium targets, always separating other oral medications by 2 hours and watching for edema and hypokalemia [^535cf636] [^c881ffc7] [^37c744c8].

---

The recommended dose of Lokelma (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) for hyperkalemia is **10 g orally three times daily for up to 48 hours** [^535cf636] for acute treatment, followed by **10 g once daily for maintenance** [^c881ffc7], with dose adjustments based on serum potassium [^535cf636]. In hemodialysis patients, start at **5 g on non-dialysis days** [^535cf636], titrating to 5–15 g as needed [^37c744c8]. Monitor potassium frequently during initiation and titration, and separate other oral medications by at least 2 hours to avoid interactions [^535cf636].

---

## Indications and clinical use

Lokelma is indicated for the **treatment of hyperkalemia in adults** [^b493e082]. It is particularly useful in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure, or those receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, where hyperkalemia is a common complication [^2a638123] [^4e41cad2]. Lokelma is not indicated for **emergency treatment** of life-threatening hyperkalemia due to its delayed onset of action [^b493e082].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen

### Acute treatment phase

During the acute treatment phase, the **initial dose** is 10 g orally three times daily (TID) for up to 48 hours [^535cf636] [^c881ffc7]. The **onset of action** is within 1 hour, with continued reduction over 48 hours [^899cb7df] [^2a638123].

---

### Maintenance treatment phase

For maintenance treatment, the **standard maintenance dose** is 10 g once daily [^535cf636] [^c881ffc7]. The **dose adjustment** should be based on serum potassium levels, with titration in 5 g increments at weekly intervals or longer, within a range of 5 g every other day to 15 g once daily [^535cf636].

---

### Special considerations for hemodialysis patients

In hemodialysis patients, the **starting dose** is 5 g once daily on non-dialysis days [^535cf636], with consideration of 10 g once daily if serum potassium is > 6.5 mEq/L [^535cf636]. The **maintenance dose** ranges from 5 g to 15 g once daily on non-dialysis days, adjusted based on pre-dialysis potassium levels [^535cf636] [^37c744c8].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing recommendations

Clinical trials demonstrate that Lokelma **rapidly and effectively reduces serum potassium levels** [^2a638123]. In the HARMONIZE trial, 10 g TID for 48 hours reduced mean serum potassium from 5.6 to 4.5 mEq/L, and maintenance dosing (5–15 g once daily) kept potassium within the normal range in 80–94% of patients, depending on dose [^bd3c9027]. Similar efficacy was observed in hemodialysis patients, with 41% achieving target pre-dialysis potassium levels (4.0–5.0 mEq/L) compared to 1% with placebo [^37c744c8].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Lokelma is **generally well tolerated** [^2a638123]. Common adverse effects include:

- **Edema**: Dose-related and more frequent at higher doses (15 g daily) [^14b7e10c].
- **Hypokalemia**: Occurs in approximately 4.1% of patients, typically resolving with dose adjustment [^14b7e10c].
- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Mild constipation or diarrhea may occur [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and dose adjustments

Regular **monitoring of serum potassium** is essential during treatment with Lokelma [^535cf636]. Potassium should be checked frequently during initiation and titration, and dose adjusted to maintain serum potassium within the desired target range (typically 3.5–5.0 mEq/L) [^535cf636].

---

## Drug interactions and administration considerations

Lokelma can bind other oral medications, reducing their absorption. Therefore, other oral medications should be administered **at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after Lokelma** [^535cf636]. Lokelma should be **reconstituted with water** and administered as a suspension [^535cf636].

2.1 Recommended Dosage

For initial treatment of hyperkalemia, the recommended dose of LOKELMA is 10 g administered three times a day for up to 48 hours. Administer LOKELMA orally as a suspension in water [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

For continued treatment, the recommended dose is 10 g once daily. Monitor serum potassium and adjust the dose of LOKELMA based on the serum potassium level and desired target range. During maintenance treatment, up-titrate based on the serum potassium level at intervals of 1-week or longer and in increments of 5 g. Decrease the dose of LOKELMA or discontinue if the serum potassium is below the desired target range. The recommended maintenance dose range is from 5 g every other day to 15 g daily.

2.2 Dosage Adjustment for Patients on Chronic Hemodialysis

For patients on chronic hemodialysis, administer LOKELMA only on non-dialysis days.

The recommended starting dose is 5 g once daily on non-dialysis days. Consider a starting dose of 10 g once daily on non-dialysis days in patients with serum potassium greater than 6.5 mEq/L. Monitor serum potassium and adjust the dose of LOKELMA based on the pre-dialysis serum potassium value after the long inter-dialytic interval and desired target range.

During initiation and after a dose adjustment, assess serum potassium after one week. The recommended maintenance dose range is from 5 g to 15 g once daily, on non-dialysis days.

Discontinue or decrease the dose of LOKELMA if:

serum potassium falls below the desired target range based on the pre-dialysis value after the long interdialytic interval, or;
the patient develops clinically significant hypokalemia

2.3 Reconstitution and Administration

In general, other oral medications should be administered at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after LOKELMA [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Instruct patients to empty the entire contents of the packet(s) into a drinking glass containing approximately 3 tablespoons of water or more if desired. Stir well and drink immediately. If powder remains in the drinking glass, add water, stir and drink immediately. Repeat until no powder remains to ensure the entire dose is taken.

14.2 Study 2

The efficacy of LOKELMA was also demonstrated in a two-part trial with an open-label acute phase and a month-long randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal phase (Study 2; NCT02088073).

In the open-label acute phase of Study 2, 258 patients with hyperkalemia (baseline mean 5.6 mEq/L, range 5.1 to 7.4 mEq/L) received 10 g of LOKELMA administered three times daily with meals for 48 hours. As shown in Figure 3, left, average serum potassium levels decreased from 5.6 to 4.5 mEq/L during treatment with LOKELMA in the acute phase.

Following the acute phase of the study, there was a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase where patients who achieved potassium levels between 3.5 and 5 mEq/L were randomized to one of three doses of LOKELMA administered once-daily for 28 days, or placebo just before breakfast. Of the patients enrolled in the acute phase, 92% achieved a potassium level within this range and were enrolled into the second phase of the trial.

The primary endpoint in the randomized withdrawal phase was the mean serum potassium value over the period from Day 8 to Day 29, comparing LOKELMA-treated and placebo-treated patients. All three doses (5, 10 and 15 g) of once daily LOKELMA maintained mean potassium at lower levels than placebo (mean serum potassium was 4.8, 4.5, and 4.4 mEq/L for the 5, 10 and 15 g dose groups, respectively, vs. 5.1 mEq/L in the placebo group, p ≤ 0.001 for all doses, Figure 3, right). A greater proportion of patients had mean serum potassium levels in the normal range (3.5 to 5 mEq/L) while on LOKELMA than while on placebo (80%, 90% and 94% at the 5, 10 and 15 g doses, respectively, vs. 46% on placebo).

14.1 Study 1

The effectiveness of LOKELMA in lowering serum potassium was demonstrated in a two-part, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT01737697) in patients with hyperkalemia (5 to 6.5 mEq/L, mean potassium 5.3 mEq/L), Study 1.

In the first phase of the trial (the acute phase), 753 patients were randomized to receive one of four doses of LOKELMA (1.25, 2.5, 5 or 10 g) or placebo, administered three times daily for the initial 48 hours with meals.

The mean age of patients was 66 years, 59% of patients were men, and 86% were Caucasian. Approximately 60% of patients had chronic kidney disease, 10% had heart failure, 62% had diabetes mellitus and 67% were on renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor therapy at baseline.

The primary endpoint in the acute phase was the difference in the exponential rate of change in serum potassium levels during the initial 48 hours of study drug treatment, comparing placebo-treated patients and LOKELMA-treated patients. The study met its primary endpoint demonstrating a greater reduction in serum potassium levels for the 2.5, 5 and 10 g (three times a day) dose groups compared to the placebo group (p < 0.001). As displayed in Table 1 for the secondary endpoint of potassium change from baseline, LOKELMA showed dose-dependent reductions in serum potassium at 2.5, 5 and 10 g. In patients administered 10 g TID, the mean serum potassium reduction was -0.7 mEq/L at 48 hours. Patients with higher starting potassium levels had a greater response to LOKELMA. LOKELMA was effective in lowering potassium levels in patients with chronic kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus and those taking RAAS inhibitor therapy.

14.3 Eleven-Month Extension Study

Patients who completed the 28-day randomized withdrawal phase had the option to continue treatment with LOKELMA, taken just before breakfast, in an open-label extension phase for up to 11 months (n = 123; NCT02107092). Figure 4 shows that the treatment effect on serum potassium was maintained during continued therapy.

14.4 Study 3

LOKELMA was evaluated in an open-label 12-month study in 751 hyperkalemic patients (NCT02163499). The mean baseline potassium level in this study was 5.6 mEq/L. Following the acute phase treatment of LOKELMA 10 g three times a day, patients who achieved normokalemia (3.5–5.0 mEq/L) within 72 hours (n = 746; 99%) entered the maintenance phase. For maintenance treatment, the initial dosage of LOKELMA was 5 g once daily and was adjusted to a minimum of 5 g every other day up to maximum of 15 g once daily, based on serum potassium level. The treatment effect on serum potassium was maintained during continued therapy.

14.5 Study 4

The effectiveness of LOKELMA in lowering serum potassium was studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 196 chronic hemodialysis patients (mean age 58 years, range 20 to 86 years) with persistent pre-dialysis hyperkalemia (mean baseline potassium 5.8 mEq/L) who were randomized to receive LOKELMA 5 g or placebo once daily on non-dialysis days (NCT03303521). During the dose adjustment period (initial 4 weeks), the dose was adjusted weekly in 5 g increments up to 15 g once daily based on pre-dialysis serum potassium measurement after the long inter-dialytic interval to achieve a pre-dialysis serum potassium level between 4.0–5.0 mEq/L. The dose reached at the end of the dose-adjustment period was maintained throughout the subsequent 4-week evaluation period.

The primary endpoint in the trial was the proportion of responders, defined as patients who maintained a pre-dialysis serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.0 mEq/L on at least 3 out of 4 dialysis treatments after the long inter-dialytic interval and who did not receive rescue therapy during the evaluation period. A greater proportion of patients were responders in the LOKELMA arm as compared to placebo (41% vs 1%, respectively; p < 0.001). The treatment effect on mean pre-dialysis serum potassium levels was maintained during continued treatment. Mean pre-dialysis serum potassium levels during the study are presented in Figure 5.

6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The total exposure to LOKELMA in the safety and efficacy clinical trials of patients not on dialysis with hyperkalemia was 1,760 patients with 652 patients exposed to LOKELMA for at least 6 months and 507 patients exposed for at least one year.

The population (n = 1,009) in the placebo-controlled trials included patients aged 22 to 96 years, females (n = 454), Caucasians (n = 859) and Blacks (n = 130). Patients had hyperkalemia in association with comorbid diseases such as chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus.

In placebo-controlled trials in which patients who were not on dialysis were treated with once daily doses of LOKELMA for up to 28 days, edema was reported in 4.4% of patients receiving 5 g, 5.9% of patients receiving 10 g and 16.1% of patients receiving 15 g LOKELMA compared to 2.4% of patients receiving placebo. In longer-term uncontrolled trials in which most patients were maintained on doses < 15 g once daily, adverse reactions of edema (edema, generalized edema and peripheral edema) were reported in 8% to 11% of patients.

In a pooled analysis of clinical studies conducted in countries with a predominantly Asian population, constipation occurred in patients receiving LOKELMA with an estimated incidence of 9% and 5% for the 10 g and 5 g dose respectively. Constipation was resolved with dose adjustment or treatment discontinuation. No cases of constipation were reported in patients receiving placebo.

Laboratory Abnormalities

In clinical trials in patients who were not on dialysis, 4.1% of LOKELMA-treated patients developed hypokalemia with a serum potassium value less than 3.5 mEq/L, which resolved with dosage reduction or discontinuation of LOKELMA. In a clinical trial of LOKELMA in patients on chronic hemodialysis, 5% of patients developed pre-dialysis hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) in both the LOKELMA and placebo groups; 3% and 1% of patients developed a serum potassium < 3.0 mEq/L in the LOKELMA and placebo groups, respectively.

Outcomes

The main clinical outcome measure will be serum potassium concentration, which will be measured every two weeks, and the dose of RAASi at the end of the study. The statistical outcome measure will be achieving target level of RAASi without hyperkalaemia (i.e. serum potassium ≥ 5.6 mmol/L). Target RAASi doses are defined as maximum dosing as in Table 3.

### A randomized study to compare oral potassium binders in the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^bdca981b]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Study groups

Participants, physicians and house staff are blinded to the study group assignment. Participants undergo sequential randomization to one of 4 study groups:
SPS (Kayexalate, Kionex) one dose of 30 g
Patiromer (Veltassa) one dose of 25.2 g
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (Lokelma) one dose of 15 g
Polyethylene glycol 3350 (MiraLax) one dose of 17 g (nonspecific osmotic laxative)

Higher doses of the oral potassium binders were chosen to evaluate maximum impact on lowering blood K + with one treatment dose. Given the focus on acute hyperkalemia therapy, it would not have been clinically meaningful to use the lowest starting dose.

### The LIFT trial: study protocol for a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of K-binder lokelma for maximisation of RAAS inhibition in CKD patients with heart failure [^2657c4a3]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

CKD is common in heart failure (HF) and associated with morbidity and mortality, yet life-prolonging medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors (RAASi) are underused due to risk of hyperkalaemia. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is a potassium-binding medication that has been shown to reduce incidence of hyperkalaemia in CKD, non-CKD, and HF populations, which we propose will support maximisation of RAASi therapy.

Methods

We propose a 1:1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which participants will receive either SZC or placebo. We will up-titrate participants' RAASi therapy while monitoring their serum potassium levels and adjusting their SZC dose if necessary. Participants with CKD and HF will be recruited from CKD and HF clinics at St George's Hospital. The total study period will be 18months; 130 participants will be enrolled for approximately two months each following screening. Our primary outcome will be the proportion of participants who achieve maximum RAASi dose while maintaining normokalaemia. Secondary outcomes include participants reaching maximum RAASi dose without severe hyperkalaemia; time from randomisation to hyperkalaemia; time from randomisation to severe hyperkalaemia; number of RAASi dose escalations per participant; final doses of RAASi therapy; changes in quality of life score, eGFR, ACR, serum sodium, troponin T; number and duration of hospital admissions; and within-participant change in serum potassium compared to baseline.

Discussion

This trial will be the first to examine the use of SZC for the maximisation of RAASi dosing in patients with advanced CKD and HF. We will assess the impact of achieving target RAASi dosing on hospital admission rates and duration of stay, with the hope that optimum RAASi treatment will translate into reduced morbidity and improved QoL. If clinical benefit is demonstrated, we hope that the joint multidisciplinary CKD-HF approach will be expanded.

### Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (Lokelma) [^899cb7df]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

LOKELMA (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) is a non-absorbed zirconium silicate that preferentially captures potassium in exchange for hydrogen and sodium. In vitro, LOKELMA has a high affinity for potassium ions, even in the presence of other cations such as calcium and magnesium. LOKELMA increases fecal potassium excretion through binding of potassium in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. Binding of potassium reduces the concentration of free potassium in the gastrointestinal lumen, thereby lowering serum potassium levels.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In a study in healthy adult subjects, LOKELMA administered as 5 g or 10 g once daily for four days caused a dose-dependent increase in fecal potassium excretion. Corresponding dose-dependent decreases in urinary potassium excretion and serum potassium were also observed.

In patients with hyperkalemia treated with LOKELMA 10 g three times a day for up to 48 hours, reductions in serum potassium were observed one hour after initiation of therapy; serum potassium concentrations continued to decline over the 48-hour treatment period [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In patients not continuing LOKELMA, potassium levels increased. Patients with higher starting serum potassium levels or receiving a higher dose have greater reductions in serum potassium.

LOKELMA causes a small dose-dependent increase in serum bicarbonate concentrations (1.1 mmol/L at 5 g once daily, 2.3 mmol/L at 10 g once daily and 2.6 mmol/L at 15 g once daily as compared with a mean increase of 0.6 mmol/L in patients treated with placebo). The clinical significance of this finding is unclear.

### New therapies for hyperkalemia [^93206479]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors have become the mainstay treatment for patients with chronic diseases, hyperkalemia is a major contributory deterrent to their use in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure. For the first time in 50 years, two new therapies (patiromer and ZS-9) have recently emerged for the concomitant treatment of hyperkalemia in these patients. The objective of this review is to discuss the efficacy and safety of these new agents.

Recent Findings

Patiromer effectively reduces serum potassium in patients with CKD and heart failure, even with the concomitant use of RAAS inhibitors. The most common adverse events in clinical trials were gastrointestinal events. ZS-9 (Lokelma) rapidly reduces serum potassium levels and to a greater magnitude, and has a role in the acute management of hyperkalemia. Despite having more adverse events than patiromer, ZS-9 is overall well tolerated.

Summary

These new therapies show promising results for the chronic management of hyperkalemia, whilst also potentially allowing for the concomitant use of RAAS inhibitors at optimal doses. More research is needed to examine the benefits of continuation of RAAS inhibitors after an episode of hyperkalemia in patients with CKD and heart failure.

### The LIFT trial: study protocol for a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of K-binder lokelma for maximisation of RAAS inhibition in CKD patients with heart failure [^2590b12c]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have shown that sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) can lower serum potassium concentrations in non-CKD, CKD, and HF populations. SZC is a zirconium silicate compound that acts as a selective potassium ion trap and is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In a phase three randomised controlled trial of 258 patients with hyperkalaemia, SZC lowered serum potassium from 5.6 to 4.5 mmol/L in 48 h and maintained serum potassium of < 5.1 mmol/L in 90% of patients (compared with 48% of patients on placebo, p < 0.001).

Most studies of potassium binders have been short and none have investigated exclusively the high-risk group of patients with advanced CKD-HF, particularly with an aim to maximise RAASi therapy. Furthermore, this study will augment the currently-limited safety and efficacy data on RAASi maximisation in advanced CKD patients.

The St George's experience suggests the need for a trial and subsequent clinical implementation of RAASi maximisation in patients with combined CKD-HF. There are significant numbers of patients in our own clinics who may benefit from recruitment into a trial of RAASi maximisation. We therefore propose a 1:1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the potential benefits of SZC in patients with CKD and HF on maximisation of RAASi therapy.

### Potassium-lowering agents for the treatment of nonemergent hyperkalemia: pharmacology, dosing and comparative efficacy [^5a03d07f]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia represents a common and potentially life-threating electrolyte abnormality, a complication frequently observed in patients with heart failure, kidney disease, diabetes or in those receiving drug therapies influencing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Elevated serum potassium levels are often the result of impaired urinary potassium elimination, inadequate or reduced cellular potassium uptake, severe heart failure, use of medications influencing potassium levels in the circulation, or, more commonly, a combination of these factors. Strategies for the treatment of nonemergent hyperkalemia include the use of cation-exchange resins, polymers or other novel mechanisms of potassium trapping, including sodium polystyrene sulfonate, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These agents differ in their pharmacology and mechanism of action, clinical efficacy, including onset and extent of potassium-lowering effect, dosage and administration, and potential safety and adverse effect profiles. In this review, an evaluation of these characteristics, including clinical evidence and safety concerns, in the management of nonemergent hyperkalemia will be explored.

### Rescue RM / CS-AKI by blocking strategy with one-dose anti-myoglobin rabMAb [^ea8714cf]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Early on-site treatment to remove key pathogenic toxic factors K + and Mb in the blood as soon as possible is essential to reduce mortality and improve the prognosis of RM/CS-AKI patients. From the perspective of lowering blood K +, ZS-9 (trade name Lokelma™) has been approved in the European Union and the United States as an oral suspension for treating acute hyperkalemia in adults. Lokelma™ may be a potential measure to control the hyperkalemia problem of RM/CS-AKI in emergencies, but the excess free Mb in peripheral blood circulation remains unresolved. Recently, the European Union approved extracorporeal cytokine adsorber CytoSorb® (Cytosorbents Corporation, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) may intercept part of the Mb. However, CytoSorb® is device-dependent, non-specific(10–55 KD size-selective removal), limited capacity(adsorption capacity decreases to about 10% after 8 h), and uncertain therapeutic efficacy.

### Intermittent sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for the prevention of hyperkalemia in chronic kidney disease [^9db3f00b]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that often requires urgent dialysis and increases healthcare costs. Daily sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is a safe and effective treatment for the control of serum potassium levels in CKD patients. We studied the efficacy and safety of intermittent SZC therapy for the prevention of hyperkalemia in CKD patients.

Methods

In a retrospective study, we analyzed patients in the Hospital Authority Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS) receiving sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (Lokelma ®) therapy once to thrice weekly for at least 3 months from January 2021 to June 2023. Outcome measures included plasma potassium levels, hyperkalemia episodes, hospital admissions, and renal function changes, which were compared to the 6 months period before the initiation of SZC treatment.

Results

We studied 36 adult CKD patients. SZC treatment significantly reduced plasma potassium levels from 5.10 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 4.91–5.40) to 4.73 (IQR 4.50–5.10) mmol/l (p = 0.0003). The median incidence of any hyperkalemia reduced from 5.0 (IQR 2.0–8.0) to 1.9 (IQR 0.0–4.7) episode per patient-year (p = 0.0001), and the incidence of urgent treatment for hyperkalemia decreased from 2.0 (IQR 0.0–4.0) to 0.0 (IQR 0.0–1.5) episode per patient-year (p = 0.007). The number of emergency room attendance and hospitalization were not significantly reduced.

Conclusion

Intermittent SZC treatment may help prevent hyperkalemia in CKD patients. Further research is necessary to ascertain if this benefit translates into improvements in hard clinical outcomes.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Gastrointestinal Adverse Events in Patients with Motility Disorders. (5.1)
Edema. (5.2)
Hypokalemia in patients on hemodialysis. (5.3)
LOKELMA has radio-opaque properties and, therefore, may give the appearance typical of an imaging agent during abdominal X-ray procedures. (5.4)

5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events in Patients with Motility Disorders

Avoid use of LOKELMA in patients with severe constipation, bowel obstruction or impaction, including abnormal post-operative bowel motility disorders, because LOKELMA has not been studied in patients with these conditions and may be ineffective and may worsen gastrointestinal conditions.

5.2 Edema

Each 5 g dose of LOKELMA contains approximately 400 mg of sodium, but the extent of absorption by the patient is unknown. In clinical trials of LOKELMA in patients who were not on dialysis, edema was observed and was generally mild to moderate in severity and was more commonly seen in patients treated with 15 g once daily. Monitor for signs of edema, particularly in patients who should restrict their sodium intake or are prone to fluid overload (e.g., heart failure or renal disease). Advise patients to adjust dietary sodium, if appropriate. Increase the dose of diuretics as needed [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

In a clinical trial of LOKELMA in patients on chronic hemodialysis in which most patients were treated with doses of 5 to 10 g once daily on non-dialysis days, there was no difference in the mean change from baseline in interdialytic weight gain (a measure of fluid retention) between the LOKELMA and placebo groups.

5.3 Hypokalemia in Patients on Hemodialysis

Patients on hemodialysis may be prone to acute illness that can increase the risk of hypokalemia on LOKELMA (e.g., illnesses associated with decreased oral intake, diarrhea). Consider adjusting Lokelma dose based on potassium levels in these settings.

5.4 Diagnostic Tests

LOKELMA has radio-opaque properties and, therefore, may give the appearance typical of an imaging agent during abdominal X-ray procedures.

### Tailoring treatment of hyperkalemia [^3888412a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that may be rapidly life-threatening because of its cardiac toxicity. Hyperkalemia risk factors are numerous and often combined in the same patient. Most of the strategies to control serum potassium level in the short term have been used for decades. However, evidence for their efficacy and safety remains low. Treatment of hyperkalemia remains challenging, poorly codified, with a risk of overtreatment, including short-term side effects, and with the priority of avoiding unnecessary hospital stays or chronic medication changes. Recently, new oral treatments have been proposed for non-life-threatening hyperkalemia, with encouraging results. Their role in the therapeutic arsenal remains uncertain. Finally, a growing body of evidence suggests that hyperkalemia might negatively impact outcomes in the long term in patients with chronic heart failure or kidney failure through underdosing or withholding of cardiovascular medication (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors). Recognition of efficacy and potential side effects of treatment may help in tailoring treatments to the patient's status and conditions. In this review we discuss how treatment of hyperkalemia could be tailored to the patient's conditions and status, both on the short and mid term.

Future Directions

We propose that if normokalemia with serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L can be achieved with diet and drug modifications, treatment with optimal and maximal RAASi dosing should be continued. Compelling modeling data from Evans and colleagues demonstrate that the treatment of hyperkalemia that allows for continued RAASi use leads to longer life expectancy, delayed progression to end‐stage renal disease, quality‐adjusted life year gains, and cost savings in CKD populations. 11

The available data do not yet provide conclusive evidence of the potential impact on maintaining normokalemia with potassium binders to allow for RAASi use. We need further clinical studies of patients with CHF and advanced CKD taking chronic RAASi in order to evaluate the safety and tolerability with long‐term use of potassium binders for the maintenance of normokalemia.

8 HYPERKALEMIA MANAGEMENT: FOCUS ON NEW TREATMENTS

The treatment of chronic hyperkalemia can be difficult and may be life‐threatening if left untreated. Potassium binders such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate is mainly used in patients with CKD and hyperkalemia. This substance is only suitable for short‐term treatment since its use is associated with hypernatremia, volume overload and gastrointestinal complications. A suggested management of chronic hyperkalemia in HF patients is presented in Figure 1. However, their use is associated with adverse effects, their efficacy is ascertain and their effects are transient. In this regard, the introduction of patiromer, acting at the level of the gastrointestinal tract, in particular in the colon lumen, is relevant, 20, 21, 23, 24 may decrease serum potassium levels and enable treatment with RAASi and MRAs in significantly higher doses. Patiromer for oral suspension is a non‐absorbed, sodium‐free potassium binding polymer that exchanges calcium for potassium in the gastrointestinal tract. Patiromer beads are insoluble, have an average particle size of ≈100 μm and so are too large to be absorbed, excreted ≈24 to 48 h after intake and bind potassium predominantly in the lumen of the colon and this increases fecal potassium excretion, reducing levels of free potassium. 20, 21, 23, 24 The mean reduction of serum potassium levels by patiromer in large clinical trials was in the range 0.45 to 1 mmol/L. 52

Zirconium cyclosilicate (SCZ, former ZS‐9) — an inorganic cation that allows a thermodynamically favorable catching of potassium ions‐ represent another significant pharmacologic advancements in the treatment of hyperkalemia. More specifically SCZ is an oral, nonabsorbed, high‐capacity cation‐binding compound that selectively exchanges K + for hydrogen and sodium ions throughout the gastrointestinal tract and has rapid onset of action. A single treatment with SCZ may reduce serum K + levels at 1 h after the initial dose, results in a continued and sustained reduction in serum K + levels for up to 48 h after the initial dose and has a favorable safety profile. 53 The mean reduction of serum potassium levels by SCZ in large clinical trials was in the range 0.3 to 1.1 mmol/L. 52

### Hyperkalemia treatment standard [^756a915c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depends on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration. Treatment is initially focused on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content. Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period of time and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy and correcting metabolic acidosis if present. The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of nonplant sources of K+. Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintaining the use of these drugs.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^f043ec85]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^d7d285a7]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The results from using SCZ were encouraging: the HARMONIZE trial showed that all three doses of SCZ were effective in lowering and maintaining normal potassium levels, including patients receiving RAASi therapy, who showed similar safety profiles. 58 In HARMONIZE‐Global study, normokalemia achieved in a geographically and ethnically diverse population of outpatients with hyperkalemia. 59 The most commonly reported AEs were oedema and constipation. 59 SZC corrects hyperkalaemia and maintains normokalaemia among outpatients regardless of the CKD stage. 1, 60

Unfortunately, these agents cannot be used as emergency treatment while the short duration of the above studies is a limitation in the management of chronic hyperlakemia. Although outcome studies are lacking, the use of potassium binders could play an important role in reaching target doses of RAASi by preventing the development of significant hyperkalemia. However, this hypothesis requires further research on combination treatment with potassium binders before guidelines can recommend their use in therapy.

### Real-world associations between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition therapy, hyperkalemia, and outcomes: a clinical and scientific call to action [^efdc3b31]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Linde and colleagues 1 have further expanded the growing and compelling data demonstrating the cardiovascular and mortality benefits of adherence to guideline‐recommended doses of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibition (RAASi) therapy. Although this is a retrospective review, the patient population in this study is robust with more than 191 000 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 21 000 congestive heart failure (CHF) patients. Remarkably, the authors note on more than one occasion that the recommended dosing for the CKD patients was derived from CHF recommendations, given that there are no current guidelines for CKD management. Of note, the mean duration of RAASi withdrawal for hyperkalemia in CKD and CHF exceeded 867 and 690 days, respectively!

The authors focus on the difficulty in maintaining adherence to RAASi, namely, that hyperkalemia remains a barrier to maintenance of optimal dosing of RAASi. As such, it is important that we review and highlight the complex relationships between mortality and hyperkalemia, algorithms for appropriate circulatory potassium level monitoring, and consider the currently available treatments for managing hyperkalemia that allows for optimal RAASi. Finally, it is important to highlight potential future research programs aimed at strategies to maintain normokalemia in order to achieve and maintain optimal RAASi dosing.

Definitions of hyperkalemia

Definitions of hyperkalemia vary by geographic region. In Europe, mild hyperkalemia is defined as serum potassium 5.0–5.4 mEq/L, moderate as 5.5–5.9 mEq/L, and severe as ≥ 6.0 mEq/L. The American Heart Association uses cutoffs of 5–6 mEq/L (mild), 6–7 mEq/L (moderate), and > 7 mEq/L (severe). However, in this review, we refer to the standard potassium values specified in the guidelines published by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare entitled "Classification criteria for the seriousness of adverse drug reactions of medical agents", wherein serum potassium values of ≥ 5.5 mEq/L and < 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 2 adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and values of ≥ 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 3 ADRs. For patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), Japanese nephrology guidelines recommend maintaining serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.5 mEq/L to avoid hypo- or hyperkalemia. Of note, mild to moderate hyperkalemia generally cannot be diagnosed from electrocardiogram (ECG) changes; a study in hospitalized patients indicated that the first ECG changes occurred at serum potassium levels above 7.2 mEq/L, a level that already indicates severe hyperkalemia.

### Updates on medical management of hyperkalemia [^f481a066]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyperkalemia is a potentially fatal electrolyte disorder, more commonly present when the potassium excretion capacity is imparied. Hyperkalemia can lead to adverse outcomes, especially due to severe cardiac arrhythmias. It can also impair the cardiovascular effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) and potassium rich diets, as hyperkalemia frequently leads to their discontinuation.

Recent Findings

Potassium is a predictor of mortality and should be monitored closely for patients who are at risk for hyperkalemia. Acute hyperkalemia protocols have been revised and updated. Randomized trials have shown that the new anti-hyperkalemic agents (patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate) are effective hyperkalemia treatment options. The use of anti-hyperkalemic agents may allow for a less restrictive potassium diet and lower RAASi discontinuation rates.

Summary

Hyperkalemia should be monitored closely for high-risk patients, as it is associated with adverse outcomes. New therapies have demonstrated effective control, offering hope for potential use in patients that would benefit from diet or medications associated with an increase in serum potassium, indicating that the use of hyperkalemic agents can be associated with better outcomes.

### Real-world associations of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor dose, hyperkalemia, and adverse clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients with new-onset chronic kidney disease or heart failure in the United Kingdom [^0c03e6c4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in the regulation of blood volume, blood pressure, and cardiovascular function. 1 Modification of the RAAS through the use of RAAS inhibitors (RAASi), such as angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), is an important therapeutic option for the treatment of numerous cardiorenal conditions, reducing progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), improving heart function and reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 However, RAASi use is known to reduce potassium (K +) excretion and increase the risk of hyperkalemia in an already vulnerable population. 9, 10

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life‐threatening electrolyte imbalance, defined as a serum/plasma K + level above the normal physiological range of 3.5 to 5.0 mmol/L, 11 that can induce electrophysiological disturbances, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. 12, 13, 14 The long‐term management of serum K + often requires down‐titration or discontinuation of RAASi, an approach supported by UK clinical practice guidelines: the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends not offering RAASi to CKD patients whose pretreatment serum K + is > 5.0 mmol/L and discontinuing them in patients whose serum K + reaches ≥ 6.0 mmol/L, 6 whereas guidelines from the UK Renal Association advocate cautious use or avoidance of drugs that impair K + elimination (including RAASi) and recommend discontinuation following a hyperkalemia episode. 15 In routine clinical practice, underdosing of RAASi has been found to be common among both heart failure (HF) 16, 17, 18, 19 and CKD 19 patients, with RAASi down‐titration or discontinuation following 22% to 47% of hyperkalemia events in cardiorenal patients. 19, 20 RAASi down‐titration or discontinuation in these patients has been shown to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including death. 16, 18, 19

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^b78a7278]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

### A randomized study to compare oral potassium binders in the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^66e72e42]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, the KBindER trial is the first to evaluate the efficacy of SPS, patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate head-to-head in ER and hospitalized patients with acute hyperkalemia. The results will be highly relevant to patient outcomes and healthcare spending; patients who are admitted to the hospital with hyperkalemia spend on average 4 additional days in the hospital compared to matched, non-hyperkalemic inpatients and incur USD $15,606 higher in total health care costs over a one year period. This study will be indirectly assessing health care costs by identifying if there is a difference in hospital length of stay amongst the K + binders.

Based on available data (Table 1), we hypothesize that SZC will have the most rapid onset of action to decrease blood K + via gastrointestinal excretion, if used as stand-alone therapy for acute hyperkalemia. However, it is important to test the oral potassium binders in the real-world setting where temporizing agents are commonly given to shift K + intracellularly, to determine the degree of additional K + lowering with the potassium binder. Further, we will evaluate whether patients treated with a potassium binder are more likely to maintain normokalemia on next-morning labs (for patients remaining in the hospital).

### A randomized study to compare oral potassium binders in the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^c2430715]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the setting of normal kidney function, serum potassium (K +) is maintained within a tight range (3.5–5.3 mEq/L) via renal excretion and cellular redistribution. Hyperkalemia is considered severe if K + is ≥ 6.0 mEq/L, with or without symptomatic muscle weakness/paralysis or electrocardiogram changes. Severe hyperkalemia occurs in up to 10% of all hospitalized patients and is an independent predictor of increased mortality that is associated with prolonged hospital stays, higher healthcare costs, and a 30-day hospital readmission rate of 14.21% vs. 9.86% in non-hyperkalemic patients.

Risk factors for hyperkalemia include chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus, and use of certain medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Historically, discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors occurred in ~75% of cases in response to drug-induced hyperkalemia, potentially leaving patients vulnerable to adverse cardiovascular events. The emergence of the newer oral potassium binders (patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate [SZC]) has allowed maintenance of normokalemia in CKD patients receiving background therapy with RAAS inhibitors. However, there is a lack of data on the potential utility of these binders for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.

### New drugs to prevent and treat hyperkalemia [^40eecb01]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyperkalemia is frequent, but occurs mostly in patients with chronic kidney disease and is often the cause of discontinuation or omission of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease and heart failure.

Recent Findings

Without much evidence in the literature on its efficacy, sodium polystyrene sulfonate is being used frequently in the clinical setting to treat hyperkalemia. In the last few years, two new promising agents have been developed to treat hyperkalemia - patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate 9 (ZS-9). Both patiromer and ZS-9 have been shown to decrease potassium in patients with hyperkalemia and then to maintain normokalemia. Gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent with patiromer, and edema occurred in patients using high doses of ZS-9, possibly due to its high sodium content.

Summary

Although patiromer and ZS-9 are very promising in terms of safety and efficacy, many questions remain, mostly in terms of selection of patients, long-term effects and costs.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hyperkalemia. Patients with decreased kidney function and higher baseline potassium levels are at increased risk. Monitor serum potassium levels and adjust dose as needed. (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1)
Worsening of Renal Function in Patients with Heart Failure. Measure eGFR and adjust dose as needed. (2.1, 2.3, 6.1)

5.1 Hyperkalemia

Kerendia can cause hyperkalemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The risk for developing hyperkalemia increases with decreasing kidney function and is greater in patients with higher baseline potassium levels or other risk factors for hyperkalemia. Measure serum potassium and eGFR in all patients before initiation of treatment with Kerendia and dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Do not initiate Kerendia if serum potassium is > 5.0 mEq/L.

Measure serum potassium periodically during treatment with Kerendia and adjust dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. More frequent monitoring may be necessary for patients at risk for hyperkalemia, including those on concomitant medications that impair potassium excretion or increase serum potassium [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)].

5.2 Worsening of Renal Function in Patients with Heart Failure

Kerendia can cause worsening of renal function in patients with heart failure. Rarely, severe events associated with worsening renal function, including events requiring hospitalization, have been observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Measure eGFR in all patients before initiation of treatment or with dose titration of Kerendia and dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)]. Initiation of Kerendia in patients with heart failure and an eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73m is not recommended.

Measure eGFR periodically during maintenance treatment with Kerendia in patients with heart failure. Consider delaying up-titration or interrupting treatment with Kerendia in patients who develop clinically significant worsening of renal function.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^d6f4f757]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Patiromer lowers serum potassium when taken without food: comparison to dosing with food from an open-label, randomized, parallel group hyperkalemia study [^24d958a0]. American Journal of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patiromer is a sodium-free, nonabsorbed, potassium binder approved for treatment of hyperkalemia. This open-label study compares the efficacy and safety of patiromer administered without food versus with food.

Methods

Adults with hyperkalemia (potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L) were randomized (1:1) to receive patiromer once daily without food or with food for 4 weeks. The dosage was adjusted (maximum: 25.2 g/day) using a prespecified titration schedule to achieve and maintain potassium within a target range (3.8–5.0 mEq/L). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with serum potassium in the target range at either week 3 or week 4. Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs) and laboratory testing.

Results

Efficacy was evaluated in 112 patients; 65.2% were ≥ 65 years of age, 75.9% had chronic kidney disease, and 82.1% had diabetes. Baseline mean serum potassium was similar in the without-food (5.44 mEq/L) and with-food (5.34 mEq/L) groups. The primary endpoint was achieved by 87.3% (95% CI 75.5–94.7) and 82.5% (95% CI 70.1–91.3) of patients in the with-food and without-food groups, respectively; least squares mean changes in serum potassium from baseline to week 4 were -0.65 and -0.62 mEq/L, respectively (p < 0.0001). The most common AEs were diarrhea and constipation. Serum K+ remained ≥ 3.5 mEq/L in all patients; 5 patients developed serum magnesium < 1.4 mg/dL, including 4 whose baseline magnesium was below the lower limit of normal.

Conclusion

Patiromer is equally effective and well tolerated when taken without food or with food, thereby offering the potential for dosing flexibility.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^a2c8c9d6]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hyperkalemia is a frequent and sometimes life‐threatening condition that may be associated with arrhythmia and cardiac dysfunction in patients with heart failure (HF). High potassium levels in HF represent both a direct risk for cardiovascular complication and an indirect biomarker of the severity of the underlying disease, reflecting neurohormonal activation and renal dysfunction. Evaluating the prevalence and significance of hyperkalemia in HF patients is essential for optimizing the use of potassium sparing agents, such the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) or angiotensin receptor‐neprilysin inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which represent a well‐established cornerstone and life‐saving therapy. In this review we discuss recent findings and current concepts related to the epidemiology, pathological mechanisms and implications of hyperkalemia, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to counteract it in patients with HF. The balance between optimizing life‐saving potassium sparing medication and minimizing hyperkalemia‐associated risk is much needed in patients with HF. Although older potassium‐binding agents are associated with serious adverse events, novel potassium‐binding drugs are effective in lowering potassium levels and are generally well tolerated. Novel potassium‐binding drugs, such as patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, may help to optimize therapy in HF and achieve guideline‐recommended doses. Hyperkalemia is common in HF patients and is associated with a poorer prognosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular complications: Contrariwise, "moderate" potassium levels go with a better prognosis, while the emergence of new drugs, potassium binders, could allow target doses of RAASi to be achieved.

### A phase 2 study on the treatment of hyperkalemia in patients with chronic kidney disease suggests that the selective potassium trap, ZS-9, is safe and efficient [^e529963c]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia contributes to significant mortality and limits the use of cardioprotective and renoprotective renin–angiotensin–aldosterone blockers. Current therapies are poorly tolerated and not always effective. Here we conducted a phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study to assess safety and efficacy of ZS-9. This oral selective cation exchanger that preferentially entraps potassium in the gastrointestinal tract was given to patients with stable Stage 3 chronic kidney disease and hyperkalemia (5.0 to 6.0 mEq/l) during a 2-day period. Of 90 eligible patients with mean baseline serum potassium of 5.1 mEq/l, 30 were randomized to placebo, 12–0.3 g, 24–3 g, or 24 to 10 g of ZS-9 three times daily for 2 days with regular meals. None withdrew and ZS-9 dose-dependently reduced serum potassium. The primary efficacy end point (rate of serum potassium decline in the first 48 h) was met with significance in the 3- and 10-g cohorts. From baseline, mean serum potassium was significantly decreased by 0.92 ± 0.52 mEq/l at 38 h. Urinary potassium excretion significantly decreased with 10-g ZS-9 as compared to placebo at day 2 (+15.8 +/− 21.8 vs. +8.9 +/− 22.9 mEq per 24h) from placebo at day 2. In this short-term study, no serious adverse events were reported; only mild constipation in the 3-g dose group was possibly related to treatment. Thus, ZS-9 was well-tolerated in patients with stable chronic kidney disease and hyperkalemia leading to a rapid, sustained reduction in serum potassium.

### A randomized study to compare oral potassium binders in the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^fa23e79b]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

It is timely to re-evaluate the utility of SPS in the treatment of acute hyperkalemia. If SPS proves to have equivalent or lower efficacy in lowering K + this may justify the higher cost of the newer oral binders (patiromer, SZC) to avoid the SPS-associated risk of colonic necrosis. Significant side effects such as hypercalcemia (patiromer) or edema (SZC) are not expected with a single dose of oral potassium binder. The oral K + binders offer a favorable safety profile compared to some widely-used temporizing measures for hyperkalemia. For example, insulin can incur life-threatening hypoglycemia despite co-administration of glucose, particularly in CKD patients who have reduced renal clearance of infused insulin and compromised gluconeogenic pathways. In a retrospective analysis of late-stage CKD patients being treated with insulin (n = 221), 13% of patients developed hypoglycemia. The use of i.v. bicarbonate in patients with metabolic acidosis is controversial due to the concern of displacing hydrogen ions from albumin, thus freeing up binding spots on albumin for Ca 2+ and lowering ionized Ca 2+. Further, i.v. bicarbonate can itself directly bind Ca 2+ thus causing hypocalcemia and incurring risk of myocardial destabilization.

Our study is not intended to identify superiority of one oral K + binder vs other binders, and we acknowledge the limitation that differential efficacy of the oral K + binders may be under-studied if the actual group difference is less than 0.6 mEq/L.

In summary, the KBindER trial is the first head-to-head evaluation of oral potassium binders in a real-world setting where temporizing therapies will be given per discretion of the medical team. The findings from our study will inform decision-making guidelines for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.

### An evidence-based narrative review of the emergency department management of acute hyperkalemia [^1ec34375]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The normal range for potassium is within narrow limits. Hyperkalemia is an electrolyte disorder that frequently affects patients in the emergency department (ED), and can result in significant morbidity and mortality if not identified and treated rapidly.

Objective

This article provides an evidence-based narrative review of the management of hyperkalemia, with focused updates for the emergency clinician.

Methods

We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for articles in English published in peer-reviewed journals and indexed up until May 2020. We used multiple search terms, including hyperkalemia, potassium, acute hyperkalemia, emergency department, dyskalemia, potassium disorders, kidney disease, epidemiology, electrolyte disturbance, severe hyperkalemia, and emergency management.

Discussion

In the ED, interventions aimed to protect patients from the immediate dangers of elevated serum potassium are divided into the following: stabilizing cardiac membrane potentials, reducing serum potassium levels through shift from the extracellular fluid to intracellular fluid, and elimination of potassium through excretion via urinary or fecal excretion. Calcium is widely recommended to stabilize the myocardial cell membrane, but additional research is necessary to establish criteria for use, dosages, and preferred solutions. Redistribution of potassium ions from the bloodstream into the cells is based on intravenous insulin or nebulized β2-agonists.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia is a frequent electrolyte disorder in the ED. Because of the risk of fatal dysrhythmia due to cardiac membrane instability, hyperkalemia is a medical emergency. There is a lack of scientific evidence on the optimal management of hyperkalemia and more research is needed to establish optimal strategies to manage acute hyperkalemia in the emergency department.

### Effect of patiromer on serum potassium level in patients with hyperkalemia and diabetic kidney disease: the AMETHYST-DN randomized clinical trial [^b4c5ed23]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening condition predominantly seen in patients treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors with stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease (CKD) who may also have diabetes, heart failure, or both.

Objectives

To select starting doses for a phase 3 study and to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of a potassium-binding polymer, patiromer, in outpatients with hyperkalemia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging, randomized clinical trial (AMETHYST-DN), conducted at 48 sites in Europe from June 2011 to June 2013 evaluating patiromer in 306 outpatients with type 2 diabetes (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 15 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium level > 5.0 mEq/L). All patients received RAAS inhibitors prior to and during study treatment.

Interventions

Patients were stratified by baseline serum potassium level into mild or moderate hyperkalemia groups and received 1 of 3 randomized starting doses of patiromer (4.2 g [n = 74], 8.4 g [n = 74], or 12.6 g [n = 74] twice daily [mild hyperkalemia] or 8.4 g [n = 26], 12.6 g [n = 28], or 16.8 g [n = 30] twice daily [moderate hyperkalemia]). Patiromer was titrated to achieve and maintain serum potassium level 5.0 mEq/L or lower.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy end point was mean change in serum potassium level from baseline to week 4 or prior to initiation of dose titration. The primary safety end point was adverse events through 52 weeks. Secondary efficacy end points included mean change in serum potassium level through 52 weeks.

Results

A total of 306 patients were randomized. The least squares mean reduction from baseline in serum potassium level at week 4 or time of first dose titration in patients with mild hyperkalemia was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.22–0.48) mEq/L for the 4.2 g twice daily starting-dose group, 0.51 (95% CI, 0.38–0.64) mEq/L for the 8.4 g twice daily starting-dose group, and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.42–0.68) mEq/L for the 12.6 g twice daily starting-dose group. In those with moderate hyperkalemia, the reduction was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.60–1.14) mEq/L for the 8.4 g twice daily starting-dose group, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.70–1.23) mEq/L for the 12.6 g twice daily starting-dose group, and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.67–1.17) mEq/L for the 16.8 g twice daily starting-dose group (P < .001 for all changes vs baseline by hyperkalemia starting-dose groups within strata). From week 4 through week 52, statistically significant mean decreases in serum potassium levels were observed at each monthly point in patients with mild and moderate hyperkalemia. Over the 52 weeks, hypomagnesemia (7.2%) was the most common treatment-related adverse event, mild to moderate constipation (6.3%) was the most common gastrointestinal adverse event, and hypokalemia (< 3.5 mEq/L) occurred in 5.6% of patients.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with hyperkalemia and diabetic kidney disease, patiromer starting doses of 4.2 to 16.8 g twice daily resulted in statistically significant decreases in serum potassium level after 4 weeks of treatment, lasting through 52 weeks.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^4e41cad2]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 chronic kidney disease blood pressure management — managing hyperkalemia with RASi: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. In observational cohorts, hyperkalemia is often associated with a subsequent reduction in dose or discontinuation of RASi, and pseudo-hyperkalemia needs to be first ruled out. Strategies to control chronic hyperkalemia include dietary potassium restriction; discontinuation of potassium supplements, certain salt substitutes, and hyperkalemia drugs; adding potassium-wasting diuretics; and oral potassium binders, and in chronic kidney disease patients receiving RASi who develop hyperkalemia the latter can be controlled with newer oral potassium binders in many patients, with the effect that RASi can be continued at the recommended dose; side effects of oral potassium binders are reported to be moderate.

The revised primary endpoint was the adjusted mean change in serum potassium from baseline. The cut-off for data was the end of study date of 24 June 2021, all efficacy results are analyses up to the cut-off date, safety results include all data collected. Five secondary endpoints were tested in a hierarchical manner: (i) time to the first event of hyperkalemia of > 5.5 mmol/l; (ii) lack of durable enablement of MRA at target dose, i.e. time to discontinuation or reduction of target MRA dose for at least 14 days or until end of the study; (iii) all investigator-reported adverse events of hyperkalemia (first and recurrent); (iv) a win ratio for morbidity and mortality-adjusted hyperkalemia-related outcomes with the following sequence: cardiovascular death, cardiovascular hospitalization, total hyperkalemia events > 6.5, > 6.0–6.5, and > 5.0–6.0 mmol/l; and (v) a win ratio of novel RAASi use score (range 0–8) based on the sequence of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular hospitalization, and one or two points each for the use of > 0% to ≤ 50% or > 50% of target doses of ACEi/ARB/ARNi, MRA, and beta-blocker (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1). There are dependencies between the secondary endpoints, e.g. the secondary endpoint hyperkalemia-related outcomes, includes hyperkalemia events, which is also a secondary endpoint. Furthermore, the RAASi use score includes MRA at target dose, which is also a secondary endpoint. A clinical events committee adjudicated events in a blinded manner. An independent data monitoring committee reviewed safety data periodically. Safety assessments included the occurrence of adverse events (according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities), evaluation of blood test results and vital signs.

Use of these newer exchange agents may help facilitate essential use of RASi/MRA, and healthcare providers should be aware of clinical nuances and local availability or formulary restrictions when determining therapy selection.

### Controversies in management of hyperkalemia [^839a273b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that can result in morbidity and mortality if not managed appropriately.

Objectives

This review evaluates the classic treatments of hyperkalemia and discusses controversies and new medications for management.

Discussion

Potassium (K+) plays a key role in determining the transmembrane potentials of "excitable membranes" present in nerve and muscle cells. K+ is the predominant intracellular cation, and clinical deterioration typically ensues when patients develop sufficiently marked elevation in extracellular fluid concentrations of K+ (hyperkalemia). Hyperkalemia is usually detected via serum clinical laboratory measurement. The most severe effect of hyperkalemia includes various cardiac dysrhythmias, which may result in cardiac arrest and death. Treatment includes measures to "stabilize" cardiac membranes, to shift K+ from extracellular to intracellular stores, and to promote K+ excretion. Calcium gluconate 10% dosed 10 mL intravenously should be provided for membrane stabilization, unless the patient is in cardiac arrest, in which case 10 mL calcium chloride is warranted. Beta-agonists and intravenous insulin should be given, and some experts recommend the use of synthetic short-acting insulins rather than regular insulin. Dextrose should also be administered, as indicated by initial and serial serum glucose measurements. Dialysis is the most efficient means to enable removal of excess K+. Loop and thiazide diuretics can also be useful. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not efficacious. New medications to promote gastrointestinal K+ excretion, which include patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, hold promise.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia can be deadly, and treatment requires specific measures including membrane stabilization, cellular shift, and excretion.

### A phase 2 study on the treatment of hyperkalemia in patients with chronic kidney disease suggests that the selective potassium trap, ZS-9, is safe and efficient [^9449f331]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

The relatively small number of patients per treatment arm is a limitation to the current study; still, the consistency of the efficacy end points in the overall population and the RAAS subgroup, dose response, and compelling P -values suggest that a true treatment effect was observed. The K + content of meals was not measured; the degree to which dietary K + affects s-K + levels during ZS-9 treatment remains to be determined. Few patients had s-K + > 5.5 mEq/l; meaningful conclusions cannot be drawn about ZS-9's effects in patients with more severe hyperkalemia. This will be evaluated in the Phase 3 trials of ZS-9. Similarly, only patients with stage 3 CKD were included in the present study, and thus results cannot be extrapolated to patients with more severe CKD. Although RAAS blockade use was not an entry criterion, more than half of the patients were receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker at baseline. This, combined with the lack of dietary restrictions, suggests that the study setting was consistent with what clinicians encounter in daily practice.

In conclusion, these results demonstrate that ZS-9 is well-tolerated and effective at acutely reducing s-K + in hyperkalemic patients with stable stage 3 CKD. Further study of the long-term efficacy and safety of ZS-9 to decrease K + and maintain normokalemia in a broader population of patients with more severe hyperkalemia is ongoing.

### Pivotal clinical trials, meta-analyses and current guidelines in the treatment of hyperkalemia [^4b30ba69]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia (HK) is the most common electrolyte disturbance observed in patients with advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), is a potentially life-threatening clinical condition due to an increased risk of fatal arrhythmias, and strongly impacts the quality of life and prognosis of CKD patients. Moreover, while renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASIs) represent the most cardio-nephro-protective drugs used in clinical practice, the treatment with these drugs per se increases serum potassium (sK) values, particularly when heart failure and diabetes mellitus coexist. In fact, the onset or recurrence of HK is frequently associated with not starting, down-titrating or withdrawing RAASIs, and is an indication to begin renal replacement treatment in end-stage renal disease. Current strategies aimed at preventing and treating chronic HK are still unsatisfactory, as evidenced by the relatively high prevalence of HK also in patients under stable nephrology care, and even in the ideal setting of randomized clinical trials. Indeed, dietary potassium restriction, the use of sodium bicarbonate or diuretics, the withdrawal or down-titration of RAASIs, or the administration of old potassium binders, namely sodium polystyrene sulphonate and calcium polystyrene sulphonate, have limited efficacy and are poorly tolerated; therefore, these strategies are not suitable for long-term control of sK. As such, there is an important unmet need for novel therapeutic options for the chronic management of patients at risk for HK. The development of new potassium binders may change the treatment landscape in the near future. This review summarizes the current evidence on the treatment of chronic HK in cardio-renal patients.

Figure 26 — Serum potassium monitoring during treatment with a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) (finerenone) outlines actions by potassium level. For K+ ≤ 4.8 mmol/l, finerenone dosing and monitoring are: 10 mg daily if eGFR 25–59 ml/min/1.73 m2 or 20 mg daily if eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m2; monitor K+ at 1 month after initiation and then every 4 months; increase dose to 20 mg daily if on 10 mg daily; and after a prior hold for hyperkalemia, restart 10 mg daily if K+ now ≤ 5.0 mmol/l. For K+ 4.9–5.5 mmol/l, continue finerenone 10 mg or 20 mg and monitor K+ every 4 months. For K+ > 5.5 mmol/l, hold finerenone, consider adjustments to diet or concomitant medications to mitigate hyperkalemia, recheck K+, and consider reinstitution if/when K+ ≤ 5.0 mmol/l. The figure also notes that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved initiation of K+ ≤ 5.0 mmol/l, serum creatinine/estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be monitored concurrently with serum potassium, and that it may be considered appropriate to continue MRAs in people with potassium of 5.0–5.5 mmol/l.

### Real-world associations of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor dose, hyperkalemia, and adverse clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients with new-onset chronic kidney disease or heart failure in the United Kingdom [^9a12cdcf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The link between RAASi use and hyperkalemia, and evidence of poor outcomes associated with suboptimal RAASi dosing have both been reported previously. 16, 17, 18, 20 However, the relationships of RAASi dose, hyperkalemia, and clinical outcomes in cardiorenal patients have not been fully described. Nevertheless, outcomes in RAASi‐treated patients are of high potential interest to cardiologists, nephrologists, general practitioners, and the general medical community, given the widespread applications of RAASi in cardiorenal medicine. Our study aimed to address this evidence gap by estimating real‐world associations of RAASi dose, hyperkalemia, and adverse clinical outcomes in a large cohort of UK patients with new‐onset CKD or HF. More specifically, the study addressed 2 objectives: to investigate the associations between the incidence of hyperkalemia and changes to RAASi dose (down‐titration or discontinuation) and to assess real‐world RAASi dosing and its association with adverse clinical outcomes.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure [^6c589e2f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Disorders of potassium homeostasis can potentiate the already elevated risk of arrhythmia in heart failure. Heart failure patients have a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease, which further heightens the risk of hyperkalemia, especially when renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors are used. Acute treatment for hyperkalemia may not be tolerated in the long term. Recent data for patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, used to treat and prevent high serum potassium levels on a more chronic basis, have sparked interest in the treatment of hyperkalemia, as well as the potential use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients who were previously unable to take these drugs or tolerated only low doses. This review discusses the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and outcomes of hyperkalemia in heart failure; provides an overview of traditional and novel ways to approach management of hyperkalemia; and discusses the need for further research to optimally treat heart failure.

### Efficacy and safety of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for treatment of hyperkalemia: an 11-month open-label extension of HARMONIZE [^8502d34a]. American Journal of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC; formerly ZS-9) is a selective potassium (K+) binder for treatment of hyperkalemia. An open-label extension (OLE) of the -HARMONIZE study evaluated efficacy and safety of SZC for ≤ 11 months.

Methods

Patients from HARMONIZE with point-of-care device i-STAT K+ 3.5–6.2 mmol/L received once-daily SZC 5–10 g for ≤ 337 days. End points included achievement of mean serum K+ ≤ 5.1 mmol/L (primary) or ≤ 5.5 mmol/L (secondary).

Results

Of 123 patients who entered the extension (mean serum K+ 4.8 mmol/L), 79 (64.2%) completed the study. The median daily dose of SZC was 10 g (range 2.5–15 g). The primary end point was achieved by 88.3% of patients, and 100% achieved the secondary end point. SZC was well tolerated with no new safety concerns.

Conclusion

In the HARMONIZE OLE, most patients maintained mean serum K+ within the normokalemic range for ≤ 11 months during ongoing SZC treatment.

### Hyperkalemia and the risks of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^92b06100]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Given their known cardiorenal protective effects, RAASi are commonly used in the long‐term management of CKD and several cardiovascular diseases, most prominently hypertension and heart failure. However, their use is frequently limited by the development of hyperkalemia. Indeed, a 2015 study of claims data assessing dosing of RAASi in patients with hyperkalemia found that mild hyperkalemia led to downtitration or discontinuation among 38% of patients taking these drugs at a maximal dose, as well as discontinuation among 22% of patients taking RAASi at a suboptimal dose, both of which have been associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular and kidney events. Though our study found that the increased risks of adverse cardiovascular outcomes among patients with hyperkalemia compared with normokalemia was consistent among the substudy of patients with baseline RAASi use, it did not examine treatment patterns or assess the risk of cardiovascular outcomes by RAASi use during the follow‐up period. Some research has shown that novel oral antihyperkalemia potassium binder therapies such as sodium zirconium cyclosilicate and patiromer sorbitex calcium can facilitate the initiation ofand persistence to RAASi, helping to preserve their cardiovascular and kidney protective effects. However, prospective clinical trials are needed to determine the long‐term safety and efficacy of intestinal potassium binders on cardiovascular end points in patients with CKD and hyperkalemia.

Strategies to avoid 'deprescribing' in hyperkalemia

RASi and MR antagonists might be legitimately withheld due to well-justified fears of hyperkalemia in patients with significant risk factors or in patients who prioritize avoidance of hyperkalemia (or other factors such as tablet burden) over any potential prognostic benefit. On the other hand, they may be withheld because of an exaggerated fear of hyperkalemia on the part of the physician or patient. To our knowledge, there have been no robust studies that have succeeded in exploring the underlying reasons for this gap in a large population.

Several potential strategies could be used to minimize 'deprescribing' and thus realize the potential benefit of RASis and MRAs in target patient groups. First, we could ensure that prescribing decisions are made in the context of accurate data regarding the presence — or risk — of hyperkalemia in any individual patient. Large datasets have been used to construct hyperkalemia 'risk scores'. Emerging technologies (such as wearable and needle-free potassium sensors) providing real-time [K +] e data could allow RASis/MRAs to be omitted only on hyperkalemic days rather than being permanently discontinued in high-risk patients.

Second, novel alternative drugs, such as non-steroidal MR antagonists, may confer less risk of hyperkalemia than conventional agents. These are being tested in clinical trials.

Third, one should not forget tried-and-trusted methods for lowering potassium levels. Effective dietary advice and dietetic input can play a vital role in limiting hyperkalemia. Administration of loop and thiazide diuretics can be a useful strategy in selected patients.

Finally, hyperkalemia could be avoided by the co-prescription of tolerable potassium binders (patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate). This strategy was successful in preventing RASi deprescribing in a small RCT. So far, these novel agents appear to be a valuable addition to our therapeutic armoury. However, we should be relatively cautious about the introduction into widespread clinical practice and remain vigilant for side effects that may emerge during post-marketing surveillance. In clinical trials, patiromer was associated with adverse reactions including hypomagnesemia and gastrointestinal upset and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate was associated with hypokalemia and oedema.

### Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in hyperkalemia [^2a638123]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia (serum potassium level, > 5.0 mmol per liter) is associated with increased mortality among patients with heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or diabetes. We investigated whether sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS-9), a novel selective cation exchanger, could lower serum potassium levels in patients with hyperkalemia.

Methods

In this multicenter, two-stage, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 753 patients with hyperkalemia to receive either ZS-9 (at a dose of 1.25 g, 2.5 g, 5 g, or 10 g) or placebo three times daily for 48 hours. Patients with normokalemia (serum potassium level, 3.5 to 4.9 mmol per liter) at 48 hours were randomly assigned to receive either ZS-9 or placebo once daily on days 3 to 14 (maintenance phase). The primary end point was the exponential rate of change in the mean serum potassium level at 48 hours.

Results

At 48 hours, the mean serum potassium level had decreased from 5.3 mmol per liter at baseline to 4.9 mmol per liter in the group of patients who received 2.5 g of ZS-9, 4.8 mmol per liter in the 5-g group, and 4.6 mmol per liter in the 10-g group, for mean reductions of 0.5, 0.5, and 0.7 mmol per liter, respectively (P < 0.001 for all comparisons) and to 5.1 mmol per liter in the 1.25-g group and the placebo group (mean reduction, 0.3 mmol per liter). In patients who received 5 g of ZS-9 and those who received 10 g of ZS-9, serum potassium levels were maintained at 4.7 mmol per liter and 4.5 mmol per liter, respectively, during the maintenance phase, as compared with a level of more than 5.0 mmol per liter in the placebo group (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). Rates of adverse events were similar in the ZS-9 group and the placebo group (12.9% and 10.8%, respectively, in the initial phase; 25.1% and 24.5%, respectively, in the maintenance phase). Diarrhea was the most common complication in the two study groups.

Conclusions

Patients with hyperkalemia who received ZS-9, as compared with those who received placebo, had a significant reduction in potassium levels at 48 hours, with normokalemia maintained during 12 days of maintenance therapy. (Funded by ZS Pharma; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01737697.).

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^09d3e823]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Monitoring

In the general patient population, potassium levels are often elevated. Approximately 6.8% of the Japanese population is estimated to have hyperkalemia (defined as at least two serum potassium readings ≥ 5.1 mEq/L) based on the results of a medical database analysis. Similarly, a Swedish study examining 364,955 patients who accessed healthcare over a 3-year period revealed a 7% incidence of hyperkalemia (defined as potassium > 5 mEq/L) with a 35.7% rate of recurrence.

Regular monitoring allows drug dosages to be adjusted based on serum potassium levels. A long-term potassium monitoring study in patients with heart failure suggested that maintenance of serum potassium levels within the normal range should be considered a therapeutic target, allowing clinicians to modify treatment and mitigate risks to improve clinical outcomes for patients. In patients with diabetes being treated with an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or spironolactone, compared with no monitoring, regular monitoring of serum potassium has been shown to decrease the risk of hyperkalemia-related adverse events (adjusted relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.37–0.66). According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, the suggested frequency of serum potassium monitoring after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy is as follows: every 4–12 weeks for serum potassium ≤ 4.5 mEq/L, every 2–4 weeks for 4.6–5 mEq/L, and more frequently than every 2 weeks for > 5 mEq/L. The American Heart Association states that potassium levels and renal function should typically be checked on days 3 and 7 after initiating therapy with aldosterone antagonists and then at least monthly for the first 3 months. However, the frequency of serum potassium measurement is not described in the guidelines published by the Japanese Society of Nephrology or Japanese societies related to CVD.

To avoid the risk of false positive findings, serum potassium levels need to be measured carefully. Causes of false positives include hemolysis, delay in sample processing, long-term cold storage, and contamination of blood samples with antiseptics or potassium salts from blood collection tubes. Careful collection techniques and proper sample handling and storage are therefore essential.

Additional suggestions for clinicians intending to prescribe RAASis include pretreatment GFR and baseline serum potassium determination (to identify or exclude high-risk patients), dosage titration, and discontinuation of potassium supplements or concomitant maintenance treatment with loop or thiazide diuretics.

### Management of hyperkalemia: an update for the internist [^48fd8fe1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications (especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represent an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of 2 new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies, and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Assessment of patiromer monotherapy for hyperkalemia in an acute care setting [^a6c138e4]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study End Points

The primary end point was the mean absolute reduction in serum potassium level from baseline at 3 distinct time intervals after patiromer administration: 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. These time intervals were prespecified to facilitate analysis in the absence of a standardized, institutional hyperkalemia protocol. Reduction of serum potassium levels was also assessed using relative (percentage) reduction owing to the hypothesized mechanism of more prominent lowering with higher baseline elevation. Outcomes were compared across prespecified subgroups based on care setting, patiromer dose, and baseline hyperkalemia severity stratified as mild (potassium level, 5.1–5.5 mEq/L), moderate (potassium level, 5.6–6.4 mEq/L), or severe (potassium level, ≥ 6.5 mEq/L). Subsequent use of any potassium binder was captured as well as standard-of-care hyperkalemia control measures (eg, calcium, albuterol, regular insulin coadministered with dextrose, and dialysis). Time to a second potassium binder dose and time to insulin dose were assessed. Incidence of hypokalemia, defined as a serum potassium level less than 3.5 mEq/L, and incidence of hypomagnesemia, defined as a serum magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL or less (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.4114), at 24 hours were recorded. Potassium laboratory test orders and their performance times after the initial patiromer administration were evaluated at intervals of 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. The time to the earliest recheck and the presence of repeated laboratory tests in each time interval were evaluated to provide insight on potassium monitoring patterns in real-world clinical practice without a treatment protocol.
