## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pricing approach begins with the customer rather than with the cost of the product offering. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle implied by "begins with the customer". Then, I should verify which options are cost-based versus value-based. Next, I will examine the provided sources to confirm which strategy explicitly anchors price to customer-perceived value. Finally, I will eliminate the alternatives and confirm the best answer with supporting citations.

> Let me first confirm the principle: "begins with the customer" means the price is determined by what the customer is willing to pay for the perceived value or benefit, rather than by adding a margin to production cost. This is the essence of value-based pricing in healthcare and other sectors, where price reflects the incremental therapeutic or service value to the buyer rather than the manufacturer's cost plus markup [^81af00b9] [^100d0178].

> Wait, let me verify the alternatives that start with cost. Cost-based pricing sets price by adding a predetermined margin to production or acquisition cost, which is the opposite of starting with the customer. Competitive pricing uses competitor prices as a benchmark, and dynamic pricing adjusts prices in real time to demand or market conditions, but neither of these inherently starts with customer-perceived value, even though they may incidentally align with it in some cases [^notfound].

> I will now examine which option explicitly starts with the customer. Value-based pricing is defined as pricing that reflects the value to the buyer rather than the actual costs of production plus a margin; it proceeds by agreeing on what constitutes value and then translating that value into a price, which is a customer-centric process rather than a cost-plus one [^81af00b9] [^f92f8073]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies beyond theory: in practice, value-based pricing is used to negotiate prices that align with incremental clinical benefit, such as cost per QALY thresholds, reinforcing that the starting point is the value proposition to the payer and patient, not the manufacturer's cost [^7b4d4bed] [^cec42f56].

> Let me consider the distractors carefully. Skimming and penetration are launch strategies that set high or low initial prices relative to market conditions, but they do not intrinsically begin with customer value assessment. Premium pricing is a positioning tactic rather than a pricing methodology. Sales pricing is vague and not a recognized framework. Dynamic pricing is reactive to market signals rather than anchored to a predefined value assessment with the customer [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought dynamic pricing might fit because it responds to customer demand, but that would be a mistake. Dynamic pricing algorithms optimize for revenue or utilization in real time and may incorporate demand elasticity, yet they do not require a prior agreement on what constitutes value to the customer, which is the hallmark of value-based pricing; thus, dynamic pricing is not the correct answer here [^notfound].

> I should double-check that the sources consistently support value-based pricing as the customer-first approach. Multiple authoritative sources describe value-based pricing as pricing according to the value delivered to the buyer, often operationalized via cost-effectiveness or multi-attribute value frameworks, and explicitly contrasted with cost-based approaches, confirming that the process begins with defining and quantifying value from the customer's perspective before setting price [^81af00b9] [^f92f8073] [^7b4d4bed].

> Conclusion: The pricing approach that begins with the customer rather than with product cost is value-based pricing. Therefore, the correct answer is H. Value-based pricing [^81af00b9] [^f92f8073].

---

The correct answer is **H. Value-based pricing**. This approach sets prices based on the perceived value to the customer rather than on production costs, aligning price with the benefits customers receive [^81af00b9] [^100d0178]. In healthcare, value-based pricing links price to clinical outcomes and patient-centered benefits, often using cost-effectiveness or quality-adjusted life years to justify the price [^7b4d4bed] [^cec42f56].

---

## Definition and core principles

Value-based pricing sets prices according to the **perceived value** of a product or service to the customer, rather than on production costs or competitor prices [^81af00b9]. The core principle is that customers are willing to pay more for products or services that deliver superior value, whether through enhanced quality, improved outcomes, or unique features [^100d0178]. This approach requires a deep understanding of customer needs, preferences, and the specific benefits they derive from the product or service [^dd99e0a3].

---

## Application in healthcare

In healthcare, value-based pricing is increasingly used to align drug and medical service prices with the **clinical benefits** and outcomes they provide to patients [^f92f8073]. This approach considers factors such as:

- **Clinical effectiveness**: The therapeutic benefits and improvements in patient outcomes [^7b4d4bed].
- **Patient-reported outcomes**: Quality of life, symptom relief, and patient satisfaction [^notfound].
- **Cost-effectiveness**: The economic value of the intervention relative to its cost, often measured using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) [^7b4d4bed].

For example, pharmaceutical companies may price new drugs based on the incremental clinical benefits they offer over existing treatments, using cost-effectiveness analyses to justify higher prices [^7b4d4bed] [^cec42f56].

---

## Comparison with other pricing strategies

| **Pricing strategy** | **Description** | **Customer-centric approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Cost-based pricing | Prices are set by adding a markup to production costs | No |
| Competitive pricing | Prices are set based on competitor prices | No |
| Dynamic pricing | Prices fluctuate based on market demand and supply conditions | Partially |
| Penetration pricing | Low initial prices to gain market share | No |
| Skimming pricing | High initial prices targeting early adopters | No |
| Premium pricing | High prices to signal superior quality | No |
| Value-based pricing | Prices are set based on perceived customer value | Yes |

---

Value-based pricing is unique in that it **explicitly starts with the customer**, assessing the value they perceive in the product or service and setting prices accordingly [^81af00b9].

---

## Advantages and challenges

### Advantages

Advantages include **alignment with customer value**, which ensures prices reflect the benefits customers receive, leading to higher satisfaction and loyalty [^100d0178]. It can also **justify premium pricing** when products or services deliver superior value, enabling higher profit margins [^81af00b9]. Additionally, it encourages **innovation** by rewarding products that significantly improve outcomes or quality of life [^4f494f4f].

---

### Challenges

Challenges include the **difficulty of quantifying value**, especially in healthcare, where outcomes may be subjective or long-term [^428e0ea2]. There is also potential for **stakeholder disagreement** — patients, payers, and providers may have different perceptions of value, complicating pricing decisions [^d634509c]. Regulatory and market access hurdles may arise, as value-based pricing often requires robust evidence and negotiation with payers [^9dffe8bc].

---

## Examples in healthcare

- **Pharmaceuticals**: Drugs like Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) for hepatitis C were priced based on their high clinical cure rates and long-term cost savings, despite high initial costs [^notfound].
- **Medical devices**: Innovative devices, such as minimally invasive surgical tools, are often priced based on the improved patient outcomes and reduced recovery times they provide [^notfound].
- **Healthcare services**: Value-based care models, such as bundled payments for surgical procedures, align provider compensation with patient outcomes and satisfaction [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Value-based pricing is a customer-centric approach that sets prices based on the perceived value of a product or service to the customer. In healthcare, it aligns pricing with clinical outcomes and patient-centered benefits, requiring robust evidence and stakeholder collaboration. While it offers significant advantages, such as justified premium pricing and innovation incentives, it also presents challenges, including quantifying value and navigating stakeholder disagreements [^81af00b9] [^f92f8073].

### Pricing medicines: theory and practice, challenges and opportunities [^6f82c967]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2005). Medium credibility.

The pricing of medicines has become one of the most hotly debated topics of recent times, with the pharmaceutical industry seemingly being attacked from all quarters. From a company perspective, determining the price for each new product is more crucial than ever, given the present dearth of new drug introductions. But how are pricing strategies developed in practice? What is value-based pricing and how are financial models of return on investment constructed? What are the challenges faced in setting the price for a particular product, and how will scientific and environmental trends provide future pricing challenges or opportunities?

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^4f494f4f]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Contemporary debates about drug pricing feature several widely held misconceptions, including the relationship between incentives and innovation, the proportion of total healthcare spending on pharmaceuticals, and whether the economic evaluation of a medicine can be influenced by things other than clinical efficacy.

Main Body

All citizens should have access to timely, equitable, and cost-effective care covered by public funds, private insurance, or a combination of both. Better managing the collective burden of diseases borne by today's and future generations depends in part on developing better technologies, including better medicines. As in any innovative industry, the expectation of adequate financial returns incentivizes innovators and their investors to develop new medicines. Estimating expected returns requires that they forecast revenues, based on the future price trajectory and volume of use over time. How market participants decide what price to set or accept can be complicated, and some observers and stakeholders want to confirm whether the net prices society pays for novel medicines, whether as a reward for past innovation or an incentive for future innovation, are commensurate with those medicines' incremental value. But we must also ask "value to whom?"; medicines not only bring immediate clinical benefits to patients treated today, but also can provide a broad spectrum of short- and long-term benefits to patients, their families, and society. Spending across all facets of healthcare has grown over the last 25 years, but both inpatient and outpatient spending has outpaced drug spending growth even as our drug armamentarium is constantly improving with safer and more effective medicines. In large part, this is because, unlike hospitals, drugs typically go generic, thus making room in our budgets for new and better ones, even as they often keep patients out of hospitals, driving further savings.

Conclusion

A thorough evaluation of drug spending and value can help to promote a better allocation of healthcare resources for both the healthy and the sick, both of whom must pay for healthcare. Taking a holistic approach to assessing drug value makes it clear that a branded drug's value to a patient is often only a small fraction of the drug's total value to society. Societal value merits consideration when determining whether and how to make a medicine affordable and accessible to patients: a drug that is worth its price to society should not be rendered inaccessible to ill patients by imposing high out-of-pocket costs or restricting coverage based on narrow health technology assessments (HTAs). Furthermore, recognizing the total societal cost of un- or undertreated conditions is crucial to gaining a thorough understanding of what guides the biomedical innovation ecosystem to create value for society. It would be unwise to discourage the development of new solutions without first appreciating the cost of leaving the problems unsolved.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^c176ca5d]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondly, we advocate for a comprehensive evaluation of the value of medicines from a societal perspective as the basis to gauge whether they are worth their cost to society. This evaluation should not be confined to immediate clinical benefits but should be extended to encompass the broad spectrum of advantages conferred by medical interventions in the near and long term to different stakeholders in our society. It is also imperative to incorporate pricing dynamics from competition (both for branded and generic medicines) in this assessment. By adopting this holistic societal approach, the perceived high costs of medicines can be understood and judged in terms of their contributions to the entire economy over the long term, thereby challenging the notion that drug prices are inherently exorbitant. However, for this view to be convincing, we must consider how and why several of the arguments advanced to argue that drugs are overpriced are flawed. For example, arguing that a drug is overpriced if it generates more in profit than it costs to develop ignores the need for a return on investment for an entire portfolio of projects from which few successes emerge. Arguing that drugs are overpriced because patients cannot afford them ignores the important role of insurance plan design in determining drug affordability and access. Also, arguing that drugs are overpriced in the USA because they are cheaper elsewhere fails to consider that other countries are possibly paying too little to support global R&D and are essentially freeriding off the USA’s greater ability and willingness to support biomedical innovation.

While it remains appropriate to condemn specific instances of excessive economic “rent-seeking” or even price gouging when companies exploit regulatory or payment system loopholes to keep competitors away, it is wrong to imply that this happens with all medicines. Market flaws are not the same as the whole market being broken: flaws can be fixed without dismantling the whole market.

It is also both naive and harmful to population health to simply point to calculations by HTA bodies and health economists that claim to demonstrate that specific drugs are not cost-effective, without first scrutinizing the underlying methodology to see if it truly reflects all of society’s values. We ask readers to consider how some first principles of value assessments might lead to a broader support for medical innovation.

### Pricing and reimbursement experiences and insights in the European union and the United States: lessons learned to approach adaptive payer pathways [^fe334d40]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Earlier patient access to beneficial therapeutics that addresses unmet need is one of the main requirements of innovation in global healthcare systems already burdened by unsustainable budgets. "Adaptive pathways" encompass earlier cross-stakeholder engagement, regulatory tools, and iterative evidence generation through the life cycle of the medicinal product. A key enabler of earlier patient access is through more flexible and adaptive payer approaches to pricing and reimbursement that reflect the emerging evidence generated.

### Implementation of value-based pricing for medicines [^f92f8073]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Value-based pricing (VBP) is well established in markets for common goods and services, but wide consensus on VBP for pharmaceuticals is lacking. In principle, VBP implies that prices are mainly driven by a drug's value (value for money) and that the impact on budget (sustainability) is a second-order driver of price regulation. Although the literature provides descriptive analyses on regulations governing medicine price negotiation, there are few insights on whether and how price negotiation regulations have been implemented. The goal of this article was to cover this information gap for 5 European countries and the United States. VBP has been applied according to two models: (1) direct models in which cost-effectiveness is a driver; and (2) indirect, multi-attribute models characterized by greater discretion on the integration between the different value domains and the evaluation of consistency between costs and value. In these models, cost-effectiveness is not a driver. In addition, it is hard to evaluate within these models the actual implementation of VBP. Identifying whether and how VBP is applied requires a clear predefined link between added value and the premium price, as well as transparency in the way added value is converted into a premium price. In general, for these countries, it remains difficult to determine whether pricing is mostly driven by value (value-for-money) or impact on budget (sustainability). In instances in which thresholds on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio are used, it becomes easier to understand whether VBP has been implemented. If VBP relies on a multi-criteria approach, greater transparency on which criteria have been used to assess a new drug and how they have been converted into a reasonable price may help in understanding whether a value-based approach has been used.

### Value-based healthcare: controlling costs through a value analysis committee [^4dd84f23]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Principle 3: Compare Costs to Similar Solutions

Supply chain and finance specialists should provide summary information on pricing, cost comparisons, and general reimbursement for co-chair and general committee review. Transparency from the hospital and/or healthcare system is important to make sound and informed decisions. The physician proposing a new product should work with a supply chain representative to accurately identify similar adopted products and essentially equivalent products on the market for cost comparisons. At the direction of the committee, adopting a new solution may require replacing an existing and similar solution to improve negotiated pricing and supply chain efficiency. Committee members should pause and reflect on whether a proposed new product that addresses the same clinical need as an existing product will add cost without improving quality.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^81af00b9]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Some countries are increasingly interested in developing tiered or differential pricing, whereby different prices are charged to buyers according to their income levels. In theory, it offers the possibility of simultaneously increasing profits and expanding access to a medicine for a larger population. Several criticisms have been raised about tiered pricing, particularly the potentially arbitrary nature of determining tiers, whether it will improve access in lower income countries or small markets, and the lack of transparency or public input into pricing primarily set by sellers—a phenomenon known as price discrimination.

An alternative case has been made for expensive medicines offsetting longer term costs, leading to the development of value based pricing. Value based pricing follows the principle that price should reflect the value to the buyer rather than the actual costs of production plus a margin.It has emerged as a way of agreeing what will be considered during negotiations. Two stages are common: firstly, an agreement of what is included in the value assessment and secondly, how it is valued. Definitions of value can vary across stakeholders and contexts, however, with some arguing that the design of such models can be manipulated to demonstrate a desired outcome.Some countries have experimented with permitting several prices for a single medicine with multiple indications according to the value of each indication. Others, such as Germany, account for such potential differences in value across indications by setting its price according to an average weighted by the population treated in each indication. This strategy, however, may disincentivise applications for new indications with minimal added benefit over comparators, instead relying on off-label prescribing or reformulation of medicines.

Pooled procurement, or joint purchasing, can reduce the power of a monopoly. This allows several buyers to agree to purchase certain medicines exclusively through the group. Joint purchasing increases buyers’ power because it provides access to several markets and increases the volume of product included in the tender.Pooled procurement has been shown to reduce the price of medicines drastically and improve access globally and regionally as suppliers and buyers both benefit from economies of scale.For example, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States Pharmaceutical Procurement Service negotiated an average cost savings of 37% for 25 selected pharmaceuticals over a five year period (1998-2002).Pooled procurement is not a perfect solution, however, as constraints owing to differences in national process or legislation may need to be resolved before implementation and may exceed the expected savingsor lead to unintended consequences for the supply.

So, the key question should be properly restated to: how high a price should society be willing to pay for a medicine (or any product) when innovators have the power to set a price?

Formalized HTA processes have been employed for many years in a number of countries to determine the value of novel health technologies and, in many cases, to inform reimbursement and pricing decisions. Major HTA organizations include the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales, Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) in France, Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss (G-BA) in Germany, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) in Australia, and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) in Canada. These agencies perform HTA on behalf of ministries of health (or equivalent) and therefore tend to take a narrow perspective of healthcare budgets when they perform assessments. Economic evaluation, including cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), is commonly conducted as part of HTA to analyze the costs and effects of alternative interventions that may be given to a defined population. In traditional CEA, the health benefits of health technologies are typically captured by quality-adjusted life year (QALY)—an outcome measure that integrates both the duration and quality of life. QALYs provide a consistent benefit measure across different treatment options and allow decision-makers to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of novel medicines in different therapeutic areas. A key output from CEA is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER): the difference in costs between two competing interventions (usually the innovative technology being evaluated and the standard of care without that novel product) divided by the difference in outcomes—represented as cost per QALY. A number of HTA bodies have an implicit or explicit ICER threshold, whereby medicines that have an ICER below this are considered cost-effective and more likely to be reimbursed. When deemed not cost-effective based on HTA, medicines may be blocked by a country or else their entry to a market may be delayed; consider that while 85% of new medicines launched anywhere in the world between 2012 and 2021 were available in the USA, that figure was 61% in Germany, 59% in the UK, and 52% in France, and delays in access to medicines among European countries can be substantial, for example, averaging from an average of 100 days in Germany to 800 days in Poland.

Conclusions

Virtually, nothing about healthcare is affordable without private or public insurance. In countries like the USA, prices that some patients pay for treatments are set by their insurance plans. When an insured patient cannot afford a medicine that is medically or clinically appropriate for them, it may be because their insurance has rendered it unaffordable by charging excessive out-of-pocket costs. Affordability for these patients would be best solved by lowering out-of-pocket costs. In that case, society would be spreading the cost of medicines for patients across premiums paid by everyone. This is the case in many European countries where patients have to spend very little out of pocket on treatments their governments have decided merit coverage.

It is reasonable for society to want to be sure that it is getting value for its money. Just by (a) recognizing that most medicines will go generic, (b) can help not only the patient but also caregivers, (c) can restore productivity, and (d) offer system-wide scientific spillovers, we can appreciate that medicines can be worth more than traditional CEA would have us believe. Adding just a few of the commonly overlooked values of medicines to a CEA reveals that many countries have long been negotiating the prices of branded medicines not down to an upper limit of cost-effectiveness but well below their societal value. That only further underscores that the way to make cost-effective medicines affordable to US patients is through insurance reform that lowers out-of-pocket costs.

Central planners—inside and outside the USA—would be wise to subject more than just medicines to generalized, comprehensive CEA. Were they to do that, they would see that the rising cost of healthcare services means that managing the ravages of Alzheimer’s disease in hospitals and nursing homes for an increasing number of aging citizens represents a tsunami of cost and suffering, not just for patients but for caregivers and the taxpaying public. Then, just as many countries have realized the long-term benefits of investing more in clean energy by paying more for those technologies, they might recognize the benefits of investing in incentives for biomedical R&D to avert Alzheimer’s and other diseases, by paying more of what today’s medicines are worth. The larger the perceived market for cost-effective products, the more the private sector will strive to serve that market with more such cost-effective solutions, in the USA and globally.

### COVID-19 vaccines pricing policy options for low-income and middle-income countries [^fd036655]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Addressing high prices

Innovative products require low-income and middle-income country governments to strike a delicate balance with their pricing policies—ensuring equitable, affordable and timely access to promising products, maximising value for money and securing the financial viability of their health systems. The challenge of striking that balance becomes even more acute in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic because of the urgency of the need, the supply scarcity and the lack of a strong evidence base to determine value, guide prioritisation and inform price negotiation. Typical pricing policies for innovative products such as external reference pricing will not work because of the lack of transparency and comparative, historic pricing data. Further, commonly used policies such as fostering competition, generic substitution and internal reference pricing do not apply to single-source products.

Priority setting

As more vaccines progress through the research and development (R&D) process and manufacturers ramp up production, countries are likely to face a choice of products varying in price, efficacy, safety and overall product profile. The rapid pace of development and the lack of historic safety, efficacy and pricing data make it difficult for governments to make informed procurement decisions to ensure affordable prices, value for money and population-wide coverage. The situation calls for transparent, consistent priority setting mechanisms—reviewing the evidence, measuring costs and benefits, determining the budget impact implications of different coverage arrangements—so governments can make evidence-based comparisons between vaccines, and between vaccines and other COVID-19 interventions. Having clear priority setting mechanisms will help governments make transparent and consistent decisions about who gets vaccinated when and how for the immediate emergency response and serve as the basis for refining prioritisation and allocation decisions in the long term.

### The economics of drug discovery and the ultimate valuation of pharmacotherapies in the marketplace [^7b92dbb5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Although it is commonly believed that the innovation of new medicines is of paramount importance for improving the health and quality of life of patients, there is also a keen recognition regarding upward-spiraling costs of innovation, drug discovery, and drug development against a backdrop of dwindling successes in research and development (R&D) efforts. We propose a new model of valuation of pharmacotherapies that attempts to secure an adequate return on investment in innovation by ensuring optimal pricing and reimbursement.

### Radiology in the era of value-based healthcare: a multi-society expert statement from the ACR, CAR, ESR, IS3R, RANZCR, and RSNA [^100d0178]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Value equation

Relating technical quality, service quality and price has been defined as the radiology “value equation”. What constitutes value in healthcare depends upon who you ask. The University of Utah Health surveyed patients, physicians and employers who pay for medical benefits, in an effort to define how they perceive value. Each group prioritised different value statements, reflecting the different viewpoints of those who deliver a service, those who receive it and those who pay for it. This led the authors to propose a shift from the original Porter equation (Value = Outcome/Cost) to a more-nuanced one, identifying service as a specific component (Value = Quality + Service/Cost). Quality may incorporate elements such as employee productivity (for employers) that matter little to other groups. Service may include elements such as out-of-pocket expenses (for patients) that are not prime considerations for physicians or employers.

Value exists as a concept only in the eyes of the recipient. In economic terms, it can be considered as the total amount of money a customer would be willing to pay for a service. Value creation involves providing new services or improving existing services to increase their worth to the recipient, at little or no additional cost.

### Differential pricing of drugs: a role for cost-effectiveness analysis? [^b9834658]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Internationally, the high costs of pharmaceutical products limit access to treatment. The principle of differential pricing is that drug prices should vary according to some measure of affordability. How differential prices should be determined is, however, unclear. Here we describe a method whereby differential prices for essential drugs could be derived in countries of variable national wealth, and, using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors provide an example of how the process might work. Indicative prices for drugs can be derived by cost-effectiveness analysis that incorporates a measure of national wealth. Such prices could be used internationally as a basis of differential price negotiations.

### Establishing value in managed care: cost-effectiveness or budgetary impact? [^bb530515]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

In the managed care setting, pharmacy benefit managers face considerable challenges when making decisions regarding drug coverage. Although scientifically valid data may be available from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, this type of information does not shed light on potential differences between medications in the same class. Furthermore, properly designed, comparative trials are rarely conducted. Randomized naturalistic or pragmatic pharmacoeconomic studies can provide valuable information but are likewise infrequently performed. Economic modeling is an alternative but is not widely accepted because of the potential for bias. Retrospective analyses of information from patient surveys or existing databases are emerging as more popular methods of supporting informed formulary decisions. In the absence of a large-scale, prospective, naturalistic, pharmacoeconomic study, an alternative indication of product superiority can be derived from a continuum of different types of studies (from basic science to clinical trials to retrospective pharmacoeconomic analysis) conducted in a variety of patient care settings. The consistency with which a product demonstrates superiority across all types of studies is critical and is a crucial determinant of whether a health care provider would be likely to use the information for the purpose of decision making.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^ed0a5aeb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Intervention costs—given pricing complexity, high-quality economic evaluations “should incorporate an estimate of net price to the payer after discounts or rebates in their base-case analysis,” ideally reflecting “the net price to the payer or payers for the entire or majority of the treatment-eligible population being evaluated, rather than a specific subpopulation.”

### A stepwise replicable approach to negotiating value-driven supply chain contracts for orthobiologics [^4c81e9be]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

The key dangers of a competitive bidding system solely focused on pricing are the loss of value and critical clinician input. Value and quality must be weighted alongside pricing when considering vendor bids. The cheapest option may not be the most cost-effective option because of vendor service or product quality issues. The need for discussions driven by institutional goals of optimizing value highlights the importance of clinician integration throughout the product acquisition RFP process. As observed in our study, focusing on high-quality purchases still resulted in lower average product pricing in most of the formulary categories without compromising quality.

International supply chains have faced disruption with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and health systems have had to adapt to these changes in many ways. In some cases, the vendors may have gained more leverage because of limitations of supplies. Our project was conducted in the severity of the pandemic and was able to meet or exceed our projections for increased value and cost reductions despite these circumstances.

Limitations of this study are several. First, this is a single, large health system with notable leverage in vendor negotiations. A group purchasing organization that negotiates deals on behalf of several institutions may realize equal or greater cost savings. A smaller institution may have more difficulty negotiating for some products. Despite this, we have observed many smaller health systems successfully negotiate high-value contracts. Second, market pricing data were generated from an index of market databases and may not reflect true national pricing benchmarks. Third, market-level pricing information may not be available for all products, especially those that are new or more rarely used. For these products, clinicians are encouraged to compare similar comparators based on published peer-reviewed data and choose products of higher clinical value. Fourth, although creating a competitive bidding process was effective for our institution in increasing savings and consolidating vendors, this strategy may not work for smaller institutions with greater efficiencies or fewer vendors. Fifth, this study does not take into account discounts negotiated between health systems and vendors. Asking for discounts can help health systems save beyond stated sticker prices. Sixth, vendor consolidation may result in risks such as in the event of supply chain disruptions, quality issues, recall events, or other disruption events in the market place. In addition to contingency plans to address these potential risks, tracking product usage and removing low-utilization products may streamline workflow, reduce complexity, and improve storage space challenges.

### Real-world nudging, pricing, and mobile physical activity coaching was insufficient to improve lifestyle behaviours and cardiometabolic health: the supreme nudge parallel cluster-randomised controlled supermarket trial [^128d7cf3]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Wearable devices or smartphones can provide context-specific cues to stimulate physical activity by prompting at decision-making moments, rendering them context-specific, yet not limited to a physical setting or place. The promotion of walking is a relevant target for preventing cardiometabolic diseases for individuals across SEP and age groups; it is free of cost to users and easily incorporated into daily activities. Existing mobile coaching strategies generally focus on the motivation to change physical activity and rarely consider the individual context. Providing context-specific coaching messages may enhance the context action relationship and promote walking habits.

Most previous real-world studies evaluated effects of nudging, pricing, and mobile coaching strategies separately, with mixed or small effects [,,,–]. Only two real-world studies evaluated effects of a combined nudging and pricing intervention, but these targeted only a single or combination of specific food groups and evaluated short-term effects (≤ 6 months) on supermarket-level sales. Information on long-term and real-world effects of nudging, pricing, and mobile coaching strategies on various lifestyle behaviours and health outcomes would provide a strong methodological underpinning on their effectiveness across populations.

Within the Supreme Nudge project, we evaluated the real-world effects of nudging and pricing strategies promoting healthy products and a mobile coaching app promoting walking on individual-level diet quality, purchasing behaviour, walking behaviour, cardiometabolic risk markers, customer satisfaction, and various psychosocial factors among Dutch adults after 6 to 12 months compared to no interventions. We hypothesised that nudging, pricing, and mobile physical activity coaching would improve healthier food purchasing and intake, daily step count, customer satisfaction, and cardiometabolic risk markers. Supermarket-level sales data were used to assess whether selective trial participation influenced our results, by exploring changes in supermarket sales trends in intervention supermarkets compared to control supermarkets.

### Marketing the gastrointestinal practice: strategic considerations [^1b439b83]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The health care marketplace is changing rapidly with increasing competition, changing reimbursement, and greater shifting of cost to patients making them more price sensitive. To be financially viable, the successful gastrointestinal practice must be more market responsive in its approach to planning, develop a unique advantage that will be of value to referral sources, and understand how customers evaluate alternative competing practices. This article focuses on these elements of practice success.

### A stepwise replicable approach to negotiating value-driven supply chain contracts for orthobiologics [^34106494]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that close partnership between physicians, supply chain managers, and vendors of orthobiologic products can yield notable cost reductions while improving value in key clinical areas. The success of our institution in obtaining best value pricing has three critical and replicable components.

First, surgeons at our institution were granted leadership roles in the management of start-to-finish supply chain procurement and purchasing. Clinician integration into supply chain management can help hospitals reduce inventory redundancies by focusing on high-quality purchases. With the goal of reducing complexity of items with comparative value, surgeons drove productive cost-savings conversations in their departments.

Second, we used data to set evidence-based pricing expectations for vendors. Transparency of categorical product pricing at the start of the RFP initiated productive negotiation with vendors. In contrast to the notion that a competitive bidding process might decrease the number of vendors or product categories offered, we retained most of our vendors from the previous year and all returning vendors were granted larger contracts with our institution. The reported decrease in the average price of all eight orthobiologic product categories reflects savings due to economies of scale that were shared with our institution.

### Real-world nudging, pricing, and mobile physical activity coaching was insufficient to improve lifestyle behaviours and cardiometabolic health: the supreme nudge parallel cluster-randomised controlled supermarket trial [^f7006c65]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiometabolic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Unhealthy diets and physical inactivity are key modifiable risk factors, which are strongly socioeconomically patterned. Individual-level interventions to improve lifestyle behaviours such as behavioural counselling are generally not sustainable beyond their duration. Such interventions rely heavily on individual resources like knowledge and motivation and inadequately reach vulnerable populations including those with a low socioeconomic position (SEP). Interventions that modify the environmental context surrounding lifestyle choices can enhance healthier lifestyle behaviours for all individuals exposed to this context and reduce cardiometabolic risk on a population level.

The supermarket is an important context to modulate food choices and is where about 80% of foods are purchased in the Netherlands. Yet, only 21% of products sold in Dutch supermarkets are recommended by the Dutch dietary guidelines. Nudging and pricing strategies may help customers choose more healthy products. Nudging—environmental changes that promote a certain choice, without removing the alternative choice—has been shown to increase healthier purchasing or sales, mainly in highly controlled experimental contexts, while mixed effects are observed in real-world contexts. Pricing strategies such as food taxes and subsidies are effective in stimulating healthier choices and are a recommended policy of the World Health Organization. However, impactful food pricing policies are politically difficult to implement and therefore potentially not sufficient to achieve a large-scale impact on health. Implementing various types of nudging and pricing strategies simultaneously across food groups are probably needed to substantially improve dietary patterns.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^b99cc5e7]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Improving strategies for selection and coverage

Buyers have developed several tools to ensure that a new single source medicine reaches appropriate patients. Budget and systems planning can ensure that price negotiations begin with an accurate forecast of the need for, and potential benefit of, a new medicine within a population. Many clinical benefits of a new medicine are common across countries, although their manner of use may need to be adapted to national situations. Thus, strategies for selection and coverage are an area ripe for improvement through additional collaboration and transparency.

Many health systems use horizon scanning for early awareness of medicines that could enter a market. In this way, buyers gain sufficient lead time to analyse the potential effect of a new medicine on the health system and develop strategies to cope with its introduction.Medicines can be prioritised for further review based on criteria such as potential health benefit, potential to trigger system changes, and unit cost or effect on the budget.Horizon scanning is administratively burdensome, but information gathering can be a collaborative effort. For example, nine European countries to date are collaborating in establishing the International Horizon Scanning Initiative.

The World Health Organization recommends that countries use health technology assessment as a tool to support decision making about reimbursement, price setting, and negotiation. The assessment is a multidisciplinary process that uses explicit and scientifically robust methods to weigh up the value of using a health technology, such as at launch, when additional real world evidence about its use is available, and once competitor products reach the market. However, health technology assessment requires significant resources, including staff with training in health economics who can critically assess technical dossiers. Countries looking to introduce such assessment should take a stepwise approach to developing legislative and technical capacity to take full advantage of it in pharmaceutical price setting and reimbursement. National academic institutions can help in developing capacity and can serve as external reviewers and train health technology assessors.

Buyers can extract larger discounts from manufacturers by threatening to offer only limited coverage for a medicine, or to leave it out of a benefit package, national list, or formulary. Without an agreement there is no market. In the US, both the Veterans Health Administration and the Department of Defense negotiate lower prices directly with manufacturers, using formularies to manage which medicines they cover.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^c0c00fbf]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The use and consequences of limited economic evaluation of new medicines

A somewhat speculative argument can be made that the widespread application of standard CEA has an economic effect and a subtle political effect with potentially large unintended adverse consequences. First, it may be that R&D spending on the development of new medicines is distorted by suppressed incentives due to certain payors not considering the full societal benefits of medicines. Essentially, because some developed countries are using CEA as a bargaining tool to secure lower prices that are actually below what their citizens would be able and willing to pay, they are both free riders on the global R&D investment and possibly causing some innovation to go unfunded. The political effect is that these underestimations of value based on conventional CEA and lower prices outside the USA have been used to argue that Americans are paying more than they should truly be willing to pay. As a result, we would argue, the new US Inflation Reduction Act has been passed as a toe in the price-control water, with an inadequate understanding of what full immersion will imply.

Countries that rely on central planning and traditional CEA as their justification for capping the prices may be using it as an excuse to pay less. What can be harmful about these countries using traditional CEA to justify their unwillingness to pay anywhere close to US prices (or else to limit their patients’ access, thereby cutting the revenues they contribute) is that these analyses may give the US public, policymakers, physicians, and payers the impression that medicines are not worth what the US is paying for them. Traditional CEA can thus give the impression that the US market-based system is broken and in need of a regulatory fix, namely price controls. But when viewed in terms of aggregate impact, a good case can be made that the US’s patent-based, market-based competitive framework is working reasonably well, despite an imperfect national insurance system, to bring about affordable biomedical innovation that benefits not only US citizens, but everyone worldwide. Should US policymakers impose price controls on novel medicines in a misguided effort to spare US payers from overpaying, they would be undermining innovation that would be cost-effective for the US and beneficial globally.

### Causal loop diagramming the dynamics that shape food environments in Dutch supermarkets [^9e43a115]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Because of the aforementioned friction, product innovation generally prioritises one approach over others. Loop S2R2 (Fig. 4 B) describes how, based on market research, retailers and producers estimate which product qualities will most likely incite consumer interest, and this informs which innovation approach is prioritised. If the chosen approach raises interest in the product, the perception that this approach is effective is reinforced, making it more likely to be used in the future. Alternatively, if the product does not become (more) popular, this incentivises the use of other approaches in the future.

This prioritisation is highly dependent on how consumers value different product qualities (S2D6; Fig. 4 B). Our participants perceived cost, taste, convenience, novelty, and healthiness to be the main qualities of importance. Out of these, cost was agreed to be the most important, followed by taste. This contrasted heavily with the growing societal interest in health that many participants perceived, which retailers and producers described as a ‘citizen-consumer paradox’: society can consider something important, but in their role of consumer most individuals tend to make different choices.

Another factor in innovation prioritisation is the image of a product (S2R3 and S2R4; Fig. 4 B). Consumers usually perceive products in a certain role, which changes what they value about them. As such, for products perceived as tasty, the priority is to innovate upon taste, while for products perceived as healthy, the priority is to innovate upon healthiness.

Despite its commercial disadvantages, health-focussed innovation can be valuable, by boosting public image (S2B5; Fig. 4 A). Supermarket rankings in the media often include how ‘healthy’ the product offer is. Ranking high, by offering healthy products, can boost the public image of a retailer and thus attract more customers. Similarly, healthy products can reflect positively on their associated brand and thus attract more consumers to buy products from that brand. In both cases, this indirectly adds commercial value and reduces the need to innovate or reduce availability. Retailers and producers also indicated that a positive public image helps attract motivated employees, which adds on to the value of products that boost this image.

### The global snakebite crisis – a public health issue misunderstood, not neglected [^c8a7809b]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The global problem of venomous snakebite continues to attract attention despite it being described as a "neglected" issue. The current focus of the World Health Organization (WHO) remains anti-snake venom quality, although "availability and sustainability" of supply are consistently described as the key issues. Sustainability of antivenom supply has been elusive, with cost and pricing in developing countries being cited as the major reasons. The current WHO approach fails to explore the cost issue, but rather focuses on quality improvements, which may well adversely affect the costs of a product already perceived to be 'unaffordable.' The reference to cost and price indicates a marketing-based perspective may well give more relevant solutions to the snakebite crisis. This paper introduces a marketing model to examine global snakebite and to identify if the current approach is relevant and effective. The "4 Ps" model examines if the correct products are available, whether sufficient information exists concerning estimated market size, whether the assumptions frequently made about the costs of the product are correct and fully understood, if the product is promoted properly, and whether the method by which the product reaches the end user is optimum. The resulting analysis demonstrates that the current approach is characterized by a misunderstanding of the nature of the global snakebite problem. Further, a lack of implementation of key solutions, such as training doctors in developing countries with relevant protocols, has inevitably led to a lack of improvement in the snakebite arena over the last 30 years.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1b0a2530]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Appropriate scope and caveats for cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs): The intention of CEAs is not to directly influence patient-level decision-making; instead, systematically applying CEAs at the health system level can promote efficient resource use and improve population health outcomes and would ideally be performed across the entire set of options rather than evaluating each intervention in a silo. CEAs can inform the prices of new health technologies entering the market, improving the affordability of and access to novel diagnostic and treatment strategies. Resource allocation is a complex process that, beyond efficiency, depends on political priorities, scalability and affordability of the proposed intervention, and its impact on health equity; this is particularly important in cardiovascular disease given that 1 in 3 US adults received care for a cardiovascular risk factor or condition in 2020. To improve health care efficiency, CEAs have to be updated over the intervention’s life cycle and policymakers have to be willing to defund less-efficient programs; adding programs that are “cost-effective” without removing those that are no longer cost-effective continues to drive up health care spending without optimizing efficiency. This statement uses the term CEA for analytic frameworks with effectiveness outcomes that reflect patient or community preferences over health states (eg, quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]).

### Causal loop diagramming the dynamics that shape food environments in Dutch supermarkets [^5c6268fc]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

S2B1 (Fig. 4 A) describes the first innovation approach, which is to improve the taste of a product to increase its attraction. This often amplifies the unhealthy aspects of the product (e.g. sugar or salt content) as such ingredients are highly palatable. Improved taste is perceived as valuable by consumers and thus incites their interest. In turn, this increases sales and the commercial value of the product, which reduces further pressure for innovation.

S2B2 (Fig. 4 A) describes the second approach, aimed at reducing production, supply, and retail costs. This is done by adding preservatives or replacing ingredients with cheaper versions, which often amplifies the unhealthy aspects of the product. This reduces costs for producers and retailers, giving space for greater profit margins, or lower retail prices, which producers and retailers indicated as the most important driver of consumer interest and sales. As a result of this benefit to margins and/or sales, the increased commercial value reduces further pressure for innovation.

S2B3 (Fig. 4 A) describes the third approach, aimed at improving product healthiness. This is done by improving healthy aspects (e.g. adding fibres) or reducing unhealthy ones (e.g. reducing salt), until a certain goal is met, often based on legal standards for health-related statements or logos (e.g. ‘low in sugar’, or a healthy-choice logo). This enables the product to be presented as ‘healthy’ to consumers (which does not guarantee it being healthy). Such products are more likely to incite consumer interest. This raises sales and the increased commercial value reduces further pressure for innovation. Notably, producers and retailers perceived taste and price to be more important to most consumers, and therefore more effective approaches in many cases. Furthermore, health improvement has diminishing returns (S2B4; Fig. 4 A): when a cutoff point for a health-related statements or logo is, reaching the next level is often far away, or there is none. This disincentivises further innovation in this direction.

### Supermarket interventions to improve dietary and lifestyle behaviours: what is the key to success? [^9cf9f327]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is an urgent need to tackle poor diets and lack of physical activity, both of which are major contributors to the burden of non-communicable disease globally. Over the past few decades, interest has been shifting from individual-level to environmental-level interventions to help change and sustain behaviour and improve health outcomes. Supermarket environments have gained particular attention, given that in many countries across the world, grocery expenditure contributes a high percentage of the total food consumption, constituting an ideal setting to shape food choice.

Previous studies conducted in real-world supermarkets have identified strategies showing various levels of success to support dietary change. The strongest evidence of effect has been reported for economic interventions, namely pricing and promotional strategies that alter the price of a product through discounts or multi-buy offers among others. Other examples of so-called nudging interventions, such as positioning of products in prominent aisles or high-traffic areas ; and availability interventions altering the amount or proportion of a product on sale have also shown some evidence of effectiveness. Strategies solely based on educating customers through signage, flyers or shelf tags have not shown very significant benefits. Collectively, evidence shows that the impact of single interventions is usually small, mostly focused on increasing sales of healthier foods for short-term periods and rarely applicable to broader food categories, particularly those concerning health the most.

### Nicotine reduction as an increase in the unit price of cigarettes: a behavioral economics approach [^19d452c9]. Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Urgent action is needed to reduce the harm caused by smoking. Product standards that reduce the addictiveness of cigarettes are now possible both in the U.S. and in countries party to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Specifically, standards that required substantially reduced nicotine content in cigarettes could enable cessation in smokers and prevent future smoking among current non-smokers. Behavioral economics uses principles from the field of microeconomics to characterize how consumption of a reinforcer changes as a function of the unit price of that reinforcer (unit price=cost/reinforcer magnitude). A nicotine reduction policy might be considered an increase in the unit price of nicotine because smokers are paying more per unit of nicotine. This perspective allows principles from behavioral economics to be applied to nicotine reduction research questions, including how nicotine consumption, smoking behavior, use of other tobacco products, and use of other drugs of abuse are likely to be affected. This paper reviews the utility of this approach and evaluates the notion that a reduction in nicotine content is equivalent to a reduction in the reinforcement value of smoking-an assumption made by the unit price approach.

### How to implement new diagnostic products in low-resource settings: an end-to-end framework [^64128c6f]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

During this phase, the developer also prepares clinical and regulatory, manufacturing and marketing and sales plans to meet development and implementation milestones. The marketing and sales plan addresses the target countries or geographies in which the product will be rolled out; develops sales and distribution strategies, including customer-service options (eg, user training, external quality-assurance programmes, installation and maintenance of instrumentation, calibration and repair)and defines the overall marketing strategy including advocacy and stakeholder engagement plans.

Various factors influence how a product is brought to market, such as available funding, market size, probability of success, infrastructure, policy guidelines and willingness of countries to adopt the product; there is no one-size-fits-all sales and distribution strategy. Products might be sold directly to governments, global funders or procurers (eg, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, commonly referred to as the “Global Fund”) or to NGOs that manage a network of health facilities. In formulating the roll out, sales and distribution and marketing plans, it is particularly useful to develop partnerships with key opinion leaders and implementers in countries that might be early adopters of the product. A comprehensive community engagement plan covering communication strategies with global and national policy makers, procurers and funders can aid in better defining in-country implementation strategies, translating policy into practice and assuring financial support.

The initial intellectual property (IP) review can help identify third-party patent rights that might hinder commercialisation opportunities. Mitigation strategies might involve altering design requirements or looking into licensing agreement options.In certain cases for which the developer receives funding for development, funders might stipulate that this type of IP information, including the developer’s patent rights, are shared and managed by the funder. This ensures global access to the diagnostic product—broad accessibility of the product to target populations on appropriate price terms and in a timely manner. In such cases, developers might work together with a funder to define a global access plan in order to address factors such as IP, royalties and pricing structures that prevent access to products.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is one example of a funder that works closely with developers to create global access strategies.

### Towards ethical drug pricing: the European orphan genomic therapies fund [^7a0142e6]. Gene Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

The outcome-based system implemented by the HIF is an ethically defensible pricing mechanism as it increases distributive justice and addresses the dilemma between patient access and research incentives. The central concept is that healthcare providers and payers can purchase medicines from the fund at a very low price, allowing to provide immediate access to patients in need around the world: “The Health Impact Fund would give companies incentives to develop new products targeting the diseases and conditions for which existing systems have failed to produce results, which would especially benefit the poor”. Since the HIF would not specifically address orphan genomic therapies, we see the need to establish an European Orphan Genomic Therapies Fund (EOGTF), which could help to balance the need to support further research and development with the commitment to immediate and universal access at the European level. Because this approach separates the incentive for innovations from the pricing of access, it reconciles to some extent the competing approaches of cost-based and value-based pricing, while avoiding their risks and drawbacks: Access is based on R&D costs, while reward reflects the real-world value their product delivers, leading to transparency in the pricing process. The main strength of this model is that, firstly, it incentivises companies to bring only orphan genomic therapies with therapeutic efficacy to market. Secondly, payers can make noteworthy savings as the EOGTF only pays the incentive once the long-term benefits have been established in the individual patient, thus bypassing the costs and burden of traditional therapies. Moreover, the EOGTF would be particularly beneficial in terms of savings if the therapy provided by the manufacturer did not show the expected outcome, in contrast to cost-based pricing models. Thirdly, the significant administrative burden of measuring long-term outcomes falls entirely on one organisation, and companies no longer need to engage in lengthy negotiations with individual countries. In addition, the EOGFT is likely to have more influence than individual companies or countries on the implementation of a global perspective of distributive justice with regard to access to orphan genomic therapies. For LMICs, the issue of access is different, as they lack not only the financial and manufacturing capacity of high-income countries to produce orphan genomic therapies, but also the bargaining power to buy these drugs at affordable prices. If the commercialisation of orphan genomic therapies is successful at the European level, then it is to be expected that it will also improve access to these innovative medicines on a not-for-profit basis in LMICs.

### How to implement new diagnostic products in low-resource settings: an end-to-end framework [^dd99e0a3]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Table 2 
Key stakeholders involved in introducing diagnostic products to low-resource settings

Market research is conducted to better understand the projected growth, size and share of the market(s) in which the product will be sold, how the product will be distributed to the end user, customer needs and preferences and the product’s competitive advantage.These activities inform others, such as development of the marketing plan, user-requirements document and the business case. The business case provides evidence to justify the need for the new diagnostic product and why pursuing its development will be a viable business opportunity. Developers also prepare a financial model that provides details around the initial investment cost, projected sales, payback period and breakeven point and other investment performance considerations, such as whether the efforts of developers, are likely to yield an acceptable return on investment. Typically, the business case and financial model are updated throughout the development process as more information becomes available and the decision to continue with development is re-evaluated at the end of each development phase.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^92720bac]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Economic evaluation methods—cost identification, costing approach, inflation adjustment, and pricing guidance are specified as follows: Micro-costing is necessary to capture resource differences when average reimbursements would obscure them, whereas when the gross-costing approach is used, estimates should reflect actual amounts paid, including out-of-pocket costs. Hospital list prices (“charges”) should be adjusted using appropriate cost-to-charge ratios, and statistical analyses should account for positively skewed, heteroskedastic cost data. For sourcing cost inputs, use of Medicare reimbursement rates is reasonable for individuals who are 65 years or older, whereas commercial and Medicaid reimbursement rates are preferred for individuals younger than 65 years. When condition-related costs are easily identifiable and survival is unaffected, it is acceptable to only focus on costs related to the condition for estimating incremental health care costs; however, when costs cannot be clearly separated or survival differs between strategies, the preferred approach is to consider all health care costs, including those unrelated to the condition being evaluated. Health care cost inputs from older studies should be inflated using the Personal Health Care Expenditure deflator or the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index developed by the US Bureau for Economic Analysis, the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index is unsuitable for use in CEAs, and high-quality economic evaluations should incorporate an estimate of net price to the payer after discounts or rebates in the base-case analysis, ideally reflecting the net price for the entire or majority of the treatment-eligible population rather than a specific subpopulation.

### Managing costly new drugs to support equitable access: international collaboration and patient engagement to assess value, and managed entry agreements [^d634509c]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Reconsidering assessment and reimbursement

Standard value assessment frameworks that have been commonly used until now are proving inadequate for the evaluation and pricing of these new treatmentsbecause different stakeholders have different priorities: regulators focus on safety and efficacy, and health technology assessment bodies and payers emphasise cost effectiveness and the effect on budgets, leading to differing value assessments for the same product.

Patients advocate for using a wider perspective beyond traditional clinical endpoints when evaluating the value of novel therapies. They also support faster access to innovative therapies, facilitated by regulators through schemes such as accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency. However, payers and health technology assessment agencies may have to delay reimbursement when upfront costs are high and the real benefits are uncertain, especially long term value, as currently is the case for ATMPs.

The pharmaceutical industry aims for the best pricing to support and foster continued innovation.It has called for dynamic value based pricing to integrate the value of new drugs over their lifecycles as new evidence emerges, and to take into account lower prices that may occur after patent expiry.A recent Dutch study found that this approach of considering value over a drug’s lifecycle including after patent expiry can substantially improve cost effectiveness.However, the assumptions of this approach, especially the emergence of competition from generics to reduce costs, may not hold true. The industry also advocates for wider perspectives to be considered beyond traditional cost effectiveness, but it can experience challenges at reimbursement from payers and health technology assessment agencies for not providing enough robust evidence of good value for money for the population these agencies serve.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^293544d0]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

AHA/ACC 2025 cost/value methodology—coupling performance measures with economic value explains that the current approach to guideline development is that the class of recommendation for the clinical recommendation is based on the strength of the clinical evidence and does not consider the economic value of the intervention, whereas the economic value statement explicitly considers incremental cost-effectiveness; it proposes that guideline writing committees continue this practice for now, but notes it is plausible that in the future economic value assessments may inform class of recommendation, with the Class 1 designation reserved for interventions that have strong clinical evidence of health benefit and are also cost-effective at the accepted threshold; alternatively, when procedures or interventions receive a Class 2 recommendation (ie, probably recommended and may be appropriate for some patients), the economic value assessment may help determine whether an intervention receives a Class 2A designation (moderate benefit and meets the cost-effectiveness threshold) versus a Class 2B designation (benefit only marginally exceeds risk or does not meet the cost-effectiveness threshold); this approach would provide an incentive for stakeholders to price interventions according to the value they generate for patients and society.

### Increasing the adOption And diffusion of a novel pharmacological therapy that is both mortality reducing and cost-effective [^cec42f56]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

One important aspect of pharmacologic pricing mechanisms in the United States is that the value of a drug, defined by the benefit derived from the prescription medication compared with the cost of that medication, is not necessarily considered. Value‐based drug pricing, a mechanism traditionally used by single‐payer health systems, such as the United Kingdom's National Health Service, is a concept by which coverage of a new drug is determined by whether its price aligns with the incremental therapeutic value it provides, as measured by quality‐adjusted life years. This type of model is more challenging in a system that has multiple healthcare payers, as prescription drugs are purchased by multiple buyers (ie, health insurers). 21 However, New York's state Medicaid program has started to use this concept in determining a fair price to use in negotiations with drug makers. 22 Furthermore, CVS Health recently announced that it had launched a new insurance design in which certain drugs would not be covered if, after price negotiation, their cost‐effectiveness did not meet a reasonable standard. 23 Even some drug manufacturers have embraced this model in select cases, as these value‐based negotiations often result in improved patient access and, therefore, the ability to recoup losses of lower prices with increased volume of specialty drug sold. 24

A key advantage of value‐based pricing is that it could establish evidence‐based consensus between insurers and manufacturer on a benchmark for the relationship between incremental benefit and cost, potentially improving patient access. Although hospital‐level factors, including region and for‐profit status, were also associated with ARNI prescription rates, many characteristics of hospitals examined by the authors in the analysis by Luo et al 19 were not associated. As such, these unmeasured characteristics of hospitals, variation we do not yet understand, may influence likelihood of receiving ARNI.

Given the complexities of drug pricing in the United States, variation in state‐level insurance policies as well as hospital infrastructure and physician culture around prior authorizations should be investigated in future research. Historically, drug companies have set prices and insurance companies have determined how to respond with prior authorizations. Providers may vary in terms of their resources and determination to respond to prior authorizations, and patients may vary in terms of their ability to advocate for themselves or afford large copayments.

### Pharmaceutical policies: effects of reference pricing, other pricing, and purchasing policies [^ba2804ef]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmaceuticals are important interventions that could improve people's health. Pharmaceutical pricing and purchasing policies are used as cost-containment measures to determine or affect the prices that are paid for drugs. Internal reference pricing establishes a benchmark or reference price within a country which is the maximum level of reimbursement for a group of drugs. Other policies include price controls, maximum prices, index pricing, price negotiations and volume-based pricing.

Objectives

To determine the effects of pharmaceutical pricing and purchasing policies on health outcomes, healthcare utilisation, drug expenditures and drug use.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), part of The Cochrane Library (including the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Register) (searched 22/10/2012); MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and MEDLINE, Ovid (searched 22/10/2012); EconLit, ProQuest (searched 22/10/2012); PAIS International, ProQuest (searched 22/10/2012); World Wide Political Science Abstracts, ProQuest (searched 22/10/2012); INRUD Bibliography (searched 22/10/2012); Embase, Ovid (searched 14/12/2010); NHSEED, part of The Cochrane Library (searched 08/12/2010); LILACS, VHL (searched 14/12/2010); International Political Science Abstracts (IPSA), Ebsco (searched (17/12/2010); OpenSIGLE (searched 21/12/10); WHOLIS, WHO (searched 17/12/2010); World Bank (Documents and Reports) (searched 21/12/2010); Jolis (searched 09/10/2011); Global Jolis (searched 09/10/2011) ; OECD (searched 30/08/2005); OECD iLibrary (searched 30/08/2005); World Bank eLibrary (searched 21/12/2010); WHO - The Essential Drugs and Medicines web site (browsed 21/12/2010).

Selection Criteria

Policies in this review were defined as laws; rules; financial and administrative orders made by governments, non-government organisations or private insurers. To be included a study had to include an objective measure of at least one of the following outcomes: drug use, healthcare utilisation and health outcomes or costs (expenditures); the study had to be a randomised trial, non-randomised trial, interrupted time series (ITS), repeated measures (RM) study or a controlled before-after study of a pharmaceutical pricing or purchasing policy for a large jurisdiction or system of care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Results were summarised in tables. There were too few comparisons with similar outcomes across studies to allow for meta-analysis or meaningful exploration of heterogeneity.

Main Results

We included 18 studies (seven identified in the update): 17 of reference pricing, one of which also assessed maximum prices, and one of index pricing. None of the studies were trials. All included studies used ITS or RM analyses. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. Three reference pricing studies reported cumulative drug expenditures at one year after the transition period. Two studies reported the median relative insurer's cumulative expenditures, on both reference drugs and cost share drugs, of -18%, ranging from -36% to 3%. The third study reported relative insurer's cumulative expenditures on total market of -1.5%. Four reference pricing studies reported median relative insurer's expenditures on both reference drugs and cost share drugs of -10%, ranging from -53% to 4% at one year after the transition period. Four reference pricing studies reported a median relative change of 15% in reference drugs prescriptions at one year (range -14% to 166%). Three reference pricing studies reported a median relative change of -39% in cost share drugs prescriptions at one year (range -87% to -17%). One study of index pricing reported a relative change of 55% (95% CI 11% to 98%) in the use of generic drugs and -43% relative change (95% CI -67% to -18%) in brand drugs at six months after the transition period. The same study reported a price change of -5.3% and -1.1% for generic and brand drugs respectively six months after the start of the policy. One study of maximum prices reported a relative change in monthly sales volume of all statins of 21% (95% CI 19% to 24%) after one year of the introduction of this policy. Four studies reported effects on mortality and healthcare utilisation, however they were excluded because of study design limitations.

Authors' Conclusions

The majority of the studies of pricing and purchasing policies that met our inclusion criteria evaluated reference pricing. We found that internal reference pricing may reduce expenditures in the short term by shifting drug use from cost share drugs to reference drugs. Reference pricing may reduce related expenditures with effects on reference drugs but the effect on expenditures of cost share drugs is uncertain. Reference pricing may increase the use of reference drugs and may reduce the use of cost share drugs. The analysis and reporting of the effects on patients' drug expenditures were limited in the included studies and administration costs were not reported. Reference pricing effects on health are uncertain due to lack of evidence. The effects of other purchasing and pricing policies are until now uncertain due to sparse evidence. However, index pricing may reduce the use of brand drugs, increase the use of generic drugs, and may also slightly reduce the price of the generic drug when compared with no intervention.

### ACC / AHA statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines and performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures and task force on practice guidelines [^5057d50c]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Arguments in favor of incorporating resource and value considerations state that economic evaluations, including cost-effectiveness analyses, can help decision makers appreciate the implications of choices and clarify factors influencing relative benefits, and that economic analyses can guide those making coverage decisions and inform developers of practice guidelines to ensure that recommendations yield the greatest value from available healthcare resources. The document notes that currently algorithms for diagnosis or management of disease states, including appropriate use of clinical interventions, typically consider a broad spectrum of differential diagnoses and patient care approaches, which essentially assume that resources are unlimited, and emphasizes that the principal consideration is not cost awareness but a comprehensive, informed, and evidence-based approach in which incentives are balanced by the need to consume resources more wisely.

### Ethical perspectives on costly drugs and health care: AAN position statement [^63cad860]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

AAN position statement—policy options to reduce drug costs include actions on generics, biosimilars, and pricing/contracting approaches. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved or tentatively approved 1,021 generic drugs in 2018; from 2008 to 2018, 64% of drugs approved benefited from programs to expedite approval by the FDA, yet 550 off-patent drugs remain without a generic. Proposals include government manufacture of generics in specific “market failure” situations such as when only 1 or 2 companies are manufacturing a generic, and hospital systems founded CivicaRx in 2018 to facilitate production of generic drugs to combat shortages. Biologic drugs only represented 2% of US prescriptions but accounted for 37% of net drug spending in 2017. Allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices is discussed, with budget reconciliation plans advanced by Congress in fall 2021 that may ultimately allow such negotiations; other ideas include value-based pricing and outcome-based contracts in which payments are conditional on whether the drug achieves its purported outcomes. In 2019, Louisiana embarked on a “Netflix” style subscription model for hepatitis C treatment for its Medicaid population, with the state agreeing to pay a subscription fee in exchange for as much drug as it needs, which allows the state to predict costs while the manufacturer receives a guaranteed income stream and market exclusivity within the state.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^1e954da5]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Improving strategies for price benchmarking

An important factor in determining a fair price for a medicine is the price a buyer is willing to pay for a given clinical benefit. Buyers have used several different methods to benchmark medicine prices and facilitate purchasing. None of these strategies alone will achieve lower prices, but the recent drive for additional transparency and collaboration has made buyers more active purchasers in determining what is fair in their goal of achieving access for their populations.

Setting a benchmark using price information from other countries, with similar socioeconomic status, is one method that buyers have used to control costs—known as external reference pricing. This method generally uses a declared list price that can differ substantially from the actual price paid, given confidential discounts and rebates.The widespread use of external reference pricing, particularly in Europe,has been criticised because of its reliance on list price. The interconnected web of countries referencing each other’s prices has potentially affected launch sequencing across countries, thereby directly affecting patient access.

### Pharmaceutical policies: effects of reference pricing, other pricing, and purchasing policies [^8a034807]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmaceuticals can be important for people's health. At the same time drugs are major components of health care costs. Pharmaceutical pricing and purchasing policies are used to determine or affect the prices that are paid for drugs. Examples are price controls, maximum prices, price negotiations, reference pricing, index pricing and volume-based pricing policies. The essence of reference pricing is to establish a maximum level of reimbursement for a group of drugs assumed to be therapeutically equivalent.

Objectives

To determine the effects of pharmaceutical pricing and purchasing policies on drug use, healthcare utilisation, health outcomes and costs (expenditures).

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases and web sites: Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Register (date of last search: 22/08/03), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (15/10/03), MEDLINE (07/09/05), EMBASE (07/09/05), ISI Web of Science (08/09/05), CSA Worldwide Political Science Abstracts (21/10/03), EconLit (23/10/03), SIGLE (12/11/03), INRUD (21/11/03), PAIS International (23/03/04), International Political Science Abstracts (09/01/04), NHS EED (20/02/04), PubMed (25/02/04), NTIS (03/03/04), IPA (22/04/04), OECD Publications & Documents (30/08/05), SourceOECD (30/08/05), World Bank Documents & Reports (30/08/05), World Bank e-Library (04/05/05), JOLIS (22/08/05), Global Jolis (22/08/05 and 23/08/05), WHOLIS (29/08/05).

Selection Criteria

Policies in this review were defined as laws, rules, financial and administrative orders made by governments, non-government organisations or private insurers. To be included a study had to include an objective measure of at least one of the following outcomes: drug use, healthcare utilisation, health outcomes, and costs (expenditures); the study must be a randomised controlled trial, non-randomised controlled trial, interrupted time series analysis, repeated measures study or controlled before-after study of a pharmaceutical pricing or purchasing policy for a large jurisdiction or system of care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study limitations. Quantitative analysis of time series data, for studies with sufficient data, and qualitative analyses were undertaken.

Main Results

We included 10 studies of reference pricing and one study of index pricing. Most of the reference pricing studies were for senior citizens in British Columbia, Canada. The use (dispensing) of reference drugs increased in five studies, between 60% and 196% immediately after introduction of reference drug pricing, whereas the use of cost sharing drugs decreased by between 19% and 42% in four studies. In three studies the reference drug group expenditures decreased (range 19% - 50%), whereas in the fourth study the expenditures increased by 5% in the short term. The results after six months of reference pricing do not show any clear pattern in relationship to the immediate effects. We found no evidence of adverse effects on health and no clear evidence of increased health care utilisation. For index pricing the evidence was much more limited than for reference drug pricing. A small reduction in drug prices was found.

Authors' Conclusions

We found relatively few studies of pricing policies. The majority of the studies dealt with reference pricing. They had few methodological limitations. Based on the evidence in this review, mostly from senior citizens in British Columbia, Canada, reference drug pricing can reduce third party drug expenditures by inducing a shift in drug use towards less expensive drugs. We found no evidence of adverse effects on health and no clear evidence of increased health care utilisation. The analysis and reporting of the effects on patient drug expenditures were limited in the included studies and administration costs were not reported.

### Improving the affordability of prescription medications for people with chronic respiratory disease. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^6b17b30c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

International approaches to pharmaceutical pricing and access—The World Health Organization released evidence-based guidelines to assist national policy makers and other stakeholders to manage pharmaceutical prices, with recommendations including greater regulation of mark-ups, tax exemptions for pharmaceutical products, use of external reference pricing, promotion of generic medicines, and greater use of health technology assessments; these recommendations are widely used by high-income countries, but not the United States. European Union countries have focused on containing pharmaceutical expenditures and ensuring affordable access to medicines, with a common approach of external reference pricing by setting prices on the basis of comparison prices in other member nations, often adopting the lowest price; Canada has also adopted reference pricing using EU member nations as common comparators. Many countries with universal health care and/or multipayer systems have national organizations responsible for conducting health technology assessments to support reimbursement decisions and price setting, including Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, whereas in the United States similar efforts by nongovernmental organizations are isolated and underfunded, and their work is not widely used in practice.

### Funding of drugs: do vaccines warrant a different approach? [^85012e82]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

Vaccines have features that require special consideration when assessing their cost-effectiveness. These features are related to herd immunity, quality-of-life losses in young children, parental care and work loss, time preference, uncertainty, eradication, macroeconomics, and tiered pricing. Advisory committees on public funding for vaccines, or for pharmaceuticals in general, should be knowledgable about these special features. We discuss key issues and difficulties in decision making for vaccines against rotavirus, human papillomavirus, varicella-zoster virus, influenza virus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. We argue that guidelines for economic evaluation should be reconsidered generally to recommend (1) modelling options for the assessment of interventions against infectious diseases; (2) a wider perspective to account for impacts on third parties, if relevant; (3) a wider scope of costs than health-care system costs alone, if appropriate; and (4) alternative discounting techniques to explore social time preference over long periods.

### Performing cost-effectiveness analyses to support policy making: key lessons from the assessment of aducanumab [^fc6072d9]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this article is to describe the process and the methods of cost-effectiveness analysis for clinicians interested in joining or leading aspects of this branch of evidence-based research. Cost-effectiveness is a useful tool for policymakers and is considered a starting point for discussions of fair pricing. Clinicians are important members of teams conducting cost-effectiveness analyses, particularly as it relates to integrating their clinical expertise into the decisions around the design and conduct of the analysis. Their input is essential in assuring that models adequately reflect clinical practice and are informed by expert judgments of how existing data can best be interpreted to build a comprehensive analysis of the clinical and economic outcomes of different treatment options. We illustrate specific contributions that clinicians are well positioned to make in these teams using a recent cost-effectiveness analysis of aducanumab that was conducted to support fair drug pricing. While discussing these contributions, we explain key components of a cost-effectiveness analysis, such as time horizon, health states, and perspective, to support understanding of the methods of cost-effectiveness by the clinical researchers and to promote a common dialogue among these multidisciplinary teams.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^c6453a24]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Device cost inputs in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs)—methodological guidance emphasizes transparency, pricing sources, sensitivity analyses, and handling price opacity. High-quality CEAs should be transparent about the source of effectiveness and safety parameters (and, if substantial changes have occurred over time, the version of the device that these inputs refer to), and they should also evaluate how sensitive their conclusions are to uncertainty in these parameters. Because device prices can vary widely across health systems, CEAs should use the price net of discounts where available or the list prices when the net price is not available, and device costs should be varied widely in 1-way sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect on the ICER. In situations where device costs are truly opaque, the economic value statement should report the threshold prices at which the device would be expected to be cost-effective. The costs of drugs or devices can also change substantially over time, baseline risk may change over time, and collectively these changes can markedly alter the economic value of an intervention.

### Planning post-launch evidence generation: lessons from France, england and Spain [^4947170e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Technological developments in medicines in areas of high unmet need have led to increased use of expedited regulatory pathways that bring medicines to market faster.This creates challenges for health technology assessment (HTA) bodies who must determine the added value of these new medicines while many uncertainties remain about their short or long‐term consequences and optimal use outside the controlled setting of a clinical trial. This can affect the price that Payers are willing to pay or level of reimbursement. To address these issues there is a push towards the development of evidence over a product's lifecycle, providing patient access for a limited period, or at a reduced price, subject to data collection for a specific group of patients to resolve uncertainties that are key to HTA/Payers.This approach to accumulating additional evidence based on conditional reimbursement is referred to by the umbrella term Post‐Launch Evidence Generation (PLEG).Nationally systems may refer to such arrangements by different terms, including Outcomes/Performance Based Managed Entry Agreements,,Managed Access Agreements, (Monitoring) Registries,or Post‐Registration Studies. These evidence generation processes are usually led by the health system and thus differ substantially in construct, use of data sources, responsibilities of stakeholders, and use in subsequent Payer decision making. One common concern among HTA bodies is whether these PLEG processes produce sufficiently robust evidence that can be used to inform reassessments and price negotiations without placing an undue burden on stakeholders.

To generate cross‐country learnings of PLEG systems, RWE4Decisions, which is a multistakeholder learning network,hosted a series of roundtables about operationalizing PLEG for highly innovative medicines in Europe and Canada. Previous roundtables considered the potential of using outcomes‐based agreements to collect real‐world evidence and inform pricing and reimbursement decisions and the possibility of aligning evidence requirements for HTA bodies and payers in the post‐launch setting.The 2021 report resulted in recommendations that emphasized the importance of planning PLEG well in advance of the pricing and reimbursement process, with iterative multistakeholder dialogues to discuss the uncertainties in clinical effectiveness that are likely, and do, emerge during clinical development. This facilitates agreement on the uncertainties that are “decision relevant” for HTA/Payers and on what evidence can be generated to fill those gaps, either by continuation of, or initiation of new clinical studies, or by collection of real‐world data (RWD).

### Information on cost-effectiveness: an essential product of a national comparative effectiveness program [^bd38695c]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians recently highlighted the need to provide increased information comparing the effectiveness of health care interventions to ensure the rational and effective practice of medicine. Comparative effectiveness refers to the evaluation of the relative clinical effectiveness, safety, and cost of 2 or more medical services, drugs, devices, therapies, or procedures used to treat the same condition. The College further recommended the establishment of an adequately funded, trusted national entity that should prioritize, sponsor, or produce both comparative clinical and cost-effectiveness data. This article addresses the need for the proposed entity to develop cost-effectiveness information. It examines the current reluctance to develop and use cost-effectiveness in the United States; it argues for the importance of this information for all health care stakeholders; and it makes specific recommendations regarding how this information can best be made available and used for the good of the public and our patients.

### Pricing of tobacco products during, and after, the introduction of standardized packaging: an observational study of retail price data from independent and convenience (small) retailers in the United Kingdom [^fe16c36f]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Tobacco companies claimed that standardized packaging, phased in/introduced May 2016-May 2017, would reduce prices and increase consumption. We: (1) describe changes in price-per-cigarette and price-per-gram during, and after, the introduction of standardized packaging; (2) describe price changes by cigarette price segment; and (3) analyse price changes by stage of implementation.

Design

An observational study, using electronic point-of-sale data, monitored price trends in three periods: (1) May-September 2016, start of transition period; (2) October 2016-May 2017, when fully branded and standardized products were sold and duty escalators implemented; and (3) June-October 2017, when standardized packaging was mandatory.

Setting

United Kingdom.

Participants

Small retailers (n = 500) stratified by region and deprivation. Data were monitored for 20 leading fully branded tobacco products [15 factory-made cigarettes (FMC), 5 roll-your-own (RYO)] and their standardized equivalents.

Measurement

Price-per-cigarette and price-per-gram, based on monthly average Recommended Retail Price (RRP) and actual sale price, adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Pricing Index (CPIH). Net changes (£GBP, %) were analysed by product type (FMC versus RYO) and FMC price segment (value, mid-price, premium).

Findings

Between May 2016 and October 2017, the average inflation-adjusted RRP/price-per-cigarette and price-per-gram increased for FMC (all price segments) and RYO. For example, sales price-per-cigarette increased +4.64%, with the largest increases for value (+6.81%), premium (+5.32%) and mid-price FMCs (+3.30%). Net sales price-per-cigarette and price-per-gram increases were largest in period 2, when fully branded and standardized products were sold and duty escalators were implemented (FMC = +4.70%; RYO = +3.75%). There were small decreases in sales price-per-cigarette and price-per-gram once standardized packaging became mandatory (FMC = -1.14%; RYO = -0.88%).

Conclusion

In the United Kingdom, the price of leading roll-your-own and factory-made cigarette brands sold by small retailers increased as standardized packaging was phased in, with increases larger than expected through duty escalation.

### The high cost of prescription drugs in the United States: origins and prospects for reform [^0c2e7e60]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The increasing cost of prescription drugs in the United States has become a source of concern for patients, prescribers, payers, and policy makers.

Objectives

To review the origins and effects of high drug prices in the US market and to consider policy options that could contain the cost of prescription drugs.

Evidence

We reviewed the peer-reviewed medical and health policy literature from January 2005 to July 2016 for articles addressing the sources of drug prices in the United States, the justifications and consequences of high prices, and possible solutions.

Findings

Per capita prescription drug spending in the United States exceeds that in all other countries, largely driven by brand-name drug prices that have been increasing in recent years at rates far beyond the consumer price index. In 2013, per capita spending on prescription drugs was $858 compared with an average of $400 for 19 other industrialized nations. In the United States, prescription medications now comprise an estimated 17% of overall personal health care services. The most important factor that allows manufacturers to set high drug prices is market exclusivity, protected by monopoly rights awarded upon Food and Drug Administration approval and by patents. The availability of generic drugs after this exclusivity period is the main means of reducing prices in the United States, but access to them may be delayed by numerous business and legal strategies. The primary counterweight against excessive pricing during market exclusivity is the negotiating power of the payer, which is currently constrained by several factors, including the requirement that most government drug payment plans cover nearly all products. Another key contributor to drug spending is physician prescribing choices when comparable alternatives are available at different costs. Although prices are often justified by the high cost of drug development, there is no evidence of an association between research and development costs and prices; rather, prescription drugs are priced in the United States primarily on the basis of what the market will bear.

Conclusions and Relevance

High drug prices are the result of the approach the United States has taken to granting government-protected monopolies to drug manufacturers, combined with coverage requirements imposed on government-funded drug benefits. The most realistic short-term strategies to address high prices include enforcing more stringent requirements for the award and extension of exclusivity rights; enhancing competition by ensuring timely generic drug availability; providing greater opportunities for meaningful price negotiation by governmental payers; generating more evidence about comparative cost-effectiveness of therapeutic alternatives; and more effectively educating patients, prescribers, payers, and policy makers about these choices.

### Improving the affordability of prescription medications for people with chronic respiratory disease. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^5158b00d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society policy priorities for pharmaceutical policy reform to support affordability and access outline actions across formularies, generics, pricing, value assessment, and research. Key priorities include: expand flexibility of formulary design to mitigate cost burdens to patients; ensure essential respiratory medicines with established clinical benefit are available in Tier 1 formularies; reduce barriers to timely generic drug availability and foster competition; promote expeditious market entry of international providers of generic and novel medicines; establish uniform and meaningful negotiation with producers and suppliers and establish price transparency of financial flows through the pharmaceutical supply chain. Additional priorities include establishing a cost-effectiveness research agenda and action plan with a uniform pharmaceutical value framework; expanding value-based pricing and benefit design, including demonstration projects to test alternative payment models on outcomes and costs; incentivizing development of truly new medicines; ensuring that financial incentives for rare diseases are not extended to widely sold drugs; expanding stock albuterol programs in schools within all 50 states; establishing infrastructure for ongoing examination of patient affordability and availability and access to assistance programs; defining and routinely examining a list of essential medicines; establishing policies to reduce academic detailing, lobbying, direct-to-consumer drug advertising, and anticompetitive deals; comparing expenses and processes of early-stage drug development research between NIH, small industry, and large pharmaceutical manufacturers; and modifying requirements for the award and extension of exclusivity rights.

### Incorporating considerations of cost-effectiveness, affordability, and resource implications in guideline development: article 6 in integrating and coordinating efforts in COPD guideline development. An official ATS / ERS workshop report [^944b8eee]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Professional societies, like many other organizations around the world, have recognized the need to use rigorous processes to ensure that health care recommendations are based on the best available research evidence. This is the sixth of a series of 14 articles prepared to advise guideline developers for respiratory and other diseases on how to achieve this goal. In this article, we focused on integrating cost and resource information in guideline development and formulating recommendations focusing on four key questions.

Methods

We addressed the following specific questions. (1) When is it important to incorporate costs, and/or resource implications, and/or cost-effectiveness, and/or affordability considerations in guidelines? (2) Which costs and which resource use should be considered in guidelines? (3)What sources of evidence should be used to estimate costs, resource use, and cost-effectiveness? (4) How can cost-effectiveness, resource implications, and affordability be taken into account explicitly? Our work was based on a prior review on this topic and our conclusions are based on available evidence, consideration of what guideline developers are doing, and workshop discussions.

Results and Discussion

Many authorities suggest that there is a need to include explicit consideration of costs, resource use, and affordability during guideline development. Where drug use is at issue, "explicit consideration" may need to involve only noting whether the price (easily determined and usually the main component of "acquisition cost") of a drug is high or low. Complex interventions such as rehabilitation services are to a greater degree setting- and system-dependent. Resources used, and the costs of those resources, will vary among systems, and formal identification by a guideline group of the resource requirements of a complex intervention is essential. A clinical guideline usually contains multiple recommendations, and in some cases there are hundreds. Defining costs and resource use for all of them-especially for multiple settings-is unlikely to be feasible. At present, disaggregated resource utilization accompanied by some cost information seems to be the most promising approach. The method for assigning values to costs, including external or indirect cost (such as time off work), can have a significant impact on the outcome of any economic evaluation. The perspective that the guideline assumes should be made explicit. Standards for evidence for clinical data are usually good-quality trials reporting a relevant endpoint that should be summarized in a systematic review. Like others, we are therefore proposing that the ideal sources of evidence for cost and resource utilization data for guideline development are systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials that report resource utilization, with direct comparisons between the interventions of interest.

### How tobacco companies have used package quantity for consumer targeting [^94068f55]. Tobacco Control (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Package quantity refers to the number of cigarettes or amount of other tobacco product in a package. Many countries restrict minimum cigarette package quantities to avoid low-cost packs that may lower barriers to youth smoking.

Methods

We reviewed Truth Tobacco Industry Documents to understand tobacco companies' rationales for introducing new package quantities, including companies' expectations and research regarding how package quantity may influence consumer behaviour. A snowball sampling method (phase 1), a static search string (phase 2) and a follow-up snowball search (phase 3) identified 216 documents, mostly from the 1980s and 1990s, concerning cigarettes (200), roll-your-own tobacco (9), smokeless tobacco (6) and 'smokeless cigarettes' (1).

Results

Companies introduced small and large packages to motivate brand-switching and continued use among current users when faced with low market share or threats such as tax-induced price increases or competitors' use of price promotions. Companies developed and evaluated package quantities for specific brands and consumer segments. Large packages offered value-for-money and matched long-term, heavy users' consumption rates. Small packages were cheaper, matched consumption rates of newer and lighter users, and increased products' novelty, ease of carrying and perceived freshness. Some users also preferred small packages as a way to try to limit consumption or quit.

Conclusion

Industry documents speculated about many potential effects of package quantity on appeal and use, depending on brand and consumer segment. The search was non-exhaustive, and we could not assess the quality of much of the research or other information on which the documents relied.

### ACC / AHA statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines and performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures and task force on practice guidelines [^4bd92125]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA cost and value consideration in guideline development—scope and definitions: Guideline writing committees are encouraged to be informed about cost when information is available, but data on clinical efficacy and outcomes constitute the primary basis for their recommendations, and there is an ever-increasing need to be more explicit and transparent about value, which can be defined as the incremental benefits of a therapy or procedure relative to its incremental net long-term costs. A recent survey reported that slightly more than half of the largest US physician societies explicitly consider costs in developing their guideline documents, although their approach remains vague, and the authors concluded by recommending greater transparency and rigor in the approach to cost consideration in guideline documents from medical societies going forward. In moving toward explicit consideration of resource utilization and value, the overarching goal of this document’s writing committee is to facilitate the achievement of the best possible health within the confines of available resources.

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^428e0ea2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC)—discussion on integrating economic evidence explains that the CGC aims to improve health and health care by providing clinicians with recommendations based on the best available evidence and includes evaluating the cost of care, assessing the value of an intervention, incorporating economic evidence into recommendations, and discussing corresponding clinical considerations; it highlights limitations of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs), noting that willingness-to-pay thresholds commonly used in the United States do not reflect clinical, social, individual economic, and inflation considerations, economic evidence is sparse and poorly reported in the United States and analyses from outside the United States have low applicability, the certainty of economic evidence is often limited due to dynamic pricing and modeling assumptions, industry funding of CEAs is common and results cannot be easily repurposed in quantitative meta-analytic syntheses, many CEAs rely on surrogate outcomes and analyze medications individually rather than by class, and certainty in CEA results should be based on critically appraised certainty of clinical benefits and harms and model credibility.

### Policies to promote affordability and access across the life cycle of costly new drugs [^8a1d6615]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Strong health systems are also essential to scaling access. Beyond tools like health technology assessment and demand forecasting aiming for more efficient use of existing resources, countries need robust infrastructure, skilled workforces, effective procurement, and innovative delivery models. Health system strengthening has emerged as a key development strategy, recognising that resilient, well funded systems are vital for equitable healthcare.Though resource intensive, such systems enable efficient allocation through tools including reimbursement mechanisms, market based models, pharmacovigilance, and regulatory oversight, ensuring new (and older) treatments reach patients when they are needed.

Key messages

Persistent systemic challenges in the medicine life cycle hinder equitable access to novel therapies, whether for ongoing health challenges or acute health emergencies
Tackling these challenges requires actions that prioritise equity from research and development through to post-market use
Strategic, coordinated collaboration across countries and sectors is essential, as is the need to embed equity considerations from the start of the medicine life cycle
Effective solutions include enforceable pricing and access provisions in publicly funded research and development, alternative innovation models, global collaboration on regulatory processes, and expanded localised manufacturing

### WHO-led consensus statement on vaccine delivery costing: process, methods, and findings [^e021a98a]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommended costing terminology and principles

After reviewing the definitions of costing terms, the following definitions of costing terms are recommended:
Vaccine delivery costs Costs associated with delivering immunization programs to target populations, exclusive of vaccine costs.
Vaccine cost At a minimum includes the cost of the vaccine and diluent (if applicable); the analysis should include accounting for wastage rates; the analyst should specify whether this also includes injection supplies (syringes), international shipment, insurance, and customs/duties.
Financial cost Monetary outlays, with straight-line depreciation for capital goods; does not include opportunity costs for use of resources or donated goods and services from sources other than the payer(s) defined in the analysis. Definition is dependent on perspective since monetary outlays are specific to the payer(s) defined in the analysis.
Economic cost The value of all resources utilized, regardless of the source of financing. Includes opportunity costs for use of existing resources and any donated goods or services from any source. Capital costs are annualized and discounted.
Undepreciated financial cost Financial costs without depreciation of capital costs (note: such costs have been termed “initial investment” in some costing tools and referred to as fiscal costs in previous analyses.)
Recurrent cost Value of resources that last less than one year. Start-up activity costs may include recurrent costs.
Capital cost Value of resources lasting more than one year such as equipment, buildings, and trainings. Start-up activity costs may include capital costs.
Incremental cost Cost of adding a new service/intervention or a package of services/interventions over and above an existing program; inclusion of existing resources will depend on assumptions made about excess capacity (i.e. whether resources are underemployed; if there are no slack resources (e.g. all personnel time is fully allocated before the addition of the new service/intervention), then their use for the new service or intervention incurs an opportunity cost that should be included—either by measurement or assumption).
Full cost Baseline cost as well as the additional/incremental cost of the new intervention, including vaccine cost.
Cost projection Estimation of future costs of both recurrent and capital inputs.
Prospective data collection Direct observation of resource use during intervention implementation; i.e. data are collected concurrently with intervention implementation.
Retrospective data collection Data collection after resource use is completed.
Start-up cost Cost of initial one-time programmatic activities. Examples may include initial micro-planning, initial training activities, and initial sensitization/social mobilization/information, education, and communication (IEC); does not include routine or repeated programmatic activities such as refresher training or annual microplanning. Start-up activities may include both recurrent and capital costs; they are defined by the non-repeating nature of the activity, not the type of input.
Micro-costing Focuses on granular accounting of input prices and quantities; disaggregates costs of particular output into specific goods and services consumed.
Bottom-up costing Measures input quantities at the client (e.g. per vaccination administered) or activity level.
Top-down costing Divides overall program cost or expenditures, often including those at administrative levels above service delivery level, by number of outputs to calculate unit cost.
Perspective The point of view considered for costs (and benefits, if included) in a costing study, by whom the costs were incurred. Payers are the disbursing agents for a good or service, and may differ from the original source of funding. A provider perspective includes costs incurred by health service providers (can be limited to the government), a payer perspective includes costs to the payer(s), such as government or an external partner, while the societal perspective includes all costs incurred by providers as well as clients.
Shared cost Shared resources that are not used only for immunization, but also for other productive activities.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^9dffe8bc]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

For high cost medicines with uncertain benefits, healthcare systems can put conditions on how a medicine is used or paid for using a managed entry agreement. Conditions can be financial discounts and rebates, or more complex arrangements based on outcome.Managed entry agreements often specify collection of additional data to enable future decision making about new products with limited current evidence.Technical and practical challenges exist with such arrangements. Implementation can be limited by technical factors—for example, data collection in routine care can be costly and might yield less evidence than expected. In addition, delisting a treatment can raise objections from patients, who consider that they are being denied treatment, despite efforts to explain that a medicine is less effective than expected.

Buyers can use a variety of tools to improve their spending forecasts. Some can be used while research and development are still under way, as in the case of horizon scanning. Other tools, such as formularies and health technology assessment, allow buyers to select medicines once approved for marketing. In recent years managed entry agreements have reduced financial risk, particularly for medicines with uncertain benefits. Recognition that each of these processes is improved with better data reporting has led to an increased push for transparency and collaboration.

### Prescription drug prices: an AAN position statement [^c2a14012]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

AAN position—transparency in prescription drug pricing—supports proposals to promote transparency and to prohibit direct-to-consumer advertising, and highlights reporting frameworks in the CARES Act. The AAN supports proposals that promote transparency in prescription drug pricing and states that disclosure of pricing information, including how drugs are priced, the prices paid by insurers, and the prices paid by consumers, would provide information that could lower costs for patients and the healthcare system; the AAN also supports proposals that prohibit direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs. The document notes that a provision in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act creates additional manufacturing reporting requirements and that the CARES Act (sections 3112 and 3121) provides a framework for reporting volumes of drugs produced but would benefit from more specific language regarding developing cooperative mechanisms among manufacturers and regulators to share information regarding the increasingly complex drug supply chain in the United States.

### Short and long-term economic implications of biosimilars [^5de43504]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Biosimilars are gaining popularity due to their ability to offer comparable therapeutic benefits at potentially lower costs.

Areas Covered

This article analyses studies that compare the cost savings of biosimilars with biologics. It also explores market competition dynamics and the impact of policies in countries. The focus is on the advantages of biosimilars in oncology and rheumatological treatments while considering broader economic implications for the pharmaceutical industry such as market displacement, pricing strategies and their influence on innovation and healthcare sustainability.

Expert Opinion

The introduction of biosimilars marks a shift in healthcare economics by offering cost reductions and long-term potential for economic balance. However, I also recognize challenges related to research methodologies and regulatory inconsistencies across countries. To fully capitalize on their potential, future research and development in the field of biosimilars must emphasize harmonized approaches and comprehensive studies that ensure both cost containment in healthcare and wider access, to high quality treatments.

### The price is right? An economic analysis of factors influencing cosmetic surgery prices [^2e427d37]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cosmetic surgery is a large portion of practice revenue for many plastic surgeons, and therefore understanding the economic principles of pricing is critical. Although national averages provide a starting point for price determination, they may not reflect specific economic factors. Over the last decade, publicly reported pricing for cosmetic surgery has increased in prevalence, improving price transparency for patients and surgeons alike.

Objectives

This study aims to compare publicly reported prices to national cosmetic surgery averages and identify variables that have the greatest impact on price determination.

Methods

An Internet search was performed with the term "cosmetic surgery, price" for practices that publicly reported cosmetic surgery prices. Publicly reported prices were compared to national averages generated from The Aesthetic Society's Aesthetic Society Plastic Surgery National Databank Statistics. The impact of regional prices, practice type, and surgeon accreditation were analyzed for the most popular cosmetic surgery procedures.

Results

Sixty-six practices were identified that reported cosmetic surgery pricing information. Publicly reported prices were significantly higher for all surgical procedures except nipple procedures, excision of (excess) skin, fat grafting, fat harvest, and lip enhancement. Facility/operating room fees (n = 38) and anesthesia fees (n = 34) were the most common components included in a price, after surgeons' fees (n = 66). A significant price difference was appreciated when separating practices by region for all procedures except breast augmentation (P = .074) and liposuction (P = .088).

Conclusions

Publicly reported prices provide greater insight than national averages into specific pricing factors and strategies that can be employed when setting surgical prices.

### Public policies to reduce sugary drink consumption in children and adolescents [^c8775e65]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Public policy recommendations—pricing strategies for sugary drinks outline consideration of excise taxes with education and equitable allocation, and quantify expected consumption impact. Local, state, and/or national policies intended to reduce consumption of added sugars should include the consideration of approaches that increase the price of sugary drinks, such as an excise tax, and such taxes should be accompanied by education of all stakeholders on the rationale and benefits of the tax before implementation, with tax revenues allocated, at least in part, to reducing health and socioeconomic disparities. Price increases are associated with a decrease in consumption, and in the case of sugary drinks, a systematic review revealed that each 10% increase in price, such as a tax, reduced sugary drink consumption by 7%.

### Pharmaceutical pricing, price controls, and their effects on pharmaceutical sales and research and development expenditures in the European union [^2cd2be85]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Each country in the European Union (EU) currently employs direct price controls or permutations of direct price controls, such as reference pricing or limitations on returns to capital. Some countries also use volume controls. A new proposal that is being discussed would have all of the countries in the EU adopt uniform pricing for each pharmaceutical.

Objective

This paper analyzes the economic effects of free-market pricing individual-country price controls, and uniform EU price controls.

Methods

Microeconomic and mathematical models were used to simulate and predict probable economic outcomes in a comparative static setting.

Results

Price controls may be in the form of price ceilings or price floors. Both forms of price control generate deadweight economic losses in the short run and long run. A uniform EU price for each pharmaceutical sold there would have elements of a price ceiling in some of the countries and of a price floor in other countries. The deadweight loss incurred would be a function of the level at which the uniform price was set by the EU and the price elasticity of demand for each pharmaceutical in each country.

Conclusions

Economic efficiency is maximized in both the short run and long run when prices are set in freely competitive markets. An additional important dimension of Ramsey pricing within a competitive context is that it generates funds for investment in pharmaceutical research and development, which enhances economic efficiency in the long run.

### Decision-making by healthcare payers [^ddad676d]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Healthcare payers are faced with the need to allocate finite resources to maximize population health. To assist in decision-making, healthcare payers are increasingly using health outcomes information and economic analyses. Healthcare payers are often under pressure to make early decisions (around the time of product launch), when the evidence available is imperfect. They must also consider the equitable distribution of resources between therapeutic areas. Tools to help healthcare payers reach transparent and objective decisions include cost-utility analysis and decision modelling. In practice, healthcare payers in different countries (for example, Ireland, France and Canada) vary in the approaches taken to reimbursement and formulary listing decisions. The key to decision-making among healthcare payers is the provision of appropriate evidence, comparing any new treatment approach to current best practice, in situations corresponding to real life. When data assumptions have to be made, these should be clearly stated with consideration of the impact of varying the assumptions. The impact on budgets should also be considered.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^d62ef0fa]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs)—scope and caveats emphasize that the intention of CEAs is not to directly influence patient-level decision-making, and systematically applying CEAs at the level of the health system can promote efficient use of resources and improve population health outcomes; they would ideally be performed across the entire set of options available to generate health, rather than evaluating each intervention in a silo, which can be challenging in the United States given the fragmented nature of our health care system. CEAs can inform the prices of new health technologies entering the market, thus improving the affordability of and access to novel diagnostic and treatment strategies, while resource allocation is a complex process based on several considerations in addition to the efficient use of resources, including political priorities, scalability and affordability of the proposed intervention, and its impact on health equity; these considerations are particularly important for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease given the large number of individuals affected—1 in 3 US adults received care for a cardiovascular risk factor or condition in 2020—and the substantial economic burden of cardiovascular disease. CEAs have to be updated over the intervention’s life cycle as more cost and effectiveness data become available, and policymakers have to be willing to defund less-efficient programs already in place, because adding more programs and interventions that are “cost-effective” without removing interventions that are no longer cost-effective continues to drive up health care spending without optimizing efficiency.

### ACC / AHA statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines and performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures and task force on practice guidelines [^c9b1b46f]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Limitations, challenges, and arguments against incorporating resource and value considerations—barriers and gaps are described, including variability in value across settings, integration of long-term costs, and lack of national consensus, while noting hopes for routine cost-effectiveness assessment and acknowledging system-level changes are not addressed. Barriers include “widespread unwillingness to acknowledge that resources are limited, distrust of government and other policy decision makers, and lack of confidence in the science of value determination (cost-effectiveness).” Value “is not constant; it may vary over time and from one location to another,” and integrating “long-term costs” like infrastructure into per-treatment costs is challenging. “In the United States, no national consensus has emerged regarding the role of cost-effectiveness considerations in healthcare decision making,” but “the writing committee…will encourage routine assessment of cost-effectiveness,” and it “recognizes” that a focus on individual procedures “does not address system changes that may improve efficiency of cardiovascular care.”

### European perspective on the costs and cost-effectiveness of cancer therapies [^cecb6e93]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

In Europe, the vast majority of the costs of cancer therapy fall on third-party payers, normally the government, or sickness funds. Therefore, the main focus of cost-effectiveness studies is to assist payers in deciding whether new therapies are worthwhile, despite their high cost. Drug budgets are regulated in most European countries. The main form of central control is price setting, with some form of reference pricing being the most common approach. This sets the price of drugs, either to an international standard, or to a common price for drugs in the same group or cluster. At the hospital level, the main control over cancer drugs is the hospital formulary. Studies have shown a wide variation among European countries in access to cancer drugs. Explanations for these variations include differences in research funding, the drug approval process, the role of health economics in decision making, and budgetary issues. Several countries in Europe now require economic data in making decisions about the reimbursement of new drugs. An examination of decisions made by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom suggests that cancer drugs have fared quite well, with most recommendations being positive. This could be because of the seriousness of the health condition and the lack of alternative therapies for some cancer patients. If the policy of requesting cost-effectiveness evidence for pricing and reimbursement decisions becomes more popular, a major implication for the pharmaceutical industry is that studies should be conducted during phase III of clinical development to generate the required data.

Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Key economic concepts—scarcity, opportunity cost, and efficiency are defined to frame value assessment. Scarcity is foundational: “the most fundamental of which is the concept of scarcity,” requiring that “choices, or more precisely trade-offs, must be made,” and leading to the notion of cost as “opportunity cost.” “The opportunity cost of medical care is whatever else we might desire that cannot be produced because of the decision to produce more health care.” Efficiency is highlighted as “A second critical economic concept,” with the policy objective to “maximize the well-being (sometimes referred to as utility) of the members of society collectively,” and with “Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis” presented as tools that quantify efficiency of policy choices.

### Pricing of tobacco products during, and after, the introduction of standardized packaging: an observational study of retail price data from independent and convenience (small) retailers in the United Kingdom [^c337df9f]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Tobacco products monitored

All tobacco products were monitored through Universal Product Codes (i.e. barcodes). Forty tobacco products were selected, comprising 20 of the best‐selling fully branded products (15 FMC 20‐cigarette packs and five RYO 25‐g packs, or nearest size equivalent) and the 20 standardized products which replaced them (Table 2). Data on cumulative sales value (£) from March 2015 to March 2016 were used to select best‐selling products at baseline. FMCs were classified into value, mid‐price and premium price segments using the average price‐per‐stick from March 2015 to March 2016, with segmentation based on thresholds reported in the retail and industry trade press 39. Only a small number of RYO products were monitored, and no price segmentation was used. If a fully branded product was sold in both a price‐marked (i.e. RRP printed on the cellophane) and non‐price‐marked pack, we received information on each variant separately and combined average. Price‐marking was not permitted for standardized products. One RYO fully branded product (John Player Special Silver 25 g) was discontinued during the phase‐in period, and thus only 19 standardized products were monitored (four RYO). Details on sales trends are reported elsewhere 36, 37.

Table 2 
The fully branded products monitored from May 2016 and the replacement compliant products, by price segment.

Price measures

RRP represented the default sales value (£GBP) set on the EPoS system. RRPs were periodically downloaded from wholesaler price databases to each retailer's EPoS system, although these prices could be manually adjusted by retailers to increase profitability or implement local‐level price offers. Sales price represented the actual value recorded at the point of transaction (£GBP). For each product, we received a monthly average RRP and sales price for each retailer (inclusive of VAT at 20%).

### Implications of large language models for quality and efficiency of neurologic care: emerging issues in neurology [^ce7c6b0c]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Business challenges in implementing LLMs—beyond model bias, business implementation is a significant challenge because “off-the-shelf” products typically do not meet proliferating regulatory requirements, especially those related to data privacy, and generally lack robust functionality such as additional training on health care–specific sources. Health care providers must decide whether to obtain functionality from an existing EHR vendor at additional cost or purchase a stand-alone product; while less mature vendors may carry greater risks such as inability to deliver on sales promises (the so called “vaporware” risk), vendors with smaller customer bases may be nimbler with greater interest in codevelopment and commercialization, and may offer pricing incentives such as no-cost pilots in exchange for marketing references. However, these opportunities often come with restrictions and expected obligations such as significant limitations in the number of users or the extent of the services offered.

### Global barriers to accessing off-patent endocrine therapies: a renaissance of the orphan disease? [^97c5f7d8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Price Control Measures

Even when competition is minimum, governments may take price control measures using different pricing policies depending on the requirement. One example is external reference pricing where benchmarking the price is done by comparing the price in the country with that of other countries with a comparable economic status. Internal reference pricing is comparing the price of a drug within the country to another with similar active ingredients or comparable clinical effects. Value-based pricing benchmarks a price based on the added value of a drug considering factors such as quality of life and life years. Setting profit and price ceilings for the products can also be utilized.

Setting a standard price will not be effective unless measures are taken to ensure that the medicines are available for the set price. This is commonly done through reimbursement policies, negotiations, and regulatory laws. Governments may negotiate with the suppliers to make the medicine available for the benchmarked price as in the case of New Zealand. Reimbursement by the government or insurers can be limited to the set price, however, ensuring that there is no expenditure to the patient for the additional price. Regulatory laws defining maximum retail price for selected medicines are also used in some countries. In Sri Lanka, 60 medicines have defined maximum retail prices, which include metformin, gliclazide, levothyroxine, alendronate, and insulin.

### Understanding tobacco industry pricing strategy and whether it undermines tobacco tax policy: the example of the UK cigarette market [^8dcfc098]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Tobacco tax increases are the most effective means of reducing tobacco use and inequalities in smoking, but effectiveness depends on transnational tobacco company (TTC) pricing strategies, specifically whether TTCs overshift tax increases (increase prices on top of the tax increase) or undershift the taxes (absorb the tax increases so they are not passed onto consumers), about which little is known.

Design

Review of literature on brand segmentation. Analysis of 1999-2009 data to explore the extent to which tax increases are shifted to consumers, if this differs by brand segment and whether cigarette price indices accurately reflect cigarette prices.

Setting

UK.

Participants

UK smokers.

Measurements

Real cigarette prices, volumes and net-of-tax- revenue by price segment.

Findings

TTCs categorise brands into four price segments: premium, economy, mid and 'ultra-low price' (ULP). TTCs have sold ULP brands since 2006; since then, their real price has remained virtually static and market share doubled. The price gap between premium and ULP brands is increasing because the industry differentially shifts tax increases between brand segments; while, on average, taxes are overshifted, taxes on ULP brands are not always fully passed onto consumers (being absorbed at the point each year when tobacco taxes increase). Price indices reflect the price of premium brands only and fail to detect these problems.

Conclusions

Industry-initiated cigarette price changes in the UK appear timed to accentuate the price gap between premium and ULP brands. Increasing the prices of more expensive cigarettes on top of tobacco tax increases should benefit public health, but the growing price gap enables smokers to downtrade to cheaper tobacco products and may explain smoking-related inequalities. Governments must monitor cigarette prices by price segment and consider industry pricing strategies in setting tobacco tax policies.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^43a3332d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Table 2. Reference case for high-quality CEAs—costs and outcomes—states that costs should be based in the same jurisdiction as the target population, and health care cost estimates should reflect actual amounts paid, including out-of-pocket costs. Micro-costing can produce reliable cost estimates but is not always feasible; when micro-costing is not available or feasible, gross-costing is an acceptable alternative. Cost of drugs should reflect price after discounts or rebates in the base-case analysis, preferably the price available to the entity or majority of the treatment-eligible population. Costs of medical devices should be the price net of discounts when available or the list price when the net price is not available, and a wide range of costs should be examined in sensitivity analyses. Cost estimates should be adjusted for nonadherence, and the currency and year of evaluation should be clearly identified. For health outcomes, the reference case should report outcomes in terms of life years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, report alternative metrics when available, report intermediate outcomes, and may include disutility related to taking the treatment in sensitivity analyses.

### Ethical perspectives on costly drugs and health care: AAN position statement [^4b1e094c]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Drug pricing ethics—price justifications, examples, and development attrition are detailed, noting that “Pharmaceutical companies commonly defend high prices in the United States compared to other countries by arguing that higher prices are necessary to recoup research and development costs,” yet “a 2017 study of revenues from the top 20 selling drugs found that the difference in price (non–United States vs United States) for these drugs alone would allow companies to recoup all their research & development costs with $40 billion leftover for profit.” Illustrative price points include Daraprim being raised “from $13.50 to $750 per pill,” sofosbuvir “priced at $1,000 a pill, with a course of treatment costing $84,000,” and an international comparison where “the list price for 12 weeks of treatment in India was only $539.” Development risk is highlighted by “Only 1 in 10 drugs entering phase I trials will ultimately win approval.”

### Availability of cost-effectiveness studies for drugs with high Medicare part D expenditures [^e76181fb]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

The results of the present study showed that cost-effectiveness studies were rarely published early enough to inform initial pricing. This finding implies that the cost-effectiveness of a given drug outside the manufacturer’s own internal economic analyses were less likely to be considered in initial pricing strategies. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review and others have sponsored efforts to promote earlier analyses of the economic value of new drugs.The success of these endeavors near the time of market introduction will be critical for models that aim to use these analyses to inform drug pricing or access.

Quality varied among the published CEAs included in the present study. Most of the analyses adopted study perspectives and incorporated discounting according to the guidance of the First and Second Panels on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine. However, we found low adherence to recommendations regarding the time horizon, cost-effectiveness threshold, or sensitivity analyses. These are minimum quality criteria that should be met by most studies. Performance of CEAs that use standard analytic approaches is necessary to compare different therapies. Increasing the quantity and quality of drug CEAs is important for the successful implementation of value-based formulary design.

Even when a study is well conducted based on the criteria used for quality assessment, the selection of parameter values, model structures, or outcomes to optimize the probability of a favorable evaluation of a given drug remains possible, which may lead to bias in industry-sponsored studies. Thus, the results of the present study should be viewed as representing the availability of CEAs that meet a minimum quality standard and an upper bound for availability of this evidence.

### A stepwise replicable approach to negotiating value-driven supply chain contracts for orthobiologics [^766c49a0]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Orthobiologics are increasingly used to augment healing of tissues. Despite growing demand for orthobiologic products, many health systems do not enjoy substantial savings expected with high-volume purchases. The primary goal of this study was to evaluate an institutional program designed to (1) prioritize high-value orthobiologics and (2) incentivize vendor participation in value-driven contractual programs.

Methods

A three-step approach was used to reduce costs through optimization of orthobiologics supply chain. First, surgeons with orthobiologics expertise were engaged in key supply chain purchasing decisions. Second, eight orthobiologics formulary categories were defined. Capitated pricing expectations were established for each product category. Capitated pricing expectations were established for each product using institutional invoice data and market pricing data. In comparison with similar institutions, products offered by multiple vendors were priced at a lower benchmark (10th percentile of market price) than more rare products priced at the 25th percentile of the market price. Pricing expectations were transparent to vendors. Third, a competitive bidding process required vendors to submit pricing proposals for products. Clinicians and supply chain leaders jointly awarded contracts to vendors that met pricing expectations.

Results

Compared with our projected estimate of $423,946 savings using capitated product prices, our actual annual savings was $542,216. Seventy-nine percent of savings came from allograft products. Although the number of total vendors decreased from 14 to 11, each of the nine returning vendors received a larger, three-year institutional contract. Average pricing decreased across seven of the eight formulary categories.

Discussion

This study demonstrates a three-step replicable approach to increase institutional savings for orthobiologic products, engaging clinician experts, and strengthening relationships with select vendors. Vendor consolidation permits a symbiotic win-win relationship: Health systems achieve increased value by reducing unnecessary complexity of multiple contracts, and vendors obtain larger contracts with increased market share.

Level Of Evidence

### Economic impact of tobacco price increases through taxation: a community guide systematic review [^0293ca58]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. and around the world. Increasing tobacco price through higher taxes is an effective intervention both to reduce tobacco use in the population and generate government revenues. The goal of this paper is to review evidence on the economic impact of tobacco price increases through taxation with a focus on the likely healthcare cost savings and improvements in employee productivity.

Evidence Acquisition

The search covered studies published in English from January 2000 to July 2012 and included evaluations of national, state, and local policies to increase the price of any type of tobacco product by raising taxes in high-income countries. Economic review methods developed for The Guide to Community Preventive Services were used to screen and abstract included studies. Economic impact estimates were standardized to summarize the available evidence. Analyses were conducted in 2012.

Evidence Synthesis

The review included eight modeling studies, with seven providing estimates of the impact on healthcare costs and three providing estimates of the value of productivity gains. Only one study provided an estimate of intervention costs. The economic merit of tobacco product price increases through taxation was determined from the overall body of evidence on per capita annual cost savings from a conservative 20% price increase.

Conclusions

The evidence indicates that interventions that raise the unit price of tobacco products through taxes generate substantial healthcare cost savings and can generate additional gains from improved productivity in the workplace.

Generic medications—antidote pricing dynamics are described: when there are two generics available, drug prices decline to an average of 55% of the brand name drug price, yet cost increases of generic antidotes can reflect “predatory pricing” that is not related to production or development and does not reward innovation; for example, the sole U.S. supplier of calcium disodium EDTA (CaNa2EDTA) was purchased in 2012, at which point the average wholesale price of CaNa2EDTA was increased 7150% from 2008 to the end of 2014.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis for clinicians [^6438d463]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The current economic news is bad. Expenditure on health care is under scrutiny in every country and with predictions of another economic crash comes pressure on the funding of health care systems - systems that, according to the World Health Organizationare meant to deliver quality service to all people, when and where they need them.

At the same time, new products - pharmaceuticals, diagnostic tests, new technologies - continue to be developed and launched. Health care systems are under pressure to pay for all of the potential hope that these provide, sometimes with good reason, sometimes without. This is where cost-effectiveness analysis comes in.

### Improving patient access through value-based CAR T delivery: examples using a micro-costing tool [^d1bfee38]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

The true costs of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) delivery (i.e. all costs except acquisition costs) remain uncertain, with little guidance available to guide accurate estimation. Providers therefore may face challenges in estimating the costs of establishing or expanding CAR T services, particularly if they have limited business expertise or CAR T experience. This risks over- or under-estimation of CAR T delivery costs, with potential for inadequate provider reimbursement, resource challenges, and restricted patient access. Accurate estimation of CAR T delivery costs is an essential component of ensuring value-based healthcare that achieves the best possible patient outcomes, while also ensuring that providers are adequately compensated for service delivery. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how value-based CAR T service delivery can be facilitated using an Excel-based micro-costing framework ('tool') to derive accurate and transparent cost estimates that consider the full patient pathway from initial assessment through to 100 days post CAR T infusion. Micro-costing can be used to support robust CAR T business case development and ensure all individual components of the treatment pathway have been accounted for. The tool's flexibility allows providers to model different future scenarios (e.g. changes in the case mix) and test the impact of resource changes (e.g. adjusting staff experience levels) to make informed resourcing decisions. This facilitates identification of opportunities for efficiencies, resource reallocation, and service improvements, and supports providers in delivering CAR T therapy to as many eligible patients as possible. A clear and detailed understanding of CAR T delivery costs can also support validation of reimbursement levels, such as CAR T tariffs, mitigating the risk of provider underpayment for services. The publicly available micro-costing tool is the first to support costing across the full CAR T treatment pathway from initial patient assessment to long-term follow-up. It has the potential to transform provider approaches to CAR T program development, reducing reliance on assumptive costs and uncertainty, and instead offering an evidence-driven approach. Overall, the tool supports value-based and sustainable CAR T therapy delivery, with the aim of ensuring adequate reimbursement for providers while facilitating patient access to this potentially life-saving therapy.

### Cost control for prescription drug programs: pharmacy benefit (...) [^933b5824]. aspe.hhs.gov (1999). Low credibility.

Cost control methods in prescription drug programs can be categorized as being targeted to or intending to affect pharmacies or pharmacists, drug manufacturers, prescribers, and/or consumers. Strategies directed toward pharmacies/pharmacists or manufacturers generally are price or discounting oriented, consistent with a theme of volume purchasing that serves as a basic tenet throughout managed care. Strategies directed toward consumers or prescribers can be more complex and with utilization goals in mind, sometimes achieved by manipulating the cost incurred when choosing to use a given drug.
1. Pharmacy Payments/Reimbursement -- Negotiated Prices The standard approach for pharmacy reimbursement for dispensed prescriptions is to pay an ingredient cost amount for the drug dispensed in the prescription, plus a dispensing fee.

How the ingredient cost is determined and the amount of the dispensing fee often varies depending on whether the drug dispensed is a brand name or generic drug. Ingredient cost payment for a brand name drug with an existing patent typically is determined by deducting a percentage from the drugs average wholesale price as an estimate of the pharmacys acquisition cost of the drug. Since PBMs reflect aggregate purchases representing all individuals within a drug coverage program, their reimbursement formulas are established to extract volume purchase discounts from pharmacies. Levels of prices paid by PBMs generally are the lowest or some of the lowest accepted by pharmacies for any types of customers. Prices paid by cash paying customers and even Medicaid programs in many states are higher than what a PBM would pay. Thus the PBM pricing approach can be considered a negotiated price, volume discount strategy targeted at pharmacy providers.
3.

Manufacturer Price Concessions -- Rebates Rebates are moneys returned by a seller to a purchaser that are delayed from the sales transaction, and can be considered a negotiated price discounting strategy targeted to drug manufacturers. Manufacturers pay a rebate based upon the amount of the firms products that are dispensed by the pharmacies providing prescription service to beneficiaries or enrollees. Differential brand/generic copayments specify higher copayment amounts on prescriptions for brand name drugs and lower amounts on prescriptions for generic drugs. In addition to brand and generic differential copayments, some plans include an additional third tier of copayment for non-formulary drugs. The third tier copayments are the highest, often sizeably more than the brand name copayment amount, since non-formulary or non-preferred drugs typically are brand name drugs without rebates.

### Drug prices after patent expirations in high-income countries and implications for cost-effectiveness analyses [^7bb1e1b3]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Then we incorporated the pricing estimates from the empirical assessment at 2, 8, and 14 years after target exposure introduction times. We presented 3 effectiveness scenarios with different survival effects hazard ratios (HRs, 0.44, 0.58, and 0.89), to represent high-, mid-, and low- effectiveness levels, respectively. Then we assessed the extent of the influence that the introduction of pricing dynamics has depending on the above-mentioned scenarios. Additionally, we created an online open-access web tool that can be used to explore the influence of parameters and scenarios.

### Value for money of medicine sampling and quality testing: evidence from Indonesia [^ff2033d1]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Implications for policy-makers

Ascertaining the value of postmarket surveillance activities requires policy-makers deciding on its objectives and resources to consider carefully a range of contextual aspects. An important initial distinction is between one-off medicine quality exercises and routine postmarket surveillance. While our cost estimates are based on STARmeds, a standalone study, having these cost estimates inform a discussion on the value of postmarket surveillance in the form of medicine sampling first requires being explicit about what are the policy objectives, what type of study design best serves these objectives (eg, random or targeted sampling) and what ‘value’ represents in context.

If ‘value’ refers to the amount and quality of existing knowledge on the substandard medicines prevalence in the respective context, then it can be argued that with absent credible information on the likely extent of the problem, for example, a STARmeds-like type of exercise can offer novel, otherwise unavailable insights that can focus the policy dialogue and serve as a benchmark for future medicine quality efforts. With ‘value’ understood as knowing the likelihood of a patient buying substandard products, then the substandard point prevalence is determinant since the average cost of detecting one substandard sample was largely determined by the prevalence and laboratory testing costs, as illustrated in our scenario analyses (figure 2). A recent study on the return on investment of technologies to detect substandard and falsified amoxicillin focuses on this issue, and studies the possibility of using more cost-efficient screening alternatives to quality testing, leaving standard quality tests for measuring APIs (such as the high-performance liquid chromatography technology used by STARmeds) for confirmatory tests.As illustrated in scenario C (panel ii), randomised Post-market surveillance (PMS) has diminishing returns to prevalence: the smaller the number of substandard medicines in the market the more expensive and the more difficult it is to find them. One can argue that preventing the existence of substandard medications in the market is a balance between investing in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) inspection and enforcement, and PMS since effective quality control at production can reduce the need for extensive (and expensive) randomised PMS. In that sense, when there are not enough substandard medicines in the market to justify the cost of randomised PMS, risk-based surveillance might be a better option, which requires a different cost-effectiveness study. On the other hand, countries with a significant number of substandard products should prioritise random PMS. How many substandard medicines constitute a ‘significant’ amount to justify this view of ‘value’ of PMS is a trade-off that national regulators need to take into consideration in their planning activities. When ‘value’ is understood as preventing or deterring substandard products from being brought to the market, the higher the magnitude of this deterrent effect, the higher the value of the postmarket surveillance activity and the lower the expected prevalence of SFM in the market. While, to our knowledge, there is no empirical quantitative evidence on the deterrent effect of medicine surveillance activities, criminological research has found significant deterrent effects associated with the use of surveillance cameras (with random or targeted installation), by increasing the criminals’ expected probability of being detected.If postmarket surveillance activities are known to the people and work as surveillance cameras for the medicines market, criminals may be discouraged to produce or sell SFM, just by the existence of these activities. An information experiment increasing the visibility and awareness of surveillance activities in the form of medicine sampling and testing from the market could be useful to investigate the existence and pontetial of this effect. The same would apply if ‘value’ refers to avoiding adverse events due to SFM: the more cases are avoided, the higher would be the value of postmarket surveillance. Studies estimating the economic impact of SFM have included costs related to adverse events, which could help understand the value of avoiding them, but this evidence is limited to sub-Saharan Africa countries and antimalarials or antibiotics.

### Beyond excise taxes: a systematic review of literature on non-tax policy approaches to raising tobacco product prices [^3a865f34]. Tobacco Control (2016). Low credibility.

Tobacco users respond to opportunities to purchase lower priced products.In various surveys, between 25% and 40% of respondents report using discounts and/or cheaper brands. Several US studies found that purchasing cheaper brands, or buying with a discount or multipack offer, was associated with price reductions of up to $1 per pack.People who engage in price-minimising strategies make fewer cessation attempts and are less likely to reduce their smoking.

Some of the highest risk groups for tobacco initiation and use, including youth and people with lower incomes,are also the most price sensitive, so price dispersion may be a particularly important policy target. Furthermore, groups engage in different price minimisation strategies, so understanding whether a policy is likely to change average prices, prices within a specific price tier, or the availability of low price tiers, is important for understanding potential impacts on vulnerable populations. For example, more than one-third of youth smokers report exposure to price couponsand young adults are both more likely to use coupons or promotions, and less likely to smoke discount brands, compared to older smokers.Policies that shrink tier-specific price dispersion may therefore have a particularly strong impact on youth. Lower income smokers, however, are more likely to buy discount brands,so policies that target low price tiers might ameliorate socioeconomic disparities in smoking.

To boost prices in low tax areas and counteract tobacco industry price reduction strategies, many governments are exploring policies to increase tobacco prices through mechanisms other than taxation, including setting minimum prices or banning promotional discounts. Although the impact of tobacco tax policies has been previously summarised,the practical and substantive advantages and disadvantages of other price policy options have not been similarly explored. To fill this gap, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to determine how non-tax tobacco price policies are described, recommended and evaluated.

### Enhancing the value of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies by identifying patients most likely to benefit. A consensus statement from the National Lipid Association [^b4bff3a1]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies—cost-effectiveness thresholds and pricing in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) are detailed as follows: In the United States, the initial wholesale acquisition cost was greater than $14,000 per year, and guideline assessments characterized low value at ≥$150,000 per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]. Manufacturer-supported analyses reported that with discounting, therapy approached ≈ US$100,000 per QALY when low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are ≥ 100 mg/dL, whereas a conservative analysis estimated that discounting to US$2566 per year would be needed to approach a reasonable value of US$100,000 per QALY in patients with a recent myocardial infarction whose LDL-C was ≥ 100 mg/dL. Alirocumab pricing was adjusted to the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review price point for higher-risk ASCVD with LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL at $4500 to $8000 per year, and manufacturers subsequently announced reducing the list price by about 60% to $5850 per year. Even with reduced prices, analyses indicated low value (≥$150,000/QALY) for many ASCVD patients with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL, while subgroups could achieve reasonable (≤$100,000/QALY) or even high (<$50,000 per QALY) value.

### Planning post-launch evidence generation: lessons from France, england and Spain [^49965124]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Technological developments and innovations in regulatory pathways have meant medicinal products are increasingly associated with substantial clinical and economic uncertainties at launch. This has increased the focus on continuous evidence generation to assess the real‐world value of new medicines post‐launch. This paper examines Post‐Launch Evidence Generation (PLEG) systems in France, Spain, and England, drawing on insights from a series of multistakeholder roundtables hosted by RWE4Decisions. These discussions provided a platform to compare national approaches to PLEG considering PLEG planning and operationalization. The roundtable events included presentations by representatives of the HTA bodies and payers in France, Spain, and England, an industry response, and multistakeholder discussions. The events highlighted that while there are differences in the products to which PLEG is applied and the way it is operationalized, there are many common challenges experienced across systems and by all stakeholders. First, there is a recognition that evidentiary needs must be anticipated earlier to avoid PLEG where possible and better plan for PLEG where needed. Second, there is a need to streamline data collection. This includes trying to make greater use of existing data sources vs. primary data collection, prioritizing collection of a small number of outcomes that directly address key uncertainties, and by improving international collaborations to streamline data collection and evidence generation across borders. Our findings suggest value in improving scientific advice processes and international collaboration to discuss key data gaps early and ensure efficient and effective evidence collection that improves the speed and quality of reimbursement and pricing decisions.

### Ethical perspectives on costly drugs and health care: AAN position statement [^3c28e0a6]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Allocation complexities in real life—high-priced therapies create prioritization and access challenges for health systems, illustrated by specific pricing and distribution examples. Nusinersen was originally priced at $750,000 for year 1 and $375,000 annually thereafter, with additional costs required for administration, and health systems face the challenge of prioritizing which patients should receive the drug first. The recent entry of another high-priced biologic drug, onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma), illustrates the quandary health systems face when choosing to invest, and given the limited supply and extraordinary cost, Novartis has offered Zolgensma for free to patients selected using a lottery.

Medical device cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs)—price inputs and sensitivity reporting should ensure transparency and robust testing: CEAs should be transparent about sources of effectiveness and safety parameters and should evaluate how sensitive conclusions are to uncertainty; CEAs should use the price net of discounts or list prices when net prices are unavailable; device costs should be varied widely in 1-way sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER); and when device costs are opaque, the economic value statement should report threshold prices at which the device would be expected to be cost-effective.

Health care costs—Health care costs refer to the resources consumed in the production of health care that are then no longer available for other uses and include costs of drugs, devices, durable medical equipment, clinician and nonclinician time, inpatient hospitalization, emergency room visits, outpatient services, long-term care, and home-based services. There are 2 approaches to evaluating health care costs: micro-costing, which is a bottom-up approach that relies on direct enumeration and costing of all resources consumed or saved, and gross-costing, which is a top-down approach that assigns each episode of care an average aggregate cost based on known national reimbursement rates (eg, Medicare reimbursement for a Diagnosis-Related Group). The choice of approach used to estimate costs depends on the specific types of resources to be valued.

### Measuring the budget impact of nondiscriminatory cost-effectiveness [^06ed644d]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The IRA prohibits traditional CEA, yet the lack of a systematic and transparent price-determination process muddies incentives for innovators and other stakeholders. The results of this analysis suggest that systematic, nondiscriminatory value assessment produces budgetary implications similar to traditional CEA, despite higher value-based prices for drugs treating more severe illness.

We compare GRACE with CEA-based pricing, which itself saves costs over the status quo.Thus, even though its 2% cost increase translates to meaningful absolute dollars, GRACE likely saves considerable resources over the status quo. Moreover, adopting GRACE has important implications for innovation incentives. If manufacturers expect broad use of GRACE, they may shift development away from less severe to more severe illnesses because value-based prices tend to be higher for severe illnesses.

Limitations

The reliance on published ICER reports allowed for implementation of GRACE for a large sample of drugs simultaneously, but this has key limitations. Because we lacked access to underlying models, we relied on simplifying assumptions of constant mortality and uniformly distributed QALYs. Nevertheless, ICER’s results were replicated using approximation methods, lending credence to the approach. In addition, ICER tends to evaluate newer drugs that are relatively high cost. Future work should examine the value-based prices and budgetary implications of switching from CEA to GRACE in a representative sample of drugs.
