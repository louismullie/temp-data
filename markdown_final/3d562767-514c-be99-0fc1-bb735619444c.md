## Question

What labs should be done for chronic fatigue

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests should be ordered for evaluating chronic fatigue. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical context and whether we are dealing with undifferentiated chronic fatigue versus suspected ME/CFS. Then, I should verify the core principle that there is no diagnostic lab for ME/CFS and that testing is primarily to exclude other causes. Next, I will review the essential first-line labs that are consistently recommended across guidelines. After that, I should consider second-line or targeted tests based on history, exam, and initial results. Finally, I will integrate special populations and synthesize a practical, staged approach with caveats about avoiding unnecessary testing and repeating normal results.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Chronic fatigue is common and multifactorial, and in primary care, routine labs change management in only about 5% of cases, so I need to ensure I am not over-ordering tests when the history and exam already point to a likely cause or to ME/CFS after appropriate screening [^51c2b825]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: ME/CFS remains a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, with no validated diagnostic biomarker, so labs are used to rule out alternative explanations rather than to confirm ME/CFS itself [^c83fd9cc] [^212ae203].

> I need to check the core principle. There is no single confirmatory laboratory test for ME/CFS; diagnosis relies on a thorough history and physical, targeted labs to exclude other fatiguing illnesses, and application of clinical criteria such as those from the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine or the Canadian Consensus Criteria, which emphasize post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance, and substantial functional decline persisting beyond 6 months [^c83fd9cc] [^c62e31c7]. Wait, let me verify the implication: this means the lab strategy is deliberately conservative and focused on identifying treatable contributors rather than chasing ME/CFS-specific markers that are not yet clinically validated [^bd50e2bd].

> Next, I should review the essential first-line tests that repeatedly appear across authoritative sources. The CDC recommends CBC with differential, ESR or CRP, a comprehensive metabolic panel including electrolytes, fasting glucose, renal function, and calcium/phosphate, TSH with free T4, iron studies (serum iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin), celiac screening with tissue transglutaminase IgA and total IgA, and urinalysis; these are echoed in primary care guidance and align with the principle of excluding common, treatable causes of fatigue. I should double-check that these are the minimal set most clinicians agree on before labeling fatigue as unexplained or considering ME/CFS, and yes, this is consistent with contemporary primary care and CDC guidance [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the rationale for each element. CBC screens for anemia, infection, and hematologic disease; ESR/CRP screen for occult inflammation; CMP evaluates renal, hepatic, endocrine, and electrolyte contributors; TSH/free T4 screens for hypo- and hyperthyroidism; iron studies detect deficiency or overload; celiac screening is justified because fatigue is a common presentation and it is treatable; urinalysis can reveal renal or systemic disease clues. These choices reflect the high yield of identifying reversible contributors in primary care fatigue presentations [^5726d8be] [^a6af3413].

> Let me consider second-line or targeted tests based on clinical suspicion. If anemia is found, I should confirm B12 and folate status and consider hemolysis labs or iron indices to characterize the anemia. If macrocytosis is present, B12 and folate are mandatory. If iron deficiency is confirmed, I should look for sources of blood loss and consider celiac disease as a cause of malabsorption. If liver test abnormalities emerge, I should evaluate for hepatitis, alcohol-related disease, or hemochromatosis. If renal function is abnormal, I should assess for chronic kidney disease and its complications. If autoimmune features are present, I should add ANA, RF, and consider Sjögren's or antiphospholipid panels as indicated. If infectious features or exposures are suspected, I should add targeted serologies or cultures. If cognitive symptoms are prominent, I should check B12, folate, and consider neuroimaging if focal deficits or red flags exist. If endocrine symptoms are present, I should evaluate cortisol, prolactin, or sex hormones selectively rather than ordering broad panels indiscriminately [^5726d8be] [^a6af3413]. Wait, I should confirm that this staged approach avoids low-yield testing; yes, this aligns with primary care guidance to expand testing only when results will change management [^a6af3413].

> I will now examine special populations where the threshold or scope shifts. In patients with a history of cancer or on immune checkpoint inhibitors, oncology and immunotherapy guidelines recommend a more aggressive evaluation including CBC, CMP, TSH, free T4, morning cortisol, and ACTH to assess for endocrine immune-related adverse events that can present with fatigue; this is a higher-yield context given the prevalence of endocrinopathies with ICIs [^ad2612ab] [^16faca6a]. In post-COVID fatigue, multidisciplinary guidance supports CBC, CMP, TSH, and symptom-guided additions such as ESR/CRP, CK, vitamins D/B1/B12, ferritin, iron profile, and sex hormones, with cardiopulmonary or autonomic testing as indicated for exertional intolerance or orthostatic symptoms; this reflects the higher pretest probability of organ-specific sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection [^036a9fc5]. In adolescents with suspected post-infectious CFS following infectious mononucleosis, research suggests that serial assessment of stress and sex hormones and innate immune markers may help stratify risk, though this remains investigational and not yet standard of care; I should be cautious not to over-interpret these data in routine practice [^bf4e582c] [^c2263c74].

> But wait, what if the patient already had a basic panel elsewhere and everything was normal? I should confirm that repeating normal tests is generally not helpful unless the clinical picture changes, and that extensive panels chasing obscure biomarkers are discouraged; indeed, primary care guidance notes that repeat testing after normal results rarely changes management and can worsen patient anxiety and iatrogenesis, reinforcing a conservative, symptom-driven approach [^51c2b825]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies even when patients request "more tests"; yes, shared decision-making should emphasize that additional labs without a clinical target rarely clarify the diagnosis and may distract from symptom management and pacing strategies in ME/CFS [^a6af3413].

> Let me synthesize a practical, staged approach. First, obtain the core panel in essentially all patients with chronic fatigue: CBC with differential, ESR or CRP, CMP with electrolytes, glucose, renal function, and calcium/phosphate, TSH with free T4, iron studies, celiac serology with total IgA, and urinalysis. Second, add targeted tests based on history, exam, and initial results: B12 and folate if anemia or macrocytosis, hepatitis serologies if liver tests are abnormal, autoimmune panels if inflammatory symptoms or signs are present, endocrine testing if clinically indicated, and infection-specific tests if exposure or epidemiology suggests them. Third, reserve specialized testing for selected scenarios such as post-COVID syndromes, cancer survivorship, or suspected cardiopulmonary disease, using cardiopulmonary evaluation, neuroimaging, or autonomic testing only when results will change management. Throughout, avoid routine repetition of normal results and avoid unvalidated ME/CFS biomarker panels [^5726d8be] [^a6af3413] [^036a9fc5].

> I should double-check that this approach aligns with diagnostic criteria usage. Since ME/CFS is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, the labs above serve to identify alternative explanations; if no alternative is found and the patient meets IOM/NAM or Canadian Consensus Criteria, ME/CFS can be diagnosed and management should pivot to symptom control, comorbidity treatment, and pacing, rather than escalating low-yield testing. This balances the risk of missing treatable disease against the harms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^c83fd9cc] [^c62e31c7].

For chronic fatigue, order a **targeted lab panel** to exclude common, treatable causes: CBC, CMP, TSH with free T4, ESR/CRP, iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation), vitamin B12, folate, and urinalysis [^5726d8be] [^a6af3413]. Add **celiac serology** if gastrointestinal symptoms or nutrient deficiencies are present [^5726d8be]. Reserve additional tests — such as cortisol, ACTH, testosterone/estradiol, HIV, hepatitis B/C, ANA, or Lyme serology — for specific clinical suspicions [^5726d8be] [^036a9fc5]. Routine screening for "adrenal fatigue", Epstein-Barr virus, or vitamin D is not recommended unless clinically indicated [^be23fb22] [^5726d8be]. If initial results are normal, avoid repeat testing; if abnormal, pursue condition-specific workups (e.g. anemia, thyroid, liver, renal, or autoimmune disease) [^51c2b825] [^5726d8be].

## Essential laboratory tests

The following tests are **recommended for initial evaluation** of chronic fatigue:

| **Test category** | **Specific tests** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Hematologic | - Complete blood count (CBC) with differential <br/> - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) <br/> - C-reactive protein (CRP) | - Screen for anemia <br/> - Infection <br/> - Inflammation <br/> - Hematologic malignancies [^5726d8be] [^c90807d0] |
| Metabolic | - Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) <br/> - Fasting glucose <br/> - Renal function (creatinine, BUN, GFR) <br/> - Calcium <br/> - Phosphate <br/> - Electrolytes | - Assess liver <br/> - Kidney <br/> - Electrolyte disturbances <br/> - Diabetes [^5726d8be] [^a6af3413] |
| Endocrine | - Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) <br/> - Free thyroxine (free T4) | Screen for hypo- or hyperthyroidism [^5726d8be] [^a6af3413] |
| Nutritional | - Iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation) <br/> - Vitamin B12 <br/> - Folate | Identify iron deficiency, B12 deficiency, or folate deficiency [^5726d8be] [^d74c322d] |
| Urinalysis | - Urinalysis | Screen for renal disease, diabetes, or urinary tract infection [^5726d8be] [^a6af3413] |

---

## Additional tests based on clinical suspicion

Further testing should be guided by **clinical suspicion** and initial results:

- **Celiac disease screening**: Tissue transglutaminase IgA and total IgA if gastrointestinal symptoms or nutrient deficiencies are present [^5726d8be].
- **Adrenal function tests**: Morning cortisol and ACTH if adrenal insufficiency is suspected [^ad2612ab].
- **Sex hormones**: Testosterone or estradiol if clinically indicated (e.g. hypogonadism symptoms) [^036a9fc5].
- **Infectious disease screening**: HIV, hepatitis B/C, or Lyme serology if clinically suspected [^036a9fc5].
- **Autoimmune screening**: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) if autoimmune disease is suspected [^036a9fc5].

---

## Tests not routinely recommended

Routine screening for the following is **not recommended** unless clinically indicated:

- **Adrenal fatigue**: No evidence supports routine cortisol testing for "adrenal fatigue" [^be23fb22].
- **Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)**: Not recommended unless infectious mononucleosis is suspected [^notfound].
- **Vitamin D**: Not routinely recommended unless deficiency is suspected or confirmed [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize a **targeted, evidence-based approach** to laboratory testing in chronic fatigue:

- **CDC guidelines**: Recommend initial basic laboratory tests to exclude common treatable conditions, with further testing based on clinical suspicion [^5726d8be].
- **Primary care recommendations**: Emphasize avoiding unnecessary tests and focusing on clinical evaluation and patient history [^a6af3413].
- **Specialist guidelines**: Recommend additional tests only when clinically indicated (e.g. endocrine, infectious, autoimmune) [^036a9fc5].

---

## Interpretation of laboratory results

Interpretation of laboratory results should be **guided by clinical context**:

- **Normal results**: If initial tests are normal, repeat testing is generally not indicated unless clinical status changes [^51c2b825].
- **Abnormal results**: Abnormal findings should prompt further evaluation and management of the underlying condition (e.g. anemia, thyroid dysfunction, liver or renal disease) [^5726d8be].
- **Borderline results**: Borderline or mildly abnormal results should be interpreted cautiously and correlated with clinical findings [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

A **targeted laboratory approach** is essential in evaluating chronic fatigue. Initial testing should include CBC, CMP, TSH with free T4, ESR/CRP, iron studies, vitamin B12, folate, and urinalysis. Additional tests should be guided by clinical suspicion and initial results. Routine screening for "adrenal fatigue", EBV, or vitamin D is not recommended unless clinically indicated. This approach ensures efficient, cost-effective evaluation while avoiding unnecessary testing and patient burden.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome: evaluation and treatment [^8ebc3b9d]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Severe fatigue is a common complaint among patients. Often, the fatigue is transient or can be attributed to a definable organic illness. Some patients present with persistent and disabling fatigue, but show no abnormalities on physical examination or screening laboratory tests. In these cases, the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) should be considered. CFS is characterized by debilitating fatigue with associated myalgias, tender lymph nodes, arthralgias, chills, feverish feelings, and postexertional malaise. Diagnosis of CFS is primarily by exclusion with no definitive laboratory test or physical findings. Medical research continues to examine the many possible etiologic agents for CFS (infectious, immunologic, neurologic, and psychiatric), but the answer remains elusive. It is known that CFS is a heterogeneous disorder possibly involving an interaction of biologic systems. Similarities with fibromyalgia exist and concomitant illnesses include irritable bowel syndrome, depression, and headaches. Therefore, treatment of CFS may be variable and should be tailored to each patient. Therapy should include exercise, diet, good sleep hygiene, antidepressants, and other medications, depending on the patient's presentation.

### The case definition of chronic fatigue syndrome [^ea982425]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

The 1994 case definition of chronic fatigue syndrome is widely used not only for diagnosis but also for clinical and laboratory-based observations of this clinical entity. The criteria for the 1994 case definition are based primarily on symptoms and not on physical signs or chemical or immunological tests. This situation has resulted in conflicting clinical and laboratory observations that in all likelihood is due to different populations of patients being studied in different centers. Based on some of the recent publications, there appears to be an emerging picture of this disease entity that we propose could be used to subgroup chronic fatigue syndrome into four different subclasses. These subclasses would consist of chronic fatigue with primarily nervous system disorders such as impaired memory or concentration and headache, chronic fatigue with primarily endocrine system disorders such as unrefreshing sleep and postexertional malaise, chronic fatigue with musculoskeletal system disorders such as muscle pain and joint pain, and chronic fatigue with immune system/infectious disorders such as sore throat and tender lymph nodes. It is suggested that if clinical and laboratory-based studies on chronic fatigue syndrome were conducted on more homogeneous subgroups of patients, the data from one center to the other might not be as conflicting and more insights can be shed on the nature of this clinical condition.

Participants

We recruited adult patients (aged 18 years and older) attending these clinics who were diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and placed on a waiting list for therapy. Several diagnostic criteria exist for chronic fatigue syndrome. In this trial, we recruited participants who met the NICE criteria, which are used by NHS clinicians. The NICE criteria require at least 4 months of clinically evaluated, unexplained, persistent, or relapsing fatigue with a definite onset that has resulted in a substantial reduction in activity and that is characterised by postexertional malaise or fatigue, or both. They also require at least one of ten related symptoms: difficulty sleeping, headaches, cognitive dysfunction, general malaise or flu-like symptoms, painful lymph nodes, sore throat, physical or mental exertion making symptoms worse, dizziness or nausea, palpitations, or multisite muscle or joint pain without evidence of inflammation. Medical assessment by the clinic doctor included history, physical, and mental state examinations, and laboratory tests, as recommended by NICE, before trial entry to exclude alternative diagnoses. Participants were also assessed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteriaand the Oxford criteriafor chronic fatigue syndrome. The structured clinical interview from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV was used to diagnose both exclusionary and allowable comorbid psychiatric disorders.

Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years, had current suicidal thoughts or comorbid psychiatric conditions requiring exclusion, had read the GES guide previously, had already received GET at one of the trial clinics, were unable to speak or read English adequately, or had physical contraindications to exercise. Participants provided written informed consent before entry into the trial.

### Fatigue in chronic dialysis patients [^c2091950]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Fatigue is common in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients and impacts on daily living, impairs significantly the quality of life, increases the risk of cardiovascular events and negatively influences survival. Although numerous social, demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables have been associated with fatigue, the causes of this symptom are often unclear. In the absence of an underlying, treatable disorder, the results of therapeutic intervention are typically frustrating. So far, none of the drugs tested can be recommended for preventing and treating fatigue in chronic HD patients. There is some evidence that exercise may significantly improve fatigue in dialysis patients; however, this requires confirmation through large, prospective, randomized studies.

### Fatigue: an overview [^51c2b825]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Fatigue, a common presenting symptom in primary care, negatively impacts work performance, family life, and social relationships. The differential diagnosis of fatigue includes lifestyle issues, physical conditions, mental disorders, and treatment side effects. Fatigue can be classified as secondary to other medical conditions, physiologic, or chronic. The history and physical examination should focus on identifying common secondary causes (e.g., medications, anemia, pregnancy) and life-threatening problems, such as cancer. Results of laboratory studies affect management in only 5 percent of patients, and if initial results are normal, repeat testing is generally not indicated. Treatment of all types of fatigue should include a structured plan for regular physical activity that consists of stretching and aerobic exercise, such as walking. Caffeine and modafinil may be useful for episodic situations requiring alertness. Short naps are proven performance enhancers. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline, may improve energy in patients with depression. Patients with chronic fatigue may respond to cognitive behavior therapy. Scheduling regular follow-up visits, rather than sporadic urgent appointments, is recommended for effective long-term management.

### Biomarkers for myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME / CFS): a systematic review [^bd50e2bd]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition that may affect between 17 and 24 million people worldwide. The clinical presentation of this illness is complex. Patients experience a heterogeneous array of symptoms that fluctuate over time and affect multiple body systems including, but not limited to, immunological, neurological, endocrinological, and cardiovascular manifestations. Severity of symptoms range between patients from mild to severe where some patients are wheelchair or bedbound.

There is currently no definitive diagnostic test; however, there is a significant body of biological evidence for this condition. Currently, ME/CFS is diagnosed using self-report case criteria following exclusion of any other potential medical explanation. A systematic review by Brurberg et al. identified 20 different definitions used for ME/CFS. The most frequent definitions commonly used in research and clinical practice include the following: the Fukuda criteria (FC), the Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC), and the International Consensus Criteria (ICC). The Institute of Medicine (IOMC) also released a definition of ME/CFS in 2015 that is sometimes used in research. One of the major differentiating features between the later definitions is the cardinal symptom "post-exertional neuroimmune exhaustion" (PENE). PENE occurs upon exertion that results in severe neuroimmune responses. Lack of definitive biomarkers complicates diagnosis and management of ME/CFS resulting in a significant number of people that remain undiagnosed. Furthermore, the reliance on exclusion of other causes of symptoms also results in delays in diagnosis as well as increased costs due to resource consumption.

A biomarker is defined as biological entity that can effectively and objectively differentiate one condition from healthy controls (HC) or from another condition. A biomarker can range from, radiological, physical- or laboratory-based. An optimal biomarker should have a clinical endpoint that is measurable over a short period of time with minimal variability and have a sufficiently higher signal-to-noise ratio. Byrnes and Weigl described key features for optimal selection of biomarkers including trade-offs between complexity of detection, sensitivity/specificity and selectivity its ability to identify disease-causing agents.

Despite no definitive consensus on a molecular biomarker multiple research studies have investigated the prognostic potential of some markers for ME/CFS. This systematic review aims to collate evidence on suggested biomarkers for ME/CFS, critically examine their methodology, and evaluate their efficacy as well as their suitability as a biomarker for ME/CFS.

### An evaluation of exclusionary medical / psychiatric conditions in the definition of chronic fatigue syndrome [^f097809e]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

In addition to its use in research, the definition is widely used for clinical purposes. The clinical application has been hampered because it gives practitioners little guidance on how to determine when a patient is sufficiently impaired or symptomatic to warrant the diagnosis and when to include patients with adequately treated 'exclusionary' diseases who may continue to have symptoms and consequences compatible with CFS. The first issue was partly addressed by the application of empiric methods to the diagnostic process. However, the problem of how to handle exclusionary diseases remained unanswered. For example, patients with hypothyroidism or systemic lupus erythematosus that is 'under control' or inactive, based on physical examinations and laboratory evaluations, may still fulfill the criteria for CFS. Clinically, they are frequently managed as CFS patients, raising the question of whether those who would meet the research criteria for CFS, except for the single fact that they have an exclusionary condition, are similar to those who fully meet the CFS case definition criteria of fatigue severity, impairment and specific symptoms and, by inference, of the underlying pathophysiology of fatigue. It is also recognized that, while the illnesses are considered exclusionary because of their frequent association with fatigue, many with those diagnosed do not have fatigue.

The purpose of this analysis is to describe the prevalence of exclusionary diagnoses identified in a population-based surveillance study of fatigue illnesses and to compare those with and without such conditions in terms of: (1) demographics; (2) specific exclusionary categories; (3) the presence of CFS case-definition criteria; and (4) levels and characteristics of fatigue and impairment. The frequency with which potentially treatable conditions were identified in subjects otherwise meeting research criteria for CFS emphasizes the need for clinicians treating patients presenting with unexplained fatigue to consider these illnesses in the differential diagnosis.

Fatigue panel recommendations

The following recommendations are intended to be used within the framework of toxicity management discussed in the General panel recommendations section, including direction for what grade of toxicity to hold and/or permanently cease treatment, considerations for life-threatening toxicities, as well as recommendations on optimal timing and dosing for administration of corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive agents by grade of AE. Any fatigue-specific exceptions or additional considerations to the general toxicity management principles are noted in the recommendations below.

Evaluation for patients with new or worsening ICI-related fatigue should include CBC, CMP, TSH, fT4, morning cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
If other organ-specific toxicities are ruled out, ICI-related fatigue should be managed similarly to cancer-related fatigue.
Patients with fatigue should also be evaluated for comorbidities that commonly cluster with fatigue, including pain, insomnia, depression, and anxiety.
Patients experiencing fatigue should be evaluated for comorbid conditions that may contribute to fatigue, including hypoxemia, obstructive sleep apnea, anemia, heart failure, liver insufficiency, renal insufficiency, reduced pulmonary function, electrolyte disturbance, thyroid dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, nutritional deficiency, or sedating medications.
Management of fatigue may include non-pharmacological strategies such as energy conservation, energy-level diaries, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and nutritional evaluation, which have been shown to be helpful in cancer-related fatigue and are likely to be helpful for ICI-related fatigue (LE: 1).

### Fibromyalgia syndrome: under-, over-and misdiagnosis [^383ad52c]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is an enigma. During the past three decades, with the gradual acceptance of the validity of FM, it is variously under-, over and misdiagnosed. Evidence-based interdisciplinary guidelines have suggested a comprehensive clinical assessment to avoid this diagnostic conundrum. Every patient with chronic pain should be screened for chronic widespread pain (pain in four of five body regions) (CWP). Those with CWP should be screened for presence of additional major symptoms of FM: unrefreshed sleep and fatigue. A complete medical (including drug) history and complete physical examination is mandatory in the evaluation of a patient with CWP in order to consolidate the diagnosis of FM or identify features that may point to some other condition that may have a presentation similar to FM. Limited simple laboratory testing is recommended to screen for possible other diseases. The 2016 criteria may be used to further confirm the clinical diagnosis of FM. In consideration of the differential diagnosis of FM, attention should be paid to the presence of other chronic overlapping pain conditions and of mental disorders. FM as a stand alone diagnosis is however rare, as most patients with FM meet criteria for other chronic overlapping pain conditions or mental disorders. The severity of FM should be assessed in order to direct treatment approaches and help inform the likely outcome for an individual patient.

### Fatigue in primary care [^2b08aa08]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Fatigue is a common problem in primary care that may represent a reaction to life problems or be a component of a disease state. A careful history, physical examination, and a few directed laboratory tests can usually allow the physician to differentiate between fatigue caused by depression, situational stress, or physical causes such as postviral or drug-induced fatigue, endocrine disorders, sleep disorders, infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, or neurologic disease. Uncommonly, patients may have otherwise unexplained fatigue lasting 6 months or more that fulfills the criteria of chronic fatigue syndrome. A range of diagnostic skills coupled with a therapeutic physician-patient relationship will usually be successful in treating women with symptoms of fatigue.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome – a clinically empirical approach to its definition and study [^a7245d6d]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we found that CFS can be defined by use of readily available instruments that evaluate the major components specified in the 1994 case definition. People with CFS defined in this manner are clinically distinct from those with unexplained fatigue (i.e. ISF) that does not meet the criteria for CFS. Future research studies should define CFS in this manner and this diagnostic strategy can also be used for the clinical evaluation and subsequent follow-up of patients with CFS.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome [^317bf7f9]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic fatigue syndrome affects between 0.006% and 3% of the population depending on the criteria of definition used, with women being at higher risk than men.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of selected treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 169 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 86 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 71 studies and the further review of 15 full publications. Of the 15 full articles evaluated, two systematic reviews, one RCT, and one further follow-up report of an RCT were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 23 PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the effectiveness of four interventions based on information relating to the effectiveness and safety of antidepressants, cognitive behavioural therapy, corticosteroids, and graded exercise therapy.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome: diagnosis and treatment [^1525a5fa]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by debilitating fatigue that is not relieved with rest and is associated with physical symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome include severe fatigue lasting longer than six months, as well as presence of at least four of the following physical symptoms: postexertional malaise; unrefreshing sleep; impaired memory or concentration; muscle pain; polyarthralgia; sore throat; tender lymph nodes; or new headaches. It is a clinical diagnosis that can be made only when other disease processes are excluded. The etiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is unclear, is likely complex, and may involve dysfunction of the immune or adrenal systems, an association with certain genetic markers, or a history of childhood trauma. Persons with chronic fatigue syndrome should be evaluated for concurrent depression, pain, and sleep disturbances. Treatment options include cognitive behavior therapy and graded exercise therapy, both of which have been shown to moderately improve fatigue levels, work and social adjustment, anxiety, and postexertional malaise. No pharmacologic or alternative medicine therapies have been proven effective.

### Genetic risk factors of ME / CFS: a critical review [^c62e31c7]. Human Molecular Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

ME/CFS Case Definitions

Population genetics studies of disease rely on accurate case definition. For ME/CFS, however, no laboratory diagnostic test is currently approved. Rather, clinical diagnosis is made on the basis of physical examination, case history and exclusion of other disorders. For research studies, investigators do not currently apply a single set of diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS or CFS cases. Of the 20 existing sets of diagnostic criteria or case definitions, three are commonly applied in research and the use of a fourth (US Institute of Medicine, now called the National Academy of Medicine [IOM/NAM]) is expected in the future (Box 1). These different diagnostic criteria will select distinct, albeit overlapping, case cohorts and thus may not yield equivalent biomolecular findings.

Box 1
ME/CFS Case Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

1) The Fukuda Criteria developed in 1994 by the International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group. To be diagnosed with CFS, a person must display unexplained, persistent or relapsing chronic fatigue, as well at least four of eight additional symptoms.
2) The Canadian Consensus Criteria. To be diagnosed, people with ME/CFS must exhibit a broad array of symptoms in specific combinations, namely: cardinal symptoms of fatigue, post-exertional malaise or post-exertional fatigue, sleep dysfunction and pain (myalgia, often including headaches); two or more neurological and/or cognitive symptoms from a given list; at least one symptom from two of the following categories: autonomic, neuroendocrine and immune manifestations (with a list of relevant symptoms provided for each) and symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months. The authors also provided a list of co-morbidities and another of illnesses that exclude the diagnosis of ME/CFS. These criteria seek to define patients with diverse symptoms and have been proposed to preferentially select individuals with more severe symptoms.
3) International Consensus Criteria: This modifies the Canadian Consensus Criteria by revising criteria, adding others and removing both chronic fatigue as a criterion and the requirement of a 6-month period prior to diagnosis. For diagnosis, a patient must display: post-exertional neuroimmune exhaustion (broadly equivalent to post-exertional malaise); three neurological impairment symptoms — at least one each from three of four categories; three immune, gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptoms — at least one from three of five categories and atleast one energy production/transportation symptom.
4) IOM/NAM Criteria developed for clinical not research purposes. Criteria were streamlined and focussed on core symptoms: substantial reduction from pre-illness activity levels, evidence of post-exertional malaise and unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment and/or orthostatic intolerance.

### Screening, evaluation, and management of cancer-related fatigue: ready for implementation to practice? [^d0b237b0]. CA (2015). Low credibility.

Answer questions and earn CME/CNE Evidence regarding cancer-related fatigue (fatigue) has accumulated sufficiently such that recommendations for screening, evaluation, and/or management have been released recently by 4 leading cancer organizations. These evidence-based fatigue recommendations are available for clinicians, and some have patient versions; but barriers at the patient, clinician, and system levels hinder dissemination and implementation into practice. The underlying biologic mechanisms for this debilitating symptom have not been elucidated completely, hindering the development of mechanistically driven interventions. However, significant progress has been made toward methods for screening and comprehensively evaluating fatigue and other common symptoms using reliable and valid self-report measures. Limited data exist to support the use of any pharmacologic agent; however, several nonpharmacologic interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing fatigue in adults. Never before have evidence-based recommendations for fatigue management been disseminated by 4 premier cancer organizations (the National Comprehensive Cancer, the Oncology Nursing Society, the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer/Canadian Association of Psychosocial Oncology, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology). Clinicians may ask: Are we ready for implementation into practice? The reply: A variety of approaches to screening, evaluation, and management are ready for implementation. To reduce fatigue severity and distress and its impact on functioning, intensified collaborations and close partnerships between clinicians and researchers are needed, with an emphasis on system-wide efforts to disseminate and implement these evidence-based recommendations.

### Diagnosing ME / CFS… [^c83fd9cc]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points There is no confirmatory test currently available to diagnose ME/CFS. However, people with ME/CFS often are found to have biological abnormalities. Yet none of these "biomarkers" have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to constitute a diagnostic test. Instead, healthcare providers need to diagnose ME/CFS based on a thorough medical history and physical exam, laboratory test results, and ruling out other fatiguing illnesses with a targeted work-up. Proposed Approach to Diagnosis Print Posterpdf icon The proposed approach to diagnosis of ME/CFS is outlined in the figure. An assessment begins when a patient presents with
- impaired function accompanied by fatigue,
- post-exertional malaise,
- unrefreshing sleep, and
- either one or both
- cognitive impairment or
- orthostatic intolerance.
- cognitive impairment or. If symptoms persist for six months or longer, ME/CFS is diagnosed. Patients with ME/CFS should be re-evaluated periodically.

Routine age-appropriate health monitoring/screening is important and should continue. In addition, healthcare providers should remain vigilant for illnesses that have symptoms similar to ME/CFS. Getting detailed medical history and social and occupational histories is critical to assess effects of ME/CFS on a patient's daily functioning. PEM may be delayed after onset of other symptoms, and some patients may not recognize PEM at the start of illness. Healthcare providers can use questions similar to those below to elicit an accurate description of symptoms, including PEM and fatigue: For children, the questions may need to be adapted and parents may be an important resource. Depending on the age of the child, the questions might be asked of the patient, parent/guardian, or both.

Patients with unexplained impaired function with fatigue for 6 months or longer who do not fully meet the ME/CFS case definition can be managed like patients with ME/CFS and monitored for change. ICD-10-CM Codes ME/CFS has a distinct diagnosis code in the ICD-10-CM. The code
- G93. 32
- applies to "myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, " "chronic fatigue syndrome, " and "myalgic encephalomyelitis. " G93. 32 is the best code for providers to select for their patients with ME/CFS. Additional codes may also be added.

### An evaluation of exclusionary medical / psychiatric conditions in the definition of chronic fatigue syndrome [^35bb2f81]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Data collection

Demographic data (age, sex, race, geographic strata) and past medical and psychiatric history data were obtained via telephone interviews and confirmed at clinic by self-administered questionnaires. Height and weight were measured at the clinic; body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the ratio of weight in kilograms to height in metres squared. To complete the screening for existing, but unidentified, medical and psychiatric conditions, participants reviewed current medications and medical history with clinic personnel and had a complete physical examination with laboratory tests recommended for the evaluation of possible CFS. In addition, a psychiatric interview was conducted using the structured clinical interview for disorders described in the forth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (SCID DSM-IV). A review committee of CDC and Emory University physicians and psychologists reviewed all the data collected at the clinic visits to determine the presence of medical and psychiatric conditions considered exclusionary for CFS.

We used the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI) to assess the fatigue status. Functional impairment was assessed by the medical outcomes survey short form-36 (SF-36). The SF-36 also yields two summary scores that reflect the two-dimensional factor structure underlying the eight subscales: a physical component summary (PCS) score and a mental component summary (MCS) score. Nichol's health utility index (HU12) was generated from eight subscales of SF-36. We used the CDC symptom inventory (SI) to evaluate occurrence, frequency and severity of the eight CFS-defining and 10 accompanying symptoms.

Statistical analyses

General linear models were performed in order to examine the bivariate associations between health outcome measures (fatigue, functional impairments and symptoms) and the following covariates: (1) diagnostic subgroups (CFS-like, unwell or well); (2) exclusion status (included or excluded); (3) demographics such as sex, age, race or geographic stratum; (4) BMI. Tukey-Kramer tests were employed to test significance of ad hoc comparisons. We used logistic regression to generate odds ratios (OR) as measures of the association between the inclusion/exclusion status and the demographic factors and qualitative health status. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine the likelihood of a subject being excluded with the adjustment of all other covariates in the model. All tests of significance were two-sided with the alpha level set at 0.05. The analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC, USA).

### ACC / AHA / ASE / ASNC / ASPC / HFSA / HRS / SCAI / SCCT / SCMR / STS 2023 multimodality appropriate use criteria for the detection and risk assessment of chronic coronary disease [^58311f21]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Definitions — appropriate test, ASCVD, risk estimation, clinical scenarios, and CCD are defined for use in chronic coronary disease evaluation. An appropriate test is one in which benefits exceed risks by a sufficiently wide margin and for imaging includes incremental information that augments efficient patient care while being weighed against potential negative consequences. Clinical ASCVD is defined by a history of acute coronary syndrome, stable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, or cerebrovascular/peripheral arterial events presumed atherosclerotic. For decision-making, some clinical scenarios are based on ASCVD risk; clinicians are suggested to use a validated risk calculator for their patient population, and for North American populations, the ACC ASCVD Risk Estimator is recommended. A clinical scenario is a specific set of patient characteristics for which cardiovascular testing may be considered. CCD encompasses heart diseases related to current or prior myocardial ischemia in a stable phase, with patients possibly asymptomatic or symptomatic (angina pectoris, dyspnea, and/or fatigue) that may or may not be related to exertion.

### Tracking post-infectious fatigue in clinic using routine lab tests [^1e72d7de]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a complex, multi-symptom illness involving persistent fatigue, musculoskeletal symptoms, as well as cognitive impairment. Studies show that CFS affects between 1 and 4 million individuals and costs an estimated $35 billion per year in health care and lost productivity. CFS affects roughly 0.2% of the general adolescent population and is a major cause of educational disruption. While viral serology is not necessary for diagnosis, CFS follows infection in at least a subset of cases. In adults, symptom onset coincided with apparent infection in up to 72% of cases; in adolescents, infectious mononucleosis (IM) is the most commonly reported antecedent infection. The reported incidence of CFS following IM is 9–12%. Females appear more susceptible than males. Consistent with this, our group reported previously that 13, 7 and 4% of adolescents met criteria for CFS at 6, 12 and 24 months respectively post-IM, and at 6 months post-IM, 90% of the subjects with CFS were female, while at 12 and 24 months, 100% were female.

Diagnosis of CFS currently relies on exclusion of other medical or psychological causes. Currently there are no validated diagnostic test, although Klimas et al. have reviewed some candidate biomarkers. Confirming many but not all past reports, Brenu et al. and Fletcher et al. found natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity to be low. Fletcher et al. also found evidence that Neuropeptide Y, an immunologically active neurotransmitter, was elevated in subjects with CFS and correlated with symptom severity. Mild hypocortisolism with attenuated diurnal variation has also been reported in some patients with CFS. In addition to the early identification of potential individual candidate markers, studies using multiplex methods have reported broader surveys and more detailed analyses. For example, while Curriu et al. found similar cell counts for T, B, and NK cell populations in general in healthy individuals and subjects with CFS (n = 22), the latter showed significant increases in the T-helper and regulatory T cell subsets. NK cells also showed higher levels of specific activation markers (e.g. CD69). Suggesting altered patterns of immune signaling, Broderick et al. found that a subset of 5 cytokines used in combination supported an accuracy of better than 80% at a confidence level of 0.95 in separating subjects with post-IM CFS versus recovered controls.

### Systematic review: digital biomarkers of fatigue in chronic diseases [^0baa6f43]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our synthesis revealed a number of significant gaps in the current literature surrounding digital biomarkers of fatigue. Despite fatigue being a multifactorial experience, majority of the studies in this review focused on single biomarker categories in isolation. This fragmented approach neglects the potential of combining multiple digital signals, which might more accurately capture the complexity of fatigue. Future research should explore integrative models that blend different biomarker types, potentially yielding more powerful predictors of fatigue across contexts. Another limitation lies in the relative scarcity of longitudinal research. Only a small proportion of studies have employed designs that track biomarker changes over time in relation to fatigue. Without such temporal data, it's difficult to fully understand how digital signals map onto the evolving experience of fatigue in daily life. More longitudinal studies are needed to capture this dynamic interplay. Furthermore, cross-condition validation remains notably underexplored. Very few studies have investigated the same biomarkers across multiple clinical populations using consistent protocols. This limits our ability to distinguish between general fatigue mechanisms and those specific to particular conditions. Studies designed for direct comparison across different pathologies could significantly advance this line of inquiry. While many investigations report correlations between digital biomarkers and fatigue, few go beyond that to assess diagnostic performance. Sensitivity, specificity, and clinically relevant cut-points are rarely discussed, limiting the practical utility of these tools in clinical decision-making. Establishing diagnostic thresholds and validating them in diverse populations will be a crucial next step. Another critical gap involves treatment response. There are not enough studies that have examined how digital biomarkers change in response to fatigue-targeted interventions. Understanding whether these markers are sensitive to treatment effects could position them as valuable outcome measures in clinical trials. Their ability to reflect change over time would enhance their role in evaluating intervention efficacy. The dominance of cross-sectional study designs also constrains our ability to infer causality. For example, while reduced physical activity is frequently associated with fatigue, it remains unclear whether it is a contributing factor, a consequence, or both. Experimental designs that manipulate contributing variables could help untangle such relationships and better establish causal pathways. Finally, methodological heterogeneity continues to be a major barrier to research synthesis. Studies vary widely regarding measurement tools, data processing algorithms, and outcome definitions. Without greater standardization in these areas, comparative analysis remains limited. A consensus on best practices would provide a solid foundation for future investigations and enhance the cumulative value of this growing body of work.

### Assessment of fatigue in adults with disabilities [^848e60b2]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Fatigue is prevalent and can produce major public health consequences. Assessment of fatigue by the PM&R physician begins with a careful history and physical examination, complemented by pertinent rating scales and laboratory studies. In adults with disabilities, a wide variety of etiologies may lead to fatigue. Educating and providing resources about fatigue to patients can help open the discussion about this highly debilitating symptom.

### Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^ba0c8212]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic functional illness that presents with widespread musculoskeletal pain as well as a constellation of symptoms including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep difficulties, stiffness, anxiety, and depressed mood. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia, similar to other functional disorders, requires that organic diseases are not causing the symptoms. Systemic and rheumatic diseases can be ruled out by a patient history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations. Because there are no specific laboratory tests for fibromyalgia, the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria have been used in clinical settings; however, they are not ideal for individual patient diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware of limitations inherent in using tender points in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The multiple symptoms of fibromyalgia often overlap with those of related disorders and may further complicate the diagnosis. One of the most challenging diagnostic dilemmas that clinicians face is distinguishing fibromyalgia from other central pain disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, migraine). Screening questions based on published criteria can be used as a first approach in diagnosing functional illnesses. Numerous studies report a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with fibromyalgia. Therefore, a careful history and evaluation should be taken for the presence of primary mood disturbances. To date, there is no "gold standard" for diagnosing fibromyalgia. Until a better clinical case definition of fibromyalgia exists, all diagnostic criteria should be interpreted with caution, considered rudimentary, and subject to modification.

### A systematic mapping review of clinical guidelines for the management of fatigue in long-term physical health conditions [^3625db4d]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Despite a high prevalence of fatigue and its importance to patients, many people with long-term conditions do not receive fatigue management as part of their treatment. This review is aimed to identify clinical guidance for the management of fatigue in long-term physical health conditions.

Methods

A systematic mapping review was conducted in accordance with Social Care Institute for Excellence systematic review guidance. Bibliographic databases and guideline repositories were searched for clinical guidelines for long-term conditions, published between January 2008 and July 2018, with a search for updates conducted in May 2023. Data were extracted on the recommendations made for managing fatigue and, where cited, the underlying research evidence used to support these recommendations was also extracted.

Results

The review included 221 guidelines on 67 different long-term conditions. Only 30 (13.6%) of the guidelines contained recommendations for managing fatigue. These were categorised as clinical (e.g. conduct further investigations), pharmacological, behavioural (e.g. physical activity), psychological, nutritional, complementary, environmental, and multicomponent. The guidelines rated much of the evidence for fatigue management as fairly low quality, highlighting the need to develop and test fatigue-management strategies in high-quality trials.

Conclusion

This review highlights that management of fatigue is a very important neglected area in the clinical guidelines for managing long-term conditions.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^16faca6a]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor–related fatigue — incidence and panel recommendations note that fatigue occurs in 21% (1% grade ≥ 3), 25% (2% grade ≥ 3), and 36% (4% grade ≥ 3) of patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1, anti-CTLA-4, and combination ICIs, respectively. Evaluation for patients with new or worsening ICI-related fatigue should include CBC, CMP, TSH, fT4, morning cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). If other organ-specific toxicities are ruled out, ICI-related fatigue should be managed similarly to cancer-related fatigue. Patients with fatigue should also be evaluated for comorbidities that commonly cluster with fatigue, including pain, insomnia, depression, and anxiety, and patients experiencing fatigue should be evaluated for comorbid conditions that may contribute to fatigue, including hypoxemia, obstructive sleep apnea, anemia, heart failure, liver insufficiency, renal insufficiency, reduced pulmonary function, electrolyte disturbance, thyroid dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, nutritional deficiency, or sedating medications. Management of fatigue may include non-pharmacological strategies such as energy conservation, energy-level diaries, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and nutritional evaluation, which have been shown to be helpful in cancer-related fatigue and are likely to be helpful for ICI-related fatigue.

### Management of fatigue in adult survivors of cancer: ASCO-Society for Integrative Oncology guideline update [^a528bffc]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

New cancer therapies — immunotherapy-related fatigue incidence and evaluation: In patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), fatigue occurs in 21%, 25%, and 36% of patients treated with anti–PD–(L)1, anti–cytotoxic T–lymphocyte–associated protein 4, and combination of ICIs, respectively, and fatigue is most likely to occur after the first month after initiation of ICI therapy; the most common symptom identified by patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T–cell therapy was fatigue in 62% of patients. The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer recommends that an evaluation for patients with new or worsening ICI–related fatigue should include CBC count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, morning cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone, and if other organ–specific toxicities are ruled out, ICI–related fatigue should be managed similar to cancer-related fatigue (CRF).

### Diagnostic accuracy of symptoms characterising chronic fatigue syndrome [^2b904aa2]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the diagnostic accuracy for single symptoms and clusters of symptoms to distinguish between individuals with and without chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).

Methods

A cohort study was conducted in an exercise physiology laboratory in an academic setting. Thirty subjects participated in this study (n = 16 individuals with CFS; n = 14 non-disabled sedentary matched control subjects). An open-ended symptom questionnaire was administered 1 week following the second of two maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests administered 24h apart.

Results

Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was significant for failure to recover within 1 day (area under the curve = 0.864, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.706–1.00, p = 0.001) but not within 7 days. Clinimetric properties of failure to recover within 1 day to predict membership in the CFS cohort were sensitivity 0.80, specificity 0.93, positive predictive value 0.92, negative predictive value 0.81, positive likelihood ratio 11.4, and negative likelihood ratio 0.22. Fatigue demonstrated high sensitivity and modest specificity to distinguish between cohorts, while neuroendocrine dysfunction, immune dysfunction, pain, and sleep disturbance demonstrated high specificity and modest sensitivity. ROC analysis suggested cut-point of three associated symptoms (0.871, 95% CI: 0.717–1.00, p < 0.001). A significant binary logistic regression model (p < 0.001) revealed immune abnormalities, sleep disturbance and pain accurately classified 92% of individuals with CFS and 88% of control subjects.

Conclusions

A cluster of associated symptoms distinguishes between individuals with and without CFS. Fewer associated symptoms may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of CFS than currently described.

### Tracking post-infectious fatigue in clinic using routine lab tests [^bf4e582c]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

While biomarkers for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are beginning to emerge they typically require a highly specialized clinical laboratory. We hypothesized that subsets of commonly measured laboratory markers used in combination could support the diagnosis of post-infectious CFS (PI-CFS) in adolescents following infectious mononucleosis (IM) and help determine who might develop persistence of symptoms.

Methods

Routine clinical laboratory markers were collected prospectively in 301 mono-spot positive adolescents, 4% of whom developed CFS (n = 13). At 6, 12, and 24 months post-diagnosis with IM, 59 standard tests were performed including metabolic profiling, liver enzyme panel, hormone profiles, complete blood count (CBC), differential white blood count (WBC), salivary cortisol, and urinalysis. Classification models separating PI-CFS from controls were constructed at each time point using stepwise subset selection.

Results

Lower ACTH levels at 6 months post-IM diagnosis were highly predictive of CFS (AUC p = 0.02). ACTH levels in CFS overlapped with healthy controls at 12 months, but again showed a trend towards a deficiency at 24 months. Conversely, estradiol levels depart significantly from normal at 12 months only to recover at 24 months (AUC p = 0.02). Finally, relative neutrophil count showed a significant departure from normal at 24 months in CFS (AUC p = 0.01). Expression of these markers evolved differently over time between groups.

Conclusions

Preliminary results suggest that serial assessment of stress and sex hormones as well as the relative proportion of innate immune cells measured using standard clinical laboratory tests may support the diagnosis of PI-CFS in adolescents with IM.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of anemia [^c90807d0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common condition and is diagnosed on laboratory assessment. It is defined by abnormally low hemoglobin concentration or decreased red blood cells. Several classification systems exist. Laboratory markers provide important information. Acute anemia presents with symptoms owing to acute blood loss; chronic anemia may present with worsening fatigue, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or chest pain. Specific treatments depend on the underlying anemia and etiology. Iron is an alternative treatment for patients with microcytic anemia owing to iron deficiency. Hyperbaric oxygen is an option for alternative rescue therapy. Most patients with chronic anemia may be discharged with follow-up if hemodynamically stable.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome: identifying zebras amongst the horses [^854856ce]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

There are currently no investigative tools or physical signs that can confirm or refute the presence of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). As a result, clinicians must decide how long to keep looking for alternative explanations for fatigue before settling on a diagnosis of CFS. Too little investigation risks serious or easily treatable causes of fatigue being overlooked, whilst too many increases the risk of iatrogenic harm and reduces the opportunity for early focused treatment. A paper by Jones et al published this month in BMC Medicine may help clinicians in deciding how to undertake such investigations. Their results suggest that if clinicians look for common psychiatric and medical conditions in those complaining of prolonged fatigue, the rate of detection will be higher than previously estimated. The most common co-morbid condition identified was depression, suggesting a simple mental state examination remains the most productive single investigation in any new person presenting with unexplained fatigue. Currently, most diagnostic criteria advice CFS should not be diagnosed when an active medical or psychiatric condition which may explain the fatigue is identified. We discuss a number of recent prospective studies that have provided valuable insights into the aetiology of chronic fatigue and describe a model for understanding chronic fatigue which may be equally relevant regardless of whether or not an apparent medical cause for fatigue can be identified. See the associated research paper by Jones et al: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/7/57.

### Systematic review: digital biomarkers of fatigue in chronic diseases [^1d8b13a4]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fatigue is one of the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms reported by individuals with chronic diseases, profoundly affecting their quality of life and daily functioning. It is defined as extreme and persistent tiredness and reduced energy, which could be mental, physical, or both. Fatigue in chronic diseases is multifaceted and often difficult to quantify and measure due to its subjective nature. It varies greatly between individuals and across different diseases and disease states. In addition to reducing overall functional capacity, abnormal fatigue limits physical activity, disrupts daily routines, and exacerbates other symptoms such as pain and cognitive impairment, creating a vicious cycle that worsens patient health.

In several chronic conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), fatigue is a prevalent and disabling symptom. For example, in MS, fatigue affects between 75 and 90% of patients and is often reported as one of the most disabling symptoms. In RA and COPD, fatigue is similarly widespread and contributes to reduced engagement in daily activities and diminished physical function.

### Systematic review: digital biomarkers of fatigue in chronic diseases [^c92883a2]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

One of the key strengths of this systematic review is its comprehensive coverage of multiple chronic diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), COPD, long COVID, cancer, Parkinson's disease, and more. This broad scope allows for a comparison of fatigue patterns across diverse conditions. It highlights commonalities in the relationship between fatigue and digital biomarkers, such as physical activity and HRV. Another strength is the focus on real-world, objective data collection through wearable devices, which provide continuous and non-invasive monitoring of patients' activity, HRV, and sleep. This overcomes the inherent limitations of self-reported fatigue assessments, which are often subjective and can vary due to recall bias. Wearable technologies, like accelerometers and fitness trackers, offer quantifiable data that can be collected over extended periods, providing a more holistic view of fatigue dynamics and give better insights into biomarkers with potential clinical utility compared to e.g. gait lab/laboratory measurements. The review also highlights the potential of digital biomarkers to facilitate personalized fatigue management. By integrating objective measures into routine clinical care, there is an opportunity to tailor interventions and monitor the effectiveness of treatments in real-time, improving patient outcomes. This is especially important for chronic diseases where fatigue is a pervasive and debilitating symptom.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome – a clinically empirical approach to its definition and study [^c0c9bb78]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The lack of standardized criteria for defining chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has constrained research. The objective of this study was to apply the 1994 CFS criteria by standardized reproducible criteria.

Methods

This population-based case control study enrolled 227 adults identified from the population of Wichita with: (1) CFS (n = 58); (2) non-fatigued controls matched to CFS on sex, race, age and body mass index (n = 55); (3) persons with medically unexplained fatigue not CFS, which we term ISF (n = 59); (4) CFS accompanied by melancholic depression (n = 27); and (5) ISF plus melancholic depression (n = 28). Participants were admitted to a hospital for two days and underwent medical history and physical examination, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, and laboratory testing to identify medical and psychiatric conditions exclusionary for CFS. Illness classification at the time of the clinical study utilized two algorithms: (1) the same criteria as in the surveillance study; (2) a standardized clinically empirical algorithm based on quantitative assessment of the major domains of CFS (impairment, fatigue, and accompanying symptoms).

Results

One hundred and sixty-four participants had no exclusionary conditions at the time of this study. Clinically empirical classification identified 43 subjects as CFS, 57 as ISF, and 64 as not ill. There was minimal association between the empirical classification and classification by the surveillance criteria. Subjects empirically classified as CFS had significantly worse impairment (evaluated by the SF-36), more severe fatigue (documented by the multidimensional fatigue inventory), more frequent and severe accompanying symptoms than those with ISF, who in turn had significantly worse scores than the not ill; this was not true for classification by the surveillance algorithm.

Conclusion

The empirical definition includes all aspects of CFS specified in the 1994 case definition and identifies persons with CFS in a precise manner that can be readily reproduced by both investigators and clinicians.

### Common questions about the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia [^7a5350c1]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia has a distinct pathophysiology involving central amplification of peripheral sensory signals. Core symptoms are chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Most patients with fibromyalgia have muscle pain and tenderness, forgetfulness or problems concentrating, and significant functional limitations. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed using an updated set of clinical criteria that no longer depend on tender point examination; laboratory testing may rule out other disorders that commonly present with fatigue, such as anemia and thyroid disease. Patients with fibromyalgia should be evaluated for comorbid functional pain syndromes and mood disorders. Management of fibromyalgia should include patient education, symptom relief, and regular aerobic physical activity. Serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics, and muscle relaxants have the strongest evidence of benefit for improving pain, fatigue, sleep symptoms, and quality of life. Multiple complementary and alternative medicine therapies have been used but have limited evidence of effectiveness. Opioids should be used to relieve pain in carefully selected patients only if alternative therapies are ineffective.

- Urinalysis. If abnormal laboratory findings are present, further evaluation is warranted.

For example, if anemia is identified, further studies are generally indicated to characterize and treat the anemia. These studies might include tests for deficiencies in B12 and folate. Anemia can also be a presenting symptom of celiac disease. Some ME/CFS expert healthcare providers include vitamin level studies, including B12, folate, and vitamin D, in initial testing. For patients with cognitive impairment, assessment of B12 and folate can help identify underlying conditions. Additional tests to consider Additional tests such as imaging and physiological assessments may be needed to diagnose underlying illnesses. These tests might include:

- Cultures or blood tests if an infection is suspected
- MRI or other neuroimaging procedures
- Sleep studies
- Exercise testing
- Tilt table testing, often in consultation with a specialist. Be aware that a patient can have ME/CFS and a co-existing condition that causes fatigue.

They can also have other ME/CFS symptoms like blood pressure abnormalities. These co-existing conditions should be treated appropriately. Extensive testing and frequent healthcare provider visits may exacerbate ME/CFS symptoms. So, follow-up visits should be scheduled thoughtfully. Some patients with ME/CFS may not look ill during office visits. Those with more severe symptoms might not always be able to keep all of their appointments.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^50aaf489]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Post-Q fever fatigue syndrome — epidemiology, features, diagnosis, and management notes that post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever and is the most common chronic outcome after acute infection, yet the data related to post-Q fever fatigue syndrome are limited, and its rate of occurrence in the United States is unknown; the majority of patients are previously healthy persons who develop debilitating fatigue after symptomatic acute Q fever infection with other accompanying symptoms that might include nausea, headache, night sweats, myalgia, intermittent muscle fasciculations, enlarged lymph nodes, arthralgia, difficulty sleeping, alcohol intolerance, photosensitivity, irrational and out-of-proportion irritability, depression, decreased concentration, and impaired short-term memory, and there is no apparent organ involvement; diagnosis relies on persistence of characteristic symptoms > 1 year after a symptomatic acute Q fever infection, elevated antibody titers against C. burnetii antigen, and a lack of clinical and laboratory evidence of chronic Q fever with organ involvement, with all other causes excluded and a thorough search for organ involvement or nidus of infection; management strategies used for chronic fatigue syndrome include graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, and while there are anecdotal reports of limited success using antibiotic therapy, no evidence-based recommendations exist for treatment of post-Q fever fatigue syndrome.

### Current research priorities in chronic fatigue syndrome / myalgic encephalomyelitis: disease mechanisms, a diagnostic test and specific treatments [^d0f4f02c]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness characterised by disabling fatigue of at least 6 months duration, which is accompanied by various rheumatological, infectious and neuropsychiatric symptoms. A collaborative study group has been formed to deal with the current areas for development in CFS research — namely, to develop an understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CFS, to develop a diagnostic test and to develop specific and curative treatments. Various groups have studied the gene expression in peripheral blood of patients with CFS, and from those studies that have been confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), clearly, the most predominant functional theme is that of immunity and defence. However, we do not yet know the precise gene signature and metabolic pathways involved. Currently, this is being dealt with using a microarray representing 47,000 human genes and variants, massive parallel signature sequencing and real-time PCR. It will be important to ensure that once a gene signature has been identified, it is specific to CFS and does not occur in other diseases and infections. A diagnostic test is being developed using surface-enhanced, laser-desorption and ionisation-time-of-flight mass spectrometry based on a pilot study in which putative biomarkers were identified. Finally, clinical trials are being planned; novel treatments that we believe are important to trial in patients with CFS are interferon-beta and one of the anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha drugs.

Methods

Design

This study is part of the NorCAPITAL project(The Norwegian Study of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in Adolescents: Pathophysiology and Intervention Trial; ClinicalTrials ID: NCT01040429, post-results). NorCAPITAL is a combined cross-sectional and randomised controlled trial that primarily aimed to investigate the pathophysiology of adolescent CFS and to assess low-dose clonidine pharmacotherapy to this group of patients; the design has been described in detail elsewhere. In the present study, we used baseline data and follow-up data from week 30. Data were collected between March 2010 and October 2012. Informed, written consent was obtained from all participants and from parents or next of kin if required.

Recruitment of patients with CFS

All hospital paediatric departments in Norway (n = 20), primary care paediatricians and general practitioners were invited to refer adolescents with CFS aged 12–18 years consecutively to our department, which is a national referral centre for young patients with CFS. To be eligible for the NorCAPITAL project, we required 3 months of unexplained chronic/relapsing fatigue of new onset, and in line with clinical guidelines the patients were not required to meet any additional symptom criteria. A standard form required the referral unit to confirm the result of clinical investigations considered compulsory to diagnose paediatric CFS according to national Norwegian recommendations (evaluation by paediatric specialist, extensive haematology and biochemistry analyses, chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, and MRI of the brain). Also, the referring units were required to confirm that the patient (1) was hindered from normal school attendance due to fatigue; (2) was not permanently bedridden; (3) was not struck by a medical or psychiatric disorder (including depression) and/or did not go through any concurrent demanding life event, both could possibly account for the present fatigue; and (4) did not use medicines (including hormone contraceptives) regularly. Patients considered eligible were summoned to our study centre; a final decision on inclusion was made after a separate clinical examination combined with quality assessment of the previously conducted screening programme. Details of the recruitment procedure and inclusion/exclusion criteria are described elsewhere.

All participants underwent an identical investigational programme at baseline, 8 weeks and 30 weeks, which included a 1-day assessment in hospital consisting of clinical examination, blood sampling, autonomic testing and cognitive testing. Immediately afterwards, daily physical activity was monitored for seven consecutive days using the activPAL accelerometer device (PAL Technologies, Glasgow, Scotland), and a self-administered questionnaire was completed.

### Fatigue in adults: evaluation and management [^a6af3413]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Fatigue is among the top 10 reasons patients visit primary care offices, and it significantly affects patients' well-being and occupational safety. A comprehensive history and cardiopulmonary, neurologic, and skin examinations help guide the workup and diagnosis. Fatigue can be classified as physiologic, secondary, or chronic. Physiologic fatigue can be addressed by proper sleep hygiene, a healthy diet, and balancing energy expenditure. Secondary fatigue is improved by treating the underlying condition. Cognitive behavior therapy, exercise therapy, and acupuncture may help with some of the fatigue associated with chronic conditions. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic, severe, and potentially debilitating disorder with demonstrated inflammatory, neurologic, immunologic, and metabolic abnormalities. ME/CFS has a poor prognosis, with no proven treatment or cure. It may become more common after the COVID-19 pandemic because many patients with long COVID (post-COVID-19 condition) have symptoms similar to ME/CFS. The most important symptom of ME/CFS is postexertional malaise. The 2015 National Academy of Medicine diagnostic criteria diagnose ME/CFS. Exercise can be harmful to patients with ME/CFS because it can trigger postexertional malaise. Patients should be educated about pacing their activity not to exceed their limited energy capacity. Treatment should prioritize comorbidities and symptoms based on severity.

### An evaluation of exclusionary medical / psychiatric conditions in the definition of chronic fatigue syndrome [^08e17faf]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

The study illustrates the complexity that exclusionary conditions introduce into both research and clinical considerations of subjects potentially classified as CFS. The exclusionary diagnoses are common; 28% of subjects in a population-based sample had exclusions identified during a personal history telephone interview. Exclusionary conditions/diseases were subsequently recognized in an additional 36% of subjects undergoing a full clinical examination. It appears that during the telephone interview subjects did not know of or did not remember all of their exclusionary diagnoses. This discrepancy could be due to: (1) greater accuracy and specificity of information obtained by clinical examination compared to telephone interview; (2) variable access to healthcare which, in turn, means variable access to diagnostic means; (3) asymptomatic status contributing to unrecognized conditions; or (4) a lack of perception of bodily feelings as being abnormal. The types of diseases identified in the clinic are recognized to be important in the differential diagnosis of CFS and emphasize the need for clinicians to evaluate patients with appropriate history taking, physical examination and laboratory tests. The finding that Black people and residents of rural and urban areas were more likely to have exclusionary conditions diagnosed at a clinic suggests that access to healthcare may be a contributing factor, as limited access to quality healthcare has been documented among these subgroups

### Diagnostic methods for myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome: a systematic review for a National Institutes of Health pathways to prevention workshop [^212ae203]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)/chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is based on clinical criteria, yet there has been no consensus regarding which set of criteria best identifies patients with the condition. The Institute of Medicine has recently proposed a new case definition and diagnostic algorithm.

Purpose

To review methods to diagnose ME/CFS in adults and identify research gaps and needs for future research.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases (January 1988 to September 2014); clinical trial registries; and reference lists.

Study Selection

English-language studies describing methods of diagnosis of ME/CFS and their accuracy.

Data Extraction

Data on participants, study design, analysis, follow-up, and results were extracted and confirmed. Study quality was dual-rated by using prespecified criteria, and discrepancies were resolved through consensus.

Data Synthesis

Forty-four studies met inclusion criteria. Eight case definitions have been used to define ME/CFS; a ninth, recently proposed by the Institute of Medicine, includes principal elements of previous definitions. Patients meeting criteria for ME represent a more symptomatic subset of the broader ME/CFS population. Scales rating self-reported symptoms differentiate patients with ME/CFS from healthy controls under study conditions but have not been evaluated in clinically undiagnosed patients to determine validity and generalizability.

Limitations

Studies were heterogeneous and were limited by size, number, applicability, and methodological quality. Most methods were tested in highly selected patient populations.

Conclusion

Nine sets of clinical criteria are available to define ME/CFS, yet none of the current diagnostic methods have been adequately tested to identify patients with ME/CFS when diagnostic uncertainty exists. More definitive studies in broader populations are needed to address these research gaps.

### A new look at chronic fatigue syndrome / myalgic encephalomyelitis [^44650b64]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

It has been 3 years since the Chief Medical Officer reported on chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) and the time has come for a thorough investigation by an All Party Group drawn from the House of Commons and the House of Lords. We have received many written submissions and are engaged in taking oral evidence in 2-h sessions, which we open to the public as well as interested groups. The group has received a fantastic response to its requests for written evidence over the past few months. Questions that arise for a government response are the lack of provision and support for patients with CFS/ME, the issue of the clinical definition of CFS/ME, the need for a diagnostic test for CFS/ME, effectiveness of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidelines, and criteria used to decide which treatments are best for patients with CFS or myalgic encephalomyelitis.

Editorial note (2 October 2019):
A statement from the Editor in Chief about this review and its planned update is available at https://www.cochrane.org/news/cfs

Background

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) is a serious disorder characterised by persistent postexertional fatigue and substantial symptoms related to cognitive, immune and autonomous dysfunction. There is no specific diagnostic test, therefore diagnostic criteria are used to diagnose CFS. The prevalence of CFS varies by type of diagnostic criteria used. Existing treatment strategies primarily aim to relieve symptoms and improve function. One treatment option is exercise therapy.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to determine the effects of exercise therapy for adults with CFS compared with any other intervention or control on fatigue, adverse outcomes, pain, physical functioning, quality of life, mood disorders, sleep, self-perceived changes in overall health, health service resources use and dropout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group controlled trials register, CENTRAL, and SPORTDiscus up to May 2014, using a comprehensive list of free-text terms for CFS and exercise. We located unpublished and ongoing studies through the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to May 2014. We screened reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) about adults with a primary diagnosis of CFS, from all diagnostic criteria, who were able to participate in exercise therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessments and data extraction. We combined continuous measures of outcomes using mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). To facilitate interpretation of SMDs, we re-expressed SMD estimates as MDs on more common measurement scales. We combined dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs with data from 1518 participants. Exercise therapy lasted from 12 weeks to 26 weeks. The studies measured effect at the end of the treatment and at long-term follow-up, after 50 weeks or 72 weeks. Seven studies used aerobic exercise therapies such as walking, swimming, cycling or dancing, provided at mixed levels in terms of intensity of the aerobic exercise from very low to quite rigorous, and one study used anaerobic exercise. Control groups consisted of passive control, including treatment as usual, relaxation or flexibility (eight studies); cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (two studies); cognitive therapy (one study); supportive listening (one study); pacing (one study); pharmacological treatment (one study) and combination treatment (one study). Most studies had a low risk of selection bias. All had a high risk of performance and detection bias. Exercise therapy compared with 'passive' control Exercise therapy probably reduces fatigue at end of treatment (SMD -0.66, 95% CI -1.01 to -0.31; 7 studies, 840 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; re-expressed MD -3.4, 95% CI -5.3 to -1.6; scale 0 to 33). We are uncertain if fatigue is reduced in the long term because the certainty of the evidence is very low (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -1.32 to 0.07; 4 studies, 670 participants; re-expressed MD -3.2, 95% CI -6.9 to 0.4; scale 0 to 33). We are uncertain about the risk of serious adverse reactions because the certainty of the evidence is very low (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.97; 1 study, 319 participants). Exercise therapy may moderately improve physical functioning at end of treatment, but the long-term effect is uncertain because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Exercise therapy may also slightly improve sleep at end of treatment and at long term. The effect of exercise therapy on pain, quality of life and depression is uncertain because evidence is missing or of very low certainty. Exercise therapy compared with CBT Exercise therapy may make little or no difference to fatigue at end of treatment (MD 0.20, 95% CI -1.49 to 1.89; 1 study, 298 participants; low-certainty evidence), or at long-term follow-up (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.28; 2 studies, 351 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the risk of serious adverse reactions because the certainty of the evidence is very low (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.96; 1 study, 321 participants). The available evidence suggests that there may be little or no difference between exercise therapy and CBT in physical functioning or sleep (low-certainty evidence) and probably little or no difference in the effect on depression (moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if exercise therapy compared to CBT improves quality of life or reduces pain because the evidence is of very low certainty. Exercise therapy compared with adaptive pacing Exercise therapy may slightly reduce fatigue at end of treatment (MD -2.00, 95% CI -3.57 to -0.43; scale 0 to 33; 1 study, 305 participants; low-certainty evidence) and at long-term follow-up (MD -2.50, 95% CI -4.16 to -0.84; scale 0 to 33; 1 study, 307 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the risk of serious adverse reactions (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.97; 1 study, 319 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The available evidence suggests that exercise therapy may slightly improve physical functioning, depression and sleep compared to adaptive pacing (low-certainty evidence). No studies reported quality of life or pain. Exercise therapy compared with antidepressants We are uncertain if exercise therapy, alone or in combination with antidepressants, reduces fatigue and depression more than antidepressant alone, as the certainty of the evidence is very low. The one included study did not report on adverse reactions, pain, physical functioning, quality of life, sleep or long-term results.

Authors' Conclusions

Exercise therapy probably has a positive effect on fatigue in adults with CFS compared to usual care or passive therapies. The evidence regarding adverse effects is uncertain. Due to limited evidence it is difficult to draw conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of CBT, adaptive pacing or other interventions. All studies were conducted with outpatients diagnosed with 1994 criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the Oxford criteria, or both. Patients diagnosed using other criteria may experience different effects.

### Chronic fatigue: symptom and syndrome [^c3301e15]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic fatigue is common, is difficult to measure, can be associated with considerable morbidity, and is rarely a subject of controversy. The chronic fatigue syndrome also presents problems in definition and measurement, is associated with even more morbidity than chronic fatigue itself, and is often controversial. Particularly unclear is the way in which chronic fatigue and the chronic fatigue syndrome relate to each other: Is one the severe form of the other, or are they qualitatively and quantitatively different? We know that many things can cause chronic fatigue, and this is probably true for the chronic fatigue syndrome, too. We can anticipate that discrete causes of the chronic fatigue syndrome will be found in the future, even if these causes are unlikely to fall neatly along the physical-psychological divide that some expect. The causes of chronic fatigue are undoubtedly many, both in a population and in any individual person, even when a discrete cause, such as depression or cancer, is identified. Social, behavioral, and psychological variables are important in both chronic fatigue and the chronic fatigue syndrome. Interventions that address these general variables can be successful, and currently they are often more successful than interventions directed at specific causes.

### Prevalence of myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME / CFS) in three regions of england: a repeated cross-sectional study in primary care [^a695aca5]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There is some evidence which indicates differences between ME/CFS and other chronically fatigued cases in relation to the type and severity of fatigue, somatic symptoms and biological abnormalities. In the absence, at present, of reliable biomarkers, the choice of the most stringent available diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS for clinical and epidemiological studies is justified for its ability to distinguish true cases from non-cases, so as to enable reliable epidemiological inferences and to ensure study validity. However, the ideal would be to sub-group research cases according to clinical and laboratory features that may reflect different aetiologies and pathophysiologies. Use of the CDC-1994 definition in research is desirable as it has been widely used and has shown in our study to capture effectively nearly all cases studied. The improvement in criteria to incorporate more objective measures of severity and functional status, as suggested by Reeves, is desirable, and should reflect the true levels of limitation experienced by those with ME/CFS, to avoid any artificial inflation of prevalence statistics and so encourage trivialization of the impact of such a severe disease on those who live with it.

### Biomarkers for myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME / CFS): a systematic review [^9d4fdb15]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There is currently no consensus on a biomarker for ME/CFS; however, there is significant body of biological evidence demonstrating that ME/CFS results in widespread immunological disruption. Effective biomarkers are accessible and have strong sensitivity, specificity and selectivity to detect disease targets. Additionally, having multiple layers of evidence such as genetic and physiological high test-test reproducibility of results is paramount. The included studies ranged in efficacy, quality, and potential to be developed into a diagnostic biomarker. This review also corroborates the use of NK cells as a suitable model to investigate the pathomechanism of this illness due to the consistency observed over time. This systematic review identifies potential associations between the findings and highlights that these systems do not work independently and rather they could be part of a complex integrative network. The heterogeneity shown across many of the included studies highlights the need for multidisciplinary research and uniform protocols in ME/CFS biomarker research.

### The phenomenon of' chronic Lyme'; an observational study [^9c4f594a]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Purposes

To chart clinical, laboratory, and psychometric profiles in patients who attribute their complaints to chronic Lyme disease.

Methods

We assessed the patients by clinical examination, laboratory tests, and questionnaires measuring fatigue, depression, anxiety, health-related quality of life, hypochondriasis, and illness perceptions.

Results

We found no evidence of ongoing Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) infection in any of the 29 included patients using current diagnostic guidelines and an extended array of tests. Eight (28%) had other well-defined illnesses. Twenty-one (72%) had symptoms of unknown cause, of those six met the suggested criteria for post-Lyme disease syndrome. Fourteen (48%) had presence of anti-Bb antibodies. The patients had more fatigue and poorer health-related quality of life as compared to normative data, but were not more depressed, anxious, or hypochondriacal. Their beliefs about the illness were characterized by negative expectations.

Conclusion

Our patients, who all attributed their symptoms to chronic Lyme disease, were heterogeneous. None had evidences of persistent Bb infection, but whether current diagnostic criteria are functional in patients with longstanding complaints is controversial. Other well-defined illnesses or sequelae from earlier Lyme disease were probable as main explanatory factor in some cases. The patients were not more depressed, anxious, or hypochondriacal than the normal population, but they had poorer health-related quality of life, more fatigue, and negative expectations about their illness.

### Biomarkers for myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME / CFS): a systematic review [^601e9d68]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Quality analysis

Levels of quality varied across the included papers, with six studies appropriately addressing all quality criteria. All studies assessed outcomes in a standard, valid and reliable way for both ME/CFS patients and HC (CACCCS criteria item 8); this is often through use of validated experimental tools. All papers provided appropriate justification for tools used to measure outcomes including, but not limited to, flow cytometry to heart rate monitors. ME/CFS patients and HC were matched in various ways most predominantly age and sex, however, also through BMI and race. In most cases where a confounding factor was identified, the researchers were able to mitigate or control for potential confounding variables using a variety of methods including exclusion, a washout period for medication or statistical adjustment for cofactors. The least addressed CACCCs item was checklist item 2: adequate matching of source population. Appropriate matching of sociodemographic characteristics through recruitment of matched participants from similar geographical regions is critical to eliminate potential sources of bias. Additionally, inclusion of power-based sample sizes, normality testing and adjustments for multiple comparisons is also necessary to ensure accurate and representative statistical outputs.

### A prospective observational study of post-COVID-19 chronic fatigue syndrome following the first pandemic wave in Germany and biomarkers associated with symptom severity [^aeb708a9]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Several diagnostic criteria have been proposed for use in ME/CFS, of which CCC are recommended for diagnosis confirmation in secondary care and in research. Severity and duration of PEM is a key diagnostic criterion of the CCC. In contrast to the original minimum length of 24 h of PEM required by the CCC, we set the duration criterion at 14 h as shown by others to yield the highest diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to discriminate patients with ME/CFS from patients with fatigue due to other chronic illnesses. Strikingly, while all PCS patients suffered from moderate to severe fatigue and exertion intolerance, a subset did not fulfill the CCC criteria for ME/CFS mostly due to a shorter PEM lasting < 14 h. We have not seen such a symptom constellation in other chronic postinfectious syndromes so frequently. The previously widely used Fukuda or CDC-1994 criteria do not require PEM for the diagnosis of ME/CFS thus most PCS/non-ME/CFS patients from our study would have been classified as ME/CFS. Fukuda criteria are, however, no longer recommended to be used for ME/CFS diagnosis as they do not require PEM, the key symptom of ME/CFS. The IOM (Institute of Medicine) criteria do not define the length of PEM but require that it should occur at least half of the time with moderate to severe intensity. Thus many patients not classified as ME/CFS in our study would not have fulfilled the IOM criteria either

Use of exercise to promote PEM was commonly used in some studies. There are significant limitations to use of exercise to stimulate and measure biological changes in ME/CFS patients. The studies also do not cater for potential delays in onset of PEM where some patients reported symptoms presenting post 24 h. In many cases, inducing PEM through exercise requires specialised equipment and transport of patients to specific locations in order to collect data and many patients are unable to participate due to the severity of their illness. There is also a trade-off for specificity in all studies, for example Frith et al. had a sensitivity of 77% but a specificity of 53%. Many ME/CFS patients will experience exercise intolerance but not everyone with exercise intolerance has ME/CFS. Exercise testing fell under the complex and indirect biomarker category as it required specialised equipment that is not available in most settings and has severe, long-term consequences to patients for an indirect measure of ME/CFS.

Most of these biomarkers fall under "moderate to difficult-to-detect" and requires extensive multi-step laboratory experiments by trained scientists in order to make these observations. Considerations for translation of the biomarker from laboratory to more automated high-throughput industry technology are critical. A rigorous approach is required for biomarkers to enter into the clinical stages of development. Byrnes and Weigl described the importance of a biomarker's ability to identify a disease-causing agent. There were limited studies that were labelled "primary" as although onset from infectious agent have been described, there are several pathogens that have been attributed to the onset of ME/CFS. Cytokines and circulatory markers such as hormones were investigated in many of the included studies and are "tertiary" biomarkers. These markers are produced via an immune response and are transient or variable and therefore often unstable as diagnostic targets. Two studies had "primary" markers that identified a disease-causing agent. Onset of ME/CFS through various infectious agents have been described and use of these markers provide valuable insight on mechanisms underlying different onsets, but are limited as a diagnostic tool.

### Modifying cancer-related fatigue by optimizing sleep quality [^f8a77a72]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2008). Low credibility.

Cancer-related fatigue is reported by patients to be the most distressing and persistent symptom experienced during and after treatment. Unrelieved fatigue often accompanies other symptoms and leads to decreased physical functioning and lower health-related quality of life. Various factors, including daytime sleepiness and sleep disturbances, have been reported to influence perceptions of fatigue. This article shares current knowledge about the relationships among cancer-related fatigue, sleep disturbances, and daytime sleepiness, and makes recommendations for routine screening, assessment, and interventions to modify fatigue through optimizing sleep quality in adult cancer patients. Evidence is reviewed for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions for optimizing sleep quality in patients with acute or chronic insomnia secondary to medical illnesses, including cancer. A summary of interventions is presented that focuses on optimizing sleep quality in attempt to lower fatigue. These interventions may be helpful for adult cancer patients experiencing insomnia but will require further testing to establish their efficacy in this population. Recommendations for research are provided, including the need to increase knowledge on the relationships among fatigue, sleep disturbances, daytime sleepiness, and other symptoms in various disease sites, stages, and treatments of cancer and the need for further testing of the measurements used for the evaluation of sleep quality in clinical practice and research.

### Rehabilitation of decreased motor performance in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome: should we treat low effort capacity or reduced effort tolerance? [^af4e84a8]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

The aetiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic delineation and treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) remain a matter of debate. Here some aspects of the debate are elucidated, with a particular focus on the patients' decreased motor performance.

Hypothesis

The pathophysiological basis of decreased motor performance in CFS may, theoretically, involve three components: (1) a peripheral energetic deficit (impaired oxidative metabolism and/or physical deconditioning); (2) a central perceptual disturbance (higher effort sense or increased 'interoception'); and (3) a fundamental failure of the neurobiological stress system, leading to an abnormal 'sickness response'. It is proposed that the first two components may lead to low effort capacity, while the third component may lead to reduced effort tolerance. Although there is evidence for low effort capacity influencing symptoms and functional limitations in CFS, it is assumed that reduced effort tolerance might be the primary disturbance in CFS.

Diagnostic Implications

Distinguishing low effort capacity and reduced effort tolerance may contribute to a refinement of current diagnostic criteria of CFS and the identification of subgroups.

Therapeutic Implications

The above-mentioned distinction may make it possible to formulate a rationale for an effective implementation and adequate outcome evaluation of rehabilitation strategies in CFS.

Research Implications

This new heuristic framework may inform future research aimed at disentangling the complex determination of impaired motor performance in CFS, as well as studies aimed at customizing treatment to different subtypes of patients.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^036a9fc5]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID assessment — common labs and procedures (Table 3) uses symptom-guided testing with "consider" language. For holistic assessment to rule out other (potentially treatable) conditions, obtain CBC with diff, CMP, TSH, and also consider ESR, CRP, CK, vitamins D, B1, and B12. For physical fatigue, to identify treatable contributors, consider ferritin, iron profile, testosterone, and estradiol. For breathing and respiratory sequelae, if not already performed consider chest XR; if breathing discomfort not improving ≥ 8 weeks after acute COVID-19 infection, or if new/worsened later in the Long COVID course, consider PFTs (FEV1/FVC and DLCO), ECG, and echocardiogram; if pulmonary exam, chest XR, or PFT abnormalities, consider noncontrast chest CT. For cardiovascular complications, if chronic chest pain suggests myocarditis consider troponin (preferably high-sensitivity); for decompensated heart failure consider BNP (preferably NT-proBNP); for PE consider D-dimer; if not already done consider ECG, chest XR, cardiac MRI (for myocarditis, if chronic chest pain and positive troponin), echocardiogram (for heart failure/valve abnormalities), and CT PE protocol (for PE). If concern for arrhythmia, consider Holter monitor for symptoms nearly daily, 14-day monitor for symptoms every few days, implantable event monitor for infrequent symptoms, and if initial work-up is unrevealing and/or to guide activity plan, consider cardiology stress test. For autonomic dysfunction and possible cardiac symptoms, if concerned for PE consider D-dimer; to identify treatable contributors consider if relevant autoimmune testing (ANA, RF, Sjögren's syndrome panel, antiphospholipid antibodies); if recurrent palpitations, tachycardia, or syncope, consider basic cardiac work-up, and if negative 10-min stand test, consider tilt table test; note that a tilt table test is not required to diagnose or treat autonomic dysfunction and can cause symptom flare. For cognitive impairment, to rule out other conditions consider thiamine, folate, homocysteine, magnesium, RPR, HIV, and neuroimaging based on history, exam, and lab findings, and see Table 12 for mental health screening tools. For neurologic sequelae, to rule out other conditions consider HgBA1c, vitamin B6, magnesium, RPR, HIV, with consideration of neuroimaging and consultation with a neurologist for further testing.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^d74c322d]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

1.2 Defining iron deficiency

Based on our literature review, it is evident that iron deficiency is not fully recognized as a disorder distinct from iron deficiency anemia, or as one that may have its own clinical consequences. Indeed, the terms "iron deficiency" and "iron deficiency anemia" are often used interchangeably. 31 Where iron deficiency is discussed, it is frequently perceived as the most common nutritional disorder worldwide, 31, 32, 33 but not as a medical condition in and of itself. 34

It is clear that the heterogeneity in how iron deficiency is defined is a knowledge gap that is compounding physicians' lack of confidence in recognizing and diagnosing this condition. The lack of a standard simple definition for iron deficiency hinders its uncoupling from iron deficiency anemia and its acceptance as a standalone medical condition with distinct clinical implications.

1.3 Expert recommendation

We propose the following wording as an overarching definition of iron deficiency:

Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia

1.4 Clinical impact of iron deficiency

Iron deficiency may contribute to several symptoms that can manifest even in the absence of progression to anemia. Although there are symptoms that are likely to be caused by iron deficiency (eg, pagophagia, and RLS), many symptoms are nonspecific, such as fatigue, and exhaustion. 35, 36, 37, 38 This means that physicians and patients do not always recognize that iron deficiency is present and, as a consequence, diagnosis is not pursued and the condition is left untreated.

Physicians may need to actively ask their patients about such symptoms, especially for those patient populations where iron deficiency is highly prevalent, so that appropriate diagnostic tests can be performed and, if necessary, treatment can be given. 35 In this section, we outline the iron deficiency symptoms that have been commonly reported in patients with CHF, CKD and IBD, as well as its associated clinical outcomes that further call for its prompt diagnosis and management.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^be23fb22]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Adrenal size could be considered another marker of adrenal activity, as hypertrophic/hyperplastic adrenal glands could be the result of an ACTH over-stimulation by the pituitary, as seen in subjects exposed to chronic stress, whereas a diminished or atrophic gland may reflect adrenal insufficiency at any level of the HPA axis. However, not a single study could be identified in which the adrenal size has been checked in fatigued or exhausted patients. Similarly, although DHEA-S could also be a potential marker for adrenal atrophy or dysfunction, is still uncertain whether it plays any pathophysiological role in fatigue. Finally, none of the abovementioned methods were accurate markers of fatigue, nor could they be correlated with the HPA axis dysfunction as an etiology of fatigue.

It is also important to note that once adrenal impairment is confirmed using any of these tests, the etiology should also be elucidated. As the HPA axis can be affected by several chronic and/or metabolic disorders, other primary conditions must be excluded before intrinsic disorders of the HPA axis are deemed responsible. Typical differential diagnosis of "adrenal fatigue" and related states are: (1) sleep obstructive apnea syndrome; (2) adrenal insufficiency; (3) mental illnesses; (4) excessive working (overwork); (5) night-shift workers; (6) other hormonal deficiencies; (7) liver and kidney dysfunctions; (8) heart conditions; (9) chronic pulmonary obstructive disease; (10) autoimmune diseases.

Although conflicting data were reported, patients with CFS tend to have a normal cortisol profile, and the abnormalities found can be typically be explained by a poor quality sleeping patterns. Therefore, health providers should not be concerned about adrenal function in CFS subjects once they had been already excluded to other conditions prior to the diagnosis of CFS. Similarly, studies investigating patients with the burnout syndrome were greatly inconsistent So far, HPA axis tests should not be used as markers for burnout syndrome by health practitioners. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the use of HPA axis tests as markers for fibromyalgia and other chronic diseases, which tend to demonstrate inconsistent findings, whereas studies that were performed in breast cancer subjects tended to show depletion of cortisol levels; however, studies in breast cancer were performed while administering chemotherapy, which can introduce a confounding bias.

Therefore, based on our current knowledge, cortisol tests should not yet be used in clinical practice for examining any condition, except if adrenal impairment is suspected. Moreover, glucocorticoid therapy should be avoided in patients, as it can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis, even in low doses.

### A prospective observational study of post-COVID-19 chronic fatigue syndrome following the first pandemic wave in Germany and biomarkers associated with symptom severity [^ff3dcb06]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

A subset of patients has long-lasting symptoms after mild to moderate Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In a prospective observational cohort study, we analyze clinical and laboratory parameters in 42 post-COVID-19 syndrome patients (29 female/13 male, median age 36.5 years) with persistent moderate to severe fatigue and exertion intolerance six months following COVID-19. Further we evaluate an age- and sex-matched postinfectious non-COVID-19 myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome cohort comparatively. Most post-COVID-19 syndrome patients are moderately to severely impaired in daily live. 19 post-COVID-19 syndrome patients fulfill the 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. Disease severity and symptom burden is similar in post-COVID-19 syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and non-COVID-19/myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome patients. Hand grip strength is diminished in most patients compared to normal values in healthy. Association of hand grip strength with hemoglobin, interleukin 8 and C-reactive protein in post-COVID-19 syndrome/non-myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and with hemoglobin, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, bilirubin, and ferritin in post-COVID-19 syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome may indicate low level inflammation and hypoperfusion as potential pathomechanisms.

### Treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome [^f2b9d89b]. Occupational Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

To review studies evaluating the treatment of chronic fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome, to describe predictors of response to treatment and to discuss the role of the occupational health physician.

Methods

A literature search was carried out using Medline and PsychInfo.

Results

Studies evaluating cognitive behaviour therapy, graded exercise therapy, pharmacological interventions (e.g. antidepressants and corticosteroids), immunological interventions and nutritional supplements were reviewed. The most promising results have been found with cognitive behaviour therapy and graded exercise therapy, and some predictors of outcome have been identified. Most of the other interventions were evaluated in just one or two studies and therefore evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions.

Conclusions

By applying the models of fatigue that form the bases for cognitive behaviour therapy and graded exercise therapy, occupational health physicians may play an important role in helping the patients with chronic fatigue syndrome to reduce their symptoms, improve their functioning and return to work.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure (HF) clinical syndrome and etiologies — The cardinal manifestations are dyspnea and fatigue that may limit exercise tolerance and fluid retention leading to pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema, and the term heart failure is preferred over congestive heart failure because not all patients have volume overload at evaluation. The syndrome may result from pericardial, myocardial, endocardial, or great vessel disorders, with most symptoms due to impairment of left ventricular (LV) myocardial function, and HF may range from normal LV size with preserved ejection fraction (EF) to severe dilatation and/or markedly reduced EF. Coronary artery disease, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, and valvular heart disease are substantial causes, and as many as 30% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy may have a genetic cause. HF is not equivalent to cardiomyopathy or LV dysfunction; it is defined as a clinical syndrome with specific symptoms and signs, and there is no single diagnostic test because diagnosis is based on careful history and physical examination.

### A systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials evaluating prognosis following treatment for adults with chronic fatigue syndrome [^f15c98bb]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a serious illness characterized by persistent and medically unexplained fatigue which is severe enough to result in substantial disability. Other symptoms such as musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbance, and cognitive dysfunction are common (Collin et al.). Some researchers consider myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) to be the same disorder, while others consider it a different condition with separate diagnostic criteria (Lim & Son). The current review uses the term CFS, rather than ME, as this has been operationalized in the literature. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE,) estimates the prevalence of CFS in the UK to be 0.2–0.4%.

Prognosis, which is defined as the proportion of subjects who improve or worsen according to a specific outcome, and within a discrete time period, plays a critical role in bridging the gap between research and practice (Kent, Cancelliere, Boyle, Cassidy, & Kongsted; Moons et al.). Indeed, the percentage change, not mean change, may be the most relevant determinant of outcome in CFS (Schluederberg et al.). In their review of naturalistic, cohort, and intervention studies, Cairns and Hotopf reported that over time, 39% of patients with CFS showed some improvement, 7% recovered, and 5–20% deteriorated.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome – a clinically empirical approach to its definition and study [^62bb1b70]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

The primary objective of this study was to implement recommendations of the International CFS Study Group and define CFS on the basis of scores from standardized and validated instruments that assess the major dimensions of the illness as specified by the 1994 CFS case definition. Functional impairment, fatigue and an accompanying symptom complex characterize CFS. We defined functional impairment as scores ≤ 70 on the physical function or ≤ 50 on the role physical or ≤ 75 on the social function or ≤ 66 on the role emotional subscales of the SF-36. We defined severe fatigue as scores ≥ 13 on the general fatigue or ≥ 10 on the reduced activity subscales of the MFI. Finally, we defined the accompanying symptom complex as reporting the occurrence of ≥ 4 of 8 symptoms and scoring ≥ 25 on the Symptom Inventory Case Definition subscale. One could debate our choice of specific subscales from the SF-36 and MFI and the specific cut-off values we chose on the SF-36, MFI and Symptom Inventory. However, these instruments have been validated, have been used extensively in studies of CFS and other illnesses, and are known to be reproducible. In contrast, most studies of CFS merely note that they used the 1994 case definition and they do not generally specify how disability, fatigue and symptom occurrence were elucidated. Thus, it is difficult to assess the validity of their diagnostic criteria and essentially impossible to compare results between studies critically.

### Long-term symptom severity and clinical biomarkers in post-COVID-19 / chronic fatigue syndrome: results from a prospective observational cohort [^281d0f15]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The higher number of women in both study cohorts aligns with the higher prevalence of the post-COVID syndrome in women. This unequal gender distribution further supports the hypothesis of an autoimmune component, which is also more commonly observed in women. However, it is important to note that the limited sample size of male patients (15/51 in PCS and 6/55 in PCS-ME/CFS) prevented statistical comparisons between women and men and thus constrains the discussion on gender aspects.

Another limitation of this study is the drop-out of 19 participants during the study period. Among these dropouts, 63% were initially diagnosed with PCS, while the remaining were diagnosed with PCS-ME/CFS. Another 46 participants provided incomplete data sets. Notably, in a subsequent drop-out investigation, 70% of the dropouts reported symptom improvement as the reason for not continuing the study, which aligns with the higher clinical improvement observed in patients with PCS in our study cohort and highlights the favorable disease course of patients with PCS who do not meet the CCC. While caution should be exercised when interpreting statistical comparisons between the study cohort (n = 106) and dropouts (n = 19) due to the unequal sample sizes, it is noteworthy that the dropouts, primarily diagnosed with PCS, displayed milder symptoms at baseline compared to the study cohort. Despite these limitations, a great strength of this study is the comprehensive disease evaluation including an extensive and interdisciplinary set-up of questionnaires and on-site clinical examinations and functional and laboratory tests.

Taken together, the post-COVID-19 condition can develop into a chronic syndrome with long-lasting symptoms and impairment. The chance of relevant improvement during the time period of 20 months investigated is particularly low in patients fulfilling the CCC, despite symptomatic therapy. Against the backdrop of over 763 million documented SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide (status April 2023), these results suggest that the post-COVID-19 syndrome continues to present a heavy burden for those affected as well as on our healthcare systems. Further studies on the pathomechanism, therapy approaches and how to establish comprehensive and interdisciplinary care networks are urgently needed.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome [^598ec3ae]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

During the past two decades, there has been heated debate about chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) among researchers, practitioners, and patients. Few illnesses have been discussed so extensively. The existence of the disorder has been questioned, its underlying pathophysiology debated, and an effective treatment opposed; patients' organisations have participated in scientific discussions. In this review, we look back on several controversies over CFS with respect to its definition, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment. We review issues of epidemiology and clinical manifestations, focusing on the scientific status of CFS. Modern neuroscience and genetics research offer interesting findings for new hypotheses on the aetiology and pathogenesis of the illness. We also discuss promising future issues, such as psychopathophysiology and mechanisms of improvement, and suggest multidisciplinary prospective studies of CFS and fatigue in the general population. These studies should pay particular attention to similarities to and differences from functional somatic syndromes and other fatiguing conditions.

### Fatigue in patients with inflammatory bowel disease-strongly influenced by depression and not identifiable through laboratory testing: a cross-sectional survey study [^cda7bbb5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Fatigue in patients with IBD remains poorly understood. This cross-sectional study of 189 patients with IBD, aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue, explore its associations with various factors, and identify important implications for clinical practice. It indicated three major findings. First, fatigue was highly prevalent: 63.5% of patients with IBD experienced either fatigue or severe fatigue, regardless of disease type and activity. Second, to address fatigue, physicians should look beyond laboratory parameters, because anemia and lab values which reflect disease activity do not reliably correlate with fatigue. Third, the diagnostic workup of patients presenting with fatigue should include screening for depression.

In this study, the observed prevalence of fatigue in patients with IBD was 63.5% (51.3% with fatigue and 12.3% with severe fatigue) — a percentage four times higher than that reported in the general population. The FAS results in patients with IBD are consistent with those in previously published studies using other fatigue instruments. In line with findings from previous studies, no differences between the type of IBD and the occurrence or severity of fatigue were found. The prevalence of fatigue in patients with IBD in remission was approximately 50% in our study. Nearly all past studies have reported that a large number of patients in remission still have fatigue. Therefore, the fatigue response may be independent of the degree of intestinal inflammation and may be signaled through other pathways.

Management of fatigue in patients with IBD is challenging. If following guidelines, laboratory testing for, and supplementing with, vitamin B12, folate and iron are recommended.

Anemia is one of the most frequent complications in patients with IBD. However, in this study, no association was found between the presence of anemia and fatigue, as 62.3% of the anemic patients and 63.9% of the non-anemic patients experienced fatigue. Conflicting results have been reported, but, the majority of studies are in agreement with our findings. Vitamin B12, folate and iron levels were not assessed in the current study, thus, subclinical deficiencies may have an impact. Likewise, a recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated the effectiveness of high-dose oral thiamine for the treatment of fatigue in patients with quiescent IBD.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome [^eafbd4d2]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is thought to have a worldwide prevalence of 0.4–1% with approximately 240,000 patients in the UK. Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and critically depends on exclusion of other physical and psychiatric diseases. Studies of pathogenesis have revealed immune system abnormalities and chronic immune activation, dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, brain abnormalities, evidence of emotional stress (comprising host aspects) and evidence of exogenous insults, for example, various microbial infections (Epstein-Barr virus, enteroviruses, parvovirus B19, Coxiella burnetii and Chlamydia pneumoniae), vaccinations and exposure to organophosphate chemicals and other toxins (comprising environmental aspects). Emotional stress appears to be very important as it reduces the ability of the immune system to clear infections, it's presence has been shown to determine whether or not an individual develops symptoms upon virus infection, and it leads to activation of the HPA axis. But, emotional stress is distinct from depression, the presence of which precludes a diagnosis of CFS. There is no specific treatment for CFS other than the much underutilised approach of specific treatment of virus infections. Current priorities are to understand the molecular pathogenesis of disease in terms of human and virus gene expression, to develop a diagnostic test based on protein biomarkers, and to develop specific curative treatments.

### An evaluation of exclusionary medical / psychiatric conditions in the definition of chronic fatigue syndrome [^70b47e41]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in research studies requires the exclusion of subjects with medical and psychiatric conditions that could confound the analysis and interpretation of results. This study compares illness parameters between individuals with CFS who have and those who do not have exclusionary conditions.

Methods

We used a population-based telephone survey of randomly selected individuals, followed by a clinical evaluation in the study metropolitan, urban, and rural counties of Georgia, USA. The medical and psychiatric histories of the subjects were examined and they underwent physical and psychiatric examinations and laboratory screening. We also employed the multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI), the medical outcomes survey short form-36 (SF-36) and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention symptom inventory (SI).

Results

Twenty-nine percent (1,609) of the 5623 subjects who completed the detailed telephone interview reported exclusionary diagnoses and we diagnosed an exclusionary condition in 36% of 781 clinically evaluated subjects. Both medical and psychiatric exclusionary conditions were more common in women, blacks and participants from rural areas. Subjects with and without exclusions had similar levels of fatigue and impairment as measured by the MFI and SF-36; those with CFS-like illness (not meeting the formal CFS definition) were more likely to have an exclusionary diagnosis. After adjusting for demographics, body mass index, fatigue subscales, SF-36 subscales and CFS symptoms, CFS-like illness did not remain significantly associated with having an exclusionary diagnosis.

Conclusion

Medical and psychiatric illnesses associated with fatigue are common among the unwell. Those who fulfill CFS-like criteria need to be evaluated for potentially treatable conditions. Those with exclusionary conditions are equally impaired as those without exclusions.

### Inflammatory fatigue and sickness behaviour-lessons for the diagnosis and management of chronic fatigue syndrome [^ebd10b27]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Persistent and severe fatigue is a common part of the presentation of a diverse range of disease processes. There is a growing body of evidence indicating a common inflammatory pathophysiology underlying many conditions where fatigue is a primary patient concern, including chronic fatigue syndrome. This review explores current models of how inflammatory mediators act on the central nervous system to produce fatigue and sickness behaviour, and the commonality of these processes in conditions as diverse as surgical trauma, infection, various cancers, inflammatory bowel disease, connective tissue diseases and autoimmune diseases. We also discuss evidence indicating chronic fatigue syndrome may have important pathophysiological similarities with cytokine mediated sickness behaviour, and what lessons can be applied from sickness behaviour to chronic fatigue syndrome with regards to the diagnosis and management.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome: a review [^136ee924]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Chronic fatigue syndrome is an illness characterized by disabling fatigue of at least 6 months, accompanied by several other symptoms. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about chronic fatigue syndrome.

Method

The case definition, prevalence, clinical presentation, evaluation, and prognosis of chronic fatigue syndrome are discussed. Research on the pathophysiology and treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome is reviewed.

Results

Chronic fatigue syndrome is diagnosed on the basis of symptoms. Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome experience significant functional impairment. Pathophysiological abnormalities exist across many domains, suggesting that chronic fatigue syndrome is a heterogeneous condition of complex and multifactorial etiology. Evidence also is beginning to emerge that chronic fatigue syndrome may be familial. Although chronic fatigue syndrome has significant symptom overlap and comorbidity with psychiatric disorders, several lines of research suggest that the illness may be distinct from psychiatric disorders. Patients' perceptions, attributions, and coping skills, however, may help perpetuate the illness. Treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome is symptom-based and includes pharmacological and behavioral strategies. Cognitive behavior therapy and graded exercise can be effective in treating the fatigue and associated symptoms and disability.

Conclusions

Chronic fatigue syndrome is unlikely to be caused or maintained by a single agent. Findings to date suggest that physiological and psychological factors work together to predispose an individual to the illness and to precipitate and perpetuate the illness. The assessment and treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome should be multidimensional and tailored to the needs of the individual patient.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^230214bf]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

5.10.3.1 Investigations and treatment in IBD patients with fatigue

Good Practice Recommendation 25. IBD patients experiencing fatigue should be investigated for subclinical disease activity and other potentially modifiable factors considered such as sleep pattern, medication side effects, anaemia, iron deficiency, electrolyte disturbance, thyroid dysfunction, vitamin D and B12 deficiency and psychological symptoms (Agreement: 93.5%).

A questionnaire study of 631 patients in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific showed that daily fatigue was reported by 53% of IBD patients with anaemia. Anaemia in IBD can be multifactorial including poor oral intake, malabsorption, chronic blood loss or due to chronic inflammation. Vitamin B12 and iron therapy are easily administered treatments that may correct anaemia in IBD patients. A Canadian population-based study found iron deficiency in the absence of anaemia did not contribute to fatigue. However, a recent European study identified iron deficiency as a risk factor for fatigue (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.1). Muscle fatigue has been associated with low serum vitamin D and magnesium. Other contributing factors should also be considered including pain, sleep disturbance, alcohol misuse and emotional stress. Medications should be reviewed for those that may contribute to fatigue. Corticosteroids have been demonstrated as a determinant of fatigue, although this may be a reflection of disease severity as opposed to a medication side effect. Avoidance of steroids and cessation of immunomodulatory therapy in Crohn's disease were predictors of improved physical and cognitive fatigue, respectively, in a longitudinal study. Recent data have demonstrated higher circulating frequencies of memory T-cells in fatigued patients with IBD. Whole blood stimulation demonstrated higher production of the Th1 cytokines TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Anti-TNF therapy with either infliximab or adalimumab has been shown to reduce the symptoms of fatigue.

### Environmental sensitivity [^13cb19b8]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The concept of environmental sensitivity is popular among a small group of physicians who believe that exposure to low levels of numerous environmental chemicals can cause a disease with numerous symptoms but no objective physical or laboratory abnormalities. The condition lacks a clear definition. Numerous theories that have been offered to explain the condition encompass immunotoxic, allergic, autoimmune, neurotoxic, cytotoxic, metabolic, behavioral, psychiatric, iatrogenic, and sociologic mechanisms. Environmental sensitivity has many features in common with other controversial syndromes, such as the chronic fatigue syndrome. Patients with environmental sensitivity frequently are subjected to unproven and unnecessary diagnostic tests and therapeutic modalities. In spite of the lack of physical illness and absence of pathology, patients often experience extreme disability, because their symptoms are triggered by common environmental exposures. The phenomenon of environmental sensitivity needs to be evaluated critically using scientifically sound methods. The practice of clinical ecology encompasses the practices of environmental sensitivity and its theories. Most methods of diagnosis and treatment have been disproved, and the concepts underlying these theories are not scientific. Alternative means of diagnosis and management are presented.

### The neuroendocrinology of chronic fatigue syndrome [^d654eda1]. Endocrine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a common and disabling problem; although most likely of biopsychosocial origin, the nature of the pathophysiological components remains unclear. There has been a wealth of interest in the endocrinology of this condition, which will be reviewed in this article. Most studied has been the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; although the quality of many studies is poor, the overall balance of evidence points to reduced cortisol output in at least some patients, with some evidence that this is linked to symptom production or persistence. There is evidence for heightened negative feedback and glucocorticoid receptor function and for impaired ACTH and cortisol responses to a variety of challenges. However, there is no evidence for a specific or uniform dysfunction of the HPA axis. Given the many factors that may impinge on the HPA axis in CFS, such as inactivity, sleep disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, medication, and ongoing stress, it seems likely that HPA axis disturbance is heterogeneous and of multifactorial etiology in CFS. Studies assessing GH, dehydroepiandrostenedione and its sulfate, melatonin, leptin, and neuroendocrine-monoamine interactions are also reviewed. There is some evidence from these studies to suggest alterations of dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate function and abnormal serotonin function in CFS, but whether these changes are of functional importance remains unclear. To obtain a clearer assessment of the etiological and pathophysiological relevance of endocrine changes in CFS, it is suggested that more prospective cohort studies be undertaken in groups at high risk for CFS, that patients with CFS are followed up into recovery, and that multidimensional assessments are undertaken to unravel the influence of the various confounding factors on the observed endocrine changes in CFS.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome – a clinically empirical approach to its definition and study [^b5b26598]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) affects 400,000 to 900,000 adults in the United States. At least a quarter of those suffering from CFS are unemployed or receiving disability because of the illness; the average affected family forgoes $20,000 annually in lost earnings and wages (approximately half of the average United States household income); and the annual value of lost productivity in the United States is approximately $9 billion. Despite the public health burden imposed by CFS, effective diagnostic, treatment and prevention strategies are not available because the etiology, risk factors and pathophysiology of CFS remain unknown (reviewed in).

To some extent, the inconsistent and often conflicting results from studies of CFS reflect referral bias. Most published studies concerning CFS recruited patients from tertiary referral clinics. Patients receiving care for CFS are neither similar across clinics nor necessarily representative of the population of people who suffer from CFS. Studies of CFS in the general population of Chicago have found that only 66% of people with CFS have consulted a physician concerning their fatigue and only 19% of them received a diagnosis of CFS. Studies in the general population of Wichita have similarly reported that only 16% of individuals with the illness have been diagnosed by or treated for CFS by a physician.

### Biomarkers for myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME / CFS): a systematic review [^cd70fe59]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although there is no consensus on a biomarker for ME/CFS, several markers have been suggested as potential candidates. The aim of this systematic review was to collate and appraise available literature on suggested biomarkers for ME/CFS.

This systematic review used "biomarker" keywords in the abstract and title to determine the search. Therefore, the only articles that were retrieved were limited to those that specifically contained the keywords as according to Cochrane's guidelines. Studies that did not contain the specific keywords but may investigate related biomarkers therefore may not have been included in the search. This study, however, gives an overview of potential biomarkers in the field of ME/CFS.

Females were more prominent across the studies where 76% of the ME/CFS patients and 72% of the HC were female. In literature, ME/CFS is more commonly reported in females. There is limited understanding as to what mechanism is contributing to sex-specific differences. Only one included study investigated potential factors influencing female predominance in epidemiological datasets through analysis of lipid profiles in male and female ME/CFS patients. Although this study found significant differences, these were against all HC not ME/CFS females; therefore, they did not appropriately control for sex-related differences.

Majority of the participants in this review are diagnosed according to FC. The predominance of the FC use in biomarker studies is a limitation as this criteria is broad in nature and has considerable overlap with other illnesses. There was a shift in criteria used over time, where the much broader FC is phasing out in more recent studies for more stringent definitions CCC and ICC. This is due to the CCC now replacing FC as the internationally recognised definition for both clinical and research use. Evidence of necessity for appropriately selected stringent definitions for detection of biomarkers can be shown in Thapaliya et al. who reported significant differences in patients diagnosed according to ICC criteria. There were no significant clusters found between ME/CFS patients diagnosed according to FC. This indicates that stratifying patients according to case criteria may allow for additional meaningful observations to be made.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^b8822d13]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Therefore, is "adrenal fatigue" an actual disorder? Is fatigue related to depleted adrenal function? Does fatigued healthy subjects present relative adrenal failure? Is adrenal involved in the pathophysiology of fatigue in diseases? Which tests were performed in order to establish markers or triggers? The aim of this systematic review was to determine the correlation between adrenal status and fatigue states, including the recently described "burnout" or "burnout syndrome", and other fatigue-related diseases. The primary objective was to evaluate the methodology for fatigue status assessment, including cortisol tests, and to examine the results of studies involving cortisol and fatigue correlation.

### The biology of cancer-related fatigue: a review of the literature [^6fd281c0]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Understanding the etiology of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is critical to identify targets to develop therapies to reduce CRF burden. The goal of this systematic review was to expand on the initial work by the National Cancer Institute CRF Working Group to understand the state of the science related to the biology of CRF and, specifically, to evaluate studies that examined the relationships between biomarkers and CRF and to develop an etiologic model of CRF to guide researchers on pathways to explore or therapeutic targets to investigate.

Methods

This review was completed by the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer Fatigue Study Group-Biomarker Working Group. The initial search used three terms (biomarkers, fatigue, cancer), which yielded 11,129 articles. After removing duplicates, 9145 articles remained. Titles were assessed for the keywords "cancer" and "fatigue" resulting in 3811 articles. Articles published before 2010 and those with samples < 50 were excluded, leaving 75 articles for full-text review. Of the 75 articles, 28 were further excluded for not investigating the associations of biomarkers and CRF.

Results

Of the 47 articles reviewed, 25 were cross-sectional and 22 were longitudinal studies. More than half (about 70%) were published recently (2010–2013). Almost half (45%) enrolled breast cancer participants. The majority of studies assessed fatigue using self-report questionnaires, and only two studies used clinical parameters to measure fatigue.

Conclusions

The findings from this review suggest that CRF is linked to immune/inflammatory, metabolic, neuroendocrine, and genetic biomarkers. We also identified gaps in knowledge and made recommendations for future research.

### Fatigue in patients with inflammatory bowel disease-strongly influenced by depression and not identifiable through laboratory testing: a cross-sectional survey study [^271fd502]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are relapsing inflammatory bowel conditions characterized by unclear etiology and an unpredictable disease course. In addition to inflammatory activity, psychosocial symptoms such as fatigue, persistent and extreme forms of mental and/or physical exhaustion, tiredness or weakness occur. In some patients, the psychosocial symptoms are more debilitating than the underlying somatic disease itself. A lack of energy, the cardinal symptom of fatigue, is one of the most frequent symptoms in IBD. As many as 80% of patients with active disease and about 60% of patients in remission report this symptom and find it even more debilitating than urgency, diarrhea, flatulence and pain. If left untreated, fatigue can increase over time. Further studies from the USA and France have reported similar high incidence of fatigue (45–65%) in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), at rates comparable to those observed with other chronic diseases such as cancer, multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis.

Although fatigue is highly relevant, it is not well understood by patients or practitioners, and it has received insufficient attention in previous years. One reason for the low recognition of fatigue in clinical consultations might be that fatigue assessment is challenging and not clearly defined. Particularly in time-limited outpatient visits, the psychosocial aspects of disease may be neglected, despite their high importance in patients with IBD.

In previous studies, fatigue has been associated with depression, pain, anxiety, low quality of life, psychological well-being, anemia, and sex. The influence of disease activity is controversial. Some studies have reported that disease activity is a relevant factor. Physicians' current management of fatigue consists primarily of addressing inflammatory activity and nutritional deficits. However, fatigue is highly prevalent even in quiescent disease, at levels above those in healthy controls, and an increase in fatigue over time is independent of disease pattern. Thus, the causes can be assumed to be multifactorial, and the dependence of fatigue on potential influencing factors must be ruled out.

The aim of this study was to further elucidate the influence of disease activity and common complications, such as pain, anemia, depression, anxiety and decreased quality of life, on fatigue in patients with IBD, to identify potential interventional targets for daily practice. In a cross-sectional study, a sizeable IBD cohort was assessed with the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), IBD disease activity clinical scores, paraclinical activity parameters and a large set of validated questionnaires.

### A systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials evaluating prognosis following treatment for adults with chronic fatigue syndrome [^3c72dc4a]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study selection criteria

Studies were eligible if they: (1) contained original data from an English-language, peer-review journal; (2) were randomized and controlled; (3) included participants who met at least one case definition for CFS, including the Oxford criteria (Sharpe et al.) which require 6 months of severe fatigue affecting physical and mental functioning, is present over 50% of the time, and is accompanied by symptoms such as myalgia, mood, and sleep disturbance; CDC criteria (Fukuda et al.) which require 6 months of persistent or relapsing fatigue, substantially reduced functioning, and at least four additional symptoms (e.g. sleep disturbance, sore throat, headaches, or post-exercise malaise); or NICE criteria (NICE,), which requires 4 months of persistent or relapsing fatigue, substantially reduced activity, post-exertional malaise and/or fatigue, and at least one of ten symptoms, including those listed above. Criteria stipulating that screening or assessment was conducted by a secondary care medical doctor or psychiatrist was added during screening to increase the probability of an accurate diagnosis; (4) investigated individually or group-based CBT or GET, or sufficient components of these treatments (e.g. for CBT, addressing perpetuating cognitive and behavioral factors, and increasing activity, and for GET, incrementally increasing physical exercise) as well as these treatments in combination with other interventions not routinely applied (e.g. pharmacotherapy when needed), with treatment at least 12 weeks in duration; and (5) described treatment outcome. Active controls (psycho-social, psychological, and/or pharmacological treatments), passive controls (specialist medical care, relaxation, or flexibility treatments), and non-inferiority studies comparing different CBT or GET protocols were included. There was no maximum follow-up period or upper age limit for inclusion.

Studies were excluded if they: (1) included participants < 18 years old; (2) used idiopathic chronic fatigue or co-morbid diagnoses as entry criteria; (3) did not include at least one outcome related to fatigue, disability, functioning, or quality of life; and (4) were economic evaluations, ecological or case-control studies, or cross-over trials without an independent control group.

### Long-term symptom severity and clinical biomarkers in post-COVID-19 / chronic fatigue syndrome: results from a prospective observational cohort [^f6e40b88]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is characterised by a wide range of symptoms, primarily fatigue and exertion intolerance. While disease courses in the early months post-infection have been well-described, the long-term health consequences for patients with PCS with disabling fatigue remain unclear.

Methods

In this prospective observational cohort study, we evaluated symptom severity and various biomarkers, including hand grip strength (HGS), cardiovascular function, and laboratory parameters, in 106 patients with PCS with moderate to severe fatigue and exertion intolerance at three time points after infection (3–8, 9–16, and 17–20 months). The study was conducted at the Charité's Fatigue Centre and the Charité's outpatient clinic for neuroimmunology at Berlin, Germany from July 16, 2020, to February 18, 2022. A subset of patients (PCS-ME/CFS) met the diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome according to the Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC). The aim was to determine differences in the disease course between the two patient groups (i.e. PCS vs PCS-ME/CFS) and identify correlating biomarkers.

Findings

Patients with PCS-ME/CFS reported persistently high severity of most symptoms up to 20 months after infection, while patients with PCS showed overall health improvement. Although fatigue and post-exertional malaise (PEM), hallmarks of post-infectious fatigue syndromes, were still evident in both groups, they remained more pronounced in PCS-ME/CFS. Inflammatory biomarkers decreased in both groups, but not antinuclear antibodies. Lower HGS at onset correlated with symptom persistence, particularly in patients with PCS-ME/CFS.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that PCS can persist beyond 20 months post-infection and encompass the full scope of post-infectious ME/CFS as defined by the CCC. Sub-classifying patients with PCS based on the CCC can assist in the management and monitoring of patients with PCS-ME/CFS due to their persistently higher symptom severity.
