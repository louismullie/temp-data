## Question

bloody stool managemen

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of bloody stool. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and triage. Then, I should verify the focused history and examination elements that change pretest probabilities. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis by age and acuity. After that, I need to check the diagnostic testing strategy, including when to test, what to test, and what not to test. Then, I will examine empiric management, including fluids, antibiotics, and what to avoid. Finally, I will consider special populations, disposition, and follow-up, and I will double-check for pitfalls like STEC and C. difficile along the way.

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the first hour: airway, breathing, circulation, and rapid assessment of hemodynamic instability, because bloody stool can reflect massive lower GI bleeding and sepsis risk, and I need to ensure I do not miss an upper GI source masquerading as hematochezia, which happens in about 15% of presumed lower GI bleeding cases, so I should keep that in mind as I proceed [^13d47ce0] [^7e155cc5].

> Wait, let me verify the key history elements that narrow the differential: onset and duration, stool characteristics including visible blood versus melena, associated fever, abdominal pain, tenesmus, mucus, travel, sick contacts, recent antibiotics, immunocompromise, pregnancy, comorbidities, and medication exposures such as NSAIDs, anticoagulants, and chemotherapeutic agents, because these factors pivot the workup toward infectious, inflammatory, ischemic, or structural etiologies and guide urgency and empiric therapy decisions [^3bf816e4] [^6b2a8e17].

> I will now examine the physical findings I must document: vitals for tachycardia, hypotension, orthostasis, fever, abdominal tenderness or peritoneal signs, masses, anorectal pathology, and stigmata of liver disease, since these findings stratify severity and influence whether I escalate to ICU care, transfusion, or emergent endoscopy or surgery [^7e155cc5] [^13d47ce0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I categorize by age and acuity. In adults, acute bloody diarrhea is commonly infectious, but I must also consider ischemic colitis, IBD flare, diverticular bleeding, malignancy, and anorectal sources, whereas in children, infectious dysentery, intussusception, and NEC are prominent, and in neonates, NEC, cow's milk protein allergy, and Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis rise on the list, so I should tailor testing and thresholds accordingly [^3bf816e4] [^0b3270b4] [^76bd699b].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic testing strategy and confirm when stool studies are indicated. Bloody diarrhea, fever, severe abdominal pain, immunocompromise, recent antibiotics, travel, persistent symptoms, or outbreak suspicion should trigger stool testing for bacterial pathogens and, when appropriate, C. difficile, with molecular panels increasing yield over culture, though I need to remember that routine testing of nonbloody, nonsevere, short-duration diarrhea is low yield and often unnecessary in immunocompetent hosts [^3ea7defb] [^568e037e] [^7a5de80b].

> I need to ensure I do not miss Shiga toxin–producing E. coli, so I should double-check that I order both culture for O157:H7 and a Shiga toxin assay for non-O157 STEC when bloody diarrhea is present, and I should avoid antibiotics if STEC is suspected because of HUS risk, while monitoring CBC, platelets, and renal function closely for evolving hemolytic uremic syndrome, especially in children [^1965d662] [^6bd3a2a4] [^33406b49].

> Let me consider noninfectious causes when the story fits: ischemic colitis in older adults with vascular risk factors or postoperative states, IBD flares with characteristic patterns and extraintestinal features, and medication-induced colitis including C. difficile after antibiotics or immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis, which may present with bloody diarrhea and requires prompt recognition and steroid management when severe [^48eb29e9] [^900ba9f4] [^ddea3d10].

> For pediatric patients, I should confirm that I include intussusception on the list when there is intermittent pain, vomiting, or lethargy, even if rectal bleeding is absent or late, because guaiac or visible blood has poor diagnostic performance and should not delay ultrasound, which is the first-line test, and I should remember that bloody stool can be a relatively late sign in NEC, so I must maintain a high index of suspicion in preterm infants with feeding intolerance and abdominal distension [^f6f34e80] [^f56c41e3] [^d3d21a04].

> I should double-check the role of fecal calprotectin. In acute bloody diarrhea, calprotectin is often elevated and cannot distinguish infection from IBD, so it is not helpful for initial triage, whereas in chronic bloody diarrhea with alarm features, colonoscopy is indicated regardless of calprotectin, and in suspected IBD flares, calprotectin can support disease activity assessment but should not replace endoscopic evaluation when alarm features are present [^56c48f35].

> Now, I will examine empiric management, starting with universal supportive care: oral rehydration for mild to moderate dehydration, IV crystalloids for severe dehydration or hemodynamic instability, correction of electrolytes, and avoidance of antidiarrheals in suspected invasive bacterial diarrhea because they may worsen disease, while reserving loperamide for nonbloody, nonfebrile watery diarrhea when the benefit outweighs risk [^3bf816e4] [^7a5de80b].

> But wait, what if antibiotics are indicated despite the general principle to avoid them in bloody diarrhea. I should confirm exceptions: infants under 3 months, immunocompromised patients with severe disease, those with high fever and dysentery suggesting Shigella, or recent international travel with systemic features may warrant empiric therapy, with adults typically receiving a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin based on local susceptibility and travel history, and children receiving azithromycin or a third-generation cephalosporin when appropriate, while strictly avoiding antibiotics if STEC is suspected [^3c3125a9] [^7a5d09e9] [^6bd3a2a4].

> Hold on, I should verify C. difficile considerations. Bloody stools are not expected in C. difficile, but severe colitis can occasionally bleed, so if there is recent antibiotic exposure or healthcare association, I should test for C. difficile with a toxin-based assay on diarrheal stool and avoid antipersitaltics, treating with guideline-directed antibiotics if positive while reassessing for complications like toxic megacolon [^1965d662] [^3ea7defb].

> Next, I should review endoscopic strategy for lower GI bleeding. In hemodynamically stable patients, colonoscopy after adequate preparation is the first-line diagnostic and therapeutic modality, ideally within 24 hours for high-risk patients, with careful inspection during insertion and withdrawal, use of a clear cap, and attempts to intubate the terminal ileum to exclude a proximal source, reserving unprepped sigmoidoscopy only when colonoscopy is not feasible and the patient is too unstable for prep [^ccefdc15] [^c0e0f61a] [^4d81623e].

> I need to ensure disposition is aligned with risk. High-risk features such as ongoing bleeding, hemodynamic instability, comorbidities, age over 60, or suspected severe colitis warrant ICU-level care, early gastroenterology and surgical consultation, and consideration of transfusion to maintain hemoglobin at or above 7 g/dL, or 9 g/dL in those with significant comorbidities or anticipated delays, while low-risk patients may be managed on the floor with planned colonoscopy and close monitoring [^7e155cc5] [^13d47ce0].

> Let me reconsider special populations and follow-up. In people with HIV, severe or persistent bloody diarrhea warrants inpatient evaluation and broader empiric antibiotics, with carbapenems considered if Shigella or Campylobacter bacteremia is suspected, whereas in children, I should avoid routine antibiotics for nonbloody diarrhea but maintain a lower threshold to test and treat when dysentery is present, and in neonates, any bloody stool should prompt evaluation for NEC, with probiotics such as Bifidobacterium infantis EVC001 showing promise for reducing NEC and bloody stools in preterm infants, though protocols should be institutional and evidence-based [^9ac7861c] [^d79e429b] [^a964a4a8].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have addressed patient education and public health steps: hand hygiene, safe food handling, return precautions for worsening pain, fever, decreased urine output, or recurrent bleeding, and, when a bacterial pathogen is identified, coordination with public health for contact management and outbreak control, because these measures reduce transmission and improve outcomes at both individual and population levels [^3bf816e4] [^5b07aa36].

Bloody stool management starts with **immediate stabilization** (airway, breathing, circulation) and **early identification of the bleeding source** [^7e155cc5]. For acute lower GI bleeding, colonoscopy within 24 hours after stabilization is first-line for diagnosis and therapy [^ccefdc15]; if unstable, use CTA or tagged RBC scan to localize bleeding and guide angiographic embolization or surgery [^7e155cc5]. In children, prioritize **NEC, intussusception, and infectious colitis** [^0b3270b4]; in adults, consider diverticular bleeding, ischemia, IBD, malignancy, and anorectal sources [^13d47ce0]. Avoid antibiotics for STEC [^6bd3a2a4]; use supportive care, transfuse to hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL (≥ 9 g/dL if comorbidities) [^7e155cc5], and escalate to surgery or interventional radiology if bleeding persists [^7e155cc5].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

- **Airway, breathing, circulation**: Immediate stabilization is critical; establish IV access and initiate fluid resuscitation [^7e155cc5].

- **Hemodynamic assessment**: Evaluate for shock, tachycardia, hypotension, and orthostatic changes [^7e155cc5].

- **Laboratory evaluation**: CBC, electrolytes, renal function, coagulation profile, and type and crossmatch [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** varies by age and clinical context:

| **Age group** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Neonates | - NEC [^d3d21a04] <br/> - Anal fissures <br/> - Milk protein allergy [^notfound] |
| Infants and children | - Infectious colitis (Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli O157:H7) [^57102f5b] <br/> - Intussusception [^f56c41e3] <br/> - Meckel's diverticulum <br/> - IBD [^6ced5da9] |
| Adults | - Diverticular bleeding [^notfound] <br/> - IBD [^56c48f35] <br/> - Ischemic colitis [^48eb29e9] <br/> - Malignancy [^notfound] <br/> - Anorectal sources (hemorrhoids, fissures) [^6b529f55] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Colonoscopy**: Preferred initial diagnostic and therapeutic modality for acute lower GI bleeding; perform within 24 hours after stabilization [^ccefdc15] [^c0e0f61a].

- **CT angiography**: Use if colonoscopy is inconclusive or patient is unstable; helps localize bleeding for embolization or surgery [^7e155cc5].

- **Tagged RBC scan**: Alternative when CTA is unavailable or contraindicated [^notfound].

- **Upper endoscopy**: Consider if upper GI bleeding is suspected (melena, hemodynamic instability) [^13d47ce0].

---

## Management strategies

### General measures

General measures include **supportive care** — IV fluids, electrolyte correction, and transfusion to maintain hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL (≥ 9 g/dL if comorbidities) [^7e155cc5] — and **antibiotic stewardship**, avoiding empiric antibiotics unless infection is suspected or confirmed [^3c3125a9].

---

### Specific interventions

- **Endoscopic therapy**: Hemoclips, epinephrine injection, bipolar electrocoagulation, or argon plasma coagulation for identified bleeding sources [^notfound].

- **Angiographic embolization**: For refractory bleeding or when colonoscopy is inconclusive [^notfound].

- **Surgery**: Reserved for ongoing bleeding despite endoscopic therapy, hemodynamic instability, or suspected malignancy [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: NEC requires immediate surgical consultation; intussusception may require air or contrast enema reduction [^notfound].

- **Antibiotic-associated colitis**: Discontinue offending antibiotics; treat C. difficile with metronidazole or vancomycin [^notfound].

- **STEC**: Avoid antibiotics due to increased risk of HUS; monitor renal function closely [^6bd3a2a4].

---

## Follow-up and prevention

Follow-up should include **colonoscopy for unresolved cases** to exclude malignancy or IBD [^56c48f35], and prevention focuses on patient education about diet, hydration, and when to seek care, plus management of underlying conditions (e.g. IBD, hemorrhoids) [^notfound].

---

Bloody stool management requires **rapid stabilization**, targeted diagnostics, and source-specific therapy, with colonoscopy as the cornerstone for stable patients and escalation to CTA, embolization, or surgery for unstable or refractory cases [^7e155cc5].

### Acute bloody diarrhea: a medical emergency for patients of all ages [^aa466d66]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute bloody diarrhea should be considered a medical emergency. Its causes are frequently serious or actionable or both and are usually identified. However, acute bloody diarrhea as a stand-alone clinical presentation has received little scholarly attention in the past several decades. Although the range of possible causes of acute bloody diarrhea is broad, infectious considerations are paramount and should always be prioritized in the evaluation of such patients. History, examination, and laboratory testing should be focused on minimizing time to diagnosis (and, by extension, to implementing appropriate therapy). Strategically chosen tests and imaging, avoidance of extraneous diagnostic pursuits, and provision of supportive care while awaiting diagnostic clarity are central to the adroit management of patients with acute bloody diarrhea. Diagnostic considerations differ somewhat between adults and children but have many elements in common, including the need for vigilance in detecting Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection. In this review, we discuss diagnostic approaches (emphasizing the importance of rapid, accurate, and thorough microbiologic investigation) and measures that can be taken to support patients while awaiting information that determines the cause of their disease. These topics are discussed in the context of the medical care that is available to children and adults with bloody diarrhea in most institutions in developed nations.

Empiric management of infectious diarrhea — bloody diarrhea indications and agents: In immunocompetent children and adults, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bloody diarrhea while waiting for results of investigations is not recommended (strong, low), except for infants < 3 months of age with suspicion of bacterial etiology, ill immunocompetent people with fever documented in a medical setting, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and bacillary dysentery presumptively due to Shigella, and people who have recently traveled internationally with body temperatures ≥ 38.5°C and/or signs of sepsis (weak, low). In adults, empiric antimicrobial therapy should be either a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin, or azithromycin, depending on the local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate). Empiric therapy for children includes a third-generation cephalosporin for infants < 3 months of age and others with neurologic involvement, or azithromycin, depending on local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate). Empiric antibacterial treatment should be considered in immunocompromised people with severe illness and bloody diarrhea (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with bloody diarrhea should not be offered empiric treatment and should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate). People with clinical features of sepsis who are suspected of having enteric fever should be treated empirically with broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy after blood, stool, and urine culture collection (strong, low).

### Severe acute diarrhea [^2abcddeb]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute diarrhea is commonly caused by an infection. Severe acute diarrhea warrants immediate medical evaluation and hospitalization. Indications for stool studies include fever; bloody diarrhea; recent travel to an endemic area; recent antibiotics; immunosuppression; and occupational risks, such as food handlers. Noninfectious causes include inflammatory bowel disease, radiation enteritis, and intestinal ischemia. Management of severe acute diarrhea includes intravenous fluid rehydration and empiric antibiotics. Use of antidiarrheal agents is controversial when invasive pathogens are suspected.

Enteric fever and STEC antimicrobial guidance — bloody diarrhea: People with clinical features of sepsis who are suspected of having enteric fever should be treated empirically with broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy after blood, stool, and urine culture collection (strong, low), antimicrobial therapy should be narrowed when antimicrobial susceptibility testing results become available (strong, high), and if an isolate is unavailable and there is a clinical suspicion of enteric fever, antimicrobial choice may be tailored to susceptible patterns from the setting where acquisition occurred (weak, low). Antimicrobial therapy for people with infections attributed to STEC O157 and other STEC that produce Shiga toxin 2 (or if the toxin genotype is unknown) should be avoided (strong, moderate), whereas antimicrobial therapy for people with infections attributed to other STEC that do not produce Shiga toxin 2 is debatable due to insufficient evidence of benefit or the potential harm associated with some classes of antimicrobial agents (strong, low).

### Bloody stools in a 3-day-old term infant [^2b0473fa]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

A 3-day-old term, male infant presented to the emergency department for evaluation of bloody stools. The infant was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy followed by a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery. The mother was group B Streptococcus colonized, and received antenatal penicillin prophylaxis. The infant received routine delivery room care, and was given ophthalmic erythromycin and intramuscular vitamin K. Circumcision was performed without bleeding and he was discharged from the newborn nursery and the hospital after 48 hours. On the day of presentation, he had streaky bright red blood in 4 consecutive stools. After discussion with the infant's pediatrician, the parents took him to the emergency department. The infant was afebrile, nursing well without emesis, and had made ∼10 wet diapers that day. The physical examination revealed a fussy infant with mild tachycardia, tachypnea, and scleral icterus. The complete blood count was unremarkable. Serum total bilirubin was 11.9 mg/dL, sodium 156 mmol/L, chloride 120 mmol/L, potassium 4.7 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 16 mmol/L. International normalized ratio was prolonged at 2.7, prothrombin time 26.6 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 38.9 seconds. The stool was hemeoccult positive. An obstructive radiograph series of the abdomen showed a nonobstructed gas pattern. Official radiology interpretation the following day reported possible pneumatosis intestinalis in the left and right colon. Our multidisciplinary panel will discuss the assessment of bloody stools in the term newborn, evaluation of electrolyte abnormalities, the diagnosis, and patient management.

### Chronic diarrhea: diagnosis and management [^717dfbbc]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; 4 weeks is a frequently used cutoff. Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of particular causes of diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency (Rome criteria). Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct therapy in some. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected on the basis of history alone. Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there is no obvious cause evident, or the differential diagnosis needs further delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed testing and more rapid diagnosis. Empiric antidiarrheal therapy can be used to mitigate symptoms in most patients for whom a specific treatment is not available.

### Identification and management of Shigella infection in children with diarrhoea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^31a23c91]. The Lancet: Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Clinicians should continue to aggressively manage dysentery, but should be aware that the absence of dysentery does not indicate a low risk of death and does not exclude Shigella as a cause of diarrhoea. In particularly vulnerable children with diarrhoea, such as those younger than 2 years or with malnutrition, identification and treatment of Shigella infection might be life-saving. Clinical trials are urgently needed to support the development of management guidelines for non-dysenteric Shigella infections.

The Shigella genus includes four species — S dysenteriae, S sonnei, S flexneri, and S boydii — and unique serotypes, such as S dysenteriae type 1. These species vary in their tendency to cause dysentery. S dysenteriae type 1 and, to a lesser extent, S flexneri are most strongly associated with bloody stool. However, recent studies have shown a global decline in the incidence of S dysenteriae type 1, which can cause epidemic or pandemic dysentery. In the Global Enteric Multicenter Studyof 9439 children with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in seven countries between 2007 and 2011, no cases of S dysenteriae type 1 were identified, and this serotype was not identified in 56 958 diarrhoeal episodes recorded in another multicountry study. Surveillance data from Bangladesh have not documented a case of S dysenteriae type 1 infection since 2005, while the prevalence of other Shigella serotypes has remained relatively constant. This change in species prevalence might result in fewer children with Shigella infection presenting with bloody stool; therefore, fewer children might receive antibiotic treatment with current guidelines.

Because of the ongoing contribution of Shigella to childhood diarrhoeal morbidity and mortality, and the changing epidemiology of Shigella globally, we aimed to examine evidence supporting dysentery-based Shigella management and to systematically review the available literature to assess associations between symptomatic Shigella infection, dysentery, and death. We also aimed to examine the diagnostic value of dysentery for identifying individuals infected with Shigella and the efficacy of antibiotics for children with Shigella or dysentery, or both.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) — heterogeneity and geographic variation: Summary Statement 6: Consider FPIES a heterogeneous disorder associated with a number of geographic variations in the features of disease, representing a spectrum of "syndromes" as opposed to a uniform "syndrome." [Strength of recommendation: Strong; Evidence strength: IIb-III; Evidence grade: B]. The majority of reports are from Western countries and predominantly involve white populations, whereas Japanese data suggest different phenotypes; in Japanese infants with FPIES, vomiting was observed in 100%, bloody stools in 47%, and fever in 13% at initial presentation. Forty-seven percent had detectable serum CM-specific IgE (sIgE), and 10% reported symptoms during breast-feeding, and this phenotype appears distinct in Japan compared with the vomiting-predominant presentation without bloody stools more commonly reported elsewhere.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^3ea7defb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Diagnostics — stool testing indications and STEC methods: Stool testing should be performed for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, C. difficile, and STEC in people with diarrhea accompanied by fever, bloody or mucoid stools, severe abdominal cramping or tenderness, or signs of sepsis. Bloody stools are not an expected manifestation of infection with C. difficile. STEC O157 should be assessed by culture and non-O157 STEC should be detected by Shiga toxin or genomic assays; Sorbitol-MacConkey agar or an appropriate chromogenic agar alternative is recommended to screen for O157:H7 STEC; detection of Shiga toxin is needed to detect other STEC serotype.

### British society of gastroenterology: diagnosis and management of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^6921da17]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

New guidelines have been produced through collaborative work between the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland, the British Society of Interventional Radiology, the Royal College of Radiologists, National Health Service Blood and Transplants and patient representatives. This is the first UK national guidance for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). The focus is the in-hospital management of adult patients presenting with acute LGIB. LGIB refers to patients presenting with bright or dark red blood per rectum, clots per rectum or blood mixed with stool. We provide a commentary and overview of the key features, with a particular focus on risk assessment, management, investigations, and radiological and endoscopic intervention.

### Recommendations for diagnosis of Shiga toxin – producing Escherichia coli infections by clinical laboratories [^714f3aab]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical testing considerations for Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) emphasize that "patients with STEC infection do not have visibly bloody stools," so "the absence of blood in the stool does not rule out the possibility of a STEC-associated diarrheal illness," and white blood cells "are often but not always detected" and "should not be used as a criterion for STEC testing." Selective testing by age or season risks missed cases: "Selective testing on the basis of patient age or season of the year also might result in undetected infections," and "almost half of all STEC isolates are from persons aged > 12 years," while "infections and outbreaks occur throughout the year." Timing is critical: "Stools should be tested as early as possible in the course of illness; bacteria might be difficult or impossible to detect in the stool after 1 week of illness," and early detection and proper management "are especially important among children because they are the age group most likely to have an infection that develops into HUS." In hospitals, "STEC testing might not be warranted, or selective STEC testing might be appropriate, for patients who have been hospitalized for ≥ 3 days," yet "when a patient is admitted to the hospital with symptoms of a diarrheal illness, a stool culture with STEC testing might be appropriate, regardless of the number of days of hospitalization."

### Health supervision in the management of children and adolescents with IBD: NASPGHAN recommendations [^6ced5da9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

Health supervision in the management of children and adolescents with IBD — ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic inflammatory disorders that can affect the gastrointestinal tract of children and adults. Children with UC or CD can present to primary care with abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and bloody stool, and although these diseases are more predominant in adults, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that a significant percentage are diagnosed during childhood. The chronic inflammatory process and waxing and waning symptoms can be especially disruptive to physical, social, and academic development, and physicians caring for children must consider these diseases when evaluating compatible symptoms. The cause is unknown but likely involves interplay between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. When frequent visits to subspecialty referral centers are not geographically feasible, primary care providers can be active participants in the management of pediatric patients with IBD.

### Acute gastrointestinal bleeding-a new approach to clinical and endoscopic management [^4099c676]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Overt or occult gastrointestinal bleeding is a frequently observed condition in routine gastroenterological practice. Occult gastrointestinal bleeding is usually a purely incidental finding, based on the discovery of iron deficiency anemia in the laboratory or blood in stool (a positive Hemoccult test). However, overt bleeding accompanied by the clinical features of tarry stool, hematemesis, or hematochezia may be a life-threatening condition, calling for immediate emergency management. In contrast to traumatology, algorithms of emergency and intensive medicine are not sufficiently validated yet for acute life-threatening bleeding. The purpose of this review was to present all established and new endoscopic hemostasis techniques and to evaluate their efficacy, as well as to provide the treating endoscopist with practical advice on how he/she could incorporate these procedures into acute medical management. The recommendations are based on inspection of the study results in the recent published literature, as well as emergency medicine algorithms in traumatology.

### Acute diarrhea in adults [^3bf816e4]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute diarrheal disease accounts for 179 million outpatient visits annually in the United States. Diarrhea can be categorized as inflammatory or noninflammatory, and both types have infectious and noninfectious causes. Infectious noninflammatory diarrhea is often viral in etiology and is the most common presentation; however, bacterial causes are also common and may be related to travel or foodborne illness. History for patients with acute diarrhea should include onset and frequency of symptoms, stool character, a focused review of systems including fever and other symptoms, and evaluation of exposures and risk factors. The physical examination should include evaluation for signs of dehydration, sepsis, or potential surgical processes. Most episodes of acute diarrhea in countries with adequate food and water sanitation are uncomplicated and self-limited, requiring only an initial evaluation and supportive treatment. Additional diagnostic evaluation and management may be warranted when diarrhea is bloody or mucoid or when risk factors are present, including immunocompromise or recent hospitalization. Unless an outbreak is suspected, molecular studies are preferred over traditional stool cultures. In all cases, management begins with replacing water, electrolytes, and nutrients. Oral rehydration is preferred; however, signs of severe dehydration or sepsis warrant intravenous rehydration. Antidiarrheal agents can be symptomatic therapy for acute watery diarrhea and can help decrease inappropriate antibiotic use. Empiric antibiotics are rarely warranted, except in sepsis and some cases of travelers' or inflammatory diarrhea. Targeted antibiotic therapy may be appropriate following microbiologic stool assessment. Hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, and food and water safety measures are integral to preventing infectious diarrheal illnesses.

### Inflammatory bowel disease andinfection: clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management [^ddea3d10]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation

CDI in IBD with young onset has a long course of disease and high mortality. The clinical features of IBD patients with CDI are often atypical and may be characterized by watery stools, bloody stools, fever, leukocytosis, and even toxic colitis. Furthermore, the incidence of extraintestinal manifestations was higher, including arthritis, osteoporosis, osteomalacia, gangrenous pyoderma, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, and chronic pancreatitis. But, the classic endoscopic manifestation of pseudomembranous colitis is uncommon, it is difficult to distinguish CDI with active IBD. Currently, the guidelines recommend routine screening for CDI in IBD patients with worsening diarrhea.

### Effect of a multi-faceted quality improvement intervention on inappropriate antibiotic use in children with non-bloody diarrhoea admitted to district hospitals in Kenya [^5362aea6]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Diarrhoea remains one of the leading causes of mortality in childhood, accounting for 15% of the approximately 8.7 million deaths of under-5 year olds worldwide in 2008 alone. Current best-practice guidance for treatment of diarrhoea is contained within the World Health Organisation's strategy for Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), a strategy adopted by over 100 countries worldwide. This strategy is intended to foster correct diagnosis and treatment of common childhood illnesses in outpatient and inpatient settings with guidance for small hospitals published in the Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children. However reports indicate that success in implementation of diarrhoea case management has been varied.

Treatment guidelines for diarrhoea emphasise that patients be assessed for presence of blood in stool; non-bloody diarrhoea is to be managed with fluids only (unless co-morbidities are present which require different treatment), while bloody diarrhoea, presumed to be dysentery, should be managed with fluids and antibiotics. This is a pragmatic approach informed by the observation that most non-bloody diarrhoea episodes in the under-5 age group in low-income settings are self-limiting and are caused by pathogens not susceptible (e.g. rotavirus, astrovirus and enteric adenovirus) to antibiotic therapy or for which antibiotics are likely of little value or even deleterious (e.g. salmonellae and campylobacter). In contrast a significant proportion of episodes of bloody diarrhoea caused by shigella are associated with considerable mortality and are ameliorated by antibiotic therapy. Furthermore correcting dehydration is clinically more important due to its association with adverse outcomes. Despite the fact that the guidelines are unambiguous, inappropriate antibiotic use remains common. Antibiotic misuse may accelerate acquisition of antibiotic resistance necessitating the use of more expensive alternative drugs and is a serious threat to drug therapy of infectious diseases. It may also be associated with missed opportunities to make correct diagnoses and as a result further increase in treatment cost. These undesirable consequences are disproportionately greater in low income countries which bear a bigger burden of infectious diseases. However, research that explores the reasons for unnecessary antibiotic use in low-income settings is unusual; research that explores the effects of interventions on this outcome, particularly amongst inpatient populations, is rare. We conducted a multi-faceted intervention trial in Kenya aimed at improving key inpatient paediatric care practices spanning assessment, diagnosis and treatment of malaria, pneumonia and non-bloody diarrhoea using 14 process-of-care indicators. The effect of this intervention on these practices has been reported previously. Here, we use these data to investigate whether the intervention (described subsequently) reduces inappropriate antibiotic use in the children admitted with non-bloody diarrhoea using a hierarchical modelling approach.

Colon ischemia initial evaluation — serology and stool studies — is emphasized because accuracy of clinical presentation is low; "Accuracy for the initial diagnosis of CI based upon clinical presentation is believed to be low," and in one emergency-department series "only one was accurately identified at the time of presentation." Given this, "initial evaluation for CI with serology and stool studies is very important," and clinicians "should consider initially obtaining complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, stool culture, stool examination for ova and parasites, Clostridium difficile toxin assay, and serum lactate, LDH, creatine kinase, and amylase levels." Table 5 lists blood tests (albumin, amylase, complete blood count, comprehensive electrolyte panel, creatine kinase (CK), lactate, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) and stool tests (Clostridium difficile toxin assay, culture, ova and parasite); additionally, Escherichia coli O157:H7 "should be tested for in all patients with bloody diarrhea."

### Diagnosis and management of necrotizing enterocolitis: an international survey of neonatologists and pediatric surgeons [^17d5ada3]. Neonatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious complication of prematurity. Currently, there is limited evidence to guide investigation and treatment strategies.

Objectives

To evaluate the parameters used to diagnose or exclude NEC, and to identify differences between neonatologists and pediatric surgeons.

Methods

A scenario-based survey was sent to neonatologists and pediatric surgeons.

Results

173 physicians from 26 countries completed the survey (55% neonatologists and 45% pediatric surgeons). Bloody stools, abdominal tenderness, low platelet counts, and increased lactate levels increased the likelihood of NEC for 82, 72, 56, and 45% of respondents, respectively. Intestinal pneumatosis, portal venous gas, and pneumoperitoneum on X-ray increased the likelihood of NEC for 99, 98, and 92% of respondents, respectively. Clinical examination and laboratory tests were insufficient to exclude NEC, but normal intestinal movements and normal gut wall thickness on ultrasonography decreased the likelihood of NEC for 38 and 33% of respondents, respectively. Neonatologists more frequently relied on increased gastric residuals and abdominal distension to diagnose NEC (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively), whereas pediatric surgeons more frequently reported that absence of bloody stools helped to exclude NEC (p = 0.04). In a deteriorating patient with suspected NEC, 39% of respondents would broaden the antibiotic spectrum, and 42% would recommend a laparotomy.

Conclusion

Our results indicate a wide variation in the management of NEC, with significant differences between neonatologists and pediatric surgeons. A better appreciation of the relative significance and weighting that should be applied to the clinical features and investigations should reduce the variation in interpretation that appears to exist.

Laboratory confirmation in acute diarrhea — ordering patterns and value are described as laboratory-confirmation of the agent being often essential for public health action, yet health-care providers often do not request stool cultures; physicians are more likely to request a culture for persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, history of travel to a developing country, bloody stools, diarrhea of > 3 days' duration, or fever, or who require intravenous rehydration; lack of laboratory confirmation can hinder appropriate management and treatment and inhibit surveillance; for the individual patient, identification of the specific agent can help with the appropriate selection of antimicrobial therapy, shortening the patient's illness and reducing morbidity, support the decision not to treat if antimicrobial therapy would not benefit the patient or would even be harmed by the use of antibiotics (e.g., prolongation of the carrier state with salmonellosis), and guide the use of invasive diagnostic techniques (e.g., avoid colonoscopy if an infectious etiology is identified); from a public health perspective, a pathogen-specific diagnosis with subtyping and prompt notification can enhance actions to prevent the spread of infection through patient education and exclusion of ill persons from food preparation or care of individuals at increased risk for poor outcomes from foodborne diseases.

Figure 6
Use of faecal calprotectin in primary care.

Faecal calprotectin is generally raised in patients with bloody diarrhoea and patients with this presenting feature will need flexible sigmoidoscopy regardless of the calprotectin result. In acute diarrhoea due to infection, calprotectin is also likely to be raised and will not discriminate between IBD and gastroenteritis, thus stool culture and/or flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy are the appropriate diagnostic investigations. While there is limited evidence to support routine repeat testing, an evaluation of the York Faecal Calprotectin Care Pathway found that, in 243 patients with a faecal calprotectin ≥ 100 µg/g after a median of 18 (IQR 14–29) days, repeat testing identified a reduction in 53% of patients, either to < 100 µg/g or, if initially > 250 µg/g, into the 100–250 µg/g range.

Faecal calprotectin is not sensitive enough in the exclusion of advanced colorectal adenoma or colorectal carcinoma, and so in patients with rectal bleeding and abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, weight loss, or iron-deficiency anaemia, cancer pathway referral should be strongly consideredand calprotectin is not appropriate. In primary care, symptoms of change in bowel habit with rectal bleeding and abnormal haematology in patients under 50 years are strongly predictive of IBD or colorectal cancer, but generally do not discriminate between the two. IBD is significantly more common in younger age groups, so referral will generally be to medical gastroenterologists. However, if there are reasons to suspect malignancy, patients should be referred via a suspected cancer pathway, although both need rapid colonoscopy (figure 6).

### Parent and clinician perspectives on diagnostic testing for children with diarrhea: a qualitative study [^87af4e00]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Clinician Management of Parents' Expectations With Regard to Diagnostics

Clinicians acknowledged that families want to understand the source of their child's symptoms and that "information for some parents is really important" (ED physician with ≥ 10 years of practice). Multiple clinicians conveyed that parents were reassured and satisfied when diagnostic testing was performed.

[The] family feels like you've done more for them when you order a test. (Nurse practitioner, urgent care, < 10 years of practice)

Some clinicians expressed that their perceived expectation that families want to have as much information as possible can influence their decision to order a diagnostic test:

Even if I don't think that a GI [gastrointestinal] stool study is necessary, there are situations where.a family is not going to leave the [ED] happy without one. And so, I probably order them sometimes when they're not truly indicated, but. I figured it's not the worst thing in the world. (Physician, ED, < 10 years of practice)

That said, clinicians thought that diagnostic testing for pediatric diarrhea was generally not warranted, except in unique cases (eg, bloody stools, prolonged duration of diarrhea, or travel history). Many clinicians stated that testing would not change their clinical management of patients:

The fact that it's not going to give us information that we're going to act on.if the kid's well, there's a good chance even if it is bacterial, they'll get over it. (Physician, urgent care, < 10 years of practice)

Some clinicians stated that further testing could even interfere with providing reassurance to families, as treatment decisions are not always straightforward using the multiplex PCR results:

The other con is trying to explain to family members that a positive result doesn't necessarily mean we needed to do anything differently. (Physician, ED, ≥ 10 years of practice)

Beyond the perceived limited utility of diagnostic testing in managing pediatric diarrhea, clinicians expressed other considerations, including the substantial cost of the testing and the burden to families of collecting a valid stool sample:

I'm reluctant to get it if I really don't think it's gonna change my management, because it's super expensive, and not all insurance covers it. (Physician, ED, ≥ 10 years of practice)

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^13d47ce0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding epidemiology and definitions — acute overt lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) accounts for ~20% of all cases of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, usually leads to hospital admission with invasive diagnostic evaluations, and consumes significant medical resources. Although most patients with acute LGIB stop bleeding spontaneously and have favorable outcomes, morbidity and mortality are increased in older patients and those with comorbid medical conditions. An individual with acute LGIB classically presents with the sudden onset of hematochezia (maroon or red blood passed per rectum), although in rare cases patients with bleeding from the cecum/right colon can present with melena (black, tarry stools), and hematochezia can be seen in patients with brisk upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Approximately 15% of patients with presumed LGIB are ultimately found to have an upper GI source for their bleeding, and for the purposes of this guideline, we define LGIB as the onset of hematochezia originating from either the colon or the rectum.

Efficacy

The proportion of patients without bloody stools was 76.9% in pH-2.4 g and 69.2% in Time-2.25 g (Table 2). The difference between the two groups was 7.7% (95% CI: −7.4, 22.8), and the lower limit of CI was more than "−10.0%", the critical value for demonstration of predetermined noninferiority.

The HR for time to bloody stools was 0.690 (95% CI: 0.353, 1.350, Fig. 2). There was no significant difference in the results of the log-rank test between the two groups (P = 0.27), but the time to bloody stools tended to be longer in pH-2.4 g in comparison with Time-2.25 g. The proportion of patients without relapse was 80.0% in pH-2.4 g and 79.7% in Time-2.25 g (Table 2). The time to relapse also was prolonged in pH-2.4 g compared to Time-2.25 g, in a similar manner to the time to bloody stools (Fig. 2), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.79). The decrease in UC-DAI at the final assessment was −0.8 in pH-2.4 g and −0.9 in Time-2.25 g, respectively, and the difference between the two groups was not significant (Table 2).

### Enhancing self-management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease: the role of autonomy support in health goal pursuit [^7733b904]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Psychological aspects of IBD

IBD refers to a chronic gastrointestinal condition with unclear etiology, encompassing two main clinical forms: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This disease primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract, causing various symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloody stools, bloating, and weight loss. - Since IBD is a lifelong condition, with the alternation of relapses and remissions, it can significantly impair patients' physical, mental, and social conditions, as well as their overall quality of life. Meanwhile, the unpredictability of relapses, the need for frequent hospitalization, the nature of the symptoms, the severe pain, and the physical transformation caused by the disease can lead to loss of control and autonomy. This may underpin the development of anxiety and depression whose prevalence is higher among patients with IBD. -

In IBD, disease self-management is crucial for maintaining remission and preventing progression. This includes daily behaviors such as adhering to regular medical check-ups, medication, and smoking cessation, as well as following dietary recommendations, participating in sports activities, and reducing stress. Effective self-management can also lead to positive health-related outcomes, including the reduction of inflammation, the alleviation of symptoms, better psychological/physical well-being, and improved quality of life. -

Despite the benefits of adapting to lifestyle changes required by the disease, previous research has found that 30%–45% of patients are nonadherent. Hence, examining the psychological factors that influence the efficacy of patients' self-management is important. It can elevate patients' engagement and improve their adherence to treatment plans, fostering a more comprehensive and patient-centered approach to self-management support.

A short course of antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin for 5 days [BIII]) may be indicated for CD4 counts of 200 to 500 cells/mm3 with function-limiting diarrhea, whereas severe disease (CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3 or AIDS-defining illness with clinically severe diarrhea [i.e., ≥ 6 liquid stools per day or bloody stools or fewer liquid stools with fever or chills]) should prompt inpatient evaluation and parenteral antimicrobial treatment (AIII). In stable patients, empiric therapy with oral ciprofloxacin (BIII) or azithromycin (BIII) is recommended, particularly if the infection is not associated with international travel, but careful follow-up is needed due to substantial resistance; if Campylobacter or Shigella bacteremia is suspected, a carbapenem is preferred for empiric therapy (BIII).

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: an algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^d4f33ec8]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential in disease management. A patient with chronic diarrhea may present with a spectrum of symptoms indicating one of several disorders, including IBS-D, EPI, celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and infections (eg, giardiasis). All of these conditions may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence among their symptoms. To assist in the accurate diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, we suggest a four-step diagnostic process (Fig. 2).

Step 1: Thorough History and Physical Examination

Diagnosis should begin by taking a thorough history and physical examination. Patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, defined as persisting for ≥ 4 weeks, should be questioned in detail on their symptoms and prior diarrhea history. Although the clinical definition of diarrhea is loose or watery stools ≥ 3 times in a 24-hour period, patients use various definitions (eg, loose stools, increased stool frequency, or fecal urgency), underscoring the importance of an accurate and detailed patient history. Abnormal stool form can be more important in defining diarrhea because patients with functional constipation will also present with a chief complaint of diarrhea owing to increased defecatory frequency. However, further questioning may cause illicit symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, obstruction, and the passage of hard stools.

As an initial approach, we recommend determining if diarrhea can be categorized as watery (indicative of IBS, celiac disease, endocrinopathy, or laxative misuse), fatty or greasy (which may indicate a malabsorptive or maldigestion disease, such as celiac disease or EPI), or inflammatory (indicative of infectious or inflammatory bowel disease); however, definitive categorization is not always possible using these criteria because some conditions overlap (Table 2). Further questioning should include the following: What is the pattern of diarrhea? Is it continuous, intermittent, or meal-related (this may differentiate secretory from osmotic diarrhea)? When did it start? Was there a precipitating event? What is the volume of feces? Is there blood, mucus, or fat in the stool or toilet basin? Is there a nocturnal component to diarrhea? Is there fecal urgency or incontinence?, In addition, other gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms should be explored, and potential aggravating factors, such as diet, stress, or medications, and alleviating factors should be queried.

### A comprehensive scoring system for the better prediction of bowel resection in pediatric intussusception [^a3981550]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data in patients with intussusception, aiming to investigate a comprehensive set of readily available clinical characteristics associated with bowel loss. Many of the variables examined in this study have been previously assessed, and no single predictor demonstrated clear superiority. Our findings revealed that the most predictive factors for bowel resection included the presence of bloody stool, prolonged disease duration, and the location of intussusceptions. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between bowel loss and symptoms such as abdominal distension, abdominal muscle rigidity, as well as elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicative of severe inflammation. Given the high incidence of bowel loss associated with these variables, timely surgical consultation should be considered, and early surgical intervention may prove beneficial in preventing bowel necrosis, even in cases where air reduction is not attempted.

In this study, a longer duration of symptoms emerged as a predictive factor for bowel loss in pediatric intussusception cases. This finding aligns with results from previous studies on the management of childhood intussusceptions, where the duration of the disease was associated with surgical intervention and bowel loss. This suggests that intussusception cases with prolonged symptom duration should be carefully considered for surgical intervention, particularly in the era of laparoscopy. Bloody stool typically represents a later sign in the progression of the disease, often leading patients to seek medical attention after some delay, posing a challenge in intussusception management. Early, nonspecific symptoms such as refusal to eat and episodes of crying may go unnoticed by parents, potentially contributing to delayed medical care. Consequently, the reported duration of illness may underestimate the true duration in many cases.

### Abdominal pain in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: association with single-nucleotide polymorphisms prevalent in irritable bowel syndrome and clinical management [^71d19e28]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

We would like to emphasise that testing for post-inflammatory IBS in our study has not been possible for two reasons: First, Rome IV criteria for our patients were not available, preventing a formal diagnosis of IBS in our IBD cohort. Second, the inflammatory state (level of inflammation) has not been rigorously tested in our patients at the time of pain assessment.

In our study, abdominal pain was a crucial predictor for the intensity of disease management in CD patients. Maximal abdominal pain was strongly associated with the number of visits and investigations, TNF-inhibitor usage and overall medical therapies as well as the length of time spent hospitalised. In other studies, patient management has also been associated with measures different from acute bowel inflammation: In a longitudinal study, IBS like symptoms in IBD increased the number of clinical visits and examinations during a follow up period of more than 2 years. Furthermore, a recent large cross-sectional study reported an association between IBS-like symptoms and the use of narcotics, clinical visits and the use of some medication after controlling for a limited number of confounders.

In our study, pain influenced clinical management in CD but only to a much lower degree in UC. A potential explanation could be the easier clinical assessment of disease activity in UC patients. The rectum is uniformly affected in UC and disease activity directly correlates with the number of bowel movements and bloody diarrhoea. The partial Mayo score (consisting of stool frequency, frequency of bloody stools and physician's global assessment) is an accepted and validated endpoint in clinical studies of UC. Of note, none of the considered IBS-SNPs were associated with IBD management. Therefore, physicians seem to rely on non-ambiguous signs of intestinal inflammation for decisions and genetic changes mediating pain levels might not significantly influence the clinical management.

In contrast, in CD, assessment of disease activity is complex and inflammation especially in the small intestine will not necessarily result in non-ambiguous symptoms, requiring usage of "softer" parameters such as the intensity of abdominal pain for treatment decisions.

Her medical history was notable for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, diagnosed 6 years previously and managed expectantly by monitoring the patient's complete blood count. Over several months, the patient's symptoms progressed, which resulted in significant weight loss. The patient's course of disease was ultimately complicated by acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and death.

Investigations

Physical examination, laboratory investigations, stool studies, colonoscopy with biopsies, immunohistochemistry and pathologic review of biopsy specimens.

Diagnosis

Leukemic colitis.

Management

Management of underlying leukemia with systemic hydroxyurea and topical colonic 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy.

Risks

Encompasses endogenous patient factors such as medical history and family history. For example, a middle-aged woman with colonic diverticulosis and worsening left lower quadrant pain over 2 days may indicate diverticulitis, while recurrent bloody stools following abdominal aortic surgery in an older man could suggest an aorto-enteric fistula. Although past and family histories are routinely addressed, emphasising this risk assessment highlights the importance of structured questioning to elicit relevant risk factors, enabling a precise diagnosis.

Exposure

Includes exogenous factors like medication, occupation, residency, travel, allergies, living things and sexual contact. They aid in enhancing differential diagnoses based on other data. As they can impact the diagnosis, less seemingly significant details should also be inquired about, but in the right way and the right time. Alternatively, in cases where the diagnosis proves challenging, paying attention to these aspects can potentially lead to the correct diagnosis. For instance, in the case of a 42-year-old man experiencing unexplained fever and generalised pain, a history of consuming bear meat during a vacation revealed the diagnosis of trichinosis. Similarly, in the case of a 55-year-old individual with longstanding dizziness and peripheral neuropathy, an occupational history of exposure to organic solvents in a factory setting unveiled the cause. These examples highlight how inquiring about such information can elucidate the diagnosis and provide valuable insights.

Description

Focus on obtaining detailed information, to the extent of being 'visualised', regarding self-reported symptoms, including their onset, clinical course, and associated factors and assessing the clinical course as linear, recurrent, or unchanged aids in forming differential diagnoses. Additionally, gathering information on factors that may affect the course (aggravating or alleviating) and patients' anxiety or specific concerns related to the symptoms is essential. When symptoms involve pain or sensory disturbances, detailed structured information regarding anatomical location and nature of the symptoms is necessary.

### Hirschsprung disease: common and uncommon variants [^76bd699b]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Overview of short-segment Hirschsprung disease

The most common variant of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is short-segment or rectosigmoid disease. The majority (70%–85%) of HSCR is limited to the rectum or sigmoid colon. These patients usually present in the neonatal period with 'typical' signs and symptoms: failure to pass meconium within the first 24–48 hours, abdominal distention, vomiting, explosive passage of stool/gas, and failure to thrive. Patients may also present with signs and symptoms of Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC), which include abdominal tenderness, fever, explosive diarrhea, and bloody stools. Rectal irrigation is usually an effective first-line management strategy in patients with short-segment HSCR and is the mainstay of treatment for HAEC.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^7e155cc5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) management algorithm — risk stratification and interventions: High-risk patients are managed with resuscitation using intravenous fluids and, if indicated, blood product transfusion, with consideration for intensive care unit management, exclusion of an upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) source, and there is no role for unprepped colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy. If the patient remains hemodynamically unstable and intolerant to colonoscopy preparation, proceed to radiographic intervention (angiography; consider preceding computed tomographic angiography for localization), consult surgery, and perform elective colonoscopy after bleeding resolves. If the patient hemodynamically stabilizes and no UGIB is found per esophagogastroduodenoscopy/nasogastric tube, perform colonoscopy < 24 h from presentation after hemodynamic resuscitation and administer 4–6 l of polyethylene glycol solution over 3–4 h until rectal effluent is clear of blood and stool. In low-risk patients, resuscitate if needed with intravenous fluids and blood product transfusion and manage on the regular hospital floor; if the patient remains hemodynamically stable, perform colonoscopy at the next available time after 4–6 l of polyethylene glycol solution until rectal effluent is clear of blood and stool. Apply endoscopic hemostasis for high-risk stigmata with modality based on bleeding source, location, and endoscopist experience, and consider repeat colonoscopy with endoscopic hemostasis for evidence of recurrent bleeding. Packed red blood cell transfusion is to maintain Hgb ≥ 7 g/dl, with a threshold of 9 g/dl considered in patients with significant comorbid conditions or expected delay in intervention.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^8db1fdf7]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial enteric infections — clinical manifestations in people with HIV — present as three major syndromes and a definable severe diarrhea phenotype. The three major clinical syndromes associated with Gram-negative enteric bacteria among people with HIV are self-limited gastroenteritis, severe and prolonged diarrheal disease potentially associated with fever, bloody diarrhea, and weight loss, and bacteremia associated with extra-intestinal involvement with or without concurrent or preceding gastrointestinal illness. Severe community-associated diarrhea often is defined as six or more loose stools per day, with loose stool defined as defecated material that takes the shape of a container, and may occur with or without systemic features such as fecal blood, orthostatic hypotension, or fever.

### Clinical, imaging, endoscopic findings, and management of patients with CMV colitis: a single-institute experience [^310b2064]. Emergency Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate clinical, laboratory, imaging, endoscopic findings, treatment, and outcomes of patients with CMV colitis.

Methods

The electronic medical records of 652 patients who had an impression of colitis of unspecified etiology via endoscopic findings between 2011 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. There were 9 patients with biopsy-proven CMV colitis and associated CT imaging performed within 1 month of diagnosis. Demographic data, past medical history, symptoms, laboratory, imaging, endoscopic and biopsy findings, colitis-related adverse events, treatment, and management were recorded.

Results

Within the group of 9 patients (2 men; median age, 60 years), all were in an immunosuppressed state (8/9 on immunosuppressive medication regimen and 1/9 with untreated AIDS). Presenting symptoms of CMV colitis included bloody stools (9/9), abdominal pain (7/9), and diarrhea (7/9). The most common imaging findings were pericolonic stranding (9/9) and bowel wall thickening (9/9). Endoscopic evaluation noted inflammation (9/9), ulceration (9/9), and erythema (8/9) as the most prevalent impressions. As determined by both imaging and endoscopy, the sigmoid colon was most commonly affected. Patients were treated with valganciclovir alone (3/9) or ganciclovir followed by valganciclovir (6/9). Outcomes included perforated colon (1/9), persistent colitis (3/9), discharge to hospice (1/9), and resolution (4/9).

Conclusions

CMV colitis is generally associated with an immunosuppressed state. Imaging and endoscopic findings can mimic inflammatory, ischemic, and infectious colitides. However, CMV colitis should be included in the differential diagnosis in immunocompromised adults who present to emergency department with bloody stools, acute abdominal pain or diarrhea, and have bowel wall thickening and pericolonic stranding on imaging.

Methods

The active surveillance system

Between January 2009 and December 2018, active surveillance of patients with acute diarrhea was administered in 217 sentinel hospitals and 93 reference laboratories in all 31 provinces (autonomous regions or municipalities) on the Chinese mainland which was managed by the Chinese Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (China CDC) (Supplementary Fig. 6). The numbers of sentinel hospitals and reference laboratories were determined in proportion to the total population size within each ecological region and the sentinel hospitals were chosen after careful consideration for the capacities of surveillance and laboratory testing and the representativeness of geographical locations (Supplementary Methods). All participating hospitals and laboratories used a surveillance protocol that included guidelines for patient enrollment, specimen collection, laboratory testing, data management, and other related standard operating procedures that were developed by China CDC. A case of acute diarrhea was defined as the presence of ≥ 3 passages of watery, loose, mucus-, or bloody-stools within a 24-h period. Patients referred from other hospitals or patients not initially diagnosed in sentinel hospitals or patients with the non-infectious disease were excluded from this study.

Nonmicrobiologic testing and endoscopy in infectious diarrhea — Serologic tests are not recommended to establish an etiology of infectious diarrhea or enteric fever (strong, low), but may be considered for people with postdiarrheal hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in which a stool culture did not yield a Shiga toxin–producing organism (weak, low). A peripheral white blood cell count and differential and serologic assays should not be performed to establish an etiology of diarrhea (strong, low), but may be useful clinically (weak, low). Frequent monitoring of hemoglobin and platelet counts, electrolytes, and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine is recommended to detect hematologic and renal function abnormalities that are early manifestations of HUS and precede renal injury for people with diagnosed Escherichia coli O157 or another Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection, especially STEC that produce Shiga toxin 2 or are associated with bloody diarrhea (strong, high); examining a peripheral blood smear for the presence of red blood cell fragments is necessary when HUS is suspected (strong, high). Endoscopy or proctoscopic examination should be considered in people with persistent, unexplained diarrhea who have AIDS, in people with certain underlying medical conditions as well as people with acute diarrhea with clinical colitis or proctitis and in people with persistent diarrhea who engage in anal intercourse (strong, low); duodenal aspirate may be considered in select people for diagnosis of suspected Giardia, Strongyloides, Cystoisospora, or microsporidia infection (weak, low). Imaging such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be considered to detect aortitis, mycotic aneurysms, signs and symptoms of peritonitis, intra-abdominal free air, toxic megacolon, or extravascular foci of infection in older people with invasive Salmonella enterica or Yersinia infections if there is sustained fever or bacteremia despite adequate antimicrobial therapy or if the patient has underlying atherosclerosis or has recent-onset chest, back, or abdominal pain (weak, low).

### Evaluation of diarrhea management appropriateness and its determinants among children under five years of age in regional and national referral hospitals in Eritrea: a cross-sectional study [^4834bfff]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Appropriateness of diarrhea management

In the assessment of diarrhea management, only 15.9% of all children were appropriately managed. Diarrhea management was found to be more appropriate in out-patients (17.3%) than in-patients (10.5%) (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Percentage distribution of the diarrhea management (n = 756). Note: OPD: Outpatient department; IPD: In-patient department

The most common types of inappropriate practices of diarrhea management were lack of counseling (77.8%), not prescribing zinc (49.9%), unnecessary antibiotic prescription (30.3%), incorrect dose/route/frequency and duration of treatment (22.2%), and ORS not prescribed (12.3%). Moreover, Diarrhea classification error (Stool not characterized 8.7%, and Duration of diarrhea not stated 2.5%), inconsistent diagnosis (6.5%), and incomplete physical assessment (1.2%) were also spotted in a significant number of patients (Table 4).

Table 4
Distribution of the most common types of inappropriate practices (n = 756)

ORS Oral Dehydration Salts

Only 21.2% (n = 160) of the children's caregivers received documented counseling on diarrhea management. The main advices provided included 'Advice when to return' (46.9%), 'Give extra fluid' (45.0%) and 'Continue feeding' (31.9%). Follow-up appointments were for only eight caregivers, all of whom attended. Among these, two children improved, three showed no change, and three worsened. For the112 documented cases of bloody diarrhea (99 out-patient and 13 in-patient), no follow-up appointments were given to outpatient children, with one exception. ORS was prescribed to 84.7% of the children with diarrhea. Moreover, ORS was not prescribed in 12.3% of the cases, and its use was in one instance.

### Direct comparison of two different mesalamine formulations for the maintenance of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis: a double-blind, randomized study [^cfc2ee37]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Statistical Analysis

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients without bloody stools. The presence of bloody stools was defined as a bloody stool score of 1 or more. The principal hypothesis was the noninferiority of pH-2.4 g to Time-2.25 g, using the proportion of patients without bloody stools.

Our hypothesis was verified by the following methods. The noninferiority of pH-2.4 g to Time-2.25 g was demonstrated if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) was more than "−10.0%" in the difference of the proportion of patients without bloody stools between the two groups (pH-2.4 g minus Time-2.25 g). In addition, the superiority of pH-2.4 g over Time-2.25 g was demonstrated if the lower limit of the 95% CI was more than "0.0%" in the difference of the proportion of patients without bloody stools between the two groups. The secondary endpoints were time to bloody stools, proportion of patients without relapse, time to relapse and decrease in UC-DAI. In this study, relapse was defined as a bloody stool score of 1 or more and UC-DAI of 3 or more. Survival values of the time to events were determined by the Kaplan–Meier method with time to bloody stools and time to relapse. The functions were compared by the log-rank test and the hazard ratio (HR) of pH-2.4 g to Time-2.25 g and the 95% CI were calculated. A statistically significant difference was demonstrated when the 95% CI of the difference between the groups did not include zero with regard to proportions of patients without relapse and the decrease in UC-DAI. In the safety endpoints, the numbers of patients with AEs and patients with ADRs were analyzed by Fisher's exact test.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^6c72991b]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — benzodiazepine selection, monitoring, and hepatic impairment guidance — states that "no particular benzodiazepine agent is more effective than another, longer-acting benzodiazepines are the preferred agents due to the clinical benefits of their longer duration of action." Clinicians "should monitor patients taking benzodiazepines for signs of over-sedation and respiratory depression," since "Longer-acting agents can accumulate and lead to over-sedation and respiratory depression, particularly in older patients or those with compromised health." In hepatic impairment, "Benzodiazepine accumulation is more likely in patients with impaired hepatic function," and "Medication dose can be reduced or a benzodiazepine with less dependence on hepatic metabolism can be used," but "the start of treatment should not be delayed while waiting for lab test(s) results or if the test(s) are unavailable at the time of presentation." When tests are unavailable and "a patient has signs of significant liver disease, use a benzodiazepine with less hepatic metabolization," with listed signs: "Skin and eyes that appear yellowish (jaundice)… Swelling in the legs and ankles (edema)… Itchy skin… Dark urine color… Pale stool color, or bloody or tar-colored stool… Confusion… Chronic fatigue… Nausea or vomiting." For agitation or confusion, "A reduction in the benzodiazepine dose and the addition of a neuroleptic agent… can be considered if patients are not at an elevated risk of seizure," noting "Some neuroleptic agents have been shown to reduce the seizure threshold."

### Infectious diarrhea: IDSA updates guidelines for diagnosis and… [^7a5d09e9]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

- Clinicians should evaluate patients with diarrhea for postinfectious and extraintestinal manifestations associated with enteric infections. From the AFP Editors. Patients with fever or bloody diarrhea should be evaluated for enteropathogens for which antimicrobial agents may be beneficial, including Salmonella enterica, Shigella, and Campylobacter. Identifying these bacteria can avoid unnecessary antibiotic therapy and procedures such as colonoscopy, abdominal surgery, or ulcerative colitis treatment. Additionally, stool tests that are negative for infectious pathogens increase suspicion for a noninfectious cause. DIAGNOSIS Diarrheal illnesses are usually self-limited and determining the exact etiology is not always necessary. Stool testing is indicated in patients at high risk of severe illness and when identification of a pathogen is important for the patient or public health.

In patients with diarrhea accompanied by fever, bloody or mucoid stools, severe abdominal cramping or tenderness, or signs of sepsis, stool should be tested for. EMPIRIC MANAGEMENT OF INFECTIOUS BLOODY DIARRHEA Choice of empiric therapy for bloody diarrhea depends on local susceptibility patterns and the patient's travel history. Options for adults include a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin. Options for children include a third-generation cephalosporin for infants younger than three months and for those with neurologic involvement, or azithromycin. However, most cases of inflammatory infectious diarrhea episodes are self-limited, and the risks of treatment often outweigh the benefits. Exceptions may include severe infections and infections in immunocompromised persons.

Patients with clinical features of sepsis and suspected enteric fever should be treated empirically with broad-spectrum antimicrobials after blood, stool, and urine culture collection. Therapy can be narrowed once test results are available. If an isolate is unavailable and enteric fever is suspected, the antimicrobial choice may be tailored to susceptibility patterns in the geographic location where the infection was acquired. Empiric antibacterial therapy should be considered for patients who are immunocompromised and have bloody diarrhea or severe illness. However, empiric treatment of bloody diarrhea is not recommended in immunocompetent patients while waiting for test results unless the patient is an infant younger than three months and a bacterial etiology is suspected, the patient has a fever documented in a health care setting, abdominal pain, and bacillary dysentery presumably caused by.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^173185b8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — definitions and classification of small bowel bleeding specify that a source of small bowel bleeding should be considered in patients with overt or occult GI hemorrhage after performance of a normal upper and lower endoscopic examination. Patients should be classified as having small bowel bleeding if a source of bleeding is identified distal to the ampulla of Vater and/or proximal to the ileocecal valve. After normal upper and lower endoscopic examinations and before performance of capsule endoscopy, patients should be classified as having "potential small bowel bleeding." "Overt small bowel bleeding" refers to patients presenting with either melena or hematochezia with a source of bleeding identified in the small intestine, and the term "occult small bowel bleeding" can be reserved for patients presenting with iron-deficiency anemia with or without guaiac-positive stools who are found to have a small bowel source of bleeding. The term "obscure GI bleeding" should be reserved for patients not found to have a source of bleeding after performance of standard upper and lower endoscopic examinations, small bowel evaluation with VCE and/or enteroscopy, and radiographic testing.

### Haemolytic uraemic syndrome managed with subtotal colectomy [^9d920643]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A man in his early 70s was transferred to our hospital due to rapid decline in renal function and inflammation throughout the colon, indicating severe ischaemic enteritis. On the day following the start of intensive care, a stool specimen tested positive for verotoxin, and haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) was diagnosed. On the same day, his vital signs deteriorated suddenly, and emergency surgery was performed due to the possibility of intestinal necrosis and perforation. Severe inflammation extending to the serosal surface of the whole colon was observed, but there was no obvious intestinal necrosis or perforation. Advanced mucosal necrosis of the entire colon suggested sepsis due to bacterial translocation, and subtotal colectomy was performed to remove the infection source. Postoperative management was successful. This case demonstrates the importance of considering HUS in patients with severe renal dysfunction and bloody stools, as well as the significance of colectomy in such patients.

### Bifidobacterium longum subsp infantis (EVC001) is associated with reduced incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis stage ≥ 2 and bloody stools in premature babies [^11a64ca8]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The implementation of a probiotic protocol in our NICU was associated with a 90% reduction in rates of NEC ≥ Stage 2 in babies born < 33 6/7 weeks. These results support the findings of many randomized control trials and metanalysis that have shown probiotics are associated with reduced NEC. Although some studies suggest the superiority of multi-strain probiotics, others have suggested that Bifidobacterium alone offers a unique benefit to the premature gut and probiotics containing B. infantis are more beneficial than probiotics without B. infantis to premature babies. B. infantis EVC001 has been associated with significant reductions in the incidence of NEC in very low birth weight infants. Our study adds to that existing research to support B. infantis EVC001 as a means to decrease NEC in premature infants.

Our probiotic protocol was also associated with improved feeding tolerance, as a cohort and across all gestational ages, evidenced by decreased bloody stools, fewer mean TPN days and fewer mean days to full enteral feeds. Some studies have found that probiotics are associated with decreased time to reach full enteral feeds, while others have found no effect on TPN days.

Dysbiosis has been cited as a risk factor for bloody stools, but published data is limited regarding the association between probiotics and bloody stools in preterm babies.

Two studies have shown a trend toward decreased bloody stools with the use of probiotics, one using Lactobacillus rhamnosus in babies born at 24 to 31 weeks gestation and another using a multi-strain probiotic of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in babies less than 29 weeks gestation. This is the first study to evaluate bloody stools as a primary outcome after introduction of B. infantis. Prior to probiotic implementation, our NICU had a high baseline rate of bloody stools in babies < 34 weeks, which often prompted NEC evaluations, including bowel rest and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Due to this, our protocol inclusion criteria was broadened to include babies born at 32 and 33 weeks completed gestation.

### Neonates presenting with bloody stools and eosinophilia can progress to two different types of necrotizing enterocolitis [^5d82f76c]. Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

We hypothesized that neonates with bloody stools and concomitant eosinophilia are likely to have atopic enteropathy rather than necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

Study Design

This was a retrospective cross-sectional study using electronic medical records and paper charts. Records of neonates admitted to any Intermountain Healthcare NICU between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2010 were eligible if 'bloody stools' were listed in any archive. Qualifying records were divided into two groups depending on whether or not within 72 h of passing bloody stool eosinophil counts were above the 95th percentile reference range limit for age.

Result

Bloody stools were identified in 275 predominantly Caucasian neonates. Fifty-four of these had eosinophilia and 221 had normal eosinophil counts. Those with eosinophilia were born at a slightly younger gestational age (31.3 ± 4.6 vs 32.6 ± 4.0 weeks, mean ± s.d. P = 0.032). Contrary to our hypothesis, those with eosinophilia did not have a lower rate of pneumatosis or bowel resection, or death ascribed to NEC. Eosinophilia was more common among those who had a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion within 48 h before passing bloody stools (P < 0.001). Those with a recent RBC transfusion were the only neonates to have NEC surgery or to die from NEC. Preceding the bloody stools, those with no antecedent transfusion had been fed a larger volume (P = 0.014), and had trends toward receiving calorically enriched feedings (P = 0.055) and recent addition of human milk fortifier (P = 0.060). Eosinophil counts following RBC transfusion tended to increase for 3–6 days, but when bloody stools were not preceded by transfusion the eosinophil counts were more static over that period.

Conclusion

In this predominantly Caucasian group of neonates with bloody stools, the presence of eosinophilia did not identify a benign condition distinct from NEC. A total of 44% of these neonates had transfusion-associated NEC. Eosinophils could have a previously unrecognized role in the pathogenesis of this NEC subtype.

An adult or pediatric colonoscope with a large working channel (at least 3.3 mm) should be used, and the use of a water-jet irrigation device is recommended to facilitate removal of adherent material and residue from the colonic mucosa.

### Direct comparison of two different mesalamine formulations for the maintenance of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis: a double-blind, randomized study [^afa32f6f]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Previous randomized controlled studies showed that the pH- and time-dependent release formulations of mesalamine used in the present study were superior to placebo. However, the criteria for clinical relapse differed in the individual studies. Moreover, the studies employed different administration periods and doses, and such differences made it impossible to compare their results. In the present study we demonstrated the noninferiority of the pH-dependent release formulation of mesalamine to its time-dependent release formulation. The results of the present study were meaningful because this study was conducted with concurrent control.

Sutherland et alfound that decreases in bloody stool score and in the mucosal appearance score paralleled symptomatic improvement. In our study, UC-DAI increased in the patients with bloody stools in both groups, whereas there was little change in UC-DAI in the patients without bloody stools in either group (Table 3). These results indicate that there is a close relation between clinical relapse (based on the clinical activity index) and bloody stools (based on the patient interviews). Therefore, we consider the presence or absence of bloody stools to be a useful predictor of clinical relapse in patients with UC in the remission phase.

Because UC is characterized by repeated relapses and remissions, the goal of treatment is to maintain the remission phase as long as possible in order to maintain the QOL of the patient. The prolongation of the remission phase is, therefore, an important indicator of the clinical efficacy of UC therapy. In the present study the time to bloody stools and the time to relapse tended to be longer in the group treated with the pH-dependent release formulation, but the difference was not significant (Fig. 2). We assume that the drug-release mechanism described previously was responsible for the improvement in symptoms seen with the pH-dependent release formulation in this study: pH-dependent release formulations might be favorable because of higher mesalamine concentrations in the mucosa. An inverse correlation between the UC-DAI and mucosal mesalamine concentration has been reported in patients without bloody stools. Accordingly, the pH-dependent release formulation may deliver an adequate amount of mesalamine to the inflamed area and effectively suppress symptom aggravation for longer periods.

To investigate the presenting clinical features of acute bacterial gastroenteritis in adult patients treated as outpatients in the emergency department (ED), and the pathogens responsible in this setting and population; and to identify the frequency with which positive stool culture result changes management.

Method

This was a retrospective study of all patients who attended the accident and emergency department of an university affiliated hospital in Hong Kong over a 12 month period, who satisfied the following inclusion criteria: (a) age ≥ 16, (b) presented with acute gastroenteritis, (c) treated as outpatients with or without observation, and (d) had positive stool cultures.

Results

One hundred and thirty patients were included. Pathogens identified were Vibrio parahaemolyticus (42.3%), Samonella spp (34.6%), Plesiomonas spp (9.2%), Campylobacter spp (6.9%), Aeromonas spp (6.9%), and Shigella spp (6.2%). Mean highest body temperature was 37.5 degrees C (95% confidence intervals (CI) 37.3 to 37.6). Bloody diarrhoea was present in 14 patients (10.8%). Mean duration of diarrhoea, from onset to the completion of stay in ED, was 2.2 days (95% CI 1.7 to 2.7). Likewise, mean duration of abdominal pain was 1.8 days (95% CI 1.5 to 2.1). Mean number of unformed stools per day was 9.3 (95% CI 8.3 to 10.3). Change of management, subsequent to the availability of positive stool culture results, was not required in 115 (88.5%) patients. Ciprofloxacin resistance occurred in eight (6.2%) cases, and seven of nine campylobacter isolates. Campylobacter positive patients had a significantly longer duration of abdominal pain (p = 0.0236) and were less likely to be dehydrated (p = 0.0103).

Conclusions

Most patients with bacterial gastroenteritis do not present with high fever, bloody diarrhoea, or persistent diarrhoea, but generally have quite severe diarrhoea. Stool cultures do not change management for most patients. Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the commonest bacterial pathogen identified.

### Positive guaiac and bloody stool are poor predictors of intussusception [^f6f34a80]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Currant jelly stool is a late manifestation of intussusception and is rarely seen in clinical practice. Other forms of GI bleeding have not been thoroughly studied and little is known about their respective diagnostic values.

Objective

To assess the predictive value of GI bleeding (positive guaiac test, bloody stool and rectal bleeding in evaluation of intussusception.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study cohort of all children, ages 1month-6years of age, who had an abdominal ultrasound obtained evaluating for intussusception over 5year period. We identified intussusception if diagnosed by ultrasound, air-contrast enema or surgery. Univariate and a multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed.

Results

During the study period 1258 cases met the study criteria; median age was 1.7years (IQR 0.8, 2.9) and 37% were females. Overall 176 children had intussusception; 153 (87%) were ileo-colic and 23 were ileo-ileal. Univariate risk ratio and adjusted Odds ratio were 1.3 (95% CI, 0.8, 2.0) and 1.3 (0.7, 2.4) for positive guaiac test, 1.1 (0.6, 2.1) and 0.9 (0.3, 3.0) for bloody stool, and 1.7 (1.02, 2.8) and 1.3 (0.5, 3.1) for rectal bleeding.

Conclusion

Blood in stool, whether visible or tested by guaiac test has poor diagnostic performance in the evaluation of intussusception and is not independently predictive of intussusception. If the sole purpose of a rectal exam in these patients is for guaiac testing it should be reconsidered.

### Differentiating ulcerative colitis from Crohn disease in children and young adults: report of a working group of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the Crohn's and colitis foundation of America [^532f69a3]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Medium credibility.

Epidemiological diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) — Among more than 40 published epidemiological series in children and adults, the definition of UC is more consistent than for Crohn disease (CD); the epidemiological diagnosis of UC relies on bloody diarrhea with negative stool cultures and endoscopic evidence of diffuse continuous mucosal inflammation involving the rectum and extending proximally, and the presence of backwash ileitis does not exclude a diagnosis of UC.

### Intussusception in preterm neonates: a systematic review of a rare condition [^fe97b81a]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although intussusception is the commonest etiology of bowel obstruction in infants, it is uncommonly encountered in neonates. Moreover, it is extremely uncommon in preterms. Clinically, it could be commonly confused with the more common disorder in neonates, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), as both share common symptomatology. This includes abdominal distension, bilious emesis, bloody stools and feeding difficulties.

The initial misdiagnosis of intussusception in neonates especially preterms has led to a delay in their management, which increases the risk of developing compromised bowel. In addition, it is difficult to reach a diagnosis as neonatal intussusception does not reveal any classical radiological signs even when contrast enema is used. Moreover, contrast enemas may even be hazardous as it may increase the risk of bowel perforation as in most cases the bowel is already compromised at the time of investigation. However, in order to reach a successful management of intussusception in preterm neonates (IPN), a timely and accurate diagnosis is required.

Therefore, we conducted the current study based on the systematic review of the published literature including case reports and case series to review the clinical features of IPN and how to differentiate it from NEC in order to shed the light on this rare disease and how having a high index of suspicion would help practitioners to make an early and accurate diagnosis. Although case reports are usually not an integral component of systematic reviews, in rare diseases they should be included to attain a comprehensive overview of the state of research and provide useful information especially when other types of studies are not available.

### 2.4 g mesalamine (asacol 400 mg tablet) once daily is as effective as three times daily in maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis: a randomized, noninferiority, multi-center trial [^da0178f2]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Efficacy Variable

The primary efficacy variable was the nonrecurrence rate. Recurrence was defined as a bloody stool score ≥ 1 and UCDAI ≥ 3. Four items (stool frequency, bloody stool, mucosal appearance, physician's global assessment) were scored and the sum of all scores was the UCDAI. Regardless of an incomplete UCDAI, subjects with a bloody stool score ≥ 1 and UCDAI ≥ 3 were handled as recurrence.

The subjects entered into their diary stool frequency, the state of their stool (the extent of bloody stools, if present), and compliance/noncompliance with treatment during the study period, and visited the study site every 4 weeks. The investigator or subinvestigator scored stool frequency score, bloody stool score, and physician's global assessment score based on the diary and the interview with the subject. At the time of screening and final observation (either week 48 visit or visit for discontinuation), the investigator or subinvestigator conducted the colonoscopy and determined the mucosal appearance score by reference to atlases of mucosal appearances based on Mayo endoscopic subscore.

Safety Variables

Safety variables were the incidence of adverse events and adverse drug reactions. Adverse events considered to be related to the study drug were handled as adverse drug reactions.

The investigator or subinvestigator collected information about adverse events by interview with the subjects at each visit. Moreover, to determine the presence or absence of adverse events, laboratory tests (hematological test, biochemical test, urinalysis, and urinary enzyme test) were conducted at the time of screening, at the visits during weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 (or at discontinuation), and the recording of vital signs were conducted at eligibility determination, at the visits during weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 (or at discontinuation).

The adverse event terms were coded using MedDRA/J (Ver. 18.1) terms for tabulation and analysis.

### Alpelisib (Piqray) [^8f44716d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Diarrhea or Colitis

Severe diarrhea, resulting in dehydration and in some cases in acute kidney injury, can occur in patients treated with PIQRAY. Most patients (58%) experienced diarrhea during treatment with PIQRAY. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 7% (n = 19) of patients. Among patients with Grade 2 or 3 diarrhea (n = 71), the median time to onset was 46 days (range, 1 to 442 days).

In clinical trials, 63% of patients who experienced diarrhea required antidiarrheal medications (e.g., loperamide) to manage symptoms. Dose reductions of PIQRAY were required in 6% of patients, and 2.8% of patients permanently discontinued PIQRAY due to diarrhea.

Colitis has been reported in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with PIQRAY [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Monitor patients for diarrhea and additional symptoms of colitis, such as abdominal pain and mucus or blood in stool. Based on the severity of the diarrhea or colitis, PIQRAY may require dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation as described in Table 4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Advise patients to start antidiarrheal treatment, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider if diarrhea occurs while taking PIQRAY.

Patients with colitis may require additional treatment, such as enteric-acting and/or systemic steroids.

### Recurrent bloody stools associated with visceral infantile haemangioma in a preterm twin girl [^16ea0a96]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A premature twin infant girl was transferred to a level IV neonatal intensive care unit for recurrent bloody stools, anaemia and discomfort with feeds; without radiographic evidence of necrotising enterocolitis. Additional imaging after transfer revealed a large retroperitoneal mass in the region of the pancreas compressing the inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta, raising suspicion for neuroblastoma. Abdominal exploration and biopsy unexpectedly revealed that the lesion was an infantile capillary haemangioma involving the small bowel, omentum, mesentery and pancreas. The infant was subsequently treated with propranolol, with a decrease in the size of the lesion over the first year of her life and a drastic improvement in feeding tolerance. While cutaneous infantile haemangiomas are common, visceral infantile haemangiomas are less so and may present a significant diagnostic challenge for clinicians. This interesting case demonstrates that such lesions should be considered in the differential diagnosis for unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding or abdominal symptoms in newborns.

### Bifidobacterium longum subsp infantis (EVC001) is associated with reduced incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis stage ≥ 2 and bloody stools in premature babies [^a964a4a8]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To utilize an evidence-based probiotic protocol to achieve a 50% reduction in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) ≥ stage 2 and bloody stools.

Study design

From January 2022 through September 2023, daily enteral Bifidobacterium longum ssp. infantis EVC001 (B. infantis EVC001) was administered to babies ≤ 33 6/7 weeks gestation until 36 weeks post menstrual age. Feeding tolerance and complications were compared to babies admitted during the prior two-year period. Fisher's Exact test was used to analyze proportional data and t test was used for continuous variables.

Results

A total of 265 babies received EVC001, and a total of 277 babies formed the pre-probiotic cohort. Probiotic use was associated with decreased NEC ≥ stage 2 (p = 0.0058), reduced bloody stools (p < 0.0001), decreased time to full enteral feeds (p < 0.0001), and decreased total parenteral nutrition (TPN) days (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Administration of B. infantis EVC001 was associated with a decrease in NEC, a decrease in bloody stools, and improvement in feeding tolerance in premature babies.

### Direct comparison of two different mesalamine formulations for the maintenance of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis: a double-blind, randomized study [^311b3123]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background:

Mesalamine has been used as the first-line medication for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). We directly compared the efficacy and safety of two different mesalamine formulations in the maintenance of remission in patients with UC.

Methods:

In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study, 131 patients with quiescent UC were assigned to two groups: 65 to receive a pH-dependent release formulation of mesalamine at 2.4 g/day (pH-2.4 g) and 66 to receive a time-dependent release formulation of mesalamine at 2.25 g/day (Time-2.25 g). Both formulations were administered three times daily for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients without bloody stools.

Results:

In the full analysis set (n = 130), the proportion of patients without bloody stools was 76.9% in the pH-2.4 g and 69.2% in the Time-2.25 g, demonstrating the noninferiority of pH-2.4 g to Time-2.25 g. No statistically significant difference in time to bloody stools was found between the two formulations (P = 0.27, log-rank test), but the time to bloody stools tended to be longer in pH-2.4 g compared to Time-2.25 g, and a similar trend was observed with regard to the time to relapse. No differences were observed between the safety profiles of the two formulations.

Conclusions:

The pH- and time-dependent release of mesalamine formulations were similarly safe and effective. Interestingly, the remission phase tended to be longer in the group that received the pH-dependent formulation compared to the group that received the time-dependent formulation (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, no. C000000289). (Inflamm Bowel Dis 2010)

### Fulminant necrotizing enterocolitis: clinical features and a predictive model [^d3d21a04]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

fNEC is the most severe subtype of NEC, characterized by sudden onset, rapid progression and poor prognosis. Among all NEC cases (Bell stage ≥ II b) in our ten-year study, fNEC accounted for approximately 22.2%. Among fulminant cases, 87.1% died during hospitalization, and one of the nine survivors suffered from short bowel syndrome. The annual morbidity of fNEC and NEC showed no decreasing trend. Moreover, advancements in preventing or treating NEC are lacking. Due to limited and nonspecific diagnostic methods, early identification of fNEC is challenging. Therefore, our study developed a nomogram to predict the risk of fNEC.

NEC is a multifactorial and complex disease. Factors such as a premature intestine, dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota, and ischemia-reperfusion injury are implicated as part of the pathogenesis of NEC. Ventilation, shock and laboratory findings including absolute neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, or PLT counts, elevated creatinine or phosphorus levels had been associated with increased risk of fNEC. However, no consistent association between these factors and fNEC has been established. In this study, bloody stool, absence of bowel sounds, lactate and pH were identified as independent predictors of fNEC, using univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression analysis.

Abdominal distension, bloody stool and vomiting are common manifestations of NEC. In our study, fulminant cases were more likely to have absent bowel sounds and a lower incidence of bloody stool, abdominal mass, and decreased bowel sounds at NEC onset compared to non-fulminant cases. The distinctiveness of fNEC is reflected in two features: one is rapid progression, the other is the extreme severity. This suggests that the pathophysiological mechanism of fNEC might diverge from nNEC, which is subtly corroborated by our study's finding of a reduced frequency of bloody stools and abdominal mass. Hypoxic-ischemic injury is thought to be a key contributor to the pathogenesis of NEC, Intestinal mucosal injury leads to necrosis and hemorrhage, even extend to the muscular layer, causing small blood vessels to rupture and hemorrhage into the intestinal lumen, forming bloody stools. When small intestinal perforations occur, abdominal masses gradually form. NEC cases that initially or primarily manifest as bloody stool may have a relatively mild course, as the excretion of bloody stool is indicative of residual function of the bowel. Two case reports from different hospitals have documented the disease progression of fNEC in detail, which were also consistent with our results.

### Safety and immunogenicity of the oral, inactivated, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli vaccine ETVAX in Bangladeshi children and infants: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 1 / 2 trial [^5916424a]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Toxicity grading of clinical and laboratory variables and vomiting was done according to the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Paediatric Adverse Events, 2009, of the US National Institutes of Health. Dehydration was assessed and managed as per the WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness guideline. Diarrhoea was defined as at least three unformed or loose stools in a 24-h period or at least one bloody loose or liquid stool or one to two liquid stools with at least some signs of dehydration in a 24-h period and during the home visits 5–7 days after each vaccination. Loose stool was defined as fewer than three episodes of unformed stools with mixed liquid and solid components in a 24-h period and during home visits.

For measurement of immune responses, heparinised venous blood samples (2–4 mL) were obtained 4–7 days before the first immunisation, 7 days after the first dose, and 5 days after the second dose (day 19). We have identified these timepoints to be optimal for assessing circulating antibody-secreting cell or ALS responses after oral vaccination, with only minor differences in plasma IgA and IgG responses between day 5 and later timepoints after the second dose. Immune responses were assessed by measuring vaccine-specific (ie, CFA/I, CS3, CS5, CS6, and LTB) IgA antibodies in ALS specimens, and IgA antibody levels against the five vaccine antigens and IgG antibody concentrations against LTB in plasma. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma were separated from the blood by density-gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Isopaque. Plasma specimens were preserved at −20°C. For ALS preparations, 10PBMCs per mL were cultured for 48 h at 37°C with 5% CO 2; supernatants were collected and stored at −70°C.

### Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of children with acute intussusception: a case series [^f56c41e3]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The typical presentation of intussusception is paroxysmal abdominal pain/crying, abdominal botuliform mass, and bloody stool. However, in this study, only 6% had bloody stools, only 2% had the typical triad of symptoms, and many older children had only abdominal pain without other symptoms or signs. Therefore, paroxysmal abdominal pain/crying should be the main clinical manifestation of acute intussusception and requires vigilance. Kimia et al. argued that bloody stools are of little diagnostic value in acute intussusception. Justice et al. reported that 78% of the children presented with abdominal pain, lethargy, and vomiting. Another study by Kimia et al. reported that the patterns of symptoms vary with age, with the presence of abdominal pain, emesis, bilious emesis, lethargy, rectal bleeding, and irritability being the predictors in children < 24 months old, while male sex was the only predictor in children > 24 months old. Therefore, for children with atypical clinical symptoms but high suspicion of intussusception, auxiliary examinations (such as abdominal ultrasound) can be performed to assist in the diagnosis.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^568e037e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infections of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract — general approach to diagnosis — For many of these infections, particularly noninflammatory diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis of short duration, no laboratory testing is recommended. The specimen of choice to diagnose diarrheal illness is the diarrheal stool, not a formed stool or a swab, with a notable exception in pediatrics where a swab is acceptable when feces is noted on the swab. Fecal testing for causes of infectious gastroenteritis using culture or culture independent methods is indicated for patients with moderate to severe, bloody, febrile, dysenteric, nosocomial, or persistent diarrheal illnesses or immunocompromised patients, and routine testing for other than C. difficile is often restricted to patients who have been hospitalized more than 3 days. Culture independent multiplex molecular tests are reported to be more sensitive than culture, result in higher rates of detection, and often cost more than culture methods, and toxin or nucleic acid amplification testing for C. difficile should only be done on diarrheal stool.

### Etiology of bloody diarrhea among patients presenting to United States emergency departments: prevalence of Escherichia coli O157: H7 and other enteropathogens [^57102f5b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Escherichia coli O157:H7 and other Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infections have been associated with bloody diarrhea. The prevalence of enteropathogens among patients with bloody diarrhea was determined by a prospective study at 11 US emergency departments. Eligible patients had bloody stools, ≥ 3 loose stool samples per 24-h period, and an illness lasting < 7 days. Among 873 patients with 877 episodes of bloody diarrhea, stool samples for culture were obtained in 549 episodes (62.6%). Stool cultures were more frequently ordered for patients with fever, > 10 stools/day, and visibly bloody stools than for patients without these findings. Enteropathogens were identified in 168 episodes (30.6%): Shigella (15.3%), Campylobacter (6.2%), Salmonella (5.8%), STEC (2.6%), and other (1.6%). Enteropathogens were isolated during 12.5% of episodes that physicians thought were due to a noninfectious cause. The prevalence of STEC infection varied by site from 0% to 6.2%. Hospital admissions resulted from 195 episodes (23.4%). These data support recommendations that stool samples be cultured for patients with acute bloody diarrhea.

### Management of upper airway leech infestations [^84ffa90f]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Upper airway foreign body is one of the most encountered clinical situations in otolaryngology practice. In rare conditions, a living organism may be a foreign body in the upper airway. In this study, we demonstrate 19 patients with leech infestations in nose, nasopharynx, and larynx.

Methods

This study was enrolled with 19 patients between 2012 and 2016 in a regional state hospital. All of the patients were admitted to clinic with these complaints: epistaxis, hemoptysis, coughing, foreign body sensation, and bloody stool.

Results

There were 12 male and 7 female patients. The leech was in the nose in 12 patients, in nasopharynx in 6 patients, and in the larynx in only 1 patient. All leeches are removed under local anesthesia (except laryngeal presentation). No bleeding and complication were seen after extraction of leech.

Conclusion

Leech can be easily diagnosed and managed in the upper aero-digestive tract without any complication and leech-associated disease.

### Bifidobacterium longum subsp infantis (EVC001) is associated with reduced incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis stage ≥ 2 and bloody stools in premature babies [^4b860f27]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

Primary outcomes were bloody stools at any time during NICU hospitalization and NEC ≥ stage 2. Bloody stools were diagnosed visually with confirmatory hemoccult testing if diagnosis was uncertain. The diagnosis of NEC was determined using the modified Bell staging criteria. Initial diagnosis was made by the on-service attending neonatologist, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a radiologist and one additional neonatologist. Cases of spontaneous intestinal perforation, defined as gastrointestinal perforation without signs of NEC, were excluded. Secondary outcomes included NPO days, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) days, days to achieve full enteral nutrition, late antibiotic days (after initial infectious screen period), late onset sepsis, urinary tract infections (UTI), tracheitis, meningitis, length of hospital stay, and CGA at discharge.

Statistical analysis

Data was initially analyzed by descriptive statistics. Subsequent comparison of outcome measures was analyzed with Microsoft Excel (Version 16.82, 2024) using the Fisher's Exact test for proportional data and two-sided student t test for continuous variables. Two-sided p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Cohorts were divided into subgroups based on gestational age.

### Evaluation of chronic diarrhea [^94a3335f]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea, defined as a decrease in stool consistency for more than four weeks, is a common but challenging clinical scenario. It can be divided into three basic categories: watery, fatty (malabsorption), and inflammatory. Watery diarrhea may be subdivided into osmotic, secretory, and functional types. Watery diarrhea includes irritable bowel syndrome, which is the most common cause of functional diarrhea. Another example of watery diarrhea is microscopic colitis, which is a secretory diarrhea affecting older persons. Laxative-induced diarrhea is often osmotic. Malabsorptive diarrhea is characterized by excess gas, steatorrhea, or weight loss; giardiasis is a classic infectious example. Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is also malabsorptive, and typically results in weight loss and iron deficiency anemia. Inflammatory diarrhea, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease, is characterized by blood and pus in the stool and an elevated fecal calprotectin level. Invasive bacteria and parasites also produce inflammation. Infections caused by Clostridium difficile subsequent to antibiotic use have become increasingly common and virulent. Not all chronic diarrhea is strictly watery, malabsorptive, or inflammatory, because some categories overlap. Still, the most practical diagnostic approach is to attempt to categorize the diarrhea by type before testing and treating. This narrows the list of diagnostic possibilities and reduces unnecessary testing. Empiric therapy is justified when a specific diagnosis is strongly suspected and follow-up is available.

### Correlation of clinical outcomes with multiplex molecular testing of stool from children admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis in Botswana [^7243c25e]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Diarrheal disease is a leading cause of death for young children. Most pediatric gastroenteritis is caused by viral pathogens; consequently, current recommendations advocate against routine antibacterial therapy if children present without bloody stools.

Methods

In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled children with severe acute gastroenteritis admitted to hospital in Botswana. Details of presenting history, physical examination, and course in the hospital were recorded. Stool samples were characterized using a 15 pathogen polymerase chain reaction assay.

Results

There were 671 participants with a median age of 8.3 months; 77 (11%) had severe acute malnutrition. Only 74 children had bloody stools, of whom 48 (65%) had a detectable bacterial pathogen, compared to 195 of 592 (33%) of those without. There were 26 deaths (3.9%). Covariates associated with death in multivariable logistic regression were the detection of any of Campylobacter/Shigella/enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (odds ratio [OR] 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–6.17), severe acute malnutrition (OR 4.34, 95% CI 1.79–10.5), and antibiotic therapy (OR 8.82, 95% CI 2.03–38.2). There was no significant association between bloody stools and death, and the effect of Campylobacter/Shigella/enterotoxigenic E. coli infection on death was not modified by the presence of bloody stools.

Conclusions

Detection of bacterial enteropathogens is associated with increased mortality in children in sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately, most children with these infections do not have bloody stools, and bloody dysentery was not found to be associated with worse outcomes. Clinical trials evaluating outcomes associated with more aggressive diagnostic strategies in children presenting with severe acute gastroenteritis in sub-Saharan Africa should be undertaken.

WARNINGS

ORALLY AND PARENTERALLY ADMINISTERED CLINDAMYCIN HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERE COLITIS WHICH MAY RESULT IN PATIENT DEATH. USE OF THE TOPICAL FORMULATION OF CLINDAMYCIN RESULTS IN ABSORPTION OF THE ANTIBIOTIC FROM THE SKIN SURFACE. DIARRHEA, BLOODY DIARRHEA, AND COLITIS (INCLUDING PSEUDOMEMBRANOUS COLITIS) HAVE BEEN REPORTED WITH THE USE OF TOPICAL AND SYSTEMIC CLINDAMYCIN. STUDIES INDICATE A TOXIN(S) PRODUCED BY CLOSTRIDIA IS ONE PRIMARY CAUSE OF ANTIBIOTIC-ASSOCIATED COLITIS. THE COLITIS IS USUALLY CHARACTERIZED BY SEVERE PERSISTENT DIARRHEA AND SEVERE ABDOMINAL CRAMPS AND MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PASSAGE OF BLOOD AND MUCUS. ENDOSCOPIC EXAMINATION MAY REVEAL PSEUDOMEMBRANOUS COLITIS. STOOL CULTURE FOR Clostridium Difficile AND STOOL ASSAY FOR C. difficile TOXIN MAY BE HELPFUL DIAGNOSTICALLY. WHEN SIGNIFICANT DIARRHEA OCCURS, THE DRUG SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED. LARGE BOWEL ENDOSCOPY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TO ESTABLISH A DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS IN CASES OF SEVERE DIARRHEA. ANTIPERISTALTIC AGENTS SUCH AS OPIATES AND DIPHENOXYLATE WITH ATROPINE MAY PROLONG AND/OR WORSEN THE CONDITION. DIARRHEA, COLITIS, AND PSEUDOMEMBRANOUS COLITIS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED TO BEGIN UP TO SEVERAL WEEKS FOLLOWING CESSATION OF ORAL AND PARENTERAL THERAPY WITH CLINDAMYCIN.

Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically effective against C. difficile colitis.

### Parasitic infections in Swiss children: are we overtesting? [^454f388e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Bloody diarrhea is usually evidence of a bacterial infection (Salmonella, Shigella or enterohaemorrhagic E. coli pathotypes;), but can also be caused by Entamoeba histolytica. Most infections are asymptomatic, but invasive intestinal disease may occur manifesting with several weeks of cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea and weight loss. Persistent diarrhea lasts for at least 14 days can suggest a parasitic etiology, such as Cryptosporidium species, Giardia intestinalis, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Dientamoeba fragilis, Cystoisospora belli etc. A differential diagnosis of bloody and persistent diarrhea is inflammatory bowel disease and has to be ruled out.

3% of the negative tested children received the final diagnosis of functional constipation. The only situation, in which constipation can be caused by parasites is a partial/total blockage of the gut due to an excessive presence of them. In terms of size, Ascaris lumbricoides, is the largest roundworm that parasitize the human gastrointestinal tract and can cause constipation and intestinal obstruction in endemic regions, in patients with high worm loads. Although it is among the most common helminthic human infections with an estimated one billion people infected, it only exists in tropical and subtropical environments and should not be an indication to regularly test European children with signs of constipation.

Worldwide, areas with high rates of parasitic infection include India, Africa, and Central and South America, due to poor sanitation and socioeconomic conditions. Studies have reported that travelers to low- and middle-income countries (mainly areas in South America, Africa and South Asia) are between 9 and 151 times more likely to develop diarrhoeal illness. This is in line with our findings, where 80% of all patients with a negative stool result did not have a history of travelling abroad.
