## Question

What separates the right and left lobes of the liver?

{{c1::Cantlie's line (line between the gallbladder fossa and IVC)}}

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what separates the right and left lobes of the liver. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct anatomical plane that divides the liver into right and left hemilivers. Then, I should verify the exact landmarks that define that plane. Next, I will consider the key intrahepatic structure that travels within this plane. After that, I should review why this matters surgically and radiologically. Finally, I will double-check for common misconceptions and confirm the most precise answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental division. The liver is divided into right and left hemilivers by the main portal scissura, which is also known as Cantlie's line, an imaginary plane that runs from the gallbladder fossa anteriorly to the inferior vena cava posteriorly, and it contains the middle hepatic vein as its principal intrahepatic landmark [^bd925067] [^cf99a056].

> Wait, let me verify the exact landmarks so I don't misstate them. Multiple authoritative sources consistently define Cantlie's line as extending from the middle of the gallbladder fossa anteriorly to the inferior vena cava posteriorly, with the middle hepatic vein coursing within this plane and serving as the key intrahepatic guide for surgical transection and imaging-based segmentation [^cf99a056] [^5e2f0dad].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surface features. I initially thought the falciform ligament might separate the lobes, but that's not correct; the falciform ligament and round ligament mark the boundary between the left lateral segments and segment IV within the left hemiliver, not the division between right and left hemilivers, so I should correct that misconception and emphasize that the true division is Cantlie's line rather than the falciform ligament [^bd925067] [^cf99a056].

> I need to ensure I capture the clinical significance. Surgeons use Cantlie's line to plan and execute anatomical resections, and intraoperative identification of the middle hepatic vein helps maintain the correct transection plane. Similarly, radiologists and interventionalists rely on this plane for segmental mapping and volumetry, which directly impacts operative strategy and graft planning in transplantation and complex hepatectomies [^0e9d4521] [^e65a3b70].

> Let me reconsider whether any alternative planes are used. Some authors describe a line from the left side of the IVC to the midpoint of the gallbladder bed as a demarcation for segment IV arterial perfusion, but that pertains to segmental arterial supply rather than the canonical right–left hemiliver division; thus, it should not supersede Cantlie's line as the primary boundary for right versus left hemiliver separation [^41e27f8c] [^cf99a056].

> Final answer, and I should double-check the wording to be precise: the right and left lobes (hemilivers) of the liver are separated by Cantlie's line, an imaginary plane running from the gallbladder fossa anteriorly to the inferior vena cava posteriorly, containing the middle hepatic vein as its principal intrahepatic landmark [^bd925067] [^cf99a056].

---

The right and left lobes of the liver are separated by **Cantlie's line**, an imaginary plane that runs from the middle of the gallbladder fossa anteriorly to the inferior vena cava posteriorly, and contains the **middle hepatic vein** [^bd925067] [^cf99a056]. This line divides the liver into right and left hemilivers based on **vascular anatomy** rather than external appearance, and is the standard reference for surgical and radiological segmentation [^9b226e25] [^5e2f0dad].

---

## Anatomical definition of Cantlie's line

Cantlie's line is defined as the plane that extends from the **middle of the gallbladder fossa** anteriorly to the **inferior vena cava (IVC)** posteriorly [^cf99a056]. It traverses the liver parenchyma and contains the **middle hepatic vein (MHV)**, which serves as a key intrahepatic landmark for this division [^bd925067].

---

## Historical background and nomenclature

Cantlie's line is named after **James Cantlie**, a Scottish physician who first described this anatomical plane in the late 19th century. His work laid the foundation for modern hepatic segmentation, emphasizing the importance of vascular anatomy in defining liver lobes [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of Cantlie's line

Cantlie's line is of paramount importance in **clinical practice**, particularly in **hepatic surgery** and **radiology**. It serves as the primary reference for:

- **Surgical planning**: Hepatectomies, liver transplantation, and other surgical procedures rely on Cantlie's line to accurately delineate the right and left hemilivers, ensuring precise resection margins and preservation of vascular structures [^0e9d4521] [^3aa13d3c].

- **Radiological imaging**: Modern imaging techniques, such as CT and MRI, utilize Cantlie's line to segment the liver into functional units, facilitating accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up assessments [^5e2f0dad] [^89425da7].

- **Anatomical education**: Cantlie's line is a fundamental concept in medical education, providing a clear and consistent framework for understanding hepatic anatomy [^bd925067].

---

## Intrahepatic structures associated with Cantlie's line

Several important intrahepatic structures are associated with **Cantlie's line**:

| **Structure** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Middle hepatic vein (MHV) | - Runs along Cantlie's line <br/> - Drains segments IV, V, and VIII <br/> - Serves as a key landmark for surgical transection [^bd925067] [^2d0f77e0] |
| Portal vein branches | - The main portal vein bifurcates into right and left branches near Cantlie's line <br/> - Supplying the respective hemilivers [^9034b59a] |
| Hepatic artery branches | - The right and left hepatic arteries accompany the portal vein branches <br/> - Providing arterial supply to the right and left hemilivers [^9034b59a] |

---

## Variations and anomalies

While Cantlie's line is generally consistent, anatomical variations can occur. These include variations in hepatic vein anatomy, portal vein branching patterns, and hepatic artery origins. Such variations necessitate careful preoperative planning and intraoperative adaptation to ensure **safe and effective surgical outcomes** [^463169a2] [^dcd980ac].

---

## Comparison with other anatomical landmarks

Cantlie's line is distinct from other anatomical landmarks, such as the **falciform ligament** and the **round ligament (ligamentum teres)**, which are external surface landmarks that do not accurately reflect the internal vascular division of the liver. Cantlie's line, by contrast, is based on internal vascular anatomy and provides a more precise and clinically relevant division of the liver [^bd925067] [^cf99a056].

---

## Conclusion

Cantlie's line is the imaginary plane that separates the right and left lobes of the liver, extending from the middle of the gallbladder fossa to the inferior vena cava and containing the middle hepatic vein. It is a fundamental concept in hepatic anatomy, guiding surgical procedures, radiological imaging, and anatomical education. Understanding and accurately identifying Cantlie's line is essential for **successful clinical outcomes** in liver-related medical practice.

### A station-wise approach to liver anatomy for linear EUS [^bd925067]. VideoGIE (2025). Medium credibility.

Liver anatomy overview

The liver is divided into 2 hemilivers (right and left), 4 lobes (right lobe, left lobe, caudate lobe, and quadrate lobe), and 8 segments (I-VIII) on the basis of surface and deep landmarks (Video 1, available online at). (The round ligament or ligamentum teres is a surface landmark, which separates left lobe from right lobe.)

As per the Couinaud's classification, the liver is divided into 8 functionally independent segments. The inflow of blood to the liver comes from the portal vein (PV) and hepatic artery branches, whereas hepatic veins (HVs) act as outflow. Each liver segment has its own portal pedicle consisting of the branch of the PV, hepatic artery, and bile duct, with an independent outflow tract from the HVs. The caudate lobe (segment I) receives blood supply from both lobes and drains into the inferior vena cava (IVC) directly. An imaginary Cantlie's line, containing the middle hepatic vein (MHV), passes through the IVC posteriorly and gallbladder (GB) fossa anteriorly, dividing the liver into the left and right hemilivers. The left hemiliver comprises segments II, III, and IV, whereas the right hemiliver comprises V, VI, VII, and VIII. The left hemiliver is again classified into left lateral (segments II and III) and left medial (segment IV) sector by the left hepatic vein (LHV), whereas the right hemiliver is separated into the right anterior (segments V and VIII) and right posterior sector (segments VI and VII) by the right hepatic vein (RHV).

### The caudate processus hepatic vein: a boundary hepatic vein between the caudate lobe and the right liver [^b5f95fc3]. Annals of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was conducted to find the boundary vein indicating the intersegmental plane between the caudate lobe and the adjacent liver segments.

Summary Background Data

Major hepatic veins of the human liver commonly run through the intersegmental plane and are widely used for the landmarks to define the boundary of both sides of liver segments. As the caudate lobe is a small independent unit of the liver separate from the right and left livers, the existence of the boundary hepatic vein to the adjacent liver segments has been expected.

Methods

Fifty-four adult cadaveric livers were minutely dissected to elucidate the correlation between the portal vein branches and the hepatic veins on both the caudate lobe and the adjacent liver segments.

Results

Among the hepatic veins of the caudate lobe, the caudate processus hepatic vein entering the inferior vena cava at hepatic hilum runs in the segmental plane between the caudate processus and the right liver. Three types of the caudate processus hepatic vein directly entering the inferior vena cava and 1 type of the exceptional hepatic vein that was the tributary of the right hepatic vein were observed. They drained the blood of the caudate processus and a part of the right liver, respectively.

Conclusions

The caudate processus hepatic vein is one of the candidates of the hepatic vein indicating the boundary between the caudate lobe and the adjacent liver segments. New procedures will be developed on the liver surgeries by acquiring the anatomic features of this vein.

### Simplifying minimally invasive right hepatectomy [^0e9d4521]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

For minimally invasive right hepatectomies, two surgical approaches can be distinguished. Following the definition introduced by Couinaud, the techniques can be classified as intrafascial and extrafascial. The intrafascial approach consists of dissection of the hepatoduodenal ligament and isolation of the right hepatic artery and the right portal vein (and eventually the right bile duct). After individual transection of the structures, the resulting demarcation line visualizes the anatomical Cantlie's line separating the right and the left liver lobe and parenchymal transection can be performed accordingly. The extrafascial or Glissonean pedicle approach was first described by Couinaud and further developed by Takasaki and others. Hereby, the right hepatic pedicle can be isolated after lowering of the hilar plate respecting the landmarks and gates that allow access to the primary branches of the portal triad.

The intrafascial approach allows early vascular control and parenchymal dissection following a demarcated line but bears the risk of injuring the vessels or the bile duct of the left liver as a result of wrong identification or due to anatomical variations. The extrafascial approach on the other hand demands the delicate detachment of the Glissonean pedicle from Lannaec's capsula, which can be difficult especially after previous operations and adhesions at the hilum. Our study describes another option with omission of hilar preparation. As adopted from living donor hepatectomy, the parenchymal dissection line (Cantlie's line) can be defined using the hepatic middle vein as the key anatomical landmark, thereby not depending on parenchymal demarcation. Intraoperative ultrasound can repeatedly be performed for intraparenchymal guidance. During the transection phase, the right pedicle (Fig. 1) and right liver vein both get exposed and can be dissected safely by vascular staplers.

Fig. 1
Schema of intraparenchymal pedicle transection after dissection of the liver parenchyma in a caudal approach

We established a 10-step-protocol for the facilitated ultrasound-guided hepatectomy (UGH) with intraparenchymal transection of the right pedicle and right liver vein. Both, extrahepatic isolation of the Glissonean pedicle (classical extrafascial approach) as well as dissection of the hepatoduodenal ligament (intrafascial approach) are thereby avoided. Our study evaluates the feasibility of UGH and compares its intraoperative and postoperative outcome to the established intrafascial approach (control group).

### The intersegmental plane of the liver is not always flat – tricks for anatomical liver resection [^df559682]. Annals of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the actual three-dimensional (3D) anatomy of the intersegmental plane of the liver to enable safe and precise anatomic resections of the portal territories.

Summary Of Background Data

Anatomic resection of the liver requires the precise detection of the intersegmental plane. However, we have sometimes encountered a dissociation between conventional understanding of the anatomy of the intersegmental plane and its actual 3D shape.

Methods

3D simulations of the livers of 81 healthy donors for living donor liver transplantation were reviewed. Several key angles formed between the plane of each venous trunk and the actual intersegmental plane on 3D simulation images were measured. The relation between these angles and the volume ratio of the liver segments located on both sides of the intersegmental plane were also investigated.

Results

The dissociation between the plane of the venous trunks and the actual intersegmental plane was remarkable, especially in the subphrenic region of the right lobe. The volume ratio of segment VIII compared with segment VII was correlated with the degree of cranio-lateral protrusion of segment VIII (r = 0.35, P = 0.001); this finding was attributed to the intricate surface of the right portal scissura. The same tendency was observed in the left portal scissura between the angle and the volume ratio of segment III/II (r = 0.23, P = 0.049), whereas the main portal scissura exhibited a relatively flat surface compared with the other longitudinal scissurae.

Conclusions

The intersegmental plane of the liver has an uneven and curved surface, especially in the right and left portal scissurae. The identification and exposure of the landmark vein on the cut surface is an important technique for avoiding disorientation during anatomic liver resection.

### Hepatic surgical anatomy [^43c33404]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The liver, the largest organ in the body, has been misunderstood at nearly all levels of organization, and there is a tendency to ignore details that do not fit the preconception. A complete presentation of the surgical anatomy of the liver includes the study of hepatic surfaces, margins, and fissures; the various classifications of lobes and segments; and the vasculature and lymphatics. A brief overview of the intrahepatic biliary tract is also presented.

### Single-cell spatial reconstruction reveals global division of labour in the mammalian liver [^7ff84898]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

The mammalian liver consists of hexagon-shaped lobules that are radially polarized by blood flow and morphogens. Key liver genes have been shown to be differentially expressed along the lobule axis, a phenomenon termed zonation, but a detailed genome-wide reconstruction of this spatial division of labour has not been achieved. Here we measure the entire transcriptome of thousands of mouse liver cells and infer their lobule coordinates on the basis of a panel of zonated landmark genes, characterized with single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization. Using this approach, we obtain the zonation profiles of all liver genes with high spatial resolution. We find that around 50% of liver genes are significantly zonated and uncover abundant non-monotonic profiles that peak at the mid-lobule layers. These include a spatial order of bile acid biosynthesis enzymes that matches their position in the enzymatic cascade. Our approach can facilitate the reconstruction of similar spatial genomic blueprints for other mammalian organs.

### The caudate lobe of the liver: implications of embryology and anatomy for surgery [^3e3adc9e]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The anatomy of the caudate lobe has technical and possibly oncologic implications for surgeons. The complex anatomy of the lobe is clarified by embryologic and anatomic analysis. This posterior sector is embryonically and anatomically independent of the right and left liver and the main portal fissure. The caudate lobe represents the only part of the liver that is in contact with the vena cava, except at the entrance of the main hepatic veins into the vena cava, and provides an anastomosis between the hepatic veins and vena cava. The entire caudate lobe is a single anatomic segment that is defined by the presence of portal venous and hepatic arterial branches, which supply the lobe, draining biliary ducts, and hepatic veins. Because no separate veins, arteries, or ducts can be defined for the right paracaval portion of the posterior liver and because pedicles cross the proposed division between the right and left caudate, the concept of segment IX is abandoned. The significance of caudate anatomy is reflected in the increase in the frequency and safety of major hepatic resection for primary and metastatic tumors in the liver. Right hepatic lobectomy routinely involves resection of the right portion of the caudate lobe (C. Couinaud, unpublished data, 1999). In the case of hilar bile duct cancer, which may extend into the dorsal ducts (especially the right lateral duct), partial or total caudate lobectomy is often necessary for complete extirpation of the tumor. Isolated caudate lobectomy can be performed for hepatocellular carcinoma that arises in the caudate lobe or for other tumors that arise in the lobe. The caudate lobe can be resected as part of the donor liver in preparation for a living related donor transplantation. Knowledge of the surgical anatomy of the caudate lobe is an essential part of the repertoire for surgeons who perform liver transplants or treat hepatobiliary cancer.

### Anatomy of hepatic resectional surgery [^95d65c2a]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Liver anatomy can be variable, and understanding of anatomic variations is crucial to performing hepatic resections, particularly parenchymal-sparing resections. Anatomic knowledge is a critical prerequisite for effective hepatic resection with minimal blood loss, parenchymal preservation, and optimal oncologic outcome. Each anatomic resection has pitfalls, about which the operating surgeon should be aware and comfortable managing intraoperatively.

### Liver lymphatic drainage patterns follow segmental anatomy [^7f468a01]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

These observations show a consistent division in lymphatic drainage patterns of the right- versus the left-sided liver segments. The authors speculate that segments V–VIII may preferentially drain to the right side of the hepatoduodenal ligament and then onwards to the peripancreatic and aortocaval nodes, whereas segments I–IV drain preferentially drain along the left and common hepatic artery and/or left gastric artery towards the coeliac trunk nodes. Remarkably, as in the median lobe of mice, lymphatic drainage of segment I can occur directly to the mediastinum. Although this is a single observation, it is consistent with older anatomical studies and implies that part of the liver parenchyma can drain directly to mediastinal lymph nodes.

Lymph node drainage patterns beyond perihepatic nodes need to be determined definitively in further studies, for example employing nuclear tracers. Ultimately, whether the lymphatic drainage of tracer dye injected in the liver parenchyma correlates with preferential localization of lymph node metastasis, thus influencing the use and extent of lymphadenectomy during partial hepatectomy for malignancy, is the subject of further clinical studies.

### CT volumetry of the liver: where does it stand in clinical practice? [^10cd9d97]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Imaging-based volumetry has been increasingly utilised in current clinical practice to obtain accurate measurements of the liver volume. This is particularly useful prior to major hepatic resection and living donor liver transplantation where the size of the remnant liver and liver graft, respectively, affects procedural success and postoperative mortality and morbidity. The use of imaging-based volumetry, with emphasis on computed tomography, will be reviewed. We will explore the various technical factors that contribute to accurate volumetric measurements, and demonstrate how the accuracies of these techniques are influenced by their methodologies. The strengths and limitations of using anatomical imaging to estimate liver volume will be discussed, in relation to laboratory and functional imaging methods of assessment.

### Liver anatomy [^125909c9]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Understanding the complexities of the liver has been a long-standing challenge to physicians and anatomists. Significant strides in the understanding of hepatic anatomy have facilitated major progress in liver-directed therapies — surgical interventions, such as transplantation, hepatic resection, hepatic artery infusion pumps, and hepatic ablation, and interventional radiologic procedures, such as transarterial chemoembolization, selective internal radiation therapy, and portal vein embolization. Without understanding hepatic anatomy, such progressive interventions would not be feasible. This article reviews the history, general anatomy, and the classification schemes of liver anatomy and their relevance to liver-directed therapies.

### Liver segmentation: indications, techniques and future directions [^74df9c33]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

In the case of right-lobe liver donor transplantation, there is a dilemma surrounding the inclusion of the middle hepatic vein (MHV) in the donated graft. The inclusion of the MHV in the graft is required for adequate venous drainage in the recipient, but may lead to congestion of segment IV in the donor liver. To strike a balance, the MHV is therefore usually transected proximal to a major segment IVb hepatic vein. This makes pre-operative volumetry along with vascular assessment advantageous for positive patient outcomes. Please see the "Vascular subsegmentation" section for further information.

### Spiegel's lobe bile ducts often drain into the right hepatic duct or its branches: study using drip-infusion cholangiography-computed tomography in 179 consecutive patients [^71f89be4]. World Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Using drip-infusion cholangiography-computed tomography (DIC-CT), we successfully identified the bile ducts draining the caudate lobe in 138 of 179 consecutive patients with extrahepatic cholelithiasis (179 ducts from Spiegel's lobe and 154 from the paracaval portion; 1–5 ducts per patient). The dorsal subsegmental duct of S8 (B8c) was often identified and could be discriminated from the paracaval caudate ducts, thus acting as a landmark for the right margin of the caudate lobe. Notably, in more than one-third of the 138 patients, at least one of the Spiegel's lobe ducts drained into the right hepatic duct or its branches (30.2% of the 179 ducts overall; all ducts joined branches of the right lobe in 25 patients). Similarly, 34.4% of the 154 paracaval caudate lobe ducts drained into the left hepatic duct or its branches. These "anatomical left/right dissociations" between the drainage territory and route were much more frequent than previously reported. Our results confirm the effectiveness of DIC-CT as a classical, noninvasive method for presurgical evaluation of the biliary system, but they also suggest that anatomical partial resection of the dorsal liver in patients with hilar cholangioma is often impossible because of contralateral biliary drainage.

### A station-wise approach to liver anatomy for linear EUS [^21ac0dc0]. VideoGIE (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Linear EUS has emerged as a key tool for liver assessment and intervention. However, its adoption for liver segmentation remains limited because of the absence of fixed anatomical landmarks and overlapping views. This study proposes a station-wise approach to simplify liver anatomy interpretation during EUS, correlating these findings with computed tomography imaging for greater comprehensibility.

Methods

EUS examinations were conducted using a linear echoendoscope with the patient in a left lateral position under deep sedation. A systematic station-wise methodology was applied to identify liver segments, leveraging anatomical landmarks such as portal vein branches, hepatic veins, and the inferior vena cava. Images were evaluated from 6 different stations.

Results

The station-wise approach successfully delineated all liver segments. Stations 1 through 3 provided comprehensive visualization of the superior and inferior segments from the gastroesophageal junction and stomach. Stations 4, 5, and 6 enabled additional imaging of challenging segments (eg, caudate lobe and posterior right liver segments).

Conclusions

This study provides a practical framework for systematic liver evaluation using linear EUS. Incorporating this station-wise methodology into EUS training programs could expand its role in diagnostic and therapeutic endohepatology.

### Splitting of the middle hepatic vein in full-right full-left splitting of the liver [^61f13799]. Liver Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Full-right/full-left splitting of the liver offers a chance to overcome the severe shortage of donor organs. During this procedure, the splitting surgeons are always faced with the question of how to share the middle hepatic vein (MHV), since this vein drains parts of both halves of the liver. Consequently, we developed a procedure that splits the MHV, thus creating an MHV on both grafts. In this short article, we report on this splitting technique and our first initial experience.

### Anatomy of the liver&gallbladder… [^b35570c4]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Anatomy of the Liver & Gallbladder Liver The liver is the largest internal organ in the body. A primary liver cancer is uncommon; most liver tumors are metastatic. The liver is divided into two lobes, right and left.
- Right lobe of liver
- Left lobe of liver
- Quadrate
- Round ligament
- Falciform
- Caudate lobe of liver
- Inferior vena cava
- Common bile duct
- Hepatic artery
- Portal vein
- Cystic duct
- Hepatic duct
- Gallbladder. Key words
- **Porta hepatis**: central region of liver which contains the hepatic artery, portal vein, lymphatic vessels, and extrahepatic bile ducts.
- **Bile**: fluid produced in the liver which aids in digestion. Gallbladder The gallbladder is a sac like organ; tumor extent is determined by invasion through the wall. The gallbladder lies under the liver and frequently invades the liver by direct extension.

The gallbladder wall lacks the thick muscular layers of the bowel wall, but still has a mucosa, lamina propria, smooth muscle, and serosa.
- **Fundus**: the fullest, most distal part of the gallbladder.
- **Body**: the area between the fundus and the neck of the bladder.
- Neck: tapers into cystic duct. Ampulla of Vater A dilated duct less than 1. 5 cm in length below the pancreas which empties into duodenum. Bile Ducts Intrahepatic bile ducts in portal area between hepatic lobes, draining hepatic lobules. Extrahepatic bile ducts:

- Common hepatic duct formed by junction of right and left hepatic bile ducts.
- Cystic duct connects common hepatic duct with gallbladder.
- Common bile duct formed by junction of cystic duct and common hepatic duct.

### Liver lymphatic drainage patterns follow segmental anatomy [^342a387f]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor

The cellular functions of the liver are sustained by a hierarchical, segmental, organized network of arteries, portal veins, and hepatic veins. In addition to this threefold vascular network, the liver lymphatic system drains interstitial fluid from the parenchyma towards perihepatic lymph nodes. The liver lymphatic system is estimated to produce 25–50 per cent of the lymph in the thoracic duct, and may play a crucial role in pathological processes such as cirrhosis and cancer dissemination. Hepatic pedicle lymph node dissection is indicated, or at least frequently performed, in patients undergoing partial hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and colorectal metastases. Surprisingly, the functional anatomy of the liver lymphatic system — whether the lymphatics follow the segmental organization of the vasculature and hence drain to specific lymph node chains — has not been mapped out. Recent work in mice showed that lymphatic tracer dye (blue dye) injected into the liver parenchyma is drained via the space of Disse and initial lymphatic vessels near the portal triads towards the perihepatic lymph nodes. The liver lobes displayed preferential lymph node drainage patterns without interlobar lymphatic flow, providing direct evidence that liver lymphatic drainage adheres to the segmental anatomy. Here, the authors show in humans that the primary lymphatic drainage route of blue dye injected into the liver parenchyma during surgery is different for the right versus the left hemiliver.

### Robotic real anatomical right hepatectomy preserving the caudate lobe: separate dissection of the right anterior and posterior glissonean pedicles, combined with the use of ICG fluorescent imaging (with video) [^6eca74af]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Conventional right hepatectomy typically involves resection of the right hemiliver, often including partial removal of the caudate lobe. However, recent advancements, particularly in indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging, have allowed for more accurate identification of anatomical boundaries between liver segments. In this context, we present a refined technique for real anatomical right hepatectomy that preserves the caudate lobe, offering enhanced surgical precision and several distinct advantages over traditional methods.

Materials and Methods

This study involved a right hepatectomy using the Da Vinci Xi robotic system, employing ICG fluorescence imaging for parenchymal transection. Key steps included the dissection of the right anterior and posterior Glissonean pedicles and the preservation of the caudate lobe. ICG was administered to visualize the boundary between the caudate lobe and the right liver, guiding a precise resection.

Results

The procedure lasted 320 min with 150 mL blood loss. Pathology showed a 6.7 cm×5.5 cm hepatocellular carcinoma with a 2.1 cm margin. No bile leakage or significant complications occurred, and the patient was discharged on day 6 without issues.

Conclusions

This technique, underpinned by a deep understanding of liver anatomy, the Glissonean approach, and advanced ICG fluorescence imaging, allows for greater precision in defining anatomical boundaries and preserving the caudate lobe. We propose that real anatomical right hepatectomy offers a promising alternative for surgical practice, with the potential for improved outcomes in patients with liver malignancies.

### Hyperspectral enhanced reality (HYPER) for anatomical liver resection [^0d505a91]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical evaluation of the demarcation line separating ischemic from non-ischemic liver parenchyma may be challenging. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a noninvasive imaging modality, which combines a camera with a spectroscope and allows quantitative imaging of tissue oxygenation. Our group developed a software to overlay HSI images onto the operative field, obtaining HSI-based enhanced reality (HYPER). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of HYPER to identify the demarcation line after a left vascular inflow occlusion during an anatomical left hepatectomy.

Materials and Methods

In the porcine model (n = 3), the left branches of the hepatic pedicle were ligated. Before and after vascular occlusion, HSI images based on tissue oxygenation (StO 2), obtained through the Near-Infrared index (NIR index), were regularly acquired and superimposed onto RGB video. The demarcation line was marked on the liver surface with electrocautery according to HYPER. Local lactates were measured on blood samples from the liver surface in both ischemic and perfused segments using a strip-based device. At the same areas, confocal endomicroscopy was performed.

Results

After ligation, HSI demonstrated a significantly lower oxygenation (NIR index) in the left medial lobe (LML) (0.27% ± 0.21) when compared to the right medial lobe (RML) (58.60% ± 12.08; p = 0.0015). Capillary lactates were significantly higher (3.07 mmol/L ± 0.84 vs. 1.33 ± 0.71 mmol/L; p = 0.0356) in the LML versus RML, respectively. Concordantly, confocal videos demonstrated the absence of blood flow in the LML and normal perfusion in the RML.

Conclusions

HYPER has made it possible to correctly identify the demarcation line and quantify surface liver oxygenation. HYPER could be an intraoperative tool to guide perfusion-based demarcation line assessment and segmentation.

### Liver segmentation: indications, techniques and future directions [^9b7a3632]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Segmentation refers to the process of delineating an organ of interest — typically on multiplanar computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) — for volumetric or morphological analysis. The liver is one of the most difficult organs to segment due to its highly variable shape and close proximity to other organs. In addition, the liver is subject to diverse pathologies that may modify its density, signal intensity or distort its architecture. Examples include liver fat, iron deposits, fibrosis and tumours.

Although physical examination has long been used to detect liver size, the variability of liver sizes among patients limits its ability to detect pathology. As seen in Fig. 1, livers of similar cranial-caudal length may have markedly different volumes. Standard liver volumes can be calculated from the patient's body surface area or mass using the formulas proposed by Vauthey et al. in 2000. However, these formulas are limited by subject demographics (healthy individuals) and by their modest correlation to liver sizes calculated by more advanced forms of volumetry.

Fig. 1
Variability of liver shape and size. Livers of different shape and volume may have similar cranial-caudal length, as demonstrated with these examples of three different patients. This observation highlights the limitation of reporting a one-dimensional measure of length, a well-entrenched practice, as a surrogate measure of liver volume

The era of modern imaging technology has offered new and more accurate tools to estimate liver volume. CT volumetry of the liver was first performed on cadavers by Heymsfield et al. in 1979 and was shown to be accurate within 5% of water displacement volumetry. Today, liver volume can be calculated from both CT and MRI examinations. CT is more commonly used due to its greater accessibility, higher spatial resolution, robustness and short acquisition time. MRI, conversely, offers multiple contrast mechanisms and the ability to assess vascular and biliary anatomy in addition to parenchymal pathology. MRI also minimises the risk of nephrotoxicity and eliminates concerns of radiation exposure.

### Liver segmentation: indications, techniques and future directions [^ba6bdf49]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Liver segmentation has emerged as the preferred technique of liver volumetry. Liver segmentation involves identifying the voxels belonging to liver parenchyma on CT or MRI images via the generation of multiple segments. There are many approaches to segmentation that involve varying amounts of operator input, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.

The goal of this paper is to provide clinicians with an accessible primer for liver segmentation. We will first discuss the major indications for performing liver segmentation for volumetry. Next, we will provide an overview of the various segmentation techniques available. Finally, we will discuss the emerging clinical applications of liver segmentation.

### Use of the resection map system as guidance during hepatectomy [^25320d86]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

The progress view, on the other hand, presents a complete overview of the entire resection plane. It displays an indicator, termed the progress window, of the volume seen in the surgical view. The progress view has a squared grid, with 1 cm side length, to provide a visual guide for interpretation of distances. Both the surgical and progress view can be rotated to enhance perception of 3D structures, and their elements can be activated or deactivated. For better understanding, Fig. 4 shows a practical example of the possibilities of this internal view.

Surgical and progress views are presented in the left and right part of each image, respectively. Green lines, arrows and text have been added to aid understanding. A Beginning of resection. Progress window set to 40 mm. The surgical view therefore shows a liver slice of 40 mm thickness. B User reduced the progress window to 20 mm and advanced its position 2 cm. Veins are deactivated in both views, and tumours are activated in the progress view; their positions are now clearly seen. Vein-cutting areas (in yellow) are now clearly seen as landmarks to track resection progress. C Progress window advanced 1 cm. The portal three (root of segments II, III, and IV), one of the critical points in this resection, is now clearly seen in the surgical view. D Progress window advanced 4 cm. Hepatic branch for segments II and III and relative tumour position clearly seen (tumour now in green in the surgical view since it is inside the resection window). (Color figure online)

To help perception of critical structures (tumours and veins cut by the resection plane) the Resection Map incorporates some visual aids. Tumours are always present in the surgical view, independent of whether they are inside the progress window; their colour becomes green in those parts that are inside the progress window. On the other hand, the vein-cutting areas, i.e. the intersection between veins and the resection plane, are highlighted in yellow. For more details about the design of the Resection Map system, the reader is referred to previous work.

### Arterial blood supply of liver segment IV and its possible surgical consequences [^a68335bf]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

The livers used in this study were recovered from deceased donors donated for education and research to the anatomy center of the Georg August University in Göttingen, Germany. A medical ethics committee reviewed each donation, and an internal review board approved the study.

We studied 29 livers from recently deceased donors without liver cirrhosis or a history of liver surgery.

After the liver was explanted, the porta hepatis and the portal triad were dissected to reveal the anatomical variations of the hepatic arteries, their branches, the origin of the middle hepatic artery, and its insertion into the liver.

The capsule of segment IV was removed along Cantlie's line that separates right and left lobes, and the umbilical fissure and falciform ligament that define the borders between segment IV and segments II and III according to the Couinaud classification (Figure 1 A).

### Arterial blood supply of liver segment IV and its possible surgical consequences [^cf99a056]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Couinaud and Bismuth anatomical classification of the liver is accepted by liver surgeons and transplant communities of Europe, Asia, and North America as the reference for describing partial organ allografts. For this reason, it should be consulted before conducting studies in search of new insights into liver anatomy 1, 2.

The Couinaud classification depends particularly on the main stems of the portal and hepatic veins. The liver is divided into two functional hemilivers by the scissures known as the main portal scissure and Cantlie's line, which is the line that runs anteriorly from the middle of the gallbladder bed posteriorly to the inferior vena cava 3. The umbilical fissure and the falciform ligament divide segments II and III from segment IV in the left hemiliver. The tract of the right hepatic vein divides the right hemiliver into anterior segments (segments V and VIII) and posterior segments (segment VI and VII) 4.

Couinaud's method of dividing the liver into eight autonomous liver segments can be accepted as a good approximation. However, the shapes of these segments, their volumes, and their segmental borders show significant variability, which limits the use of this classification in surgical practice 5.

Segment IV is unlike the other segments belonging to the left liver lobe according to the Couinaud classification and forms the border with the right liver lobe. The arterial supply to segment IV has been a topic of debate, and the risk of ischemia, necrosis, and hepatic artery thrombosis of segment IV after split‐liver transplantation or the ALPPS (associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy) procedure is high 6.

The middle hepatic artery supplies segment IV 7. Identifying this artery and its pattern is important when planning and performing hepatic resection. Accidental damage to this artery can cause a number of complications such as hepatic artery thrombosis, ischemic cholangiopathy, or a decrease in the size of the left hepatic lobe 8.

### Liver segmentation: indications, techniques and future directions [^2f60cc2b]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Alternatives to liver segmentation for volumetry

Alternative methods of volumetric analysis, such as stereology, merit mention. Stereology is a volumetric technique that employs statistical methods to calculate liver volume, whereby a sample of pixels is selected on individual liver slices to calculate the entire liver volume. This sample can be taken using a variety of methods, such as grid-based sampling method (the Cavalieri method). In this method, a regular grid is placed over cross-sectional images; each time the liver touches a pre-selected structure (e.g. right lower corner of a square), it is counted in the volumetric calculation. The calculated cross-sectional area is then summed across slices to calculate the volume. Advantages of such a method include speed, cost-effectiveness, multimodal applicability (CT, MRI, ultrasound) and the ability to perform subsegmentation (lesions, vascular structures, specific liver segments); disadvantages may include variation based on slice thickness and slightly decreased accuracy.

### Study on the segmentation of the right posterior sector of the liver [^38bf85c5]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The border between segments VI and VII of the right posterior sector of the liver is controversial owing to lack of anatomical landmarks. This study aimed to examine the segmentation of the right posterior sector.

Methods

Using three-dimensional software, ramification type of the right posterior portal vein (RPPV) was analysed in 100 patients.

Results

A bow-shaped anatomy, in which the RPPV exhibits a downward convex bow shape with several ramifications, was found in 50 patients. A bifurcation anatomy, in which the RPPV bifurcates into the cranial and caudal branches, was observed in 45 patients. In the bow-shaped anatomy, setting the segmentation was difficult due to lack of definite landmarks; thus, the downward portal branches were determined as segment VI branches, while horizontal and upward branches were determined as segment VII branches. In the bow-shaped anatomy, the incidence of full exposure of a thick branch of the right hepatic vein on virtual transection surface was 60.0%, while in the bifurcation anatomy, it was only 11.1%. No relations were observed between RPPV anatomy and main PV/right hepatic vein anatomy. The volumes of segments VI and VII were equal in both the bow-shaped and bifurcation anatomy.

Conclusions

The bow-shaped and bifurcation types are commonly observed in RPPV anatomy. In the bifurcation anatomy, the right posterior sector is divided into segments VI and VII. In the bow-shaped anatomy, setting the segmentation was difficult, thus it may be compelled to be arbitrarily determined.

### Arterial blood supply of liver segment IV and its possible surgical consequences [^247c2881]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Results

The arterial blood supply of segment IV comes from the right and left liver lobes

A total of 29 livers were dissected. Injecting water and ink into the various arterial branches supplying segment IV revealed a varying distribution of perfusion. In 23 of the 29 livers (79.3%) the distribution was separated by a line drawn from the left side of the inferior vena cava (IVC) cephalad and lateral to the falciform ligament to the medial point of the gallbladder bed.

The blood supply in the area between this line and Cantlie's line came only from the right hepatic artery (RHA) in 19 of the 23 livers (65.6% of all liver samples in the study). In the other four livers, the blood supply was from the RHA and the middle hepatic artery (MHA), which originated from the RHA in all four cases (13.8% of all liver samples in the study).

The anatomical variations of the hepatic artery and the intrahepatic blood distribution patterns were so numerous that they could not be categorized in a single format. We therefore divided the specimens on the basis of the source of the arterial blood supply and the intrahepatic blood distribution in liver segment IV.

The blood supply of segment IV arising from the RHA, MHA, and left hepatic artery (LHA) in different patterns of distribution and perfusion were as follows.

In four livers (13.8%), arterial blood for segment IV came from the RHA and the MHA, where MHA was a branch of the RHA. Perfusion lateral to this line came from the RHA and medial to this line from its branch, the MHA. Note that in one liver of this group, the LHA arose from the left gastric artery (Figure 2 A).

### Evaluating the hilar bifurcation territory in the human liver caudate lobe to obtain critical information for delimiting reliable margins during caudate lobe surgery: anatomic study of livers with and without the external caudate notch [^df0ec4a3]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The hilar bifurcation (HB), a wedged portion between the left and right portal vein origins, often issues the caudate branch. However, the HB territory in the caudate lobe has not been well recognized during liver surgery. In 50% of 48 human livers (25 usual livers and 23 with the external caudate notch), the HB gave off thick portal branches (> 1 mm) to supply the caudate lobe. Using minute dissections, we identified four cross-sectional configurations of three subdivisions of the caudate lobe (i.e., left, right, and HB portal territories). The HB territory was consistently located in the paracaval portion, although it sometimes (29.2%: type A) extended slightly or deeply into Spiegel's lobe. This leftward HB territorial extension was seen more frequently in livers with the notch (43.6%) than in those without it ("usual" livers) (16.0%). Moreover, in livers with the notch the caudate lobe (usually its right portal territory) tended to extend upward and rightward to attach or surround the terminal portion of the right hepatic vein. Our results suggested that in many cases subdivisions of the caudate lobe cannot be divided simply into right and left portions. The HB branch or territory should be examined to determine the real principal border as well as the subdivisional configuration of the caudate lobe. Combined evaluation of the HB branch(es) and external notch could provide critical information for anatomically sophisticated caudate lobe surgery.

### A station-wise approach to liver anatomy for linear EUS [^702b3cbf]. VideoGIE (2025). Medium credibility.

Techniques of liver segment visualization on EUS

EUS examination from the gastroesophageal (GE) junction and stomach

The left lobe of the liver can be visualized starting just below the GE junction from the proximal stomach, with the transducer facing anteriorly. The esophagus lies in the groove of the left side of the liver, which is adjacent to the caudate lobe.

All 3 major HVs and superior segments are very well visualized from the GE junction. To visualize other segments (III, IVB, and V) including the liver hilum, the echoendoscope needs to be pushed down into the cardia.

Station 1: Visualization of superior segments from the GE junction

At the GE junction, on minimal anticlockwise rotation, the segments II and III can be seen. By keeping the big knob up, a close approximation of the left lobe with transducer can be achieved. Segment II is visualized close to the transducer, and segment III is seen below the LHV. From segment II, rotate the scope in clockwise direction. The MHV, along with part of the LPV, is seen. The MHV is seen as tubular structure running from the right-upper part of the screen to the lower left. The MHV separates segment IVa from segment VIII.

The ligamentum venosum is a broad, dense fibrous band, remnant of ductus venosus that carries blood from the left umbilical vein to the IVC in fetal circulation. Therefore, the ligamentum venosum is seen between the superior pole of the UPLPV and IVC (merges over the MHV and LHV ostia). It separates segment I from segment IV, which lies superiorly/anteriorly to segment I.

### How I do it: robotic living donor right hepatectomy with a focus on parenchymal transection [^2aa4ee53]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Living donor liver transplantation provides a solution to the shortage of deceased donor organs. As minimally invasive donor hepatectomy has gained popularity, robotic techniques offer clear advantages, such as enhanced visualization, precision, and ergonomics.

Methods

Our institution began robotic liver surgery in 2008 and introduced robotic donor hepatectomies in 2016. With growing experience, we established a standardized approach for robotic donor right hepatectomy (RDRH), focusing on parenchymal transection and bile duct division.

Results

We suggest a zone-based approach along the middle hepatic vein by dividing the transection plane into four zones based on venous territories. This systematization improves the orientation, minimizes bleeding, and facilitates precise dissection. Key anatomical landmarks, such as segmental veins (V5 and V8), the Laennec's capsule, and intersegmental veins, guide the dissection. Supplementary Videos and Figures for each step demonstrate specific techniques, including the inter-Laennec approach and modified hanging maneuver. Bile duct division is guided by indocyanine green fluorescence and performed using either a "clip and cut" or "cut and suture" method, chosen based on individual duct anatomy.

Conclusions

Robotic articulation facilitates secure closure even in anatomically challenging cases. These standardized techniques enable reproducible outcomes and support their safe adoption by centers new to RDRH.

### Computerized system for staging peritoneal surface malignancies [^4deaee95]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Computerized Peritoneal Surface Malignancy Staging System

Based on the classic, graphical black and white representation for assessing the PCI in PSMs, we developed new anatomic models for males and females, illustrating the patient's real anatomy in color, allowing a three-dimensional image effect, and maintaining, as far as possible, Sugarbaker's concepts, including clockwise numbering, total number of regions, and lesion size score criteria, thus creating a topographic scheme (Fig. 2). The same new model, always according to Sugarbaker's lesion size score criteria, served to localize and quantify residual disease and calculate the CC-s after CRS. To avoid structural overlap, we indicated the abdominal wall as region 0, comprising the greater omentum anatomically overlying the abdominal organs. We defined the borders demarcating the various endoabdominal regions unequivocally according to anatomic landmarks: falciform ligament, gastrosplenic ligament, transverse mesocolon, mesenteric root, iliac axes, and pelvic inlet. The concepts used for identifying regions 9–12 (the upper and lower jejunum and ileum) remained unchanged. We illustrated in color the specific organs and structures contained in each region (Fig. 3). Regions 1–3 comprised the organs and structures between the transverse mesocolon and diaphragmatic domes; two landmarks (the falciform ligament and gastrolienal ligament) divided the regions longitudinally. Region 1 included the upper surface of the right liver lobe, the undersurface of the right hemidiaphragm, the gallbladder and hepatic pedicle, the first duodenal portion, and right colonic flexure. Region 2 included the left lobe of the liver, anterior and posterior surface of the stomach, transverse colon between the right and left colonic flexure and its mesocolon, lesser omentum and omental bursa with the anterior surface of the pancreas, and portion of the greater omentum between the greater curvature of the stomach and transverse colon. Region 3 included the undersurface of the left hemidiaphragm, pancreatic tail, gastrosplenic ligament, spleen, and the left colonic flexure (Fig. 3). Regions 4 and 8 were demarcated superiorly by the transverse mesocolon, inferiorly by the iliac axes, and laterally by the right and left abdominal gutter. The two regions were divided longitudinally by the mesenteric root, and both regions included the ascending and descending colon and mesocolon; region 4 included the fourth duodenal portion and the Treitz ligament. Regions 5–7 lay in the space between the iliac axes and the pelvic inlet, separated by the only imaginary line joining the aortic bifurcation to the upper boundary of the pelvic inlet. Region 5 included the sigmoid colon and its mesocolon, and, in women, the left ovary and ovarian tube. Region 7 included the cecum, appendix, the last 10 cm of the distal ileum, and, in women, the right ovary and ovarian tube. Region 6, delimited by the pelvic inlet, included the intraperitoneal rectum, the Douglas pouch, the peritoneum covering the bladder, and, in women, the uterus. For calculating the PCI, the scheme for each region contained three light-grey to black circles, differing in diameter and representing the different lesion size scores (LS1, LS2, and LS3) that could be dragged to the involved anatomic structure so that the computerized system calculated the final score. Similarly, for calculating the CC-s, each region contained three light-grey to black circles, differing in diameter and representing the size of residual disease in a specific region (CC1, CC2, and CC3). The PSM staging system also allowed the user, while dragging the three circles for calculating the PCI or CC-s, to specify, exclusively for LS1/2 and CC1/2, the number of presurgical, perioperative, or residual cancerous implants in each region.

### Laennec's approach for laparoscopic anatomic hepatectomy based on laennec's capsule [^e15f9ddf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Isolating the hepatic vein with Laennec's approach for laparoscopic anatomic hepatectomy

Hepatic veins serve as intrahepatic landmarks for anatomic hepatectomy because they are the boundaries of segments or lobes. However, it is challenging to safely isolate and expose the hepatic veins due to the increased risk of hemorrhage and hemostasis. There is also a natural gap between Laennec's capsule and the hepatic veins. First, the main trunks of the hepatic veins were exposed and pursued to their roots. Golden finger can be gently slid along the upper surface of the veins with Laennec's approach for LAH. The RHV or MHV serves as the intrahepatic landmark for an anatomic right posterior hepatectomy, or right or left hepatectomy.

A representative case underwent a laparoscopic anatomic right hepatectomy, and the trunk of the MHV was isolated and exposed with Laennec's approach for LAH. The parenchyma above the MHV was transected close to Laennec's capsule (Additional file 3). The other case underwent laparoscopic anatomic right posterior hepatectomy to isolate and expose the branches and trunk of the RHV with Laennec's approach for LAH (Fig. 4 g). The parenchyma distal to the RHV was transected close to Laennec's capsule. The hepatic veins for S6 and S7 were exposed and dissected.

The contour for the right hepatic vein is marked with a red line (h).

Fig. 8
(Left) Nonenhanced CT axial image through the abdomen with observer-set markers placed on a liver that directly abuts the stomach. (Right) Image output after IWS processing shows an uncertain border between liver and stomach, a problem likely attributed to partial volume averaging

A large number of segmentation approaches have been described for various applications. In the approach presented, we did not use geometric modeling, such as spheres, to obtain segmentation maps, as described by Salvi et al. We did not use shape constraint to prevent the region growing from leakage into surrounding tissues of similar characteristics, as described by Zhoa et al. However, this approach may be helpful when the tumor is infiltrative or when the border is not easily discernable from adjacent parenchyma.

Another limitation occurs when trying to measure lobes of the liver separated by the fat-containing falciform ligament. This problem is currently approached by either bridging the split-liver areas (Fig. 9), or by measuring each segment separately. Lobar liver volumes were not addressed in this study. The measurement of segmental or lobar liver volumes using the proposed method can be performed. The volume of each lobe could be calculated separately by including only the lobe of interest in the outer boundary.

Fig. 9
(Left) Nonenhanced CT axial image through the abdomen with observer-set markers placed on a liver that splits on either side of the falciform ligament. (Right) Image output after IWS processing shows an overestimated area of the liver, including some of the fat-containing falciform ligament between the right and left lobe of the liver

Several sources of variability affected reproducibility and accuracy in this study. The operators decided the manual placement of the inner and outer boundary markers. The best results were obtained when the inner boundary included a large and representative sample of liver parenchyma and the outer boundary excluded the liver parenchyma in its entirety. The operators could have also chosen to exclude nonhepatic tissue from the measurement. This is performed by placing an outer marker directly over the middle of unwanted tissue. Figure 2 demonstrates exclusion of the inferior vena cava by way of this technique.

### Anatomy of the liver: an outline with three levels of complexity – a further step towards tailored territorial liver resections [^9b226e25]. Journal of Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

The vascular anatomy of the liver can be described at three different levels of complexity according to the use that the description has to serve. The first — conventional — level corresponds to the traditional 8-segments scheme of Couinaud and serves as a common language between clinicians from different specialties to describe the location of focal hepatic lesions. The second — surgical — level, to be applied to anatomical liver resections and transplantations, takes into account the real branching of the major portal pedicles and of the hepatic veins. Radiological and surgical techniques exist nowadays to make full use of this anatomy, but this requires accepting that the Couinaud scheme is a simplification, and looking at the vascular architecture with an unprejudiced eye. The third — academic — level of complexity concerns the anatomist, and the need to offer a systematization that resolves the apparent contradictions between anatomical literature, radiological imaging, and surgical practice. Based on the real number of second-order portal branches that, although variable averages 20, we submit a system called the "1-2-20 concept", and suggest that it fits best the number of actual — as opposed to idealized — anatomical liver segments.

### The segments of the hepatic veins-is there a spatial correlation to the couinaud liver segments? [^2d0f77e0]. European Journal of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate and describe the volume, position and shape of venous segments within the human liver and define their spatial correlation to the Couinaud segments (CS) and to the portal vein segments (PVS).

Material and Methods

This study was based on 64 routinely acquired CT scans of patients undergoing hepatic surgery. The final analysis included 19 patients. All 19 CT data sets were transformed into 3D liver models. Three venous segments were postulated reflecting the left, middle, and right hepatic vein. Each venous segment was furthermore divided in two venous subsegments. Volume, position and shape of these venous segments/subsegments were calculated and, finally, compared with the volume, position and shape of the Couinaud segments and the portal vein segments.

Results

The right hepatic vein covers with 539.8 ± 119.5 mL (47.1%) the largest part of total liver volume followed by the middle hepatic vein 372.7 ± 151.1 mL (32.5%) and the left hepatic vein 248 ± 75.9 mL (20.4%). The Couinaud liver segments and portal vein segments 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8 have consistent positional assignments within the three venous segments. Only the CS 4a, 4b, and 6 showed significantly different positions compared to the PVS 4a, 4b, and 6 (P < 0.03). The venous subsegments have a broad volumetric distribution reaching from 79 to 337 ml. There is no positional correlation of venous subsegments compared to Couinaud segments or portal vein segments at all (kappa < 0.75). In contrast, the venous segments/subsegments which can be assigned to either liver halve and either liver lobe have an identical volume, shape and position compared to the corresponding Couinaud liver segments (kappa > 0.75).

Conclusion

The venous segments distinguish liver areas divided by the left and middle hepatic vein in exactly the same pattern as Couinaud segments and portal vein segments do. However, the comparison of shape and position of venous subsegments showed no correlation with both liver segmental approaches.

### Laparoscopic liver resection of segment 8 via a hepatic parenchymal transection-first approach guided by the middle hepatic vein [^77241f07]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The precautions for LLR of S8 via the hepatic parenchymal transection-first approach guided by the MHV are listed as follows: (1) Preoperative high resolution thin-sliced enhanced CT scanning, helical CT arterial portography and 3D reconstruction visualization system can be used to make accurate assessments of the location and courses of Glissonean pedicles, MHV, and RHV in S8 to avoid damaging the vessels that need to be preserved during surgery. (2) This technique is not dependent on liver staining by injection of special dye. Meanwhile, there was no ischemic line to guide parenchyma transected before G8 ligated and divided. Therefore, IOUS is a useful and convenient step to accurately locate important structures and to provide orientation in an area lacking in external landmarks. Without IOUS instrument or lack of technical experience in operating IOUS, a more thorough comprehension of the LLR techniques and imaging data are required. The boundary between S8 and S4a can also be determined by right or left Glissonean pedicle temporary clamping to form ischemic line. During laparoscopic surgery, it is common for surgeons to converge on the specimen; hence, it is important to add an additional 1–2 cm to the resection margins. (3) The starting point of the parenchymal dissection generally starts from the intersection of the S5 and S8 boundaries and the Cantlie line, but during surgery, this point is difficult to determine. To avoid excessive or insufficient parenchymal transection, we generally use the intersection between the caudal side transection plane where the G8 is at and the Cantlie line as the starting point for parenchymal transection. (4) Exposure of the intrahepatic MHV and separation of the G8 are the key steps for success of the laparoscopic resection of liver S8 guided by the MHV. We use IOUS to locate the MHV to determine the left transection plane. The dissection of left side transection plane and the caudal side transection plane are continued alternately (Fig. 6). The liver parenchyma separation does not go deeper than the level of the MHV (the area beyond this is the right caudal lobe), and then, the MHV and the G8 can be exposed in the liver parenchyma. In order to full exposure, partial hepatic parenchyma of S5 and/or S4a could be dissected. (5) During surgery, attention should be paid to not damage the venous that drained S5, which leads to congestion of S5. (6) The management method of G8 should be based on findings of 3D reconstruction visualization system and other imaging assessments to individualize a method. Either branch ligation or main trunk clipping can be used. Control of all structures is essential, not only to reduce the risk of post-operative complications, but to keep the operative field clear to facilitate vision and meticulous dissection. (7) There may be problems, such as inadequate exposure during initial transection of the liver parenchyma. The exposure can be improved by S8 suspension using suture and adjusting patient positioning during the procedure or retracting the liver toward the left and inferior side. The exposure will be sufficient after splitting of the liver parenchyma. (8) When parenchymal transection along the RHV to the caudal side, the surgeon should move from the right side of the patient to the left, and the parenchyma is transected from the cephalic side to the caudal side. Alternatively, two-surgeon technique can be used in which the surgeon and the assistant exchange roles as needed.

### Computerized tomography-based anatomic description of the porcine liver [^474fa3e5]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The knowledge of the anatomic features is imperative for successful modeling of the different surgical situations. This study aims to describe the anatomic features of the porcine using computerized tomography (CT) scan.

Methods

Thirty large, white, female pigs were included in this study. The CT image acquisition was performed in four-phase contrast study. Subsequently, analysis of the images was performed using syngo.via software (Siemens) to subtract mainly the hepatic artery and its branches. Analysis of the portal and hepatic veins division pattern was performed using the Myrian XP-Liver 1.14.1 software (Intrasense).

Results

The mean total liver volume was 915 ± 159 mL. The largest sector in the liver was the right medial one representing around 28 ± 5.7% of the total liver volume. Next in order is the right lateral sector constituting around 24 ± 5%. Its volume is very close to the volume of the left medial sector, which represents around 22 ± 4.7% of the total liver volume. The caudate lobe represents around 8 ± 2% of the total liver volume. The portal vein did not show distinct right and left divisions rather than consecutive branches that come off the main trunk. The hepatic artery frequently trifurcates into left trunk that gives off the right gastric artery and the artery to the left lateral sector, the middle hepatic artery that supplies both the right and the left medial sectors and the right hepatic artery trunk that divides to give anterior branch to the right lateral lobe, branch to the right medial lobe, and at least a branch to the caudate lobe. Frequently, there is a posterior branch that crosses behind the portal vein to the right lateral lobe. The suprahepatic veins join the inferior vena cava in three distinct openings. There are communications between the suprahepatic veins that drain the adjacent sectors. The vein from the right lateral and the right medial sectors drains into a common trunk. The vein from the left lateral and from the left medial sectors drains into a common trunk. A separate opening is usually encountered draining the right medial sector. The caudate lobe drains separately into inferior vena cava caudal to the other veins.

Conclusions

Knowledge of the anatomic features of the porcine liver is crucial to the performance of a successful surgical procedure. We herein describe the CT-depicted anatomic features of the porcine liver.

### Arterial blood supply of liver segment IV and its possible surgical consequences [^96fcf19a]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Liver surgery depends on the anatomical liver segment classification. There are two different classification systems of hepatic segmentation: that described by Couinaud and the other by Healey and Schroy 1, 11. In both systems, the midplane of the liver is defined by Cantlie's line. This line runs anteriorly from the middle of the gallbladder bed to the inferior vena cava posteriorly. The midplane divides the liver into the right and left hemiliver (Couinaud) or the right and left lobe (Healey and Schroy).

Both of the above classifications use the portal vein and hepatic vein branches to define the right and left lobe. In both classifications, segment IV is part of the left hemiliver. The blood supply of segment IV not only from the portal vein but also from the hepatic arteries is unlike that of the other segments in the segmental liver anatomy and has been a topic of debate 6.

Earlier studies described a different pattern of the origin of the MHA, which supplies segment IV. Healey and Schroy (1953) and Michels (1966) reported that the MHA originated in about equal proportions from the RHA and the LHA 7, 12. In our study, the MHA originated from the RHA and the LHA with the same frequency of 31%, while in one case (3.4%) it branched off from the PHA. Numerous other studies reported that the MHA originates from the LHA more often than from the RHA. Suzuki 13 reported that the MHA was a branch of the LHA in 54% of the cases and of the RHA in 34%. In 8% of the cases it arose at the bifurcation of the PHA and in 4% the MHA was a direct branch of the common hepatic artery. In 2000, Onishi et al reported that the middle hepatic artery branched from the LHA in 61.5%, from the RHA in 27.5%, from the bifurcation of the PHA in 5.5%, and from both the LHA and the RHA in 5.5% of all cases 14. Azoulay et al reported in 2000 that in most cases the MHA originated from the left hepatic artery but could also originate from the RHA, especially in the presence of a replaced LHA 15. In contrast, Jin et al reported in 2008 that the arterial supply to segment IV was mainly via a branch of the RHA or the PHA 16.

Pre-transplant volumetry

Living-donor liver transplants are increasingly being performed given the rising demand for transplant and the diminishing availability of cadaveric livers. As such, opportunities are being sought to improve donor and recipient outcomes. In the paediatric recipient population, for example, it has been shown that transplant of the just the left lateral segment from a living adult donor is sufficient for adequate recipient liver function; however, this is not the case in the adult recipient population.

Pre-transplant volumetry is indicated to ensure appropriate graft size for successful donor and recipient outcomes. To optimise donor graft survival, an FLR/TLV ratio of 30–40% is recommended. The ratio of graft size to standard liver volume (from body surface area) of the recipient should be over 50%; alternatively the ratio of graft size to body weight of the recipient should be over 0.8–1.0%. Inadequately sized grafts may be functionally insufficient and may result in small-for-size syndrome, a potentially fatal condition of hepatic insufficiency that may require re-transplant. Small-for-size syndrome is multifactorial, however, and may develop even when appropriate pre-operative volumetry is performed (see Fig. 6).

Although pre-transplant volumetry calculations seemed to indicate that the liver size was appropriate, the patient still developed small-for-size syndrome requiring ligature of the splenic artery. The cause was likely multifactorial. The donor developed transient biological hepatic insufficiency that resolved with supportive management

### Procedural standards for deceased donor organ recovery [^12f55fc3]. ASTS (2022). High credibility.

Recovered anatomy — vessels in multi-organ recovery states that for some congenital transplant and/or LVAD (left ventricular assist device) to transplant cases, extra vessels may be necessary, including extra aorta, pulmonary arteries and/or innominate vein, and the need for extra vessels may be difficult if a lung team is procuring the lungs and may not be possible if lungs are to be procured for extra pulmonary artery. If the liver is also being procured from the same donor, the document specifies division of the inferior vena cava just below the right atrium, above the diaphragm. Where lungs are being recovered as well, pulmonary artery cannulation should occur as distally as possible, division of the pulmonary artery should begin at the site of pulmonary artery cannulation and should be as distal as possible without involving the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, and pulmonary vein division should be agreed upon by both teams and allow a rim of atrium to remain above the pulmonary veins for the lung team with a good landmark to begin with being a point halfway between the base of the left atrial appendage and the left superior pulmonary vein.

### Automated segmentation of liver segment on portal venous phase MR images using a 3D convolutional neural network [^5e2f0dad]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Manual segmentation

Classification of liver segment was based on Couinaud's description, as shown in Fig. 1. The ground-truth was generated by two radiologists (Z.Y.S. and Z.X.L.) with more than 5 years of experience in abdominal imaging using Mimics software (version 19.0; Materialise, Leuven, Belgium). All the images were divided into two groups and evenly distributed to each radiologist. To ensure the consistency of the segmentation results, two radiologists went through a training session and segmented several cases together before formal segmentation.

Fig. 1
Method of Couinaud's classification on axial MRI images. Five planes (three vertical planes along the main stem of hepatic veins and two horizontal planes through the primary branches of the portal vein) are used to divide the liver. In axial MR images, the line from the midpoint of the IVC to the MHV or vertex of the gallbladder fossa divides the right and left lobes (a and b). The RHV further divides the right lobe into anterior and posterior segments (d and e). The LHV (in the upper part of the liver) and the left longitudinal fissure (in the lower part of the liver) divide the left lobe into a medial and a lateral segment. (g and h). Each segment of right and left lateral lobes is further divided into a superior segment and an inferior segment by the main stem of the right portal vein and the sagittal part of the left portal vein (f and i). The caudate lobe is separated from the other segments by the natural curve from the venous ligament fissure to the right wall of the IVC (c). IVC, inferior vena cava; MHV, middle hepatic vein; RHV, right hepatic vein; LHV, left hepatic vein.

### Liver biopsy [^4d37707f]. Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Liver biopsy — site and approach selection with ultrasound (US) guidance notes that although right lobe biopsy is the usual biopsy site in patients with diffuse disease, the choice varies by operator; some prefer the left hepatic lobe because it is readily accessible using an anterior epigastric subcostal approach, while most operators prefer the right hepatic lobe because it is large and readily accessible using either a subcostal or an intercostal approach. The subcostal approach avoids the lung but may require steep needle angulation and/or deep inspiration in patients with relatively small livers, whereas the intercostal approach does not usually require an extreme breath hold but is associated with a small risk of intercostal artery puncture, which can be minimized by inserting the needle over the cephalad rather than the caudad aspect of the rib; the lung can be easily avoided because it is readily visible as an echogenic structure on US. Additionally, small arteries that are a likely source of significant postbiopsy hemorrhage rarely can be accurately visualized by US, therefore caution and careful postprocedure monitoring remain essential after image-guided biopsy.

### Direct bile duct visualization during the preparation of split livers [^43402fc9]. Liver Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

The split-liver technique is an important means to alleviating donor shortage. Its development is, at least in part, hindered by the risk of biliary complications, particularly when splitting is performed ex situ. We present a simple technique aimed at improving the identification of the biliary anatomy at the hilar level and the safety of the procedure.

### Arterial blood supply of liver segment IV and its possible surgical consequences [^097596bf]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

According to our findings, creating a right lobe graft that includes all of segment IV means that the area medial to the above‐described line will not receive arterial blood since this comes mainly from the LHA. Consequently, the arterial blood supply to the bile ducts in this area will decrease, leading to necrosis of the bile ducts or bile leakage. This might be the reason for the described complications of the trisegment graft in which the parenchyma is transected at the falciform ligament, which can cause hypoperfusion.

The Paris technique of parenchymal transection described by Azoulay and Castaing is performed along the middle of segment IV. Despite leaving on both grafts a slice of theoretically devascularized tissue during the splitting process, they have never experienced any necrosis of the cut surfaces. The line of transection is drawn from the left side of the IVC at the cephalad point, to a point equidistant from the gallbladder bed and the round ligament at the anterior–inferior limit of the liver retaining the middle hepatic vein with the left graft. The two grafts could be used for two adult recipients 23.

The afore‐described procedure supports our definition of the demarcation line, which runs in the middle of segment IV. Using our line for parenchymal transection will increase the volume of a left graft and could be transplanted to an adult recipient.

Preservation of biliary vascularization, physiologic arterial perfusion of all segments, and anatomical resection line during transection are some the major technical aspects with impact on adequate function of the split liver graft 23. Depending on our finding, the LLS graft will not be affected as it receives its arterial blood supply from the LHA but the RTS will be affected, as a part of segment IV that receives its arterial blood from the LHA will not receive enough oxygenated blood after the parenchyma transection at the falciform ligament.

Besides the described advantages in transplant surgery, our findings might influence oncologic liver surgery. When performing the ALPPS procedure 24 in patients with marginally resectable liver metastases, nearly all groups described high rates of biliary leakage and necrosis of segment IV 25.

### Prospective volumetric assessment of the liver on a personal computer by nonradiologists prior to partial hepatectomy [^ef19f56d]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

A possible limitation of estimating the future remnant liver volume with CT volumetry is the systematic overestimation of the liver volumes compared to the resected specimens' weight. A physical density < 1.0 g/ml and systematic overestimation of the liver volume in the present study was in accordance with those of previous studies. Inaccurate estimation of the resected specimen volume by CT volumetry can occur because the liver on a CT scan is in a perfused state and the postoperative resection specimen is in an unperfused state. This applies to every radiologic application, and therefore some studies have suggested the implementation of conversion factors to improve volumetric accuracy. These factors are mostly based on the intraoperative resection volume determined with the use of Archimedes principle. Unfortunately, this approach does not determine the influence of the blood content of the resection specimen. It might be that these conversion factors can lead to a more precise volumetric analysis of the liver, but their exact role remains to be determined. Patients with steatosis have more fat in the liver, and the relative densitie of fat is 0.9 g/ml. Hence, the volume is larger and the weight less than that of a normal liver. Ultimately, this changes the volume/weight standard and can also contribute to systemic overestimation.

In all right hemihepatectomies in the present study, virtual transection followed Cantlie's line, and thus the middle hepatic vein (MHV) was used as a guide for prospective volume measurements. During surgery, the demarcation line after selective inflow occlusion is used for transection and may leave liver parenchyma outside (i.e. to the right of) the MHV in some patients. As a consequence, preoperative estimation of the future resected specimen volume may be overestimated in some individuals. In line with this, Karlo et al. showed in a retrospective study that, despite a highly accurate definition of the transection line on preoperative CT or MRI scans using anatomic landmarks on postoperative MRI scans, the resection specimen volume was still overestimated. Systematic overestimation, however, does not affect the functional remnant liver volume as a percentage of the total functional liver volume, which is one of the most important indicators of the risk of postoperative liver failure.

Semi-automated segmentation

Semi-automated segmentation techniques require coarse initialisation from the user; the algorithm then provides the majority of the optimisation. These techniques often rely on a combination of interactions. Examples include intensity-based techniques and graph cut.

Intensity-based techniques

Intensity-based techniques classify pixels and their neighbours according to intensity or texture. For example, seeded region growing is an intensity-based technique where "seeds" are positioned by the user in the liver parenchyma (see Fig. 11 or the supplementary material for an animation). The pixels then iteratively aggregate if their intensity matches that of those already tagged. As a result, intensity-based techniques perform very well on homogenous livers. However, since there is no shape control, intensity-based techniques may result in leakage of the seeded area or rough edges. This is particularly problematic in diseased livers where substantial user interaction may be required to achieve desired results. Furthermore, intensity-based techniques are ill-suited MR segmentation of the liver due to the greater heterogeneity of the parenchyma on this modality.

Fig. 11
Seeded region-growing technique. a Seeds are positioned inside the regions of interest by user. b Pixels are iteratively aggregated if their intensity is similar to those already tagged. c The liver parenchyma is segmented

Graph-cut

In the graph-cut technique, the user roughly paints some foreground (i.e. the liver) and background pixels (i.e. peri-hepatic structures). Based on graph analysis and optimisation, a cut is then performed to separate the foreground and background areas in the most homogeneous regions. This isolates the liver on the given image slice for volumetry (see supplementary material for an animation of this technique).

### Fusion of the midplane with the left intersectional plane: a liver anatomical variation revisited with multidetector-row CT [^4215c36c]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

This article updates the description of an anatomical variation of the liver, in which the gallbladder is adjacent to the ligamentum teres, that was described until now as "right-sided ligamentum teres and right umbilical portion of the portal vein". A study of eight patients showing this anatomical variation has led to a new archetypal anatomical description of the hepatic and portal veins, using multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) with three-dimensional (3D) volume-rendering (VR) reconstructions. While 2D axial imaging gave the same information, MDCT imaging with VR reconstructions provided a clear 3D visualization of this anatomical variation. Typical features can be described as follows: (1) juxtaposition of the ligamentum teres and the gallbladder; (2) typical portal vein branching with a right posterior branch, a left posterior branch and a main medial branch that terminates in the ligamentum teres; (3) two main hepatic veins and a hypotrophied medial hepatic vein. We think, based on the direct comparison of anatomical findings and knowledge of chronological embryological development, that this abnormality results from the defective development of the central part of the liver and not from the persistence of the right rather than the left umbilical vein. Because of the presence of only one medial plane, containing both the gallbladder and the ligamentum teres, we propose renaming it "fusion of hepatic planes".

Operative procedures

The preoperative evaluation, postoperative management, port arrangement, and positioning of the 20 patients were as described previously. All patients were placed in a left semi-decubitus position. The main surgeon stood on the patient's left side. The patient was placed in the reverse Trendelenburg position and the central venous pressure was maintained at < 5 cmH 2 O. Five trocars were needed for LAH. One 12 mm paraumbilical trocar and carbon dioxide were used to establish the pneumoperitoneum, the pressure of which was maintained at 10–12 mmHg. A 30° flexible laparoscope was introduced through the paraumbilical trocar, and the other four working trocars were placed surrounding the right lobe. A tourniquet for the Pringle maneuver was set using a Nelaton catheter and vessel tape through a 5 mm incision on the left mid-clavicular line. The Pringle maneuver was performed at 15-min intervals to control hemorrhage. The operation began with the division of the falciform ligament, which exposed the gap between the middle hepatic vein (MHV) and the right hepatic vein (RHV). Next, the gallbladder was resected (in LRH or LRPH). The paracaval portion of the caudate lobe was freed from the inferior vena cava (IVC) by means of the liver hanging maneuver.

First, Glissonian approach served to isolate and dissect the corresponding hepatic pedicles (right pedicle for LRH, right posterior pedicle for LRPH, or the pedicles for S7). Then, the paracaval portion of caudate lobe along the IVC was transected through dorsal approch, and then the demarcation line of the ischemic area appeared on the liver surface. Next, Harmonic shear was used to transect the liver parenchyma between the IVC and main hepatic vein (MHV or RHV) first through dorsal approach from its root to the peripheral branches. The corresponding major hepatic vein exposed from the dorsal approach as the intrahepatic landmark. The liver parenchyma between the diaphragmatic demarcation and the MHV or RHV along the aimed hepatic vein was transected through the ventral approach towards to the root of the RHV. The branches of the hepatic vein were dissected by a Hem-O-lok ligating clip, while the root of the RHV was dissected by an automatic stapler in LRH or LRPH.

### Arterial blood supply of liver segment IV and its possible surgical consequences [^41e27f8c]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

The risk of ischemia of segment IV after split liver resection is high. This anatomical study was done to identify the arterial blood supply and the intrahepatic distribution of liver segment IV. The anatomy of segment IV was studied in 29 livers from adult cadavers. To identify the arterial blood supply of segment IV, water and ink were injected into the various branches of the hepatic artery and the outflow through segment IV and discoloration of the liver parenchyma were observed. In 23 of the 29 livers (79.3%), the arterial perfusion of segment IV was separated by a line drawn from the left side of the inferior vena cava at the top of and lateral to the falciform ligament to the medial point of the gallbladder bed. The area lateral to this line was supplied mainly by the right hepatic artery, and the area medial to it was supplied mainly by the left hepatic artery. In addition to the classification system of Couinaud, we describe here a new division of liver segment IV based on arterial blood supply. These anatomical findings may be useful in defining the resection line for split liver to prevent necrosis of segment IV.

### Relation between hepatic and portal veins in the right paramedian sector: proposal for anatomical reclassification of the liver [^100e8ccb]. World Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Although a right liver graft without a middle hepatic vein resulted in potential venous congestion in the right paramedian sector, the details of the hepatic venous distribution in the right paramedian sector have not been established. In this study, the ramification patterns of the hepatic veins draining the right anterosuperior segment (S8) and the relation between the hepatic and portal veins were assessed using multislice computed tomography in 44 patients without lesions in the liver. All 52 drainage veins of the ventral area of S8 joined the middle hepatic vein, and all 48 drainage veins of the dorsal area joined the right hepatic vein. The hepatic vein crossing between the ventral and dorsal areas was observed in each patient examined. Therefore, we propose a reclassification wherein the right paramedian sector is divided into ventral and dorsal segments. This new classification may contribute to the development of new and safer surgical procedures, including more limited resection and right lobe adult living donor liver transplantation to avoid graft congestion.

### Surgical anatomy of segmental liver transplantation [^9cb01a01]. The British Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The emergence of split and living donor liver transplantation has necessitated re-evaluation of liver anatomy in greater depth and from a different perspective than before. Early attempts at split liver transplantation were met with significant numbers of vascular and biliary complications. Technical innovations in this field have evolved largely by recognizing anatomical anomalies and variations at operation, and devising novel ways of dealing with them. This has led to increasing acceptance of these procedures and decreased morbidity and mortality rates, similar to those observed with whole liver transplantation.

Methods and Results

The following review is based on clinical experience of more than 180 split and living related liver transplantations in adults and children, performed over a 7-year period from 1994 to 2001.

Conclusion

A comprehensive understanding and application of surgical anatomy of the liver is essential to improve and maintain the excellent results of segmental liver transplantation.

Information regarding the nature of the operative procedure should be provided, with any additional annotation that may be necessary (Figure 1). The various surgical procedures listed include those that attempt primary resection or resection post‐chemotherapy, and the judicious use of transplant where necessary for conventionally unresectable cases. Should the operative specimen not be one typically obtained for hepatoblastoma resection or transplantation, this needs to be clearly indicated.

Tumour Site

Hepatoblastoma usually presents as a single mass, involving the right lobe (55%–60%), the left lobe (15%) or both lobes of the liver. It is important to know the location of the tumour to determine surgical resectability.

Tumour Focality

Tumour focality is a core element; although the number of tumours is a non‐core feature (Table 1).

Hepatoblastoma is an aggressive embryonal tumour with a historically high mortality of approximately 76% reported in the early 1980s. However, recent advances in chemotherapy and the development of new surgical techniques have dramatically improved the prognosis of these children to up to 90% 5‐year survival in some regions. Tumour‐specific adverse prognostic factors include high stage using the COG surgical or PRETEXT staging systems, certain histologic subtypes, older age, vascular invasion and multifocality.,

Multifocal disease has been shown to be an independent factor associated with worse event‐free survival and overall survival. For these reasons, it has been recommended that the presence of tumour multifocality be a component of prognostic stratification.

### Image-guided proper liver segmentectomy [^c6d8757a]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The new cross-sectional radiological tools, 3D computed tomography and magnetic resonance, allow a precise study of the liver anatomy. Thanks to these imaging techniques, a new space inside the liver parenchyma, the "hepatic core", was recently recognized, where the hila of liver segments are present.

Methods

On the basis of anatomical and radiological observations, we identified a new virtual plane of dissection, named "hepato-portal", which is useful in liver segmentectomy, if integrated with the classical planes of dissection.

Results

Simulated surgical procedures can be intra-operatively transferred by ultrasounds. In this way, we performed ten "proper" liver segmentectomies through preliminary sections of the hilar vessels and a precise dissection of the boundaries of each segment.

Conclusions

Our experience underlines the value of integrating anatomy and radiology in the simulated liver surgery.

### Subtotal (segment II-VIII) hepatectomy for bilateral diffuse hepatolithiasis with compensatory caudate lobe hypertrophy: a report of two cases [^b0df72eb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

As for the key points during the operation, it is difficult to distinguish the anatomic structure of hepatic hilum due to the severe adhesions and rotation of liver. We advise to apply the intrafascial approach to expose and dissect the branches of hepatic artery, portal vein and bile duct to the caudate lobe. Maneuver must be gentle and meticulous to avoid any injury to the vital blood supply or bile drainage of the caudate lobe. To differentiate the demarcation between hypertrophic caudate lobe and segment II–VIII is another critical issue. Normally, the Spiegel lobe on the left side of IVC is relatively isolated and easier to be distinguished from the peripheral liver segments, but the boundary between the paracaval portion of caudate lobe and the right posterior liver lobe is difficult to be defined. In the reports of Takayama and Midorikawa, by the means of puncturing the right posterior portal vein under the guidance of intraoperative ultrasound, the boundary between caudate lobe and right posterior liver lobe is identified by counterstaining and tattooing techniques. Kogure et al. have reported that the caudate processus hepatic vein can be used as the demarcation between caudate processus and right posterior lobe, but the boundary between paracaval portion and right posterior lobe is still unclear. Maki et al. used 3D liver reconstruction to demonstrate that in half of normal people, a small branch from the root of right hepatic vein, named "paracaval vein", can be used as the boundary between paracaval portion and segment VII or VIII. Interestingly, there is a natural demarcation between atrophic main liver and hypertrophic caudate lobe in case of AHC, which can be served as the reference line of liver parenchyma transection.

SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY IN THE MAMMALIAN LIVER

Architecture of the mammalian liver

The liver is the central metabolic organ of higher vertebrates and the largest glandular organ. The mammalian liver is a highly complex 3D structured and functionally heterogeneous organ with a unique dual blood supply from the hepatic portal vein (PV), which brings all the blood from the gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen, and from the hepatic artery that carries oxygenated blood to the liver. Portal venous and arterial blood mix together in hepatic sinusoids before leaving the liver through the hepatic vein. The mammalian liver is divided into functionally distinct lobes, which in turn are formed by honeycomb-like structures made of repetitive functional structural units, the liver lobules, are organized in a highly irregular manner, and present different sizes and axial orientations (Figure 1 A).

Liver architecture and metabolic zonation. (A) The mammalian liver is a highly complex 3D structure organized in a honeycomb-like arrangement made of liver lobules as repetitive functional structural units. Liver lobules can be further divided into 3 zones: the region surrounding the portal triads, composed of the portal vein (PV), hepatic artery, and the bile duct, is called the periportal (zone 1); hepatocytes adjacent to the central vein (CV) are known as the pericentral (zone 3); and the regions in between are referred to as the midlobular (zone 2). (B) Currently described spatial metabolic zonation of liver metabolic processes and liver immune cells, and the molecular determinants of liver zonation are schematically summarized.

### The AIUM practice parameter for the performance of an ultrasound examination of the abdomen and / or retroperitoneum [^c3a6445d]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). High credibility.

AIUM abdominal ultrasound — liver examination specifications state that the examination "should include long-axis and transverse views", liver measurement "may be performed on longitudinal images at the midclavicular line", the parenchyma "should be evaluated for focal and/or diffuse abnormalities", and, if possible, echogenicity "should be compared with that of the right kidney". In addition, "the following should be imaged": major hepatic and perihepatic vessels including the inferior vena cava (IVC), hepatic veins, and portal vein; the hepatic lobes (right, left, and caudate) and, if possible, the right hemidiaphragm and adjacent pleural space; the liver surface with a high-frequency transducer to evaluate for surface nodularity in patients at risk for cirrhosis; and, for vascular examinations, color and spectral Doppler evaluation to document blood flow characteristics and direction.

### What's right when the gallbladder's left? A case report [^12ffbf37]. Surgical Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

During laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis in a 40-year-old woman, we came upon a case of incidentally discovered left-sided gallbladder (LSG). Two anatomic variants of LSG are known: (a) "true LSG", in which, according to Gross, an accessory gallbladder originates from the left hepatic duct (LHD), the right embryonic bud is readsorbed, and the cystic duct joins either the CBD from the left or the LHD directly. Otherwise, a normal right-sided gallbladder adheres to the inferior left hepatic lobe, and the cystic duct joins the CBD from the right side (as in our case); (b) gallbladder under the fourth hepatic segment, medial to a right-sided round ligament, probably resulting from a prenatal obliteration of the right umbilical vein. Left-sided gallbladder is a paraphysiologic condition that when identified before surgery, must be studied by CT or MRI, when incidentally discovered during surgery must be promptly recognized by the surgeon, who must be aware of the unpredictable confluence of the cystic duct into the CBD. The following operative precautions are useful for avoiding a lesion of the CBD: The surgeon should start dissection of Calot's triangle as close as possible to the gallbladder margin, prepare and clip the cystic duct as close as possible to the infundibulum, and a 30 degrees angled telescope. If in doubt, the surgeon should perform an intraoperative cholangiography.

### Surgery for colorectal liver metastases [^94179b65]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Determining resectability requires detailed knowledge of liver anatomy. Surprisingly, liver anatomy was not widely understood until the mid twentieth century. Even in the most detailed anatomical text books originating in the English-speaking world the liver appears little more than a box into which vessels enter and leave but without any internal anatomy.in France first described the segmental anatomy of the liver, which is essential to modern liver surgery. In essence the liver has four sectors and eight segments (Figure 1). Each segment has a portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct and hepatic vein branches. This means they can all be resected separately leaving for the most part the other segments of the liver uncompromised.

Resectability is much debated by liver surgeons, but in essence the current consensus would be that after resection the patient should have at least two liver segments remaining and in continuity. The remnant must be supplied by a portal vein and a hepatic artery, and there must be a bile duct, which is or can be made to be in continuity with the gut. In addition one of the three main hepatic veins should remain. Furthermore, the remnant should be around 20–25% of the total functional liver volume. This remaining liver volume is calculated on the basis of the pre-operative axial imaging and is termed the future liver remnant (FLR). There are some caveats. Survival with an FLR of 25% requires the residual liver to be free from disease such as cirrhosis, steatosis and nowadays, most importantly, chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis (CASH). Patients with a diseased liver require a larger remnant to survive. However, an inadequate FLR is also not now an absolute contra-indication for surgery. Techniques are available to 'grow' liver to facilitate resection and these are considered further below.

### Surgical text for orthotopic liver transplantation model with small-for-size graft in the pig: key techniques and pitfalls [^687abb25]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Anatomy of the porcine liver

The porcine liver is divided into four lobes: right medial lobe (RML), right lateral lobe (RLL), left medial lobe (LML) and left lateral lobe (LLL). The RLL accounts for 30% of the liver volume. The gallbladder is adjacent to the RML. The suprahepatic inferior vena cava (SHIVC) is completely covered by liver parenchyma and diaphragm, and therefore has no extrahepatic margins (Fig. 3). The infrahepatic inferior vena cava (IHIVC) extends into the RLL. There are no structures behind the liver except for a thin membrane. The typical appearance of the hepatic hilus is shown in Fig. 4. The bilateral hepatic ducts join to form the common bile duct (CBD). The portal vein (PV) bifurcates into left and right branches. The common hepatic artery (CHA) divides into the gastroduodenal artery and the branches for each lobe. The artery to the RLL is located separately on the PV trunk. The right gastric artery arises from the artery to the LLL.

### Fluoroless intravascular ultrasound image-guided liver navigation in porcine models [^b799477c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Intravascular ultrasound image-guided liver navigation. 1, right hepatic vein; 2, right median hepatic vein; 3, left median hepatic vein; 4, left lateral hepatic vein. The hepatic veins were classified according to the information given by Nykonenko et al. The illustration was originally created by the authors

The success of the US-guided intravascular navigation of the liver using the IVUSc was defined beforehand as the precise recognition of more than 95% of the prearranged anatomical landmarks, only relying upon the images provided by the IVUSc without any further complementary methods. The landmarks were selected cephalocaudally, starting immediately after passing through a central vein, and ending with extrahepatic neighboring structures, namely thoracic IVC, retrohepatic IVC, infrahepatic IVC, HVs confluence, right HV, right median HV, left median HV, left lateral HV, third-order HV branches, main PV, right PV, left PV, third-order PV branches, common bile duct, right hepatic bile duct, left hepatic bile duct, gallbladder with the access to four HVs in an ex vivo model, and the abovementioned structures with hepatic artery, right hepatic artery, left hepatic artery, pancreas, and duodenum in an in vivo model (see Additional file 1: Supplementary file 1 and Additional file 2: Supplementary file 2, which illustrate the data collection sheets for IVUS image-guided liver navigation). Both ex vivo/in vivo tests started when operator #1 introduced the IVUSc through the vascular introducer into a central vein and navigated the liver stepwise with the IVUS information alone. The partial times elapsed to identify each landmark were annotated, and when each of them was identified by operator #1, two other experienced US operators (#2 and #3) checked the indicated location with the secondary US system using a convex external probe and collected them as categorical variables (yes/no — checkboxes), along with the timestamp and video images of both US systems. No feedback was given back to operator #1 to avoid intraprocedure external biases. As a contingency plan, the experiment was scheduled in the hybrid operating room, and two extra scenarios were prepared in case of failure of the IVUS navigation alone: one making the secondary external US system available to operator #1 (second scenario), and the other incorporating X-ray fluoroscopy and/or cone-beam computed tomography images (Artis Zeego, Siemens Healthineers).

### Doppler assessment after right hepatectomy confirms the need to fix the remnant left liver in the anatomical position [^4eb10b60]. The British Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The remnant left liver after right hepatectomy tends to rotate spontaneously into the right subphrenic space. This rotation might induce venous outflow impairment. The aim of this study was to assess immediate venous outflow in the left hepatic vein by intraoperative Doppler ultrasound (US) according to the position of the remnant liver.

Methods

From August 2003 to February 2004, assessment of left hepatic venous outflow was systematically performed in 44 consecutive right hepatic resections by Doppler US in spontaneous and anatomical positions. The anatomical position was defined as the position in which the falciform ligament was in its strict median position.

Results

The placement of the left liver from the spontaneous position to the anatomical position resulted in a significant increase in left hepatic venous outflow (20.1 ± 5.7 versus 8.5 ± 4.4 cm/s; P < 0.0001). In the spontaneous position, the decrease in left hepatic venous outflow persisted even without division of the left triangular ligament (10.2 ± 5.4 versus 21.7 ± 5.3 cm/s in the anatomical position) or removal of the middle hepatic vein (8.4 ± 3.4 versus 21.3 ± 5.8 cm/s).

Conclusion

Results of this study strongly suggest that after right hepatectomy the remnant left liver should always be fixed in the anatomical position.

### Liver segmentation: indications, techniques and future directions [^bf0c0306]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Manual segmentation

Manual liver segmentation relies heavily on user-interaction to perform segmentation. Manual segmentation is performed via the contouring of pixels along the boundary of the liver or the in-painting of the liver parenchyma on sequential CT or MR slices. Once the liver has been identified on each slice, post-processing software is used to generate liver volume. Early manual segmentation approaches used very basic tools such as a pencil, spline widget or paintbrush. Newer manual techniques use algorithms to optimise contouring or in-painting; despite this rudimentary level of automation, these techniques may still be considered manual.

To perform manual segmentation via contouring, axial CT or MR images are saved as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files and loaded to post-processing software. The image analyst then uses a cursor to position nodes along the liver boundary (see Fig. 8 a or the supplementary material for an animation). Vessels enclosed by the parenchyma are included, while those that are adjacent to the liver — such as the portal vein and the inferior vena cava — are excluded. The total number of pixels within the bounded area provides the cross-sectional area for a given slice (Fig. 8 b). Each slice area is then multiplied by the slice thickness and the resulting volumes are summed to provide the total liver volume. Similar inclusion and exclusion parameters are used for in-painting, although in this case the parenchyma is swept-over by the user to select areas of interest within the liver.

Manual segmentation of the liver. a Manual segmentation of the liver performed by contouring of pixels of the liver boundary on CT image. Image obtained using Osirix image post-processing software (Osirix Foundation, Geneva, Switzerland). b Volume of the liver is obtained based on pixel size and slice spacing

There are many drawbacks of manual segmentation. There is inherent intra-observer and inter-observer variability given its subjectivity. Variability is also be introduced by the sharpness of liver boundaries, window level settings, and computer monitor settings. Manual segmentation is also time-consuming and may take up to 90 minutes for one patient. As a result, manual segmentation is not suited for a busy clinical practice in high volume settings. Examples of assisted contouring and in-painting techniques used during manual segmentation are addressed below.

### Marginal hepatectomy in the rat: from anatomy to surgery [^fa17af98]. Annals of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Based on the 3-dimensional visualization of vascular supply and drainage, a vessel-oriented resection technique was optimized. The new surgical technique was used to determine the maximal reduction in liver mass enabling a 50% 1-week survival rate.

Background Data

Determination of the minimal liver mass is necessary in clinical as well as in experimental liver surgery. In rats, survival seems to depend on the surgical technique applied. Extended hepatectomy with removal of 90% of the liver mass was long regarded as a lethal model. Introduction of a vessel-oriented approach enabled long-term survival in this model.

Methods

The lobar and vascular anatomy of rat livers was visualized by plastination of the whole organ, respectively, by corrosion casts of the portal vein, hepatic artery and liver veins. The three-dimensional models were used to extract the underlying anatomic structure. In 90% partial hepatectomy, the liver parenchyma was clamped close to the base of the respective liver lobes (left lateral, median and right, liver lobe). Piercing sutures were placed through the liver parenchyma, so that the stem of portal vein and the accompanying hepatic artery but also the hepatic vein were included.

Results

A 1-week survival rate of 100% was achieved after 90% hepatectomy. Extending the procedure to 95% resection by additional removal of the upper caudate lobe led to a 1-week survival rate of 66%; 97% partial hepatectomy, accomplished by additional resection of the lower caudate lobe only leaving the paracaval parts of the liver behind, resulted in 100% lethality within 4 days.

Conclusions

Using a anatomically based, vessel-oriented, parenchyma-preserving surgical technique in 95% liver resections led to long-term survival. This represents the maximal reduction of liver mass compatible with survival.

### "Anatomical" versus "territorial" belonging of the middle hepatic vein: virtual imaging and clinical repercussions [^463169a2]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Venous drainage patterns are of vital importance in live donor liver transplantation. The purpose of this study was to delineate "anatomical-topographical" and "territorial-physiologic" patterns of the middle hepatic vein (MHV) in a 3-D liver model as determined by the Pringle line and its drainage volume of the right and left hemilivers.

Methods

One hundred thirty-seven consecutive live donor candidates were evaluated by 3-D CT reconstructions and virtual hepatectomies. Based on right (R) and left (L), anatomical (A) and territorial (T) belonging patterns of the MHV, each individual was assigned to one of four possible types: type I:A(R)-T(R); type II:A(L)-T(L); type III:A(R)-T(L); type IV:A(L)-T(R). Couinaud's anatomical MHV variants A-C were subsequently included in our combined anatomical/territorial MHV belonging classification.

Results

The MHV showed a significant predominance of right "anatomical" (59.1%) and left "territorial" belonging patterns (65.7%). The paradoxical combinations A(R)-T(L) (type III) and A(L)-T(R) (type IV) were encountered in 36.5% and 11.7% of cases, respectively. The constellations Couinaud's A-belonging type IV and Couinaud's C-belonging type IV were predictive of right hemiliver venous congestion.

Conclusions

(1) Almost half of all livers in our series had paradoxical "anatomical"/"territorial" MHV belonging patterns that placed them at risk for right and left hepatectomies. (2) The proposed combined "anatomical"/"territorial" MHV belonging types (I-IV) provide useful preoperative information. (3) Combined types III and IV as well as Couinaud's A-IV, and Couinaud's C-IV should be considered particularly risky for venous congestion in right hemiliver grafts and in extended left hepatectomies.

### Middle hepatic vein roadmap for a safe laparoscopic right hepatectomy [^3aa13d3c]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

When performing a right hepatectomy, the middle hepatic vein (MHV) should guide the parenchymal transection. MHV hotspots for bleeding can be anticipated when applying the previously developed MHV Roadmap to a minimally invasive approach.1 This video demonstrates application of the MHV Roadmap to perform a safe laparoscopic right hepatectomy.

Patient

A 44-year-old woman with a solitary and large breast cancer liver metastasis in the right liver was considered for a laparoscopic right hepatectomy following an excellent response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The MHV anatomy was reconstructed using automated vascular reconstruction software (Synapse, Fuji) ahead of surgery.

Technique

With the patient in the French position, the hilar vessels are exposed and the inflow is controlled. Parenchymal transection begins along the demarcation line.2, 3 The constant relationship between the portal bifurcation and the V5 ventral and dorsal allows for easy intraparenchymal identification of the MHV. The parenchymal transection is performed in a convex fashion to optimize exposure of the MHV. Using MHV guidance, the parenchymal transection is continued and V8 is safely identified. The operation is completed with division of the anterior fissure and right hepatic vein.

Conclusion

Outlining the MHV anatomy according to the MHV Roadmap preoperatively helps to anticipate hotspots of bleeding. Guidance along the MHV through the parenchymal transection allows for early identification of tributaries, thereby preventing injury and remnant liver ischemia.

### Isolated caudate lobe resection: technical challenges [^da36f395]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Surgical technique

The incision preferred is a bilateral subcostal with a midline extension if required. Laparotomy is done to confirm absence of peritoneal deposits. Either left- or right-sided approach was undertaken depending on the location and size of the tumor.

In the left-sided approach, the left lobe was mobilized and rotated to the right. The gastrohepatic ligament was exposed and divided. The retrocaval ligament was divided. The short hepatic veins from the caudate lobe to the IVC were progressively divided, proceeding in a caudal to cranial direction. Once the retrohepatic veins were divided, the caudate lobe could be lifted off the IVC and became more mobile. The caudate lobe was retracted to the left and the branch from the left portal vein to the caudate lobe was divided. Then parenchymal dissection was undertaken to separate the caudate lobe from the right lobe of the liver. This part of the procedure was the most difficult as there is no definite demarcation between the two. However, no counterstaining techniques were undertaken to identify the right margin of resection. A combination of harmonic scalpel, bipolar and monopolar cautery were commonly used for parenchymal transaction (Fig. 1–8).

Mobilization from the left was difficult in tumors located in the paracaval portion of the caudate lobe (n = 2) and in case of bulky tumors (n = 1). In such situations a right-sided approach was appropriate. The right liver was mobilized from the diaphragm until the lateral surface of the IVC was reached. Dissection was continued in a plane between the anterior surface of the IVC and the posterior surface of the caudate lobe. The retro hepatic veins from the caudate lobe were divided starting inferiorly behind the paracaval portion and extending superiorly until the major hepatic vein trunks were reached. Transection was carried along the right border of the caudate process to the root of the right hepatic vein in the cranial direction.

### Quality metrics for single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging: an ASNC information statement [^4d4be759]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

D1. Extra-cardiac activity — separation of subdiaphragmatic activity from the heart is a defined processing quality measure because liver activity, particularly in the left lobe, and/or stomach activity due to duodenogastric reflux can result in photon scatter into the adjacent myocardium, and tomograms may be normalized to the 'hot' inferior wall creating artifactual defects; if excessive liver and/or stomach activity is present, delayed imaging should be performed. The definition of measure is the percentage of SPECT MPI studies with no extracardiac activity or with extracardiac activity separated from the heart in the final processed and archived scans. The reporting period is 100 consecutive stress SPECT MPI studies performed at the site, with archived scans as the data source and no exclusions. The measure numerator is the number of SPECT MPI studies with no liver or stomach activity or with activity separated from myocardium and the denominator is the number of SPECT MPI studies examined, with standards of good quality ≥ 80% and of excellent quality ≥ 90%.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma: a practical anatomy-based guide for staging and treatment planning, from theSpecial series on critical anatomy [^caed63bd]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and is rising in incidence. Treatment is complex and rapidly evolving but is also highly algorithmic. Radiologic imaging (primarily CT and MRI) guides treatment at each management step, and radiologists command a central role across the continuum of HCC care, from early detection during surveillance to diagnosis, staging, treatment, and response assessment. Recent updates to major guidelines, including the 2022 Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system and the 2023 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines, reflect significant advances in surgical approaches, interventional techniques, and systemic therapies. Radiologists must accurately assess tumor burden, background liver, and vascular anatomy to determine eligibility for each treatment pathway. This review provides an overview of clinically relevant anatomic considerations for HCC staging and treatment planning, informed by recent major treatment advances. We present a practical anatomy-based approach to radiology reporting that aligns with clinical decision-making pathways. By incorporating these elements, radiologists can effectively communicate relevant findings, facilitate appropriate therapy selection, and guide multidisciplinary discussions.

### Technical challenges of hepatic venous outflow reconstruction in right lobe adult living donor liver transplantation [^8825b4ab]. Liver Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

A right lobe graft that is drained by the right hepatic vein (RHV) is obtained by transecting the liver on the right side of the middle hepatic vein (MHV). On occasion, a small RHV that only drains a portion of the right lobe, with the predominant outflow achieved by the MHV, is encountered. If such variation is not recognized while performing right lobe liver transplantation and the RHV only is used for reconstruction, venous outflow obstruction with subsequent graft congestion and eventual graft failure will occur. Additionally, preservation of the main MHV and its branch drainage of the left lobe is crucial to avoid outflow blockage to the remaining segment 4 in the donor. We report 4 cases showing a variant type of small RHV and large MHV branch that drain not only segments 5 and 8, but also segments 6 and 7. These variations were simultaneously associated with a large-caliber inferior RHV that also required reconstruction. The methods used to diagnose such anatomic variations and the techniques for reconstruction in the donor and recipient are described.

### Description of the vascular anatomy of livers with absence of the portal bifurcation [^dcd980ac]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The absence of the portal bifurcation (APB) is a rare anatomic variation, in which the horizontal part of the left portal vein (PV) is missing. The aim of this study was to identify the vascular architecture in livers with APB.

Methods

Computed tomography data for 17,651 patients were reviewed; five patients (0.03%) were found to present with APB. The liver volume and anatomy of APB patients were compared with those of 30 patients with normal livers.

Results

All the APB patients exhibited an independent posterior branch of the PV. The intrahepatic left PV (LPV) ran through either the ventral (n = 2, 40%) or dorsal side (n = 3, 60%) of the middle hepatic vein. The frequency of medial branches diverging from the LPV was higher in patients with APB than in normal patients (p < 0.001). The left hepatic duct (LHD) ran through the inside of the left lobe along the left PV in 40% of the patients with APB, whereas in the remaining 60% of the patients with APB, the LHD ran on the outside of the liver separately from the left PV and joined the right hepatic duct. The liver volume of the left lateral section was significantly smaller (p = 0.014), and the posterior section was significantly larger (p = 0.014) in patients with APB than in patients with normal livers.

Conclusion

The unique anatomical characteristics and the positional relation of the vessels should be considered preoperatively in patients with APB.

### Hepatic vein anatomy of the medial segment for living donor liver transplantation using extended right lobe graft [^dce62d75]. Liver Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatic vein anatomy (V4) of the medial segment (S4) has been a matter of concern since introduction of extended right lobe (ERL) graft. To assess risk of hepatic venous congestion (HVC) in ERL donors, we tried to newly classify V4 anatomy. We analyzed V4 anatomy of 328 living donor livers by using 3-dimensional reconstruction (3-DR) and volumetry of computed tomography (CT). Variations of V4 were divided into type A (middle hepatic vein [MHV] dominant: n = 142, 43.3%), type B (MHV-dominant, but enabling preservation of dorsal V4 branch [V4b]: n = 40, 12.2%), type C (mixed: n = 92, 28%), and type D (left hepatic vein dominant: n = 54, 16.5%). We analyzed the amount of HVC at S4 in 143 donor livers of right lobe (RL) and ERL grafts. Occlusion of MHV trunk induced HVC equivalent to 85.2%, 85.4%, 55.2%, and 35.4% of S4 volume and 34%, 33.9%, 20.3%, and 14.2% of left liver volume in livers of types A, B, C, and D, respectively. Tailored V4b preservation reduced HVC significantly in type B livers. Considering that functional capability may be decreased in HVC portion, functional hepatic resection rate (FHRR) of ERL graft procurement ranged as follows: 62.3%-75% in type A; 62.2%-75% and 62.2%-68.7% in type B with and without V4b preservation, respectively; 63.2%-70.7% in type C; and 61.8%-67.2% in type D. These results support the theory that these categories of V4 types are closely correlated with potential amount of HVC at S4, reflect the possibility of V4b preservation, and are compatible with CT findings. We believe that this V4 classification is applicable to assess donor V4 anatomy in practice.

### Comparing a virtual reality head-mounted display to on-screen three-dimensional visualization and two-dimensional computed tomography data for training in decision making in hepatic surgery: a randomized controlled study [^04909a0a]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The aim of the presented study was to evaluate and explore the benefit and problems of a VR environment for training of surgical novices for liver surgery. We interpret the results that with the correct way of visualizing the clinical data even surgical novices can determined the correct liver anatomy and thus have the basis to making a decision on the right liver resection. The findings of this study do not serve to validate this tool as a surgical planning tool and cannot be generalised to surgical practitioners. The creation of the three-dimensional images by segmentation of the underlying computed tomography images is still a time-consuming process. Especially creating surgically and radiologically accurate 3D-models remains a process based on the surgical and radiological expertise and needs the validation of these experts.

### Medical liver biopsy: background, indications, procedure and histopathology [^9939ff57]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Histological assessment

In a medical liver biopsy, the normal liver architecture should be maintained unless there are marked morphological changes due to cirrhosis or necrosis. Usually areas of hepatic parenchyma with hepatocytes and sinusoids are seen ('lobular' region), which are interspersed with central venules and portal tracts. Portal tracts usually contain a portal vein, a branch of the hepatic artery and a bile duct.

Three different 'zones' are defined by these structures, although the anatomy is complex: zone 1 is adjacent to the portal tract, zone 3 is closest to the hepatic venule and zone 2 is in between (see figure 1). This arrangement of structures is also called an 'acinus'.

### Procedural standards for deceased donor organ recovery [^ced417bf]. ASTS (2022). High credibility.

Liver — recovered anatomy (vessels) advises that replaced or accessory arterial anatomy should be identified during the recovery, when practical. A replaced or accessory left hepatic artery must be maintained intact with its celiac trunk origin, and a 1-2cm stump of the left gastric artery should be left with the left hepatic artery at the former's division in such cases. A replaced/accessory right hepatic artery must be maintained intact with its SMA trunk, and a patch of aorta supplied with that SMA trunk, and this is negotiable in the setting of a pancreas or small intestinal donor to maximize utilization of all organs.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cholangiocarcinoma [^a92d4b30]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, concomitant resection of the caudate lobe is undertaken due to the high proportion of patients with microscopic infiltration of the caudate lobe. Sufficient resection to achieve R0 resection margins is advocated. Extended right hemi-hepatectomy, inclusive of the inferior section of segment 4 (4B) with hilar bile duct excision at the confluence, has been demonstrated to achieve good R0 resection margins for type 3a disease. The anatomical proximity of the portal vein to the hilar confluence has led to the development of en bloc 'no-touch' techniques including resection of the portal vein as necessary. En bloc resection has been suggested to offer improved survival, but may also be associated with increased perioperative mortality.

Right-sided trisectionectomy is the preferred approach, if feasible, for resecting hilar CCA. Left-sided approaches for hilar pathology are surgically demanding and reserved solely for predominantly left-sided BC 3b tumours. Principally, the difficulty of the approach relates to the extrahepatic course of the respective portal vein. The right portal vein has a short extrahepatic course, which makes reconstruction of the portal vein following left-sided resection difficult. Left-sided resections for BC 3b tumours are also more likely to involve complex hepatic arterial resection and reconstruction. The right hepatic artery is potentially threatened due to its proximity to the left portal vein and its course within the hilum. Consequently, there is a corresponding increase in potential for postoperative liver insufficiency if the right hepatic artery is encountered during a left-sided resection.

Patient position

Fig. 2
Diagrams of trocar placement for LLR of S8. Two 12-mm trocars, two 5-mm trocars and one 10-mm trocar are used. The incision marked with p was made 3 mm in length for insertion of extracorporeal Pringle's maneuver

Intraoperative procedure: (1) Liver mobilization: the round and falciform ligaments were divided to the second hepatic hilum to expose the root of the MHV and right hepatic veins (RHV) and the crypt between MHV and RHV. The right coronary ligament next to the second hepatic hilum was also divided. Resections in s S8 do not usually require a full anti-clockwise rotation of right lobe. After mobilization of the liver, the posterior side of right liver could be well visualized. (2) Preparing for Pringle's maneuver: Extracorporeal laparoscopic Pringle's maneuver was prepared. This method can be quickly used in case of major bleeding and declamped easily and fast. (3) Intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasonography (IOUS): IOUS was performed on the liver surface to localize the tumor range and central position and to determine the courses of main trunk of MHV and RHV, and the position of the S8 Glissonean pedicle (G8) or ventral branch of G8 (G8v) and dorsal branch of G8(G8d) and mark them accordingly. (4) Dissection of the left side transection plane and caudal side transection plane liver parenchyma: hepatic resection is begun from the caudal side of the liver at the intersection of the G8 level which was positioned by ultrasound and the Cantlie line via a hepatic parenchymal transection-first approach. The starting point also can be estimated by reference to simulation images constructed using preoperative 3-dimensional reconstruction. The resection is continued from the caudal to cranial side along the markings of MHV (right of the vein), until the critical separation of S8 from liver segment 4a (S4a) was completed. The left side resection plane should be dissected as straight transection lines as these are easier to follow MHV, especially during deeper dissection, allowing the surgeon to evaluate the relationship between the tumor and the intended resection line. Safely exposed hepatic vein branches were clipped and cut. Then, the hepatic resection was continued from the above-depicted starting point toward the right direction of caudal side transection plane and the caudal side liver transection plane parenchyma was divided 1–2 cm for better visualization. The left side transection plane resection and caudal side transection plane resection continued alternately to expose the root of the MHV. S8 was retracted cephalically during this procedure. The resection was continued until the G8 or G8v and G8d were naturally exposed on the resected liver surface. When performing deeper dissection, care must be taken. According to the intraoperative situation, it is possible to repeatedly adjust the transection plane under guidance of IOUS. To reduce air interference in IOUS, saline can be injected on the transection plane. (5) Management of the G8: The caudal side transection plane was further divided toward the dorsal side of the G8 to obtain a large space around the G8. The G8 is clamped. In most cases, the G8 bifurcates into the ventral half and the dorsal half. G8v and G8d were clamped separately. The liver surface ischemic line is marked along the resulting discoloration using electrocautery. Then, the right side transection plane hepatic parenchyma was initially transected along the ischemic line, followed by ligated and divided of the G8 or G8v and G8d. (6) Management of the ventral branch of the draining vein from S8 (V8v) and intermediate vein for S8 (V8i) branches: When hepatic resection is continued further cranially along the MHV, the S8 branches of the MHV, including the V8v and V8i branches and small ducts, are ligated and divided. Titanium clips, hemolock clips or vascular staplers are used to divide progressively larger biliary and vascular structures. (7) Dissection of the right side transection plane liver parenchyma: To expose the root of the RHV, the transection of the liver parenchyma was continued from the root of the MHV toward right side, in the crypt between MHV and RHV and the RHV direction. Subsequently, the RHV is exposed. Then, liver resection is performed toward the caudal direction along the RHV and ischemic line, and the main trunk of the RHV is exposed. At that point, the surgeon was standing at the left side of the patient and performed the parenchyma transection via a cranial approach. Dorsal branch of the draining vein from S8 (V8d), which drains the dorsal portion of S8, is ligated and divided. After the completion of S8, the following structures are exposed at the resected liver surface: MHV, stump of G8, and RHV. (8) Bagging of the resected specimen: A protective bag was inserted intra-abdominally into which the resected specimen was placed. (9) Management of the resection margin: The surgical field was irrigated. The margin was carefully checked for any bleeding or bile leakage. Hemostasis was achieved by using bipolar electrocoagulation or Prolene sutures ligation. Any bile leakage from the suspicious bile ducts was ligated using 5–0 Prolene sutures. Hemostatic products such as fibrillar hemostatic or fibrin glue were used. (10) Specimen removal: After the specimen was resected, the incision for extracorporeal Pringle's maneuver was extended to the incision for the left subsidiary port for removal of the specimen. (11) Drainage and wound closed: After a silastic drain placed under the right diaphragm, the wound was closed in layers with absorbable sutures (Fig. 3 a–i).

### Donor morbidity is equivalent between right and left hepatectomy for living liver donation: a meta-analysis [^4e442a55]. Liver Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Maximizing liver graft volume benefits the living donor liver recipient. Whether maximizing graft volume negatively impacts living donor recovery and outcomes remains controversial. Patient randomization between right and left hepatectomy has not been possible due to anatomic constraints; however, a number of published, nonrandomized observational studies summarize donor outcomes between 2 anatomic living donor hepatectomies. This meta-analysis compares donor-specific outcomes after right versus left living donor hepatectomy. Systematic searches were performed via PubMed, Cochrane, ResearchGate, and Google Scholar databases to identify relevant studies between January 2005 and November 2019. The primary outcomes compared overall morbidity and incidence of severe complications (Clavien-Dindo > III) between right and left hepatectomy in donors after liver donation. Random effects meta-analysis was performed to derive summary risk estimates of outcomes. A total of 33 studies (3 prospective and 30 retrospective cohort) were used to identify 7649 pooled patients (5993 right hepatectomy and 1027 left hepatectomy). Proportion of donors who developed postoperative complications did not significantly differ after right hepatectomy (0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27–0.40) and left hepatectomy (0.23; 95% CI, 0.17–0.29; P = 0.19). The overall risk ratio (RR) did not differ between right and left hepatectomy (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.83–1.63; P = 0.36). The relative risk for a donor to develop severe complications showed no differences by hepatectomy side (Incidence rate ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.67–1.40; P = 0.86). There is no evidence that the overall morbidity differs between right and left lobe donors. Publication bias reflects institutional and surgeon variation. A prospective, standardized, multi-institutional study would help quantify the burden of donor complications after liver donation.

### Effects of microperfusion in hepatic diffusion weighted imaging [^220e346f]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The increase in the ADC in the left lobe, which was demonstrated in Fig. 2, is usually explained from the increased cardiac motion in the left lobe. However, we found that the fraction of microperfusion f fast in the left lobe was almost a factor two higher than in other liver locations. Although pseudo-anisotropy is a known artefact of respiratory triggering in the liver, we suspect that the increased ADC in the left lobe may be caused by extensive microperfusion contamination of the ADC and to a lesser extent by either cardiac or respiratory artefacts. This is supported by a study on the hepatic perfusion of eight hepatic segments by dual-source computed tomography. They found that the hepatic perfusion index (HPI) was significantly higher in segment 3 (left lobe) than in segments 5 to 8 (right lobe), and suggested that this might be related to the anatomy of the liver vessels. Another study using pharmacokinetic analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI demonstrated that regional variations in liver microcirculation can be displayed by colour-coded parameter maps. They found a minor variation of perfusion in an apical section of a transplanted liver. The left part of the liver, corresponding to segment 2, showed a different perfusion rate than the right part of the liver. In an experimental study on rats using perfusion CT, the relative blood flow in the left lobe was 17% higher than in the right lobe of the liver. We suspect that these regional variations in the density of small blood vessels and capillaries caused the heterogeneous appearance of microperfusion throughout the liver. This is supported by our analysis of including a blood vessel in the ROI, which resulted in more microperfusion contamination than when blood vessels were avoided.

### Arterial blood supply of liver segment IV and its possible surgical consequences [^951e727b]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

According to our findings, parts of segment IV are supplied arterially by the RHA and other parts by the LHA. It follows that the parts of segment IV supplied by the LHA will not receive any blood after the first step of the ALPPS procedure. This could explain the high incidence of necrosis and biliary leakage after these operations.

Considering our results regarding the arterial blood supply to segment IV, the division should theoretically be performed from the left side of the IVC at the cephalad point and lateral to the falciform ligament to the medial point of the gallbladder bed to avoid ischemia, necrosis, or cholangiopathy in segment IV.

Taken together and in contrast to the portal venous blood supply, we describe here the arterial blood supply of segment IV, arising from the right and left hepatic artery with a demarcation line between the areas supplied by the RHA and the LHA, that runs from the left side of the IVC at the top and lateral to the falciform ligament to the medial point of the gallbladder. The anatomical findings may be useful in defining the resection line in the split‐liver resection or trisegment transplantation and ALPPS procedure. To avoid ischemia, necrosis, or cholangiopathy in segment IV, the division of the hepatic parenchyma should be based on the anatomy of the arterial blood supply and the intrahepatic blood distribution to segment IV. In view of the intrahepatic blood distribution to segment IV, we recommend that the described line be used as the resection line.

### Liver segmentation: indications, techniques and future directions [^e65a3b70]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Liver volumetry has emerged as an important tool in clinical practice. Liver volume is assessed primarily via organ segmentation of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. The goal of this paper is to provide an accessible overview of liver segmentation targeted at radiologists and other healthcare professionals.

Methods

Using images from CT and MRI, this paper reviews the indications for liver segmentation, technical approaches used in segmentation software and the developing roles of liver segmentation in clinical practice.

Results

Liver segmentation for volumetric assessment is indicated prior to major hepatectomy, portal vein embolisation, associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) and transplant. Segmentation software can be categorised according to amount of user input involved: manual, semi-automated and fully automated. Manual segmentation is considered the "gold standard" in clinical practice and research, but is tedious and time-consuming. Increasingly automated segmentation approaches are more robust, but may suffer from certain segmentation pitfalls. Emerging applications of segmentation include surgical planning and integration with MRI-based biomarkers.

Conclusions

Liver segmentation has multiple clinical applications and is expanding in scope. Clinicians can employ semi-automated or fully automated segmentation options to more efficiently integrate volumetry into clinical practice.

Teaching points

- Liver volume is assessed via organ segmentation on CT and MRI examinations.

- Liver segmentation is used for volume assessment prior to major hepatic procedures.

- Segmentation approaches may be categorised according to the amount of user input involved.

- Emerging applications include surgical planning and integration with MRI-based biomarkers.

### Abdominal vascular trauma [^ad510680]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

During the right medial visceral rotation, the white line of Toldt is divided lateral to the ascending colon from the base of the cecum and continued up to the hepatic flexure, and the mesentery of the right colon and small bowel is dissected off the retroperitoneum to its root. The duodenum is Kocherized by incising its lateral peritoneal attachments and is then mobilized until the head of the pancreas is exposed to the uncinate process and its posterior aspect visualized. The cecum and small bowel are swept out of the pelvis and toward the patient's left upper quadrant. A complete right medial visceral rotation exposes the IVC from the inferior border of the liver (suprarenal portion) to its bifurcation (figure 2).

Figure 2
Exposure of the infrarenal, juxta-renal, and suprarenal IVC following right-sided medial visceral rotation. The exposure of the suprarenal IVC is obtained by displacing the inferior edge of the right lobe of the liver superiorly and after performing an extended Kocher maneuver. IVC, inferior vena cava.

### Imaging evaluation of living liver donor candidates: techniques, protocols, and anatomy [^89425da7]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

The need for liver transplants is increasing because the prevalence of liver diseases and the indications for transplants are growing. In response to the shortage of grafts from deceased donors, more transplants are being performed worldwide with grafts from living donors. Radiologic evaluation is an integral component in the assessment of donor candidates to ensure their eligibility and to choose the most appropriate surgical approach. MRI is the preferred modality for evaluation of the liver parenchyma and biliary tree. In most centers, a combination of MRI and CT is used to take advantage of the higher spatial resolution of CT for evaluation of arteries. However, MRI-only assessment is feasible. In addition to assessment of the liver parenchyma for abnormalities such as steatosis, a detailed evaluation of the hepatic vascular and biliary system for pertinent anatomic variants is crucial, because these variants can affect surgical techniques and outcomes in both recipients and donors. In this pictorial article, after a brief review of the most common surgical techniques and postsurgical liver anatomy, the biliary and vascular anatomy are discussed, with specific attention paid to the variants that are pertinent to this surgical procedure. The roles of liver segmentation and volumetric assessment and current imaging techniques and protocols are also discussed. Online supplemental material is available for this article. © RSNA, 2021.

### Use of the resection map system as guidance during hepatectomy [^8ad08a60]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Intraoperative assistance by the Resection Map

Surgeons performed hepatectomies following their usual standards and guidelines. The Resection Map was displayed for them on a monitor as an additional source of orientation and guidance. Surgeons read the information of the Resection Map and interactively changed its visualization through voice commands to their assistants, who controlled the tool with a computer mouse interface. The interaction possibilities and contents of the Resection Map were adapted to the different phases of the surgical procedure as described below.

The Resection Map first shows an external view of the virtual liver, which is used to review the case. Surgeons can rotate this view, and activate or deactivate its elements (resection plane, tumours, liver parenchyma, or veins; Fig. 3). This view also helps the surgeon with orientation and drawing of the cauterization line over the liver's surface.

Fig. 3
External view of the Resection Map, showing two cases: A case 2: anatomical resection of left lobe, and B case 4: top view of a partial resection of segment II. Note the amount of liver preserved in this case, comparing this resection with an anatomical left lobe option. The other two tumours were locally resected (tumour located in segment IV) and ablated (tumour in segment VI). Parenchyma surface is removed for clarity: only vessels (blue for the hepatic and orange for the portal), resection plane (yellow) and tumours (green) are visible. (Color figure online)

Once resection starts, the Resection Map can be changed to show an internal view of the virtual liver. This view, divided into a surgical view and a progress view, offers interactive selection and visualization of a volume in the proximity of the resection plane, depending on the resection stage. In the surgical view, structures in the neighbourhood of the resection plane are gradually shown or hidden in the direction of resection progress, as indicated by simple commands of "forward" or "backward". The 3D orientation of the virtual liver in this view is defined by the surgeon to match the orientation of the real liver and thus help the reading of the Resection Map.
