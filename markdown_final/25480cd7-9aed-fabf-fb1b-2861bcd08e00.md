## Question

Significance of hepatoportal venous shunt/venous malformation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of hepatoportal venous shunts and venous malformations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and classification to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why these shunts matter clinically. Next, I will examine the clinical spectrum and complications, followed by diagnostic strategies and imaging pitfalls. After that, I need to appraise management principles, including when to observe, embolize, or transplant. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize prognostic implications with a practical takeaway, making sure I double-check key claims against guidelines and cohort data throughout.

> Let me first confirm the terminology and classification so I don't conflate entities. Hepatoportal venous shunts are abnormal communications between the portal venous system and either systemic veins (portosystemic shunts) or the hepatic artery (arterioportal shunts), and they can be congenital or acquired; congenital forms include intrahepatic and extrahepatic portosystemic shunts, with extrahepatic shunts often termed Abernethy malformations, while arterioportal shunts reflect direct hepatic artery to portal vein connections that can drive portal hypertension and hepatofugal flow [^782af88e] [^4be49701] [^877997b8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without verifying the hemodynamic consequences. Portosystemic shunts bypass hepatic sinusoids, reducing portal perfusion and impairing hepatocyte metabolic functions, while arterioportal shunts arterialize the portal system, increasing portal pressure and promoting hepatofugal flow; both patterns can culminate in portal hypertension, encephalopathy, and cardiopulmonary complications depending on magnitude and chronicity [^782af88e] [^73378018] [^0f81d9d3].

> I will now examine the clinical significance across the lifespan, but wait, let me verify the neonatal versus adult patterns. In fetuses and neonates, congenital portosystemic shunts can present with fetal growth restriction, hydrops, neonatal cholestasis, and hyperammonemia, and some intrahepatic shunts close spontaneously, whereas in older children and adults, complications include hepatic encephalopathy, hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hypertension, and liver tumors such as adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma, with risk correlating to shunt fraction and portal venous development [^8832043f] [^7c3dbace] [^e7fe522d] [^deb9910b].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and make sure I don't overstate any single modality. Doppler ultrasound is the first-line tool to detect shunts and characterize flow direction, but cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI is often required to define anatomy, classify the shunt, and screen for liver nodules; in complex or equivocal cases, invasive angiography with balloon occlusion can assess portal pressures and feasibility of closure, and I need to remember that hepatofugal flow can be a pitfall at angiography if misinterpreted as portal vein occlusion [^97ddef60] [^4be49701] [^73378018].

> Let me think about management principles and double-check thresholds. Asymptomatic intrahepatic shunts may be observed in infancy because spontaneous closure is not rare, but symptomatic shunts or those with high shunt fraction generally warrant closure; endovascular embolization is preferred when feasible, whereas type 1 Abernethy malformations with absent intrahepatic portal veins often require liver transplantation, and in children with hypoplastic portal veins, staged or partial closure can promote portal venous remodeling and reduce complications; I should confirm that contemporary guidance emphasizes endovascular therapy over transplant in most children, reserving transplant for select cases [^f015407d] [^d3abf988] [^e7fe522d] [^5fe0fe8d].

> But wait, what if the shunt is an arterioportal fistula rather than a portosystemic venous shunt; I need to ensure I distinguish these because management differs. Congenital arterioportal fistulas can cause severe portal hypertension and high-output cardiac failure, and recurrence after embolization is common due to collateralization, so definitive strategies may require surgical ligation or even transplantation in refractory cases, and pre-procedural planning must anticipate arterialized portal veins that complicate anastomoses [^877997b8] [^d7e5e3ac].

> I should confirm special populations and associations so I don't miss syndromic clues. Abernethy malformations are associated with other congenital anomalies, including cardiac, skeletal, and genitourinary defects, and have been reported with RASopathies such as Noonan syndrome; hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia frequently features hepatic vascular malformations with arteriovenous and arterioportal shunting that can lead to high-output heart failure, portal hypertension, and encephalopathy, so screening and longitudinal surveillance are essential in these settings [^f424295e] [^0f81d9d3] [^4ca8347e].

> Let me reconsider prognostic implications and make sure I cite the right data. Patients without visualization of a portal vein on imaging have significantly higher rates of complications and may benefit from earlier intervention even if asymptomatic, whereas those with preserved portal venous anatomy generally fare better; long-term, persistent portosystemic shunting increases risks of encephalopathy, pulmonary vascular disease, and hepatic neoplasia, reinforcing the rationale for timely closure when indicated [^deb9910b] [^e7fe522d].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is precise: hepatoportal venous shunts and venous malformations are not merely incidental radiologic curiosities; they disrupt normal hepatic perfusion and can cause progressive liver dysfunction, cardiopulmonary complications, and neoplasia, so accurate classification, vigilant surveillance, and selective closure are key to altering natural history, with endovascular therapy now the cornerstone for most congenital portosystemic shunts and liver transplantation reserved for anatomically unfavorable cases or those with advanced complications [^d3abf988] [^e7fe522d] [^5b1dc2e2].

Hepatoportal venous shunts and venous malformations are **congenital or acquired anomalies** that bypass portal venous flow around the liver, causing portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatopulmonary syndrome, and liver tumors [^e7fe522d] [^0f81d9d3]. They are classified as intrahepatic or extrahepatic (Abernethy malformation) [^4be49701], with extrahepatic shunts carrying a higher risk of complications and often requiring liver transplantation [^d3abf988]. Diagnosis relies on Doppler ultrasound, CT/MRI, and angiography [^97ddef60]; management is individualized, with endovascular closure for intrahepatic shunts and transplantation for extrahepatic or complex cases [^d3abf988] [^e7fe522d]. Early recognition and treatment are essential to prevent irreversible liver injury and systemic complications [^deb9910b].

---

## Classification and anatomical types

Hepatoportal venous shunts are broadly classified into **two main categories**:

| **Type** | **Description** | **Subtypes** |
|-|-|-|
| Intrahepatic shunts | Abnormal connections within the liver between portal vein branches and hepatic veins or IVC [^782af88e] | - Type 1: Single large vessel from right PV to IVC <br/> - Type 2: Peripheral PV-HV connections in one segment <br/> - Type 3: Aneurysmal PV-HV connection <br/> - Type 4: Multiple bilateral PV-HV connections [^4b6abba3] |
| Extrahepatic shunts (Abernethy malformation) | Portal blood bypasses the liver via congenital connections to systemic veins [^4be49701] | - Type I: Complete absence of intrahepatic PV with total shunting <br/> - Type II: Partial PV perfusion with partial shunting [^d3abf988] |

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

These shunts **bypass portal blood around the liver**, reducing hepatic perfusion and impairing detoxification, protein synthesis, and metabolic functions. Key consequences include:

- **Portal hypertension**: Increased pressure from shunted flow and reduced portal perfusion [^73378018].
- **Hepatic encephalopathy**: Unmetabolized ammonia and toxins enter systemic circulation [^54f0e074].
- **Hepatopulmonary syndrome**: Intrapulmonary vasodilation and shunting cause hypoxemia [^0b1ed25a].
- **Liver tumors**: Chronic hypoperfusion and regenerative changes predispose to adenomas and HCC [^e7fe522d].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Clinical presentation varies with shunt size, type, and age; **many patients are asymptomatic** and diagnosed incidentally, whereas others develop severe complications:

- **Neurological**: Hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, developmental delay [^e7fe522d].
- **Cardiopulmonary**: Dyspnea, cyanosis, clubbing, pulmonary hypertension [^2156bf31].
- **Gastrointestinal**: Variceal bleeding, splenomegaly, abdominal pain [^beeaf988].
- **Hepatic**: Cholestasis, liver dysfunction, nodular hyperplasia, adenomas, HCC [^e7fe522d].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and classification are essential for management; **multimodality imaging is standard**:

- **Doppler ultrasound**: First-line for shunt detection, flow direction, and portal vein assessment [^40949ea1].
- **CT/MRI**: Define anatomy, shunt size, liver parenchyma, and nodules; MR angiography is noninvasive and detailed [^97ddef60].
- **Angiography**: Gold standard for complex anatomy and pre-intervention planning [^notfound].
- **Laboratory tests**: Ammonia, liver function, coagulation profile, and tumor markers (AFP) [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **individualized** based on shunt type, symptoms, and complications:

- **Observation**: Small, asymptomatic intrahepatic shunts may close spontaneously, especially in infants [^f015407d].
- **Endovascular closure**: Preferred for intrahepatic shunts; coils, plugs, or devices restore portal flow and improve liver function [^53d8697a].
- **Surgical ligation**: For extrahepatic or complex shunts when endovascular therapy is not feasible [^09b4ee13].
- **Liver transplantation**: Indicated for type I Abernethy, severe liver dysfunction, or unresectable tumors [^d3abf988].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Hepatology, interventional radiology, surgery, and pediatrics coordinate care [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on shunt type, size, and treatment. Untreated shunts can cause **irreversible liver injury**, encephalopathy, and fatal cardiopulmonary complications [^e7fe522d]. Early closure improves liver function and reverses some complications, though pulmonary hypertension and tumors may persist [^deb9910b].

---

Hepatoportal venous shunts and venous malformations are **rare but significant** vascular anomalies that bypass portal flow around the liver, causing portal hypertension, encephalopathy, hepatopulmonary syndrome, and liver tumors. Early diagnosis with imaging and tailored therapy — endovascular closure or transplantation — are critical to prevent irreversible liver injury and systemic complications [^e7fe522d].

### Ultrasound with Doppler evaluation of congenital hepatic vascular shunts [^a5bd59c1]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Congenital aberrant hepatic vascular communications result from intrahepatic or extrahepatic errors in vascular development or involution during the transition from fetal to newborn hepatic circulation. These hepatic vascular shunts can be fortuitously discovered and asymptomatic, or can cause symptoms of varying severity, often presenting diagnostic dilemmas. Some hepatic vascular shunts resolve spontaneously while others require interventional radiologic or surgical closure. Affected patients are often first studied with real-time and Doppler ultrasound, so radiologists should familiarize themselves with the expected ultrasound findings of these vascular shunts for effective diagnosis, triage and management. In this review, the authors focus on ultrasound and Doppler findings of hepatic vascular shunts with underlying embryology, clinical features and management strategies. Broadly, these aberrant hepatic vascular communications include portosystemic venous shunts (which can be intra- or extrahepatic and include persistent patent ductus venosus), arterioportal, arteriovenous or mixed shunts.

### Venous shunts in portal hypertension… [^e1047885]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE USE of shunts between the portal venous system and the vena cava or its branches has become a well-established method of combating the complications of portal hypertension. 1 The impetus of a reasonable surgical treatment has resulted in an improved understanding of the modes of production of portal hypertension. The frequent disproportion between the level of the portal pressure in intrahepatic disease and the degree of hepatic damage has been studied by Kelty and others. 2 These workers find that the regeneration of liver cells which improves hepatocellular function adds to the interference with portal blood flow. In cases of extrahepatic portal obstruction, the causes are narrowing down to those of congenital nature and those resulting from inflammation and thrombosis of the portal vein with subsequent organization along various lines. This organization may take the form of a single, extremely thick-walled vessel with small lumen, met with in one JULIAN OC, DYE WS.

Congenital portal venous shunts

Portal venous shunts are abnormal communications between portal and systemic venous systems (portosystemic shunts), or between the PVS and the hepatic artery (arterioportal shunts). They can be congenital or acquired and occur within or outside the liver. In this section, we will discuss the congenital ones.

Portosystemic shunts are diversions of portal venous blood into the systemic venous system bypassing the liver. Patients may be asymptomatic, but high-flow shunts are prone to develop hepatic encephalopathy, hepatopulmonary syndrome, and portopulmonary syndrome. Depending on the case, these shunts are managed conservatively, with trans-catheter embolization, or surgery.

Congenital intrahepatic portosystemic shunts are uncommon and their pathogenesis remains unclear. Interestingly, they are more frequent in the right hepatic lobe (Fig. 6). Four types are classically described, as proposed by Park et al. in 1990 (Table 1). Intrahepatic portosystemic shunts may also be acquired, resulting from trauma (may be iatrogenic) and portal hypertension (PH), as described later.

Table 1
Classification of congenital intrahepatic portosystemic shunts based on Park et al.

Congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunts are rare and represent a group of malformations with high morphological variability, with resultant differences in clinical presentation and optimal operative approach. In 1793, John Abernethy first described a case of a congenital absence of the PV with a portocaval shunt responsible for the portal venous blood diversion. Since 1997, Abernethy malformations became an accepted eponymous to congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunts, and can be subdivided into two major categories: total shunting with complete absence of intrahepatic portal venous flow — type I; and partial shunting with some preserved hepatic portal venous flow — type II. Nowadays, it is increasingly recognized that there is more a continuum than an absolute distinction between type I and type II. A more comprehensive classification may also benefit comparative analyses from different institutions (Table 2). In both types, most patients suffer premature mortality, associated with the shunting complications and other congenital abnormalities inherent to the syndrome (Figs. 7 and 8).

The increased use of high-contrast volume, arterial-phase studies of the liver has demonstrated the frequent occurrence of arterioportal shunts within both the cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic liver. This article sets out to explain the underlying microcirculatory mechanisms behind these commonly encountered altered perfusion states. Similarly, well-recognised portal perfusion defects occur around the perifalciform and perihilar liver and are largely caused by anomalous venous drainage via the paraumbilical and parabiliary venous systems. The underlying anatomy will be discussed and illustrated. These vascular anomalies are all caused by or result in diminished portal perfusion and are often manifest in the setting of portal venous thrombosis. The evolving concept of zonal re-perfusion following portal vein thrombosis will be discussed.

Background

Intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (IHPSS), characterised by abnormal connections between the intrahepatic portal vein branches and the hepatic vein, is a rare vascular malformation. Most previous studies of congenital portosystemic shunts have focused on children and adults. However, these studies have limited clinical relevance for foetal IHPSS due to the foetus's unique anatomical and circulatory characteristics.

With the development of prenatal ultrasonography, some articles have also reported IHPSS in the foetus; however, little is known about its intrauterine characteristics and prognosis. This study aimed to review our experience in diagnosing IHPSS during the foetal period, analyse their clinical features and prognosis, and provide assistance for perinatal management and prenatal counselling.

Congenital hepatoportal arteriovenous fistula

Congenital hepatoportal arteriovenous fistula (CHPAVF) is a kind of vascular malformation, of which the pathogenesis is the shunt between the hepatic artery and the portal venous system, leading a large amount of arterial blood drain into the PV, with the result of a rare cause of pediatric pre-sinusoidal portal hypertension and its complications. Prenatal ultrasound with Doppler might show single or multiple direct communications between the hepatic artery and the portal vein branches. Additional findings include hepatic artery enlargement, portal vein dilatation at the site of fistula, and abdominal aorta tapering beyond the celiac artery. The main clinical symptoms of CHPAVF are shortness of breath, malaise, poor appetite and watery diarrhea. CHPAVF can lead to high out-put heart failure with a mortality rate of 50–90%. The prenatal diagnosis of CHPAVF enables better planning of postpartum management. Surgical resection, hepatic artery embolization and hepatic artery ligation have all been said to be important tools in the management of this condition.

Isolated absence or atresia of ductus venosus

The DV plays an important role in fetal circulation because of diverting oxygenated blood from the placenta toward the right atrium and through the foramen ovale to the left heart and supporting the brain. When the DV is absent or atretic, the UV completely drains into the portal sinus connecting with the intrahepatic portal venous system. Ultrasound picture demonstrates that the DV is absent or presents as a thin band connecting the LPV and the IVC (Fig. 18) and that CDFI examination could not demonstrate the blood flow signal. There is the research suggested that the isolated absence or atresia of DV had good prognosis in 67.2% cases and died in perinatal period as a result of fetal edema in 15.6% cases. However, the experts considered that this result might be exaggerated. Prenatal ultrasonography detects the isolated absence or atresia of the DV, close surveillance of fetal hemodynamic changes is recommended. If the signs of fetal heart enlargement and fetal edema are detected, delivery must be performed as soon as possible.

### Congenital portosystemic shunts: current diagnosis and management [^5b1dc2e2]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Congenital portosystemic shunts are increasingly recognized in several settings and at any age. The following are some of the most common presentations: prenatal ultrasound, neonatal cholestasis, incidental finding on abdominal imaging, or systemic complications such as unexplained cardiopulmonary or neurological disease, or the presence of liver nodules in a noncirrhotic liver. The purpose of the present review is to summarize clinical presentation and current recommendations for management, and highlight areas of future research. Illustrative examples from the veterinary literature complement our current lack of knowledge of this rare malformation often masquerading as a multisystem disease.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu disease, is a rare autosomal dominant trait affecting approximately 1 in 5000 people. It is a multi-organ vascular dysplasia characterized by multiple arteriovenous malformations that lack an intervening capillary network. Liver involvement is characterized by hepatic telangiectasia and usually arteriovenous and less commonly arterioportal, shunts. Arterial phase contrast-enhanced CT typically shows major signs of hepatic arterialization, such as enlarged hepatic arteries, small hyperdense foci representing shunts, and early enhancement of hepatic and/or portal veins (Fig. 10). We can also see portal and hepatic venous dilatation, hepatomegaly, and lobulated hepatic contour. Doppler ultrasound may raise the suspicion of an arterioportal shunt when increased systolic velocity and decreased resistance index of hepatic artery are present, increased velocity of the PV flow, and PV wave inversion demonstrating hepatofugal blood flow.

Extrahepatic portosystemic shunts as an acquired pathology are the most common portal venous shunts, discussed here later.

Arterioportal shunts may be either congenital (presenting as a fistula or as vascular malformations in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) or more frequently acquired, as discussed here later.

Congenital arterioportal fistulas are rare and generally solitary connections between hepatic arteries and portal veins (Fig. 9), in contrast to other arteriovenous malformations, which usually have a complex plexiform vascular nidus. As the arterial flow enters the PVS, it follows the lowest gradient pressure, filling retrogradely the PV. High-flow shunts may generate a continuous hepatofugal flow, progressing in time to PH.

### Hepatofugal flow in the portal venous system: pathophysiology, imaging findings, and diagnostic pitfalls [^73378018]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

Hepatofugal flow (ie, flow directed away from the liver) is abnormal in any segment of the portal venous system and is more common than previously believed. Hepatofugal flow can be demonstrated at angiography, Doppler ultrasonography (US), magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography (CT). The current understanding of hepatofugal flow recognizes the role of the hepatic artery and the complementary phenomena of arterioportal and portosystemic venovenous shunting. Detection of hepatofugal flow is clinically important for diagnosis of portal hypertension, for determination of portosystemic shunt patency and overall prognosis in patients with cirrhosis, as a potential pitfall at invasive arteriography performed to evaluate the patency of the portal vein, and as a contraindication to specialized imaging procedures (ie, transarterial hepatic chemoembolization and CT during arterial portography). Hepatofugal flow is generally diagnosed at Doppler US without much difficulty, but radiologists should beware of pitfalls that can impede correct determination of flow direction in the portal venous system.

### Liver involvement in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia or Rendu-Osler-Weber disease [^baf31029]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetic disease characterised by the presence of teleangiectases virtually involving every organ. Hepatic involvement is represented by a spectrum of vascular abnormalities, which evolve in a continuum from tiny teleangiectases to substantial vascular malformations, potentially with a progressively greater arteriovenous shunt. Liver involvement in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia is almost always asymptomatic; on the other hand, hepatic vascular malformations can induce severe complications, depending on the predominant venous side of the arteriovenous fistulas-high-output cardiac failure in the case of hepatohepatic fistulas, and portal hypertension in the case of hepatoportal fistulas. Doppler sonography can detect and stage hepatic vascular malformations in subjects with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia; according to Doppler sonographic grading, appropriate advice for follow-up and/or therapy can be given.

Conclusion

As previously mentioned in the literature, UPSVS are rare anomalies. The clinical utility of routine screening for UPSVS remains a subject of debate. Studies involving a larger number of patients will allow for a better understanding of the frequency and prognosis of isolated cases and provide more information and guidance in this regard.

### A new classification of congenital abnormalities of UPVS: sonographic appearances, screening strategy and clinical significance [^35c0201c]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Previous classifications of congenital abnormalities of UPVS

Several classifications of congenital abnormalities of UPVS have been proposed from different perspectives. Morgan et al. proposed the classification of portosystemic anomalies into two types based on whether or not the hepatic parenchyma is perfused with blood from the mesenteric venous system. Moore et al. divided the abnormalities of the UV within the fetal abdominal which may be detected with prenatal sonography into three groups. In 2016, Achiron et al. proposed the in utero classification which was based on the embryological–anatomical origin of the shunt, regarding the fetal venous system as a whole. This classification is the most comprehensive classification about fetal umbilical–portal–systemic venous shunt. However, it still cannot meet the clinical needs.

New classification of congenital abnormalities of UPVS

In terms of identifying subtle anatomical or morphological anomalies, postnatal imaging examination (especially angiography) is better than prenatal ultrasonography in recognizing developmental abnormalities of UPVS. For ultrasonographists, mastering various congenital abnormalities of UPVS is of great importance for proper prenatal consultation and postnatal management. After analyzing numerous of prenatal ultrasonic imaging and literature, we proposed a relatively comprehensive classification of developmental abnormalities of UPVS. The new classification could identify three types: Type I, anatomy and morphological abnormalities of the PV; Type II, anatomy and morphological abnormalities of the UV; Type III, vascular connection abnormalities. Based on different prenatal sonographic manifestations, prognosis and perinatal management, all subtypes were classified into four prenatal diagnostic grading: necessary, amenable, difficult and unnecessary. The prenatal ultrasonographic manifestations, prenatal diagnostic grading, clinical findings and prognosis and perinatal management of each subtype were described in detail (Table 1).

The EHPSS is characterized by the diversion of the portal blood into the vena cava, with complete or partial absence of IHPVS (Fig. 14). The case with EHPSS can involve multiple structural malformation, especially those with the complete absence of IHPVS. The prognosis of EHPSS depends on the size of shunt volume, the present of associated malformations, and the development of hemodynamic imbalance with signs of heart failure, cardiomegaly and hydrops. Hemodynamic changes should be closely monitored in utero, and the fetus should be delivered as soon as possible with the sign of heart failure. Intrahepatic portal venous perfusion insufficiency can lead to abnormal liver development, abnormal liver function and abnormal hyperplasia. The risk of liver malignant tumor in such patients is high. Other complications included neonatal cholestasis, hepatopulmonary syndrome, encephalopathy, and pulmonary hypertension might be consequences of the EHPSS. Surgical management can help patients relieving symptoms and preventing complications, including surgical closure, interventional embolization and liver transplantation.

### A novel treatment of congenital hepatoportal arteriovenous fistula [^d7e5e3ac]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Congenital hepatoportal arteriovenous fistula is a rare cause of portal hypertension in young children. Unlike the acquired form, which is usually isolated and can be cured by hepatic artery (HA) embolization, recurrence of portal hypertension often occurs with congenital hepatoportal arteriovenous fistula after embolization and/or HA ligation because of early, rapid collateralization and the presence of multiple arterioportal fistula. Although long-term outcome after embolization is not known, liver transplantation has been proposed as the only option for this condition. However, portal vein and hepatic arterial anastomoses are made difficult because of the presence of portal vein arterialization and previous HA ligation, with a significantly increased risk of vascular complications. We report a case where resolution of portal hypertension has been achieved by an end-to-side portocaval shunt, to preserve the portal vein and HA for future liver transplantation, should it be required.

### Imaging assessment of congenital and acquired abnormalities of the portal venous system [^97ddef60]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Abnormalities of the portal venous system are a heterogeneous group of conditions that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality and may lead to complications during surgery or percutaneous interventions involving the portal venous system. High-resolution computed tomography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging permit a comprehensive, noninvasive evaluation of the portal venous system, enabling the detection of both structural and functional abnormalities. However, an understanding of the embryologic development of the normal portal venous anatomy and anatomic variants is essential to accurately interpret the imaging findings. Knowledge of the characteristic appearances of abnormalities of the portal venous system allows a more confident diagnosis, permitting timely treatment and more informed guidance of surgical procedures and percutaneous interventions, which may lead to an improved outcome.

### Clinical and radiologic manifestations of congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunts: a comprehensive review [^4be49701]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

Congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (CEPS) is a rare condition in which the portomesenteric blood drains into a systemic vein, bypassing the liver through a complete or partial shunt. Most often, the diagnosis is made primarily with Doppler ultrasonography. Computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography are used for further classification of the shunt and assessment of accompanying anomalies. Conventional angiography is necessary when results of the other tests disagree or are inconclusive. CEPS is classified into two types according to the pattern of anastomoses between the portal vein and systemic vein. In type 1, intrahepatic portal venous supply is absent; in type 2, intrahepatic portal venous supply is preserved. Type 1 usually occurs in girls with associated malformations, such as situs ambiguous with polysplenia and congenital heart defects. Associated anomalies are less frequent in type 2, and symptoms usually develop later without a gender preference. Hepatic encephalopathy and liver dysfunction are possible complications of both types and usually develop during adulthood. Both types are also associated with regenerative hepatic nodules. The clinical setting and imaging appearance of these nodules can help one avoid misdiagnosis. Definitive treatment of CEPS is determined by the type of shunt. Liver transplantation is the only effective treatment for symptomatic type 1 CEPS; surgical closure or embolization of the shunt is the therapeutic approach for type 2.

### Liver involvement in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) [^9dafda11]. Journal of Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Liver involvement in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) consists of extensive intrahepatic vascular malformations associated with blood shunting (arteriovenous, arterioportal and/or portovenous). It is a rare disorder that nevertheless can result in significant systemic and hepatobiliary abnormalities. Although hepatic vascular malformations are present in a majority of patients with HHT, symptoms occur in a only a minority with a clear predominance for the female gender. Symptoms from liver vascular malformations are often misdiagnosed and this can lead to potentially harmful interventions. In this review article, clinical findings of liver involvement in HHT and their pathophysiology are discussed as well as diagnostic methodologies, therapies used and their outcome. Data presented is based on a review of the literature performed in October 2006 using the following MEDLINE search terms: (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [ALL] OR Rendu-Osler-Weber [ALL]) AND (liver OR hepatic [ALL]). Papers were considered if they were published in English and if they included specific cases that were sufficiently described.

### Imaging findings in incidental intrahepatic portal venous shunts [^dd19aca8]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to describe the imaging findings in incidentally discovered intrahepatic portal venous shunts.

Conclusion

Intrahepatic portal venous shunts are uncommon hepatic vascular anomalies that are often not associated with manifestations of liver disease or symptoms. They are most often solitary and in the left hepatic lobe. Identification of 25 intrahepatic portal venous shunts at a single institution over 6 years suggests that they may be more common than previously known and that with an increasing use of imaging, they may be identified more often in the future.

Umbilical–systemic shunts

In the case of umbilical–systemic shunts (USS), the UV failed to form the normal intrahepatic connection with the LPV–DV, due to agenesis of both the LPV and the DV, and directly connected to the systemic circulation, such as the right atrium, the IVC, the renal vein or the iliac vein (Fig. 15). USS is often associated with deficiency of the DV and dysplasia of portal venous system. The risk of chromosome abnormality and other structure malformations in such case is high. Previous studies showed that the USS was characterized by the highest incidence of the complete absence of normal IHPVS and the highest incidence of associated major anomalies. The fetuses with USS have the poorest prognosis, and the lowest rates of live birth and postnatal survival are observed.

Fig. 15
Schematic drawing of the USS. The UV directly connects to the right atrium (a), the intra-thoracic IVC (b), the abdominal IVC (c), the AWV (d), and the CIV (e)

Ductus venosus-systemic shunts

Ductus venosus-systemic shunts (DVSS) is referred as the slightly abnormal connection of the DV, which is shunted from its normal path to the hepatic fragment of the IVC, the abdominal IVC, the hepatic vein or the coronary sinus, with an intact the umbilical–portal-DV complex structure (Figs. 16, 17). This type is characterized by the presence of a normal IHPVS, in which the DVSS could differ from the USS. Therefore, some experts believe that the DVSS is a variation of normal anatomy. It has been reported that the fetuses with the DVSS are associated with a high incidence of chromosomal malformation and a low risk of other structural malformations. Genetic examination should be recommended for fetuses with DVSS detection to exclude chromosomal abnormalities. Fetuses with isolated DVSS have a good prognosis and normal liver function. Not all alive cases can be detected the shunt by targeted postnatal ultrasonography, and medical intervention is not necessary.

Portal vein stenosis or atresia

Stenosis or atresia of the PV may involve all or a portion of the PV. The UV drains into the LPV in embryonic period and spontaneously involute at birth. If this obliterative process is excessive, PV atresia and/or stenosis can develop. Portal vein obstruction, splenomegaly, variceal hemorrhage and portal hypertension could be the results of such anomaly. Atresia of a major branch of the PV can have the associated absence of the corresponding hepatic lobe. Congenital complete atresia of the PV may involve extrahepatic portosystemic shunt of splenomesenteric vein system.

Portal vein hypoplasia

The PV, which is as small as or smaller than the adjacent hepatic artery, can be generally considered as hypoplasia of the PV. Congenital portal vein dysplasia is thought to be secondary to development failure of the PV and/or its branch or embryonic thrombogenesis affects the development of the corresponding hepatic lobe or segment. The corresponding hepatic lobe may be atrophic as a result of the dysplastic PV. Hypoplasia of the PV can be depicted in children with biliary atresia, in addition to enlargement of the hepatic artery. PV hypoplasia in the setting of biliary atresia has an incidence of 26%. This increases the risk of complications associated with liver transplantation, strongly linked to the risk of thrombosis.

### Intrahepatic aneurysmal portosystemic venous shunt diagnosed on EUS [^a40c2836]. VideoGIE (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with intrahepatic shunts may present with a wide variety of adverse events, including hepatic encephalopathy and hepatopulmonary syndrome. However, many intrahepatic shunts may go unnoticed and are found incidentally on imaging studies.

Our case was an aneurysmal communication between the left hepatic vein and the umbilical part of the left portal vein, representing type 3 intrahepatic shunt, and the patient had no sign of liver dysfunction. Aneurysmal portosystemic venous shunt is an exceedingly rare clinical condition. Its diagnosis with transabdominal ultrasound has been reported; however, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of type 3 intrahepatic portosystemic shunt diagnosed on EUS.

In conclusion, the reported case represents a benign vascular anomaly of the liver and requires no specific therapeutic intervention. It is important that endosonographers become familiar with the anatomy of the liver and its vascular anatomy to appropriately diagnose liver lesions and avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful diagnostic interventions.

### Congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunts (abernethy malformation): an international observational study [^e7fe522d]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (CEPS) or Abernethy malformation is a rare condition in which splanchnic venous blood bypasses the liver draining directly into systemic circulation through a congenital shunt. Patients may develop hepatic encephalopathy (HE), pulmonary hypertension (PaHT), or liver tumors, among other complications. However, the actual incidence of such complications is unknown, mainly because of the lack of a protocolized approach to these patients. This study characterizes the clinical manifestations and outcome of a large cohort of CEPS patients with the aim of proposing a guide for their management. This is an observational, multicenter, international study. Sixty-six patients were included; median age at the end of follow-up was 30 years. Nineteen patients (28%) presented HE. Ten-, 20-, and 30-year HE incidence rates were 13%, 24%, and 28%, respectively. No clinical factors predicted HE. Twenty-five patients had benign nodular lesions. Ten patients developed adenomas (median age, 18 years), and another 8 developed HCC (median age, 39 years). Of 10 patients with dyspnea, PaHT was diagnosed in 8 and hepatopulmonary syndrome in 2. Pulmonary complications were only screened for in 19 asymptomatic patients, and PaHT was identified in 2. Six patients underwent liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma or adenoma. Shunt closure was performed in 15 patients with improvement/stability/cure of CEPS manifestations. Conclusion: CEPS patients may develop severe complications. Screening for asymptomatic complications and close surveillance is needed. Shunt closure should be considered both as a therapeutic and prophylactic approach.

### Percutaneous transhepatic treatment of a unique portal vein malformation with portal hypertension in a pediatric patient [^61abccf5]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anomalies of the portal venous system can be congenital or acquired, the latter being related to spontaneous thrombosis or iatrogenic alterations such as complications of perinatal catheterization of the umbilical vein (Corness et al; Carneiro et al.). Congenital absence of the portal vein (CAPV) is associated with different degrees of porto-systemic shunts (Abernethy malformation (Rajeswaran et al.)) with concomitant congenital malformations of the liver and cardiovascular system and related syndromes such as hepatic encephalopathy, hepatopulmonary syndrome and hepatorenal syndrome (Shen and Zhu). Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) must be distinguished from CAPV: in particular when thrombosis occurs gradually, or during embryologic development, this can be very difficult. Differential diagnosis in favor of PVT is the presence of venous collaterals or secondary signs of portal hypertension, such as splenomegaly or ascites (Albers and Khanna). Imaging provides a very accurate representation of the actual anatomic situation, but cannot always assess the evolution of events and establish an exact diagnosis.

The aim of this report is to present a singular case in a pediatric patient with malformation of the portal venous system characterized by unique imaging findings and to describe the interventional procedures applied in its successful management. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

### Catheter interventional treatment of congenital portosystemic venous shunts in childhood [^f6dd92cf]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The study aimed on the catheter interventional treatment of congenital portosystemic venous shunt (CPSVS) in childhood and the impact on vascular growth of hypoplastic portal veins. Clinical course and follow up of partial or complete closure of CPSVS are described.

Background

CPSVS is a very rare vascular malformation of the portal venous drainage resulting in potentially life threatening abdominal, pulmonary, cerebral, and cardiac complications. The anatomic type, clinical course, and diagnosis must be determined for optimal management.

Methods

Single centre case series.

Results

Eight (6 female) children with extrahepatic (n = 5) and intrahepatic (n = 3) CPSVS were diagnosed invasively by catheterization, including test balloon occlusion of the shunt and simultaneous retrograde angiography, and treated by catheter interventions (n = 5) with partial (n = 2) and complete (n = 3) occlusion of CPSVS at a median age of 3.9 years (range 0.7–21). Congenital heart disease (CHD) was the most frequent associated organ manifestation (n = 5) followed by mild to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (n = 4), hepatopulmonary syndrome (n = 2), and portosystemic encephalopathy (n = 1). CHD was simple (n = 3) or complex type (n = 2). Three patients were untreated so far, because they were in excellent clinical condition at an age < 1 year, refused treatment, or planned for later treatment.

Conclusions

Accurate invasive diagnosis of CPSVS with test balloon occlusion of the shunt is mandatory to depict the anatomic situation. Catheter interventional treatment of CPSVS offers a feasible and safe approach with complete or partial closure of the vascular malformation inducing potentially significant vascular growth of a former hypoplastic portal venous system. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Endovascular management of a congenital hepatic arterioportal malformation in a low resource setting [^bab6c04c]. CVIR Endovascular (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic arterioportal malformations is a communication seen directly between the portal vein and hepatic artery and can be divided into congenital and acquired. Congenital ones are a rare type of vascular malformation with one study reporting prevalence of less than 10% (Zhang et al.). They may be associated with certain conditions including hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and biliary atresia (Burrows et al.). Acquired causes of hepatic arterioportal malformations include cirrhosis, neoplasms, trauma, and iatrogenic causes including liver biopsy, biliary surgery and gastrectomy (Davenport et al; Tanaka et al; Vauthey et al.).

They are often asymptomatic but in rare instances can have debilitating symptoms that threaten survival. Some of the symptoms include portal hypertension, hepatofugal flow in the portal vein which becomes arterialized, splenomegaly, hypersplenism, variceal formation, bleeding, ascites, intestinal dysfunction including malabsorption, diarrhoea and esteatorrhea (Vauthey et al.). These patients are often extremely unwell and not ideal open surgical candidates. Therefore, minimally invasive treatment presents a suitable alternative.

### Ultrasonographic classification of 26 cases of fetal umbilical-portal-systemic venous shunts and the correlations with fetal chromosomal abnormalities [^9ea5c419]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fetal umbilical-portal-systemic venous shunts (UPSVS) refers to abnormal venous communication between portal vein and systemic vein, which is a low-incidence congenital vascular malformation. UPSVS is classified into four types: type I: umbilical-systemic shunts (USS), type II: ductus venosus-systemic shunts (DVSS), type IIIA: intrahepatic portal-systemic shunts (IHPSS), and type IIIB: extrahepatic portal-systemic shunts (EHPSS). The direct entry of venous blood from umbilical and portal veins into systemic venous system leads to inadequate intrahepatic portal venous blood perfusion and portal-systemic shunt, and consequently, fetal heart failure, fetal hydrops and fetal growth restriction (FGR) in the fetal period. Postnatal clinical manifestations may include different degrees of liver impairment, metabolic abnormalities, and even hepatic encephalopathy, pulmonary arterial hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome. Clinical manifestations of UPSVS are diverse. Fetal prognosis may be determined by the types of UPSVS and the complicated structural malformations and/ or chromosomal abnormalities. The incidence rate of UPSVS in neonatal period was reported to be 1/30 000–1/25 000, and that in fetal period has not been reported yet. UPSVS was associated with fetal chromosomal abnormalities, whereas gene syndromes have not been reported.

In this study, we analyzed the ultrasound characteristics, genetic test results, pregnancy outcomes and neonatal prognosis of 26 cases of UPSVS, in order to explore the ultrasonographic classification of fetal UPSVS and its correlations with fetal chromosomal abnormalities. The deeper understanding of fetal UPSVS may provide more comprehensive basis for prenatal consultation and postnatal management.

### Direct percutaneous abdominal venous access for endovascular therapy [^4fdee311]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- Type of Research: Single-center, retrospective, observational study
- Key Findings: Conventional methods for accessing the deep intra-abdominal veins can be challenging for various reasons. Direct percutaneous cannulation of deep intra-abdominal veins, such as the mesenteric, pelvic, or retroperitoneal veins, using ultrasound guidance may offer safe and efficient alternative access for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Direct access can be obtained using various needles and catheters with minor morbidity.
- Take Home Message: Ultrasound-guided direct percutaneous access to dilated intra-abdominal veins — including the pelvic, retroperitoneal, and portomesenteric veins — is a feasible and safe technique that enables effective embolization of complex vascular malformations when conventional access routes are limited or unsuccessful. This approach provides real-time visualization, stable catheter positioning, and minimal morbidity and should be considered a valuable alternative in challenging cases.

Deeply seated intra-abdominal and pelvic veins are generally not suitable for direct percutaneous access owing to the presence of overlying arteries, bowel, and viscera, which pose significant risks for procedure-related complications. Conventional access to abdominal systemic veins is typically achieved via a retrograde approach, whereas the portomesenteric veins are accessed through transhepatic or trans-splenic routes.

Safe and stable percutaneous access to intra-abdominal veins can be challenging, particularly in cases of markedly dilated and tortuous pelvic veins, postembolization changes, or chronic thrombosis of the portal or splenic veins. When conventional access methods fail, direct percutaneous access may provide a safe and effective alternative.

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are high-flow vascular malformations in which arterial blood is shunted directly into veins through a dysplastic nidus, bypassing the capillary bed. This abnormal circulation increases venous pressure and flow, leading to vascular dilation, tissue ischemia, congestion, and complications such as ulceration, infection, bone destruction, hemorrhage, or even high-output cardiac failure. In contrast, venous malformations are low-flow vascular malformations involving abnormal venous wall development without arteriovenous shunting. These differences in flow and structure result in distinct clinical courses and require different therapeutic strategies.

### Congenital intrahepatic portohepatic shunt managed by interventional radiologic occlusion: a case report and literature review [^53d8697a]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Congenital intrahepatic portosystemic shunts are rare hepatic vascular anomalies that often lead to severe secondary conditions. A 6-year-old boy was referred for assessment of severe hypoxia, and a large liver mass was diagnosed with such a malformation and was managed by direct closure of the venous fistula by interventional radiology. Follow-up assessment shows normalization of the respiratory condition and a progressive reduction of the vascular liver lesion. Review of literature suggests that radiologic interventions are currently the criterion standard for managing these conditions, with surgery reserved for patients who are not eligible for radiologic procedure and those requiring liver transplantation.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) liver vascular malformations (LVMs) — prevalence and clinical presentations indicate frequent imaging findings with defined shunt-related syndromes. LVMs on imaging are present in 55% of patients with definite HHT. Three shunt patterns are described: hepatic artery to hepatic vein shunting resulting in high-output heart failure (HOHF) and/or ischemic cholangiopathy with secondary sclerosing cholangitis and/or biloma formation; hepatic artery to portal vein shunting resulting in portal hypertension (PH); and portal vein to hepatic vein shunting that may lead to portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE) and could also contribute to HOHF. The most common complications are HOHF (63%), biliary ischemia (19% of cases), and PH (17% of cases). Symptomatic LVMs occur in adults with a mean age of around 48 years at presentation, and the youngest reported symptomatic case is 21 years old.

Liver vascular malformations in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) — Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a rare disease (1 in 5,000–8,000 persons), and liver vascular malformations (LVMs) are present in 40%-70% of patients with definite HHT. Symptoms from LVMs occur at a median of 90 months after imaging diagnosis and typically appear around age 30, occurring predominantly in females, and mortality is higher in patients with LVMs versus those without them. Symptoms result from three types of shunting within the liver: hepatic artery (HA) to HV, HA to PV, and PV to HV, and shunting leads to presentations with the most common being high-output heart failure, followed by biliary ischemia, portal hypertension (ascites more common, variceal hemorrhage rarer), portosystemic encephalopathy, and intestinal ischemia.

### Portal vascular anomalies in down syndrome: spectrum of clinical presentation and management approach [^78536d30]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The occurrence of portal vascular anomalies in Down syndrome has been sporadically reported in the literature. These rare disorders have a wide spectrum of anatomical and clinical presentations. The aim of this communication was to describe the clinical course, imaging features, and management approaches in patients with this association.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive search of the databases of the Vascular Anomalies Center and the Department of Radiology at Children's Hospital Boston for patients with Down syndrome and portal vascular anomalies. Medical records and imaging studies of varying modalities were reviewed.

Results

Three children with Down syndrome and portal anomalies (portosystemic shunt, simple arterioportal shunt, complex arterioportal shunt) were managed at our institution. The portosystemic shunt was clinically insignificant and resolved without any intervention. The simple arterioportal shunt was successfully treated with embolization. The complex arterioportal shunt was associated with major congenital cardiac defects and the child ultimately expired despite a decrease in the arterioportal shunting after embolization.

Conclusions

Three is a wide spectrum of clinical and anatomical features of portal vascular shunts in Down syndrome. The management approach should be tailored based on the severity of symptoms. Percutaneous embolization can offer a safe, effective, and minimally invasive alternative to the surgical approach in selective cases.

### Prenatal ultrasonographic features and follow-up outcomes of 19 cases of congenital intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunts diagnosed during the foetal period [^1905228e]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

We found that the left lobe of the IHPSS diagnosed in the foetal period was more common than the right lobe, whether on the portal or hepatic venous side. This conclusion is consistent with that reported by Kivilevitch et al. In their cases, except for one foetus in which the left portal vein could not be identified, the starting position of the shunt in all other cases was located in the left portal vein. Cytter-Kuint et al. studied IHPSS in 15 children, of which 14 shunts were located between the LPV and hepatic vein, and only one case was located between the RPV and RHV. However, none of these studies have discussed this feature further.

The hepatic primordium emerges in the fourth week of gestation and is in contact with the vitelline and umbilical venous systems. Eventually, liver blood vessels are formed via angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and vascular differentiation. The segments of the vitelline veins located between the subdiaphragmatic and subhepatic anastomoses are interrupted by the developing hepatic trabeculae and resolve into a plexus of small vessels connected to the hepatic sinusoids. The hepatic afferent veins (venæ advehentes) convey blood from the subhepatic anastomosis to the sinusoidal plexus, while the hepatic efferent veins (venæ revehentes) drain blood from the sinusoidal plexus to the subdiaphragmatic anastomosis. The foetal umbilical vein completely supplies the left portal vein of the foetal liver, whereas the right portal vein of the foetus is supplied by both the umbilical vein and the main portal vein. The blood flow in the left portal vein of the foetal liver was greater than that in the right portal vein. IHPSS is a vascular malformation caused by incomplete vascular remodelling of the vitelline vein. We speculate that in the process of gradual remodelling of the small vascular plexus connected to the sinus plexus into the peripheral branches of the portal vein and hepatic vein, the peripheral branch of the LPV has greater blood flow because the LPV connects to the umbilical vein, making it easier to "maintain" the abnormal connection with the peripheral branch of the hepatic vein. That is, increased blood flow facilitates the formation of an IHPSS. This may be the reason the IHPSS we observed during the foetal period was more common in the left branch of the portal vein. In the single-shunt group, the closer the portal vein branch was to the umbilical vein, the more shunts were observed (LPVi > LPVm > LPVs). The spontaneous closure of IHPSS diagnosed prenatally after birth may be related to the closure of the umbilical vein and the decrease in portal venous blood flow after birth, which, on the other hand, indicates that low blood flow is not conducive to the "maintenance" of the abnormal shunt.

### Abernethy malformation (type II) presenting in a 6-day-old boy with noonan syndrome: a case report [^f424295e]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

AM is a rare condition wherein the portomesenteric blood supply drains via a complete or partial shunt into the systemic blood supply, bypassing the liver. This condition affects roughly 1 of every 30,000–50,000 live births, and is categorized into two types based on the pattern of the portal and systemic vein patterns. According to current literature, Type I AM appear to exhibit a female predominance, while Type II AM demonstrates a higher prevalence in males. In type I cases, complete aplasia of the intrahepatic portal vein branches and complete extrahepatic shunting of portovenous blood into systemic veins is observed, often associated with congenital anomalies, and increased risk of hepatic tumors. In type II cases, hypoplastic intrahepatic portal vein branches are observed together with the partial extrahepatic shunting of the portovenous blood into a systemic vein.

Clinical manifestations of AM patients may exhibit a wide array of clinical symptoms including hyperammonemia and jaundice, with the precise nature of these symptoms being dependent on portosystemic shut locations. This condition is most often diagnosed in children exhibiting congenital defects, psychomotor delay, cholestasis, failure to thrive, or hyperglycemia. In some instances, it may be detected incidentally via prenatal ultrasonography or during the evaluation of portopulmonary syndrome, abdominal pain, portopulmonary hypertension, abnormal liver function test results, or portosystemic encephalopathy. In the present case, the patient's hyperammonemia and regressive elevation of liver enzymes likely resulted from the systemic circulation of unmetabolized ammonia due to the portosystemic shunt. Although the exact pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension caused by congenital portosystemic shunts remains incompletely elucidated, proposed mechanisms include volume overload due to increased systemic blood flow and impaired hepatic clearance of vasoactive substances.

Discussion

Since Abernethy first discovered the congenital portosystemic shunt (CPSS) in 1793, an increasing number of studies have been conducted on this disease. According to the location of the shunt between the portal and systemic veins, the CPSS can be divided into intrahepatic and extrahepatic types and various subtypes. The previous description of foetal CPSS also used the adult classification until Achiron proposed the foetal umbilical–portal–systemic shunt (UPSVS) classification, including type I umbilical–systemic shunt, type II ductus venosus–systemic shunt, and type III portal–systemic shunt. Type III is further divided into two subtypes: type IIIa, intrahepatic portal–systemic shunt, and type IIIb, extrahepatic portal–systemic shunt. This classification is currently the only foetal type of CPSS that can better reflect the unique blood circulation characteristics of the foetal period and is more suitable for the diagnosis of foetal CPSS. However, prenatal ultrasound manifestations of type IIIa are diverse, and no further elaboration has been made regarding the characteristics of this type. It must be emphasised that prenatal classification is not the same as postnatal classification. Furthermore, for optimal treatment and management after birth, various imaging modalities, including CT angiography and Doppler ultrasound, should be considered to precisely define the involved vessels, type of shunt, and presence of aneurysm/dilation.

The direct manifestation of the congenital IHPSS is an abnormal connection between the hepatic and intrahepatic portal veins. Due to the limitations of imaging conditions, prenatal classification of IHPSS based on the Park classification is unreliable. However, it is not difficult to distinguish single or multiple shunts by prenatal ultrasound. The abnormal connection was often close to the liver capsule (78.9%, 15/19), indicating that the shunts were mostly located in the peripheral branches of the hepatic and intrahepatic portal veins. The morphology of the abnormal connection was diverse: 33.3% (4/12) of the single-shunt group and 28.6% (2/7) of the multiple-shunt group showed cystic dilatation at the shunt. In the multiple-shunt group, 57.1% had irregular shunts and 42.9% had regular shunts.

Congenital portosystemic shunts — pediatric classification and management are described, noting that congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunts were classified into type I and II lesions depending on the presence or absence of an accompanying hypoplastic portal vein (PV). A significant proportion of these patients may have severe congenital cardiac, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal defects. Treatment with liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed, but is unnecessary in the vast majority of children because of modern endovascular shunt closure techniques.

Introduction — hepatic blood supply and portal venous anatomy notes that about 75% of blood flow comes through the portal vein and the remaining 25% through the hepatic artery, that the portal vein is approximately 6–8 cm in length and 1 cm in diameter and divides in the hilum of the liver into the left and right portal vein branches, and that portal blood drains into hepatic sinusoids which then drain into the inferior vena cava (IVC) through the hepatic veins; the major hepatic veins are the right, middle, and left hepatic veins, and the left and middle hepatic veins usually join within the liver entering the left side of the IVC as a single vessel.

Budd–Chiari syndrome (BCS) — the guideline states all patients should be evaluated for acquired and inherited thrombophilia, and, given the "high prevalence of 2 or more risk factors," investigation for secondary prothrombotic factors is recommended "even in the presence of 1 conspicuous thrombophilia disorder." The hepatic venous outflow tract should be investigated in unexplained acute or chronic liver disease with new-onset ascites and/or abdominal pain; hepatic venogram and/or liver biopsy are "rarely required" for diagnosis. Referral to a hematologist is recommended, and gastroesophageal varices are "not a contraindication to anticoagulation" with indicated primary/secondary prophylaxis.

Acquired portosystemic shunts

Acquired extrahepatic portosystemic shunts are the most common shunts among PVS. A large group of pathologies can trigger its development, but the most common cause is PH. Other causes include splenic, splenomesenteric, and SMV stenosis or obstruction. Hepatopetal venous flow is rerouted away from the liver (hepatofugal) through collateral pathways to reach the low-pressure systemic vessels. More than 20 pathways have been described, the most common being gastroesophageal, para­esophageal, paraumbilical, splenorenal (mostly left-sided), and inferior mesenteric venous collateral vessels, in order of decreasing frequency. The imaging findings are the presence of dilated tortuous veins in relation with the PVS and systemic venous system. Can be found on ultrasound, on CT are best depict at portal venous phase as tubular enhancing structures and on MRI as flow voids.

Coronary collateral veins at the lesser omentum are the most frequently depicted varices (Fig. 18 c). Their presence has a high sensitivity rate to PH diagnosis. Gastric varices are commonly located in the posterosuperior aspect of the gastric fundus (Fig. 18 c), and drain into the esophageal or paraesophageal veins, or occasionally into the left renal vein.

Esophageal varices are of major clinical importance because they are a frequent source of gastrointestinal bleeding (Fig. 24). Endoscopy is more sensitive in the diagnosis of esophageal mucosal varices but CT shows to better advantage the paraesophageal varices. Both venous plexuses communicate via perforating veins, crossing the muscular layer of the esophageal wall.

### Percutaneous transhepatic treatment of a unique portal vein malformation with portal hypertension in a pediatric patient [^24ebc5a0]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Developmental anomalies and acquired alterations of the portal venous system lead to a wide spectrum of uncommon clinical conditions. Herein, we describe a unique and singular case which has some clinical features common to PVT. Interestingly, in this case portal hypertension was not associated with ascites, hypersplenism or altered liver morphology: we hypothesize this was due to absence of liver disease and to the peculiar vascular anatomy, with spontaneous portal system decompression through an enlarged left gastric vein; although reduced by the stenosis, liver flow was probably enough. The case presents peculiar aspects suggesting a possible developmental anomaly: we hypothesize the persistence of the caudal ventral anastomosis of the right vitelline vein that may have compensated a portal vein agenesis or embryonic thrombosis. To our knowledge this vascular abnormality has been never reported with this clinical presentation.

Percutaneous transhepatic angioplasty led to the resolution of portal hypertension with no further risk of bleeding.

### Diagnostic and interventional radiology for Budd-Chiari syndrome [^a4a7045c]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Budd-Chiari syndrome is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hepatic venous outflow obstruction that involves one or more draining hepatic veins. Its occurrence in populations in the western hemisphere is commonly associated with hypercoagulative states. Clinical manifestations in many cases are nonspecific, and imaging may be critical for early diagnosis of venous obstruction and accurate assessment of the extent of disease. If Budd-Chiari syndrome is not treated promptly and appropriately, the outcome may be dismal. Comprehensive imaging evaluations, in combination with pathologic analyses and clinical testing, are essential for determining the severity of disease, stratifying risk, selecting the appropriate therapy, and objectively assessing the response. The main goal of treatment is to alleviate hepatic congestion, thereby improving hepatocyte function and allowing resolution of portal hypertension. Various medical, endovascular, and surgical treatment options are available. Percutaneous and endovascular procedures, when performed in properly selected patients, may be more effective than medical treatment methods for preserving liver function and arresting disease progression in the long term. In addition, such procedures are associated with lower morbidity and mortality than are open surgical techniques.

### Congenital portosystemic shunt occlusion with an amplatzer PFO occlusion device: a case report [^4b6abba3]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion/Conclusion

CPSS are rare intrahepatic or extrahepatic vascular malformations redirecting blood flow from the portal circulation to the systemic circulation, bypassing the liver. Extrahepatic portosystemic shunts (EPSS) or "Abernethy malformations" have aberrant connections between the porto-mesenteric vasculature before PV branching and a systemic vein. Type 1 EPSS have no portal venous perfusion of the liver while Type 2 EPSS have partial portal perfusion of the liver. Intrahepatic shunts, are classified based on the abnormal connections between intrahepatic branches of the portal vein and the hepatic veins or IVC. There are four subtypes which include: a single large vessel connecting the right portal vein to the IVC (type 1), localized peripheral connections between peripheral PV branches and the hepatic veins in a single hepatic segment (type 2), an aneurysmal connection between a peripheral PV and hepatic vein (type 3), and localized peripheral connections between peripheral PV branches and the hepatic veins in bilateral hepatic lobes (type 4). Our patient was classified as a type 1, intrahepatic CPSS.

Doppler ultrasound is the main mode of diagnosis of CPSS. Pre-procedural CT angiography and magnetic resonance angiography are often used to further evaluate complex anatomy. Shunt type, location, degree of function, patient age, severity of symptoms, and complication risks are several considerations when planning treatment. To date, no standard treatment options exist. Given the variability of treatment options, this case study seeks to describe when endovascular approach with an Amplatzer PFO OD is appropriate and how it can successfully be utilized to treat a large type 1 intrahepatic CPSS.

Asymptomatic patients diagnosed with an incidental finding of intrahepatic shunt prenatally or in early infancy should be monitored for a year before definitive intervention, as many intrahepatic CPPS involute by this time. Symptomatic patients, such as our patient, require immediate treatment to avoid complications associated with encephalopathy and liver dysfunction. Shunt type also determines treatment approach. Many intrahepatic CPSS can be treated with endovascular occlusion or surgical ligation given the presence of other hepatic PV perfusion. For patients with a type 1 EPSS, liver transplantation is required for definitive treatment, while for type 2 EPSS, embolization remains a non-invasive treatment option.

### Complications of congenital portosystemic shunts in children: therapeutic options and outcomes [^8d1f4cdf]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Congenital portosystemic shunts are rare vascular malformations that lead to severe complications. Their management is controversial. The aim of this study was to propose a clear definition of the risks and management of congenital portosystemic shunts in children according to our experience and a review of the literature.

Patients and Methods

Twenty-two children with a complicated congenital portosystemic shunt were studied in our institution. When necessary, management included portal pressure measurement and portal vein angiography during an occlusion test and closure of the shunt by surgical and/or endovascular methods.

Results

Five neonates with intrahepatic shunts presented with cholestasis that resolved spontaneously, and 17 older children presented with liver tumors (13) and/or hepatopulmonary syndrome (2), pulmonary artery hypertension (3), portosystemic encephalopathy (3), heart failure (1), and glomerulonephritis (1). The portosystemic shunt was extrahepatic (11) or intrahepatic (6). Portosystemic shunts were closed by endovascular methods in 5 children and surgically in 10, 4 of whom had portal pressure during occlusion above 35 mmHg and extremely hypoplastic or undetectable portal veins requiring banding of the fistula before closure. Shunt closure resulted in restoration of intrahepatic portal flow in all, with complete or partial regression of benign liver masses, and regression or stabilization of pulmonary, cardiac, neurological, and renal complications.

Conclusions

Congenital portosystemic shunt carries risks of severe complications in children. Closure of a shunt persisting after age 2 years should be considered preventively. Intrahepatic portal flux restoration can be expected, even when intrahepatic portal veins are extremely hypoplastic or undetectable.

### Ultrasonographic classification of 26 cases of fetal umbilical-portal-systemic venous shunts and the correlations with fetal chromosomal abnormalities [^f3701b73]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Achiron's study suggested that IHPSS group (type IIIA) was characterized by the highest incidence of FGR. In our study, FGR was not found in all three cases of IHPSS. One case was terminated at 25 gestational weeks due to multiple malformations. One case was terminated at 26 gestational weeks due to the compound malformation of right polycystic dysplastic kidney. One case was terminated at 27 gestational weeks due to the appearance of fetal heart failure. The gestational weeks at termination for all three cases were less than 28 weeks. Thereby, whether type IIIA mostly manifest as late-onset FGR needs further studies.

In our study, two cases of trisomy 18 were found in type IIIB. Song, et al. also reported a case of type IIIB diagnosed as trisomy 18. These findings are inconsistent with Achiron's finding that type II (DVSS) was the only type that had chromosomal aneuploidy. In our study, seven of nine EHPSS cases terminated pregnancies due to chromosomal abnormalities or (and) complicated structural malformations, and two cases of isolated EHPSS continued pregnancy to term delivery, and were normal in growth and development after birth. The prognosis of fetal EHPSS depended on the development of intrahepatic portal vein and its branches. Cases with complete absence of intrahepatic portal vein (type I EHPSS) had poor prognosis, and liver transplantation could be the only treatment option after birth. For type II EHPSS, portosystemic shunt closure or ligation and hepatic lobectomy can be applied after birth according to the diameter of shunt and the clinical manifestations. In most cases, symptoms will be improved significantly after surgery, but a small number of cases still had pulmonary hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy and intestinal congestion.

### A new variant of abernethy malformation treated by transhepatic interventional closure: a case report [^02a94cf1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

CPSS are rare vascular malformations with an estimated incidence of one in 50,000 births. Probably based on improvements of imaging techniques the number of reported cases has increased significantly during the recent years. Development of CPSS is attributed to failed involution of one or several primordial venous vessels resulting in abnormal vascular connections between portal and systemic veins. These abnormal vascular connections allow partial or complete bypass of portal venous flow from the liver to the systemic veins. Early complications of CPSS include neonatal cholestasis and galactosemia as a consequence of portosystemic shunting. Late complications encompass liver atrophy which is probably related to portal venous flow bypassing the liver and absent hepatotrophic factors. Other liver pathologies include focal nodular hypoplasia as well as development of benign or malignant liver tumors like hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Screening tests for early detection of hepatic tumours should be carried out regularly in the follow-up of these patients. Significant morbidity and mortality may result from portopulmonary hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome. Pulmonary hypertension may occur both in neonates and in adults. Franchi-Abella et al. reported portopulmonary hypertension in 40 of 413 patients, 31 of these patients having extrahepatic shunts. In at least six patients, sudden cardiac death was associated with pulmonary hypertension. Hepatopulmonary syndrome with the development of intrapulmonary arteriovenous-shunts results in chronic hypoxemia. Portosystemic encephalopathy often associated with increased ammonemia is the most frequent neurologic complication which may develop at any age.

John Abernethy was the first to describe absence of the portal vein associated with an extrahepatic CPSS in 1793. Since then several different classifications have been introduced to classify these abnormal vascular connections. CPPS can be classified in an extrahepatic and an intrahepatic category. Extrahepatic shunts are classified in type 1 characterized by total congenital absence of the portal vein, and type 2 associated with partial congenital absence of the portal vein. Both anomalies are referred to as Abernethy malformations. Intrahepatic shunts are located inside the liver. Based on a large cohort of 265 children Bernard et al. suggested a different classification based on the origin of the CPSS from the portal system, the type and number of communications. Finally, the classification proposed by Franchi-Abella is based on surgical and interventional treatment options according to Blanc and Kanazawa. Congenital CPSS can be distinguished from acquired CPSS which are described in up to 20% of patients with increasing portal hypertension in the context of liver cirrhosis. These acquired vascular anastomoses are characterized by a varicose appearance.

### The classification based on intrahepatic portal system for congenital portosystemic shunts [^2d2514b9]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Liver transplantation was previously indicated as a curative operation for congenital absence of portal vein. Recent advances in radiological interventional techniques can precisely visualize the architecture of the intrahepatic portal system (IHPS). Therefore, the therapeutic approach for congenital portosystemic shunt (CPS) needs to be reevaluated from a viewpoint of radiological appearances. The aim of this study was to propose the IHPS classification which could explain the pathophysiological characteristics and play a complementary role of a therapeutic approach and management for CPS.

Methods

Nineteen patients with CPS were retrospectively reviewed. The median age at diagnosis was 6.8 years old. Eighteen of these patients underwent angiography with a shunt occlusion test and were classified based of the severity of the hypoplasia of IHPS.

Results

The eighteen cases who could undergo the shunt occlusion test were classified into mild (n = 7), moderate (n = 6) and severe types (n = 5) according to the IHPS classification. The IHPS classification correlated with the portal venous pressure under shunt occlusion, the histopathological findings, postoperative portal venous flow and liver regeneration. Shunt closure resulted in dramatic improvement in the laboratory data and subclinical encephalopathy. Two patients with the severe type suffered from sepsis associated with portal hypertension after treatment, and from the portal flow steal phenomenon because of the development of unexpected collateral vessels. The patients with the severe type had a high risk of postoperative complications after shunt closure in one step, even if the PVP was relatively low during the shunt occlusion test.

Conclusion

The IHPS could be visualized by the shunt occlusion test. The IHPS classification reflected the clinicopathological features of CPS, and was useful to determine the therapeutic approach and management for CPS.

### Abernethy malformation (type II) presenting in a 6-day-old boy with noonan syndrome: a case report [^ce86f8b5]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

These cases underscore the necessity of comprehensive vascular system evaluation in patients with RASopathies, including systematic imaging screening of the portal venous system, to minimize the risk of missed diagnoses. Multicenter collaborative efforts are needed to establish comprehensive genotype-phenotype correlations and elucidate whether AM represents a direct consequence of RASopathy or a coincidental comorbidity.

The management of AM is highly individualized, depending on the type of malformation, associated anomalies, and clinical complications. There is no universal therapeutic strategy, and treatment decisions must be tailored to each patient's specific presentation. In general, patients with type I Abernathy malformation require liver transplantation, while shunt closure can be sufficient to treat type II cases. Treatment is necessary for any patient with symptoms, and the shunt ratio, as computed via doppler ultrasonography, is used to guide treatment efforts for asymptomatic individuals. When the shunt fraction, defined by the ratio of the shunt flow to the total portal flow volume, exceeds 60%, patients face a high risk of hepatic encephalopathy such that treatment is generally advisable. Some expert opinions indicate that children diagnosed with AM should undergo endovascular intervention or surgical treatment as soon as possible in symptomatic cases. The primary goals of treatment include reducing systemic ammonia levels, alleviating symptoms, and preventing long-term complications through the restoration of physiological portal flow. Per current guidelines for management, most patients with NS achieve normal intellectual performance in adulthood, although they require routine follow-up to monitor for complications such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and lymphatic abnormalities.

In our patient, progressive elevation of liver enzymes and hyperammonemia during follow-up prompted laparoscopic portosystemic shunt ligation at six months of age. Postoperatively, the patient exhibited rapid normalization of biochemical parameters including the level of liver enzymes, blood ammonia and coagulation parameters, and remained stable at the 12-month follow-up, with no recurrence of symptoms. For NS, the patient continues to undergo regular multidisciplinary evaluations to monitor growth and neurodevelopment.

With the increasing use of multidetector computed tomography and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging in evaluation of liver pathologies, a variety of vascular shunts are detected in the liver. These shunts can be related to tumors or they can be nonneoplastic. Identification of these shunts can help in diagnosing an underlying condition. We classify and describe a wide spectrum of intrahepatic vascular shunts with their key imaging features. After reviewing this article, the reader should have improved ability to detect and characterize intrahepatic vascular shunts, which will help in diagnosing an underlying condition and facilitate optimal patient care.

A 76-year-old woman presented to an outside hospital for evaluation of persistent headache for 2 weeks. On laboratory assessments, she was found to have elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Biopsy from the temporal artery was negative for temporal arteritis. An abdominal CT scan was performed and demonstrated a 25- × 24-mm mass lesion in the left liver lobe with enhancement in the portal venous phase (Fig. 1). Liver enzymes and tumor markers were unremarkable. She was referred for EUS examination at our center for further evaluation of the liver lesion. EUS revealed an aneurysmal communication between the left hepatic vein and the umbilical part of the left portal vein, which supplies blood to segments 2 and 3 of the liver (Fig. 2 A and B; Video 1, available online at). Further interrogation with EUS revealed that ligamentum venosum was present, excluding the presence of patent ductus venosus (Fig. 3). Given the patient's age, normal liver enzymes, and absence of symptoms, no radiologic or surgical intervention was pursued. The patient underwent expectant management with serial follow-up imaging.

### What are the implications of the spontaneous spleno-renal shunts in liver cirrhosis? [^9278c552]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The understanding of mechanisms regulating Portal Hypertension (PH) has been incomplete so far, although researchers have struggled for years. PH is primarily caused by an increase in resistance to portal outflow and secondly by a growth in splanchnic blood flow. In a later phase, these changes lead to a hyperkinetic circulation that raises cardiac output and reduces systemic vascular resistance as well as perfusion pressure. Regional alterations in vasoreactivity (vasodilation and vasoconstriction), sinusoidal remodelling and capillarization, angiogenesis, venous thrombosis, and obviously vascular distortion, all play a certain role in the pathophysiology of PH by contributing to circulatory impairment and expansion of the collateral circulation. Among vasoactive substances activated in PH, nitric oxide is considered as the most important vasodilator. Endothelin-1 and cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandins are the foremost vasoconstrictor factors, apart from the sympathetic overactivity. Furthermore, a major role has been attributed to activated hypercontractile hepatic stellate cells, which cause vascular remodelling as an adaptive response to the changed balance in vasoactive substances. It has recently demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction is determinant in PH development. Finally, an increase in the splanchnic vascular bed size mediated by a Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-dependent angiogenic process has been claimed to significantly contribute to increased overall blood flow in splanchnic tissues of PH animals. In addition, this VEGF-dependent angiogenesis also plays a crucial role in the formation of portal-systemic collateral vessels, which include Spleno-Renal shunts (SRS). Notably, novel research has highlighted that PH is an independent predictor of HepatoCellular Carcinoma (HCC) development. Beyond the formation of portosystemic shunts, of which Esophageal Varices (EV) have the greatest clinical impact and the most severe complications, PH leads to Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) and ascites. Other manifestations of PH include portal hypertensive gastropathy and Large Spontaneous Shunts (LSS). LSS refer to the presence of patent paraumbilical vein, SRS, ano-rectosigmoid varices with or without portal hypertensive colopathy. The prevalence of umbilical vein patency ranges from 6% to 30% in patients with PH. SRS are present in cirrhotics from nearly 14% up to 21%. Rectosigmoid varices are present in nearly one third of cirrhotic patients, 4% of whom have a lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage. LSS, the presence of which was assessed by portal venous phase multidetector-row spiral computed tomography, have been shown to be responsible for recurrent or persistent HE. In patients with liver cirrhosis, with and without bleeding varices, many imaging techniques are available to detect collaterals, beyond the previously quoted one. In fact, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography, selective intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography, scintiphotosplenoportography, but also the percutaneous transhepatic portography, are quite conclusive in diagnosing SRS. Reports published in the literature to date have shown that all patients with hepatic cirrhosis should be studied by using Doppler UltraSound (DUS) techniques, being the remainder methods invasive or extremely expensive and then unsuitable in close follow-ups. DUS can provide a great deal of information about the morphology and hemodynamics of PH and consequently spontaneous shunts can be identified. They may mimic surgically created shunts in their large volume-flow capacity. In contrast, other Authors believe that hepato-splenic hemodynamics, as studied at DUS, are only weakly correlated to portal pressure, suggesting measuring them with MRI. Anyway, among blood flow parameters, Splenic Vein Flow Velocity (SVFV) is considered to be specifically related to the stages of liver damage and to EV bleeding. Although significant advances are expected to be made in the diagnosis and management of the PH-related complications, in the face of an increasing burden of chronic liver disease, the prognostic role of LSS has not been presented in a convincing manner so far. Clarifying this aspect could help correctly approach the ongoing, life-treating events occurring in patients suffering from liver cirrhosis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the relation of SRS, detected by an easily reproducible and reliable tool, i.e. DUS, to the severity of ascites, EV, HE and the presence of HCC. Furthermore, we intended to seek any association of these imaging parameters with the degree of liver failure.

Budd–Chiari syndrome — diagnostic work-up and imaging recommendations: Investigation for acquired and inherited thrombotic conditions should be performed in all patients with BCS. Owing to the high prevalence of two or more risk factors in BCS, investigation for secondary prothrombotic factors is recommended even in the presence of 1 conspicuous thrombophilia disorder. The hepatic venous outflow tract should be investigated in all patients with acute or chronic liver disease without an obvious cause, particularly in the setting of new-onset ascites and/or abdominal pain. Hepatic venogram and/or liver biopsy are rarely required to make a diagnosis of BCS. For imaging selection in new-onset ascites, the guideline asks, "Should Doppler US, contrast-enhanced CT scan, or MRI be obtained to diagnose BCS in patients with new-onset ascites?" and states, "We recommend Doppler US as the initial diagnostic test for evaluation for BCS. Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scans should be obtained to assess thrombus extension, rule out tumor thrombus, determine response to anticoagulation therapy, evaluate indeterminate hepatic nodules, and whenever there is high clinical suspicion of BCS despite negative or inconclusive Doppler US results (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence)."

### Progressive cyanosis following kawashima operation: slow resolution after redirection of hepatic veins [^7bf9bb3a]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A newborn girl was diagnosed with dextrocardia, left atrial isomerism, azygous continuation to a solitary left sided superior vena cava, hepatic veins draining to the left sided atrium, unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect, double outlet right ventricle and valvar pulmonary stenosis. Initially the patient was surgically palliated with an aortopulmonary shunt. Kawashima operation with closure of the shunt was performed at the age of ten months. Postoperatively resting saturations were initially 85–90%, but declined over the next two years to 60–65%. Cardiac catheterization showed an unobstructed left-sided cavopulmonary anastomosis, low pulmonary artery pressures and absence of significant veno-venous collaterals. No macroscopic arteriovenous malformations were present. At the age of three years, the hepatic veins were excised from the atrium with a cuff of atrial tissue, anastomosed to a GORE-TEX® tube graft which was placed along the left side of the heart and anastomosed end-to-side to the confluent pulmonary arteries facing the superior cavopulmonary connection. The operation was done through a median sternotomy using cardiopulmonary bypass on beating heart. Postoperatively oxygen saturations were initially 60–70% but increased to approximately 85% after four weeks, 90–93% after nine months and 95–100% after three years, when she was last seen.

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations are a common finding following the classic cavopulmonary shunt i.e. superior vena cava to right pulmonary artery. However, the prevalence following total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) has been described as relatively low, except for patients with left atrial isomerism in whom the hepatic venous flow is not incorporated directly in the TCPC. In these patients pulmonary arteriovenous malformations develops in 21–75 percent. The large range in patients developing pulmonary arteriovenous malformations may be a combination of lack of early awareness of the problem, a wide range in the clinical presentation, additional venous-venous collaterals and a time factor, since these malformations take several years to develop. Table 1 shows a summary of the current literature with focus on the timing of surgical redirection of hepatic venous flow and time to resolution.

### Management of Budd-Chiari syndrome [^d2f901cc]. Liver Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Key Concepts

1. Medical therapy alone is rarely sufficient for long-term management of patients with hepatic vein thrombosis. 2. Enthusiasm for intravascular stents (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt [TIPS] or vena caval stents) for the management of Budd-Chiari syndrome must be tempered by the limited interval of expected utility, the likelihood of stent occlusion/revisions, and the potential complications that stent migration would impose upon a subsequent liver transplant. 3. Both decompressive shunts and liver transplantation provide excellent long-term survival for patients with the Budd-Chiari syndrome. The determination of which surgical procedure is most appropriate is aided by assessment of the etiology of hepatic vein thrombosis, hepatic reserve, liver histology, and splanchnic venous anatomy. 4. Progressive hepatic damage may develop in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome who have patent surgical shunts or TIPS. Lifelong follow-up and tracking of hepatic function are indicated. Some patients with shunts will require salvage with liver transplantation. 5. Long-term anticoagulation should be considered after transplantation, even in patients who do not have an identifiable coagulation disorder.

Considerable evidence has since accumulated to indicate that the procedure effectively prevents recurrence of varix hemorrhage, the most common precipitating cause of liver failure in cirrhotic patients. * Nevertheless there is widespread belief that protection from bleeding is uncertain and that variceal rupture occurs again in a significant proportion of treated patients even though the anastomosis is patent. Should gastrointestinal hemorrhage recur, it is almost routinely inferred the varicosities are the source, especially when they are again demonstrable.

Except for a few case references, authentication for this inference is lacking as applied to the direct portacaval type of anastomosis in contrast to that of the splenorenal variety.

### Congenital portosystemic venous shunt associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: a case report [^e0df186a]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS) is the most common chromosomal microdeletion syndrome and occurs in 1 in 3000–6000 individuals. The clinical phenotype is diverse, with complications ranging from mild to severe. In the neonatal period, congenital heart disease (CHD) affects prognosis. From infancy onward, neurological symptoms, such as developmental delays and psychiatric disorders, are often problematic.

Congenital portosystemic venous shunts (CPSS), in which portal blood flows into the systemic venous system through abnormal shunt vessels, are rare developmental abnormalities of the portal venous system during fetal life. The overall prevalence of CPSS is reported to be 1 in 30,000, and the rate of shunt vessels remaining open after infancy is 1 in 50,000. CPSS are classified into intrahepatic and extrahepatic types and are often associated with CHD. The concentrations of galactose, bile acids, ammonia, and manganese in the systemic veins increase when shunt blood bypasses the liver. Hence, some patients with CPSS develop portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE) and a variety of neurological symptoms. Symptoms of CPSS are influenced by abnormal vessel size and short-circuit blood flow and may present with a variety of clinical symptoms or even be asymptomatic. The age and trigger for being diagnosed with CPSS varies from case to case.

Here, we report a case of 22qDS diagnosed as CPSS secondary to hypergalactosemia in the neonatal period. To the best of our knowledge, complications of these two diseases have never been reported.

### Unique case of pelvic congestion syndrome caused by a new communication branch of the portal-vena cava system [^c7323bbd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

In this case, we present a vascular malformation that is of subtype Abernethy Type II. This abnormality leads to the ovarian venous hypertension, producing blood reflux and tortuous dilatation of the veins, resulting in the patient's symptoms of PCS. To our knowledge, this is the first report, suggesting that extrahepatic portal shunts may be associated with PCS. The pathophysiological and hemodynamic changes that occur are not known and require further study. Abernethy malformation can cause liver hypoperfusion and abnormal shunt of the extrahepatic venous system. This results in various atypical clinical manifestations, while the symptoms of severe damage to liver function are not obvious. Therefore, Abernethy malformation is not easily detected and diagnosed. In our present case, the liver function was normal.

The use of transvascular interventional embolization in the treatment of type II Abernethy malformation has also been reported. Yamagami et al. performed embolization on a 6-year-old child with type II Abernethy malformation. The location of embolism was the inferior mesenteric vein- left internal iliac vein shunt. This treatment was clinically effective and minimally invasive. In this case, by embolization of the left OV and the anomalous traffic branch, the portal shunt, and the left OV-left renal vein-inferior vena cava vascular pathways were blocked, ensuring that no reflux occurred in either pathway. The patient no longer showed symptoms of PCS after the operation, which proved the effectiveness of our embolization treatment.

A thorough understanding of vascular anatomical differences can aid doctors in correctly diagnosing and treating patients as well as comprehending the connection between disease and vascular malformation. In interventional embolization, understanding these variations can guide clinicians in preventing complications. Therefore, a good knowledge of vascular variants is important for clinical work.

In conclusion, we share a case of PCS due to an anomalous traffic branch of the left OV converging into the portal vein. And the patient was cured by embolization of the distal left OV and flow restriction of the OV-portal vein access. We hope that the report of a case with a specific variant of abdominal vascularity will increase the knowledge of the anatomy of this region and contribute to clinical management.

### Cross-sectional imaging of congenital and acquired hepatic vascular abnormalities [^9a5652bd]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cross-sectional imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of both congenital and acquired hepatic vascular abnormalities. Congenital vascular anomalies, such as arteriovenous malformations, portal vein and hepatic vein anomalies, often present with nonspecific symptoms and require precise imaging for accurate assessment. Acquired hepatic vascular conditions, including cirrhosis-related vascular changes, portal hypertension, and vascular lesions, can lead to clinical complications and may necessitate timely intervention. Cross-sectional imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging offer detailed visualization of these abnormalities, aiding in the detection, characterization, and monitoring of disease progression. The integration of dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging techniques further enhances the ability to evaluate blood flow, vessel architecture, and the impact of vascular abnormalities on liver function. Early and accurate detection of both congenital and acquired hepatic vascular abnormalities through cross-sectional imaging is vital for optimizing patient outcomes, guiding therapeutic strategies, and preventing further complications.

### Developmental venous anomaly with an arteriovenous shunt and a thrombotic complication. case report [^6134a510]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) are common congenital variations of normal venous drainage that are known for their benign natural history. Isolated cases of symptomatic DVAs with associated arteriovenous (AV) shunts have recently been reported. The present case, in which thrombosis occurred in a DVA involving an AV shunt, raises intriguing questions regarding the clinical characteristics of these lesions and can be used to argue in favor of considering such lesions to be arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). A 39-year-old man presented with acute thrombosis in a complex system of anomalous hemispheric venous drainage, which included two distinct DVAs, one of which involved an AV shunt. The hemodynamic turbulences induced by a communication between shunted and normal venous outflows were the possible predisposing factor of the thrombosis. Follow-up angiographic and magnetic resonance images revealed complete recanalization of the thrombosed vessel and provided a thorough visualization of the particular angioarchitecture of the DVA. Acute thrombosis within a DVA with an AV shunt has not been reported previously and, thus, this case can be added to other reports of complications that arise in this particular type of DVA. The authors hypothesize that the presence of an AV shunt in a DVA is a risk factor for aggressive clinical behavior of the anomaly, rendering those lesions prone to complications similar to AVMs. Although no treatment can be offered, the presence of an AV shunt in a DVA warrants close follow-up observation because such lesions may represent a particular subtype of AVM and, therefore, may exhibit an aggressive clinical behavior.

### Venous-predominant parenchymal arteriovenous malformation: a rare subtype with a venous drainage pattern mimicking developmental venous anomaly [^ac67664d]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Object

Considerable confusion exists in the literature regarding the classification of cerebrovascular malformations and their clinical significance. One example is provided by the atypical developmental venous anomaly (DVA) with arteriovenous shunt, because it remains controversial whether these lesions should be classified as DVAs or as atypical cases of other subtypes of cerebrovascular malformations. The purpose of this study was to clarify the classification of these challenging vascular lesions in an effort to suggest an appropriate diagnosis and management strategy.

Methods

The authors present a series of 15 patients with intracranial vascular malformations that were angiographically classified as atypical DVAs with arteriovenous shunts. This type of vascular malformation shows a fine arterial blush without a distinct nidus and early filling of dilated medullary veins that drain these arterial components during the arterial phase on angiography. Those prominent medullary veins converge toward an enlarged main draining vein, which together form the caput medusae appearance of a typical DVA.

Results

Based on clinical, angiographic, surgical, and histological findings, the authors propose classifying these vascular malformations as a subtype of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), rather than as a variant of DVA or as a combined vascular malformation.

Conclusions

Correct recognition of this AVM subtype is required for its proper management, and its clinical behavior appears to follow that of a typical AVM. Gamma Knife radiosurgery appears to be a good alternative to resection, although long-term follow-up results require verification.

### Multistage closure of a congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt [^09b4ee13]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunts (CEPS), also known as Abernethy malformations, are rare shunts connecting the portal system proximal to its bifurcation with the supra-renal inferior vena cava (IVC) (Alonso-Gamarra et al.). CEPS are further divided into type I, an end-to-side shunt without intrahepatic portal system, and type II, a side-to-side shunt with an underdeveloped intrahepatic portal system, where both surgical and endovascular closure is feasible (Franchi-Abella et al.).

The portal blood bypass results in a liver perfusion disarrangement and an impaired first pass effect, responsible for the clinical spectrum in untreated CEPS which includes nodular liver disease, hyperammonemia, encephalopathy and hepatopulmonary syndrome. When complications are present closure is recommended, as CEPS spontaneous closure is uncommon (Baiges et al; Rajeswaran et al.).

Treatment selection is based on the risk of portal hypertension and shunt dimensions. A venography is performed, and the shunt temporarily occluded with a balloon to determine portal pressure before and after shunt occlusion. If portal pressure after shunt occlusion is above 24 mmHg or portal pressure gradient before/after shunt occlusion is above 9 mmHg a multistage closure must be selected due to the increased risk of portal hypertension. As for shunt dimensions, it's a subjective classification where a shunt is considered short length when the risk of non-target embolization and turbulent flow with standard coils or plugs precludes a safe procedure. Endovascular treatment is indicated for long length single stage closures, whereas short length shunts and multistage occlusions are preferentially surgically approached with ligation, clips placement, caval partition or banding, often in combination with endovascular treatment. (Baiges et al; Bruckheimer et al; Rajeswaran et al.).

We report a multistage occlusion of a short length CEPS occluded with an atrial septal defect plug in combination with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation, that was later occluded with a flow reductor stent and an amplatzer vascular plug II.

Portosystemic communications

Portosystemic shunting frequently occurs in patients with progressive liver fibrosis and is a reaction to the increased intrahepatic pressure gradient. Blood from the splenic and mesenteric circulation bypasses the liver by intrahepatic or extrahepatic portosystemic communications. A re-opened umbilical vein draining blood from the umbilical recess to the systemic circulation can be frequently encountered in children of all ages and is sensitively detected by US as there is no superimposition of gas. The umbilical vein runs superficially within the falciform ligament and can be identified as a tubular structure showing a monophasic hepatofugal flow (Fig. 1). A persisting ductus venosus is typically seen in neonatal hemochromatosis and other forms of diffuse neonatal liver disease. The ductus venosus is part of the fetal circulation, carrying blood from the umbilical vein via the portal recess to the venous confluence and normally closes shortly after birth (< 1 month in premature babies and < 2 weeks at term). The ductus venosus can be identified by color Doppler US (showing a high velocity hepatofugal flow pattern), as well as with other cross-sectional imaging modalities (Fig. 5). Extrahepatic portosystemic shunts may be difficult to depict with US due to their complexity and superimposition of bowel gas. Thickness of the lesser omentum and, more specifically, the left gastric vein (with size and direction of flow) should be assessed with a convex transducer, while perigastric and perisplenic varices can be depicted with a high-frequency probe. For full delineation of abdominal vessels and identification of atypical communications at intra- or extrahepatic sites, contrast-enhanced CT or MRI with multiplanar reconstructions are often superior. Four-dimensional flow MRI (4-D flow MRI) can be used for functional analyses without the use of contrast. Four-dimensional flow MRI is a relatively new 3-D, time-resolved phase contrast imaging technique that enables visualization and quantification of blood flow in the abdominal vasculature during a single examination (Fig. 1). The technique has been tested in a feasibility study of adults with cirrhosis to stratify their risk for bleeding from esophageal varices. Although in one study, direct identification of esophageal varices succeeded only in a few patients, a disproportionate portal venous flow (portal venous flow < sum of the flow in superior mesenteric vein and splenic vein) showed good performance in the prediction of esophageal varices at high risk of bleeding (sensitivity 100%, specificity 94%). Another study found a postprandial increase in flow rate in the azygos vein, which is known to be associated with esophageal varices.

### Rare venous connection causes severe cyanosis after the fontan operation [^700838c2]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

### Pulmonary hypertension in patients with congenital portosystemic venous shunt: a previously unrecognized association [^2156bf31]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary arterial hypertension has been reported to be observed in association with acquired portal hypertension. However, the contribution of congenital anomalies occurring in the portal system to the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension remains to be elucidated.

Methods

Nine patients with congenital portosystemic venous shunt were studied from January 1990 through September 2005.

Results

Patent ductus venosus was detected in 5 patients, including 3 patients with an absence of the portal vein. The presence of either a gastrorenal or splenorenal shunt was evident in another 4 patients. Six patients had a history of hypergalactosemia with normal enzyme activities, as seen during neonatal screening. Six (66.7%) of the 9 patients were identified to have clinically significant pulmonary arterial hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure: 34–79 mm Hg; pulmonary vascular resistances: 5.12–38.07 U). The median age at the onset of pulmonary arterial hypertension was 12 years and 3 months. Histologic studies of lung specimens, which were available in 4 of the 9 patients with congenital portosystemic venous shunt, showed small arterial microthrombotic lesions in 3 patients. This characteristic finding was recognized even in the congenital portosystemic venous shunt patients without PAH.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated thromboembolic pulmonary arterial hypertension to be a crucial complication in congenital portosystemic venous shunt, and this pathologic state may be latently present in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension of unknown etiology.

### Assessment of surgical portosystemic shunts and associated complications: the diagnostic and therapeutic role of radiologists [^8d0d9af8]. European Journal of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Surgical portosystemic shunting, the formation of a vascular connection between the portal and systemic venous circulation, has been used as a treatment to reduce portal venous pressure. Although the use of portosystemic shunt surgery in the management of portal hypertension has declined during the past decade in favour of alternative therapies, and subsequently surgeons and radiologists became less familiar with the procedure, it remains a well-established treatment. Knowledge of different types of surgical portosystemic shunts, their pathophysiology and complications will help radiologists improve communication with surgeons and enhance their understanding of the diagnostic and therapeutic role of radiology in the assessment and management of these shunts. Optimal assessment of the shunt is essential to determine its patency and allow timely intervention. Both non-invasive and invasive imaging modalities complement each other in the evaluation of surgical portosystemic shunts. Interventional radiology plays an important role in the management of complications, such as shunt thrombosis and stenosis. This article describes the various types of surgical portosystemic shunts, explains the anatomy and pathophysiology of these shunts, illustrates the pearls and pitfalls of different imaging modalities in the assessment of these shunts and demonstrates the role of radiologists in the interventional management of complications.

### Management and classification of type II congenital portosystemic shunts [^02052692]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital portosystemic shunts (PSS) with preserved intrahepatic portal flow (type II) present with a range of clinical signs. The indications for and benefits of repair of PSS remain incompletely understood. A more comprehensive classification may also benefit comparative analyses from different institutions.

Methods

All children treated at our institution for type II congenital PSS from 1999 through 2009 were reviewed for presentation, treatment, and outcome.

Results

Ten children (7 boys) with type II PSS were identified at a median age of 5.5 years. Hyperammonemia with varying degrees of neurocognitive dysfunction occurred in 80%. The shunt arose from a branch of the portal vein (type IIa; n = 2), from the main portal vein (type IIb; n = 7), or from a splenic or mesenteric vein (type IIc; n = 1). Management included operative ligation (n = 6), endovascular occlusion (n = 3), or a combined approach (n = 1). Shunt occlusion was successful in all cases. Serum ammonia decreased from 130 ± 115 μmol/L preoperatively to 31 ± 15 μmol/L postoperatively (P = 0.03). Additional benefits included resolution of neurocognitive dysfunction (n = 3), liver nodules (n = 1), and vaginal bleeding (n = 1).

Conclusion

Correction of type II PSS relieves a wide array of symptoms. Surgery is indicated for patients with clinically significant shunting. A refined classification system will permit future comparison of patients with similar physiology.

### Impact of portal flow on the prognosis of children with congenital portosystemic shunt: a multicentric observation study in Japan [^deb9910b]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSSs) are increasingly being recognized, the optimal treatment strategies and natural prognosis remain unclear, as individual CPSSs show different phenotypes.

Methods

The medical records of 122 patients who were diagnosed with CPSSs at 15 participating hospitals in Japan between 2000 and 2019 were collected for a retrospective analysis based on the state of portal vein (PV) visualization on imaging.

Results

Among the 122 patients, 75 (61.5%) showed PV on imaging. The median age at the diagnosis was 5 months. The main complications related to CPSS were hyperammonemia (85.2%), liver masses (25.4%), hepatopulmonary shunts (13.9%), and pulmonary hypertension (11.5%). The prevalence of complications was significantly higher in patients without PV visualization than in those with PV visualization (P < 0.001). Overall, 91 patients (74.6%) received treatment, including shunt closure by surgery or interventional radiology (n = 82) and liver transplantation (LT) or liver resection (n = 9). Over the past 20 years, there has been a decrease in the number of patients undergoing LT. Although most patients showed improvement or reduced progression of symptoms, liver masses and pulmonary hypertension were less likely to improve after shunt closure. Complications related to shunt closure were more likely to occur in patients without PV visualization (P = 0.001). In 25 patients (20.5%) without treatment, those without PV visualization were significantly more likely to develop complications related to CPSS than those with PV visualization (P = 0.011).

Conclusion

Patients without PV visualization develop CPSS-related complications and, early treatment using prophylactic approaches should be considered, even if they are asymptomatic.

### Portal venous remodeling after endovascular reduction of pediatric autogenous portosystemic shunts [^5fe0fe8d]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with autogenous native vessel portosystemic shunts, whether surgical or congenital, may experience complications of excess shunt flow, including hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), hepatic encephalopathy (HE), and hepatic insufficiency. The authors explored endovascular reduction or occlusion of autogenous portosystemic shunts using methods commonly employed in transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) reduction in four pediatric patients. Before treatment, the patients had hypoplastic, atrophic, or thrombosed portal veins. Following intervention, symptoms of overshunting resolved or improved in all patients without major complications. The innate plasticity of the pediatric portal venous system allowed for hypertrophy or development and maturation of cavernous transformations to accommodate increased hepatopetal blood flow and pressure.

### Congenital portosystemic shunt occlusion with an amplatzer PFO occlusion device: a case report [^d814e09d]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital portosystemic shunts are embryological malformations in which portal venous flow is diverted to the systemic circulation. High morbidity and mortality are seen in patients with concurrent hepatic encephalopathy, hepatopulmonary syndrome, and pulmonary hypertension. Endovascular therapy, in the correct patient population, offers a less invasive method of treatment with rapid relief of symptoms.

Case Presentation

In this report, we discuss the treatment of a two-year-old male with abnormal chorea-like movements, altered mental status, anisocoria and hyperammonemia diagnosed with an intrahepatic congenital portosystemic shunt between the inferior vena cava and right portal vein. Given the patient's amenable anatomy and shunt type, embolization was performed with an 18 mm Amplatzer patent foramen ovale occlusion device.

Conclusions

Portosystemic shunts are a rare congenital abnormality without universal treatment guidelines. An Amplatzer PFO occlusion device can provide a novel method of shunt closure given appropriate shunt type, size and anatomy.

Classifications of hepatic vascular anomalies

The new classifications of vascular anomalies have recently become widely accepted. Abnormal communication can occur between all the three hepatic vascular systems and some other very rare hepatic anomalies can also be detected by US:
Arterio-portal shunt
Porto-hepatic (intra and extrahepatic) shunt
Arterio-hepatic shunt
Porto-portal shunt
Veno-venosus shunt
Portal vein aneurysm
Hepatic web (IVC)
Vascular hepatic masses

Infantile hepatic hemangioma (IHH) is the most frequent anomaly representing a spectrum of hepatic vascular tumors. The recent classification should be used because of the prognostic and therapeutic consequences of the findings. Three categories are suggested: focal, multifocal and diffuse lesions. The association of IHH with superficial hemangiomas in various locations can occur and its prevalence is debatable (approximately 10–47%). Differentiation of IHH from hepatoblastoma can usually be made based on clinical and imaging/US findings and by elevated AFP in hepatoblastoma (in 90% of the cases).

In addition, several hepatic vascular variants can be detected incidentally without abnormal communications of the vessels. Some of these lesions can be appreciated by B-mode US (portal and hepatic veins), hepatic artery variations mainly depicted by CTA/MRA or angiography.

The acquired vascular hepatic lesions can be detected less frequently in the pediatric age, often associated to surgical or interventional procedures (e.g. surgical shunts, arterio-portal shunts after biopsy, portal or hepatic vein thrombosis, hepatic veno-occlusive disease, etc.).

The imaging of pediatric vascular anomalies

US and MR are the basic imaging methods in the work up of hepatic vascular disorders. Most of the hepatic lesions can be detected and characterized by US methods: B-mode US, color Doppler, duplex Doppler should be used. The extent of the lesions, types of vessels, and often the communication of the vascular structures can be analysed by Doppler. Spectrum Doppler evaluation, especially in small babies, is difficult or sometimes impossible. However, using proper methodology in experienced hands the diagnosis can be established by US. In the future, contrast enhanced US (CE-US) may also play role in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of pediatric hepatic anomalies, and CEUS can also depict perfusion changes non-invasively.

Collateralisation and arteriovenous malformations

Patients with a significant impendence to flow due to resistance within the Fontan circuit may decompress through arterial or venous collaterals to the lower pressure pulmonary veins or left atrium. Venous collaterals may develop in several locations including the bronchial veins and the venae cavae as well as between the upper-limb veins and pulmonary venous system. Collaterals forming in these areas result in right-to-left shunts, which serve to naturally lower the pressure within the Fontan circuit in order to maintain ventricular preload. These patients are also at increased risk of developing pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Lack of hepatic venous effluent and the slow non-pulsatile flow state of the Fontan circuit are both considered to be underlying mechanisms in their formation. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations can occur even before Fontan circuit completion, when the superior cavopulmonary anastomosis is formed due to unilateral hepatic venous flow from caval offset. The primary consequence is decreased systemic oxygen saturation due to right-to-left shunting. Both MRI and CT angiography are excellent in depicting the presence, course, and severity of collateral vessels. CT may demonstrate dilated pulmonary vessels, which extend to the periphery of the lung. Maximum intensity projections (MIPs) using multiplanar reformats aid in visualisation and localisation of collaterals and arteriovenous malformations on CT. Contrast-enhanced MRI angiography acquired as a dynamic sequential sequence may demonstrate vessels better than CT (Fig. 15). Flow quantification from shunts by collaterals and arteriovenous malformations can reliably be assessed with through-plane PC MRI.

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^89aed74b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Budd–Chiari syndrome (BCS) — interventional vascular therapies and outcomes: Endovascular interventions aim to decompress the hepatic sinusoids by restoring adequate hepatic venous outflow, with thrombolysis, balloon angioplasty and/or stenting for recanalization and TIPS creating an intrahepatic shunt. Systemic or arterially delivered thrombolytic agents are ineffective in BCS, whereas local infusion into the hepatic vein and/or IVC can potentially be effective when combined with balloon angioplasty; hepatic vein angioplasty with or without stenting is beneficial in a small subset with short-segment hepatic vein stenosis but long-term success is limited to about a third. In a multicenter European study including 157 patients with BCS, 39.5% underwent TIPS and, of these, only 6.45% required a liver transplant while only 2% underwent surgical shunting; in another study, 60% failed medical therapy and underwent rescue TIPS, but the majority of patients (60%) developed late TIPS dysfunction and required TIPS revision. The routine use of polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stents has significantly reduced the incidence of TIPS dysfunction, and when TIPS is not technically feasible due to complete hepatic vein obstruction, ultrasound-guided DIPS connecting the portal vein and IVC may be an acceptable alternative.

### Vascular liver disorders, portal vein thrombosis, and procedural bleeding in patients with liver disease: 2020 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^543c5522]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO) in children — also referred to as cavernous transformation of the PV — is believed to be an acquired lesion subsequent to postnatal events including umbilical vein catheterization, omphalitis, and de novo thrombosis, and liver function is always preserved unless EHPVO occurs with an accompanying coexistent primary liver disorder. Evidence suggests that early intervention with restoration of portal blood flow confers an advantage, and delayed reconstruction may be detrimental to the final outcome. The meso-Rex bypass has been established as the primary and preferred surgical correction for EHPVO, with portosystemic shunting with either a distal splenorenal shunt or a meso-caval shunt indicated if the meso-Rex bypass is anatomically not possible. Given advancing confidence in the meso-Rex bypass, corrective surgery should be considered in asymptomatic children to prevent the development of portal hypertension complications and downstream sequelae, and evaluation and surgical treatment should be in hospitals with expertise in hepatobiliary surgical care and transplantation in children.

### Spontaneous portosystemic shunts in liver cirrhosis: new approaches to an old problem [^90e183e0]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The development of SPSS seems also to have implications on liver function. Kumamoto et al. proposed the term "portosystemic shunt syndrome" referring to a significant reduction of hepatic reserve (reflected by progression of Child–Pugh score) over 5 years, as compared with patients with cirrhosis and PH without gastrorenal shunts. Saad et al. based on this concept, described a complete syndrome with clinical manifestations and imaging findingsthat developed in three phases: (1) early stage, characterized by few episodes of HE and relatively well-preserved liver function; (2) late stage, in which overt HE is more frequent and liver function starts to deteriorate; radiological signs include incipient liver atrophy, disappearance of portal branches and the possibility of portal thrombosis; in the main portal vein, the hepatopetal flow becomes sluggish; and (3) end stage, in which HE is markedly disabling, the patient has advanced liver failure and portal thrombosis or liver atrophy are easier to find; portal flow can reverse and become hepatofugal. Thus, despite the fact that a SPSS is initially a compensatory mechanism, as PH progresses, the shunt increases in size, worsening the bypass effect and contributing to the deterioration of liver function.

Paraumbilical shunts deserve a special mention. Their development occurs due to the expansion of paraumbilical veins, normally collapsed, located at the falciform ligament. When they are the only SPSS present, significant blood volume circulates through the portal vein with hepatopetal direction. However, these characteristics do not imply an effective portal perfusion and do not confer a protective role: as other SPSSs, paraumbilical veins are specially identified as liver function deteriorates. –

### Portal anatomic variants relevant to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt [^8d2c8cb7]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation is an accepted treatment for portal hypertension. TIPS creation remains a challenging procedure because it involves the successful passage of a needle from a point of origin (hepatic vein) to a target point (portal vein) through the liver substance. An understanding of the anatomy of these two vascular beds facilitates overcoming the challenge of the spatial relationship between these two points. In this article the authors review the vascular and parenchymal anatomic variations, both congenital and acquired that impact the success of TIPS creation.

### The putative role of the venous system in the genesis of vascular malformations [^25f75c9c]. Neurosurgical Focus (2009). Low credibility.

Recent clinical and experimental evidence has challenged the traditional concept of the venous system as a "passive" element in the genesis and evolution of intracranial vascular malformations. The authors review the clinical and experimental evidence linking the venous system and its anomalies to the genesis of various intracranial vascular malformations, including dural arteriovenous fistulas, cavernous malformations, parenchymal arteriovenous malformations, and capillary telangiectasia. They also describe the potential significance of different associations of these vascular anomalies.

### Hepatic portal venous gas: the ABCs of management… [^7088687f]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

A frontal plain abdominal radiograph obtained in the supine position demonstrates distended loops of bowel and extensive hepatic portal venous gas. This finding was missed on the initial read of the plain radiograph. Axial and coronal views of contrast-enhanced computed tomographic images of the liver with extensive hepatic portal venous gas. Hepatic portal venous gas in a patient with peritonitis is an ominous finding with a potentially fatal outcome that warrants immediate emergency surgery. While the pathophysiology of HPVG is, as yet, unclear, changing abdominal imaging technology has altered the significance of this radiologic finding. Hepatic portal venous gas therefore predicts high risk of mortality if detected by plain radiography or by CT in a patient with additional evidence of necrotic bowel. If detected by CT in patients after surgical or endoscopic manipulation, the clinician is advised that there is no evidence of increased risk.

If HPVG is detected by CT in patients with active peptic ulcer disease, intestinal obstruction and/or dilatation, or mucosal diseases such as Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis, caution is warranted, as risk of death may approach 20% to 30%. Hepatic portal venous gas therefore remains an ominous sign in the specific context of bowel ischemia or necrosis. To this effect, a management algorithm is proposed in Figure 4 and is summarized by the mnemonic "ABC. " Urgent laparotomy is recommended for patients in whom HPVG is detected by CT with concurrent signs of bowel necrosis or ischemia and patients in whom HPVG is detected by plain abdominal radiograph, as decades of study have demonstrated serious risks, with mortality approximated at 75% for both groups.

Patients with more equivocal presentation and HPVG — mucosal disruption, bowel distention, abscesses, or gastric ulcers, as examples — should be monitored intensely with a reduced threshold for surgical correction under appropriate conditions. These patients may be at risk for mortality as high 20% to 30%, based on the Liebman et al5 and Kinoshita et al6 studies. Case 2 exemplifies the difficulty of HPVG observed in a patient with ambiguous findings. This patient was successfully managed conservatively, despite the fact that HPVG would have once been an indication for laparotomy.

### Pathomechanisms of symptomatic developmental venous anomalies [^7c239517]. Stroke (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although it is generally accepted that developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) are benign vascular malformations, over the past years, we have seen patients with symptomatic DVAs. Therefore, we performed a retrospective study and a literature study to review how, when, and why DVAs can become clinically significant.

Methods

Charts and angiographic films of 17 patients with DVAs whose 18 vascular symptoms could be attributed to a DVA were selected from a neurovascular databank of our hospital. MRI had to be available to rule out any other associated disease. In the literature, 51 cases of well-documented symptomatic DVAs were found. Pathomechanisms were divided into mechanical and flow-related causes.

Results

Mechanical (obstructive or compressive) pathomechanisms accounted for 14 of 69 symptomatic patients resulting in hydrocephalus or nerve compression syndromes. Flow-related pathomechanisms (49 of 69 patients) could be subdivided into complications resulting from an increase of flow into the DVA (owing to an arteriovenous shunt using the DVA as the drainage route; n = 19) or a decrease of outflow (n = 26) or a remote shunt with increased venous pressure (n = 4) leading to symptoms of venous congestion. In 6 cases, no specific pathomechanisms were detected.

Conclusions

Although DVAs should be considered benign, under rare circumstances, they can be symptomatic. DVAs, as extreme variations of normal venous drainage, may represent a more fragile venous drainage system that can be more easily affected by in- and outflow alterations. The integrity of the DVA needs to be preserved irrespective of the treatment that should be tailored to the specific pathomechanism.

Glenn shunts — cavopulmonary connections are described as follows: a Glenn shunt is a palliative operation to increase pulmonary blood flow and systemic oxygen saturation via direct anastomosis between the superior vena cava and the pulmonary artery without causing systemic ventricle volume overload; the classic Glenn procedure anastomoses the superior vena cava to the distal divided right pulmonary artery so the superior vena cava is the only systemic venous return to the right lung, and acquired pulmonary arteriovenous malformations with systemic arterial desaturation are a common long-term complication due to absence of hepatic factors to the right lung; the bidirectional Glenn shunt (bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis [BDCPA]) is an end-to-side anastomosis of the divided superior vena cava to the undivided right pulmonary artery directing superior vena cava blood to both lungs, with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations absent in this configuration.

### Portosystemic shunt placement reveals blood signatures for the development of hepatic encephalopathy through mass spectrometry [^54f0e074]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of advanced liver disease, with up to 30–40% of patients developing this neurological condition as their disease progresses. The phenotype of HE can vary widely from mild cognitive impairment to more serious symptoms such as disorientation and coma. While the etiology of HE is complex, the most prevalent theory of its pathophysiology is the inability of dysfunctional hepatocytes to process enteric neurotoxins that accumulate within the splanchnic circulation, allowing them to enter the systemic circulation, and precipitate cerebral inflammation and cerebral edema.

Due to the elevated pressure within the portal venous system and resultant hepatofugal flow in the cirrhotic liver, extrahepatic collateral blood vessels known as varices form to allow for portal blood return to the vena cavae and the systemic circulation. Porto-hepatic venous collaterals, or intrahepatic shunts, can also form, although efforts to characterize this phenomenon have been sparse –. The presence of these extrahepatic and intrahepatic shunts alters toxin circulation, decreases toxin metabolism in the liver, and contributes to hepatic encephalopathy.

In severe liver disease with refractory ascites or variceal bleeding, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement is a therapeutic intervention that can reduce pathologies caused by portal hypertension. With TIPS, a synthetic shunt connects the portal venous system to the hepatic venous system, such that some blood can bypass the cirrhotic liver and reduce portal hypertension and its sequelae. Although TIPS can significantly improve the morbidity and mortality of patients with cirrhosis and increase transplant-free survival, TIPS placement is also a known risk factor for the development of HE and, thus, preexisting HE is a relative contraindication to TIPS placement. TIPS can increase the incidence of HE by 30–55% post-procedure, with 90% of affected patients developing it within the first three months –.

While the association between TIPS placement and HE exacerbation is well-documented, the mechanism is poorly understood. Ammonia level is usually associated with HE, but studies examining ammonia level and HE development are conflicting. The association is highly dependent on the chronicity of hyperammonemia and varies greatly in outcome and thus levels are not typically followed clinically –. Therefore, neurotoxic compounds beyond ammonia likely contribute to HE. Microbial products such as aromatic amino acids and bile acids (BAs) are candidate neurotoxins, but it is still unclear which microbial products or metabolites induce HE onset and how TIPS placement affects the concentration of these compounds within the systemic circulation.

We then hypothesized that participants who develop more severe HE have less intrahepatic shunting at the time of their TIPS. To test this hypothesis, we compared the shift in metabolome within each participant before and after the TIPS procedure. In this analysis, those who already have significant intrahepatic shunting should have a low dissimilarity between their pre- and post-TIPS hepatic vein plasma metabolome, while those who have less shunting should have a higher dissimilarity. Within-participant dissimilarities between pre- and post-peripheral vein metabolome did not show any difference based on HE grade (Fig. 2c). Serendipitously, within-participant dissimilarities between pre- and post-hepatic vein metabolome are significantly different between participants with an HE grade of 0 versus participants with a grade of 1 or 2+ (Wilcoxon P = 0.027 and P = 0.036, respectively, Fig. 2d), despite no overall difference in hepatic vein blood metabolome before and after TIPS (Fig. 1b). This difference is also consistent when we remove HE grade 1 (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). This change in the hepatic vein metabolome based on HE grade suggests that individuals with more dissimilarity in their metabolome after shunt placement, likely from a lack of pre-TIPS intrahepatic shunting, are at a higher risk of developing HE after the procedure (Fig. 2e).
