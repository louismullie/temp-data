## Question

Can pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy be used to treat autism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) can be used to treat autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what PERT is actually indicated for and how it works in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Then, I should verify what ASD is and whether its pathobiology would plausibly respond to a gastrointestinal enzyme therapy. Next, I will check the corpus for any trials or guidelines linking PERT to ASD, being careful not to conflate other gastrointestinal hormones or therapies with PERT. After that, I should assess biological plausibility and, finally, consider comorbid scenarios where ASD and EPI might coexist, including dosing, monitoring, and safety so I do not overextend indications beyond the evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core: PERT is a treatment for EPI that supplies lipase, protease, and amylase to correct maldigestion; it is recommended as first-line therapy in EPI by multisociety European guidelines and the AGA clinical practice update, with the explicit therapeutic aim of improving fat and protein absorption, nutritional status, and maldigestion symptoms, not neurobehavioral outcomes [^112JEQd1] [^1135cB4F] [^112bWh4V].

> I need to check the nature of ASD itself; ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition defined by differences in social communication and restricted, repetitive behaviors, and while GI symptoms can co-occur, expert consensus emphasizes providing standard GI care when indicated, not ASD-specific GI enzyme interventions to modify core ASD features.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does any trial or guideline in the corpus actually evaluate or recommend PERT for ASD? I will now examine the documents: I see no RCTs, guidelines, or expert reviews endorsing PERT for treating ASD; the only related item is an older Cochrane review showing that intravenous secretin, a hormone that stimulates pancreatic secretion, is ineffective for ASD, and secretin is not a pancreatic enzyme replacement product, so I should not conflate it with PERT.

> Hmm, wait a minute — at first glance I wondered if secretin might be a form of enzyme therapy relevant to PERT; wait, let me verify and correct that thinking: secretin is a gastrointestinal hormone, not a porcine-derived pancreatic enzyme formulation, and the negative secretin evidence in ASD does not imply any benefit of PERT for ASD, nor does any plausible pathway suggest that luminal enzyme supplementation would alter neurodevelopmental trajectories [^116AFKBV].

> Next, I should review biological plausibility: PERT acts in the intestinal lumen to aid digestion and absorption, and its treatment success is measured by reductions in steatorrhea, weight gain, and fat-soluble vitamin repletion; there is no mechanism here to directly modify central nervous system development or the core behavioral phenotype of ASD, which argues strongly against PERT as an ASD therapy [^112hLW4j] [^111uk4co] [^112bWh4V].

> But wait, what if an individual with ASD also has documented EPI — for example, due to chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic cancer, or post-pancreatic surgery? In that case, I should confirm that PERT is indicated for the EPI itself and dosed per guidelines (commonly starting at 40,000 USP lipase units with meals in adults, half with snacks), with response tracking by symptom reduction, weight/muscle gains, and vitamin normalization; treating EPI in such a comorbid scenario may improve nutrition and GI symptoms but does not treat ASD [^112MQHfb] [^114mJDtk] [^112BHB2r].

> I should double-check safety considerations so we do not inadvertently cause harm while chasing a non-indicated outcome; chronic high-dose pancreatic enzyme exposure has been associated with fibrosing colonopathy and colonic strictures, and overdosing can produce hyperuricosuria or hyperuricemia, so PERT should not be used outside established EPI indications and dose limits [^112Vzx1X] [^114jo67z].

> Let me reconsider the totality of evidence and make the conclusion explicit: there is no evidence base supporting PERT for ASD, no biologically plausible mechanism by which luminal enzyme replacement would modify ASD, and authoritative EPI guidelines and ASD GI consensus do not endorse PERT for ASD; if EPI coexists with ASD, PERT is appropriate for EPI per standard guidelines, but this treats maldigestion and nutritional deficits, not the core features of autism [^112bWh4V] [^111uk4co] [^117ELN9b] [^116AFKBV].

---

Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is **not supported** for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the absence of confirmed exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) [^117ELN9b]. There is **no evidence** that PERT improves core ASD symptoms or behavior. PERT is indicated only for EPI [^111uk4co] due to conditions such as cystic fibrosis [^113uocDr], chronic pancreatitis [^114DcVC8], or pancreatic cancer [^1145YVcc] [^112bWh4V]. Routine use in ASD is not recommended; any consideration should occur under medical supervision with confirmed EPI [^1135cB4F].

---

## Rationale for considering PERT in autism

The rationale for PERT in ASD posits that GI symptoms may stem from maldigestion/malabsorption due to subclinical EPI and that improving digestion could reduce GI symptoms and indirectly improve behavior. However, this hypothesis **lacks direct evidence** [^117ELN9b], and PERT is only indicated [^111uk4co] for confirmed EPI [^112bWh4V].

---

## Evidence supporting or refuting PERT in autism

There is **no robust evidence** that PERT improves core ASD symptoms or behavior [^117ELN9b]. Available data are limited to anecdotal reports and small, methodologically weak studies, with no large RCTs or systematic reviews supporting its use in ASD. Additionally, a small open-label study (n = 9) with CEL mutations reported GI symptom improvement and weight gain with PERT, but **no change in neurological or behavioral outcomes** [^113zJxX1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines **do not recommend** the use of PERT for ASD without confirmed EPI [^117ELN9b]. PERT is indicated for EPI due to chronic pancreatitis [^114DcVC8], cystic fibrosis [^113uocDr], pancreatic cancer [^1145YVcc], or pancreatic surgery [^111uk4co] [^112bWh4V].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

PERT is generally safe when used appropriately; however, **high doses** can cause fibrosing colonopathy [^112Vzx1X], especially in children with cystic fibrosis. Additional risks include hyperuricosuria, hyperuricemia [^114jo67z], and GI symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain) [^112Vzx1X]. These risks outweigh any unproven benefit in ASD without EPI.

---

## Current research gaps and future directions

There is a **lack of high-quality evidence** on PERT in ASD [^117ELN9b]. Future research should include well-designed RCTs to assess efficacy and safety in ASD with confirmed EPI and to identify ASD subgroups with true EPI who might benefit from PERT.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

PERT is **not supported** for ASD without confirmed EPI. There is no evidence that it improves core ASD symptoms or behavior, and it should not be used in this context. Clinicians should confirm EPI before prescribing PERT [^111uk4co] and monitor for adverse effects [^112Vzx1X].

### Relationship of initial pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy dose with weight gain in infants with cystic fibrosis [^114BgWeF]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Optimal pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) dosing is essential to minimize malabsorption and maximize growth in children with cystic fibrosis. Clinical data are still lacking on the best dose of PERT to achieve recommended weight goals.

We found a linear relationship between initial dose and attainment of favorable changes in weight-for-age z score and weight-for-length percentile at age 2 years. Specifically, an initial PERT dose of ≥ 1500 lipase units/kg/largest meal resulted in an increased likelihood of attaining favorable weight-related outcomes.

Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is present in 85% to 90% of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and is the primary challenge to achieving adequate nutrition in CF. Multiple studies report that early growth of children with CF is a significant predictor of lung function, morbidity, and survival. A high-fat, high-protein diet along with PERT is recommended to meet energy demands and achieve optimal weight gain, growth, and development.

The determination of optimal PERT dosing is essential to minimize malabsorption and help attain the goal of maximizing growth of children with CF. Clinical data are, however, still lacking on the optimal dose of PERT to achieve recommended weight goals. The recommendations for PERT dosing were made in the mid-1990s in response to the recognition that excessively high doses were associated with the development of fibrosing colonopathy.

### Timing of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in cystic fibrosis [^115EtxkR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive, life-limiting, multisystem disease affecting over 70,000 individuals worldwide. Between 80% and 90% of people with CF suffer from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which, if left untreated, leads to a poor nutritional status. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has been shown to be effective in improving nutritional status and is subsequently associated with improved lung function. However, the timings of PERT administration in relation to a meal are subjective and not standardized, meaning that variations in the timing of PERT dosing persist.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective of the review is to compare the efficacy (fat absorption) and effectiveness (nutritional status, lung function, and quality of life) of different PERT dosing strategies in terms of timing of administration for treating dietary malabsorption in all individuals with CF.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. The date of the last search was 24 June 2021. We also searched ongoing trials registers on 09 July 2021.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cross-over RCTs with a minimum washout period of two weeks, and quasi-RCTs of PERT dosing regimens in people (of any age) with CF.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed and screened the studies identified from the searches.

### Proper usage of pancreatic enzymes [^115UaAUc]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

With the recognition of the close link between nutritional status and pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis (CF), treatment and prevention of malnutrition have become a major focus in the modern therapeutic approach for patients with CF. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy thereby plays a central role. This article reviews key publications on important aspects of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy contained in the literature over the last 12 months.

New insights into the pathogenesis of exocrine pancreatic disease, efficacy and dosing of pancreatic enzyme preparations, occurrence of fibrosing colonopathy, enzyme replacement in the context of enteral nutrition, and assessment of pancreatic function are addressed.

### Treatment of pancreatic exocrine deficiency [^116DZcRH]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

In treating pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, the diagnosis of a cause, wherever possible, is a first step. If there is an obstructing lesion, then its relief may be curative. Adequate management depends on dietary manipulation and enzyme replacement. A reduction in fat intake, with accentuation of protein and carbohydrate consumption, is recommended. For enzyme replacement, enteric-coated microspheres are required, taken with adequate acid-suppression using a proton-pump inhibitor. The enzyme supplements, using standard preparations of pancreatin, usually of porcine source, may be as much as 4 to 8 tablets per meal and should be taken with food. Endocrine insufficiency usually requires insulin.

### Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for people with cystic fibrosis [^113uocDr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Most people with cystic fibrosis (CF) (80% to 90%) require pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) to prevent malnutrition. Enzyme preparations must be taken with food, and the dose needs to be adjusted according to the food consumed. A systematic review on the efficacy and safety of PERT is necessary to guide clinical practice due to variability between centers in the assessment of pancreatic function, timing of treatment initiation, dose, and choice of supplements. This is an updated version of a published review.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PERT in children and adults with CF and to compare the efficacy and safety of different formulations of PERT and their appropriateness in various age groups. Additionally, the review aims to compare the effects of PERT in CF according to different diagnostic subgroups, such as different ages at the introduction of therapy and different categories of pancreatic function.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, which includes references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and hand searches of relevant journals and conference abstract books. The most recent search was conducted on 07 November 2019. We also searched ongoing trials websites and the websites of pharmaceutical companies manufacturing pancreatic enzyme replacements for any additional trials, with the most recent search on 26 December 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials in individuals of any age with CF and receiving PERT at any dosage.

### Management of chronic pancreatitis: Recent advances and future prospects [^113JV7oj]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy has been a standard therapy to prevent maldigestion, malnutrition, and excessive weight loss in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) since the first decade of the 21st century. Since 2010, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have focused on evaluating the efficacy of pancreatin in the form of delayed-release capsules and enteric-coated mini-microspheres. In 2020, a phase I, open-label, randomized, crossover trial focusing on the bioavailability of a pancreatic enzyme product revealed a significant increase in lipase, chymotrypsin, and amylase released into the duodenum after the uptake of the pancreatin product with meals, compared with the ingestion of meals alone. A post hoc analysis of 15 trials showed that pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) could significantly improve fat absorption and mal-digestive symptoms with long-term administration. Besides, two meta-analyses in 2016 and 2017 revealed that PERT could improve the nutritional status of CP patients, but these studies came to opposite conclusions regarding the pain-relieving effect of PERT.

As for the application status of PERT, a cross-sectional observational study involving 1006 patients with CP from Europe showed that only 64% of the patients were correctly treated with PERT. Furthermore, a mixed-methods study in East China revealed that the rate of good adherence to PERT was only 12.8%. These studies indicate that the application status of standardized treatment with PERT is not yet satisfactory.

At the time of writing, most pancreatic enzyme products are oral delayed-release and recommended to be taken with meals.

### Relationship of initial pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy dose with weight gain in infants with cystic fibrosis [^114hBfo1]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Previously published studies evaluating PERT dosing used older preparations, were generally performed on small numbers of patients, and had important methodological weaknesses. For example, a CFF Registry study of 1,215 patients older than four years from 33 US CF centers that was published in 2005 found no association between PERT dose and growth or gastrointestinal symptoms. The findings of that analysis were, however, likely confounded by indication bias, an important pitfall when observational databases and registries are used to evaluate the association between therapies and outcomes. Clinicians often prescribe higher doses or additional therapies to patients whose condition is more severe, so naïve analyses of observational data may find the apparent effectiveness of evidence-based therapies to be dampened, lost, or even apparently reversed.

Multivariable modeling may adjust for indication bias if all indications for treatment are measured and recorded, but residual confounding will occur when modeling is unable to adjust for undocumented influences on prescribing. Novel techniques have been proposed to eliminate confounding by undocumented indication, but indication bias remains an important challenge to comparative effectiveness research. Haupt et al. used CFF Patient Registry data to investigate the association between PERT dosing and body mass index (BMI) percentile in patients aged 2 to 20 years, using CF center practice as the unit of analysis to avoid indication bias. They found a higher adjusted median PERT dose prescribed at centers in the highest quartile for BMI compared with lower quartiles.

### Regenerative medicine and cell-based approaches to restore pancreatic function [^114LE1d2]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). High credibility.

The pancreas is a complex organ with exocrine and endocrine components. Many pathologies impair exocrine function, including chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Conversely, when the endocrine pancreas fails to secrete sufficient insulin, patients develop diabetes mellitus. Pathology in either the endocrine or exocrine pancreas results in devastating economic and personal consequences. The standard therapy for treating patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus is daily exogenous insulin injections, but cell sources of insulin provide superior glycemic regulation, and research is now focused on the goal of regenerating or replacing β cells.

Stem-cell-based models might be useful to study exocrine pancreatic disorders, and mesenchymal stem cells or secreted factors might delay disease progression. Although the standards that bioengineered cells must meet before being considered a viable therapy are not yet established, any potential therapy must be acceptably safe and functionally superior to existing therapies. Here, we describe progress and challenges in cell-based methods to restore pancreatic function, with a focus on optimizing the site for cell delivery and decreasing requirements for immunosuppression through encapsulation. We also discuss the tools and strategies being used to generate exocrine pancreas and insulin-producing β-cell surrogates in situ and highlight obstacles to clinical application.

### Dasiglucagon for the treatment of congenital hyperinsulinism: A randomized phase 3 trial in infants and children [^112xCTu5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a rare condition with an estimated incidence ranging from approximately 1:2,500 to 1:50,000. In CHI, pancreatic β-cells secrete insulin irrespective of blood glucose concentration, resulting in persistent and often severe hypoglycemia in neonates and early childhood. This can lead to brain damage, seizures, and neurodevelopmental impairment in the absence of timely diagnosis and effective treatment.

CHI can be acquired or genetic, with both forms associated with an adverse impact on neurodevelopment in up to 50% of patients. Other forms of neonatal hyperinsulinism tend to be transient in nature and are often associated with perinatal stress or maternal gestational diabetes. The genetic forms can be single gene defects with symptoms related predominantly to hypoglycemia secondary to hyperinsulinism, or they may occur as part of a syndrome in which hypoglycemia secondary to hyperinsulinism is only one manifestation of the syndrome. At the time of writing, a number of genes have been identified that cause hyperinsulinism, with many involved in the insulin secretory pathway. The genetic forms of CHI are generally classified as either focal, diffuse, or atypical according to histology.

Treatments for CHI include pharmacotherapy, nutritional support, and surgical management. At present, the potassium channel activator diazoxide is the only approved drug for the treatment of hyperinsulinism. However, this drug is ineffective in patients with inactivating mutations in the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, who represent the largest proportion of patients.

### Practical guide to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency - Breaking the myths [^113LrxTZ]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is characterized by a deficiency of exocrine pancreatic enzymes, resulting in malabsorption. Numerous conditions account for the etiology of EPI, with the most common being diseases of the pancreatic parenchyma including chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, and a history of extensive necrotizing acute pancreatitis. Treatment for EPI includes dietary management, lifestyle changes (i.e. decrease in alcohol consumption and smoking cessation), and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.

- **Discussion**: Many diagnostic tests are available to diagnose EPI; however, the criteria of choice remain unclear, and the causes for a false-positive test are not yet understood. Despite multiple studies on the treatment of EPI using exogenous pancreatic enzymes, there remains confusion among medical practitioners with regard to the best approach to diagnose EPI, as well as dosing and administration of pancreatic enzymes.

- **Summary**: Appropriate use of diagnostics and treatment approaches using pancreatic enzymes in EPI is essential for patients. This opinion piece aims to address the existing myths, remove the confusion, and function as a practical guide to the diagnosis and treatment of EPI.

### Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in subjects with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and diabetes mellitus: a real-life, case-control study [^111niMmY]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). High credibility.

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) can be associated with all types of diabetes. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has short- and long-term benefits in subjects with EPI, but its effects on diabetes control are uncertain. We aimed to study the effects of PERT initiation on glycemic control in subjects with diabetes and EPI from any cause.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective study, we compared subjects with EPI and diabetes who were prescribed PERT with subjects with diabetes who had a fecal elastase-1 concentration dosage, but did not receive PERT. The primary outcome was the effect of PERT on hypoglycemia frequency and severity. The secondary outcomes were the effects of PERT on gastrointestinal disorders, HbA1c, and body mass index (BMI).

- **Results**: Forty-eight subjects were included in each group. Overall, PERT did not have any significant effect on hypoglycemia frequency or severity, but hypoglycemia frequency tended to decrease in subjects with chronic pancreatitis. While 19% of subjects experienced mild hyperglycemia after PERT initiation, we did not report any ketoacidosis or any other severe adverse event. Gastrointestinal disorders improved in 80% of subjects treated with PERT, versus 20% of control subjects (p = 0.02). Gastrointestinal disorders improved in 87% of subjects with the recommended dosage of PERT, versus 50% of subjects with underdosage (not significant). HbA1c and BMI evolution did not differ between the groups.

- **Conclusions**: PERT initiation is safe in subjects with diabetes and EPI. It does not globally decrease hypoglycemia severity or frequency.

### Real-world patient experience with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^117Cq1Rs]. Pancreas (2024). Low credibility.

**Survey respondents' demographic and clinical characteristics**: Two hundred fifty-two individuals indicated their interest in the survey, of whom 75 patients qualified and completed the survey. The vast majority of the 75 respondents identified themselves as patients (93%), and the remainder identified themselves as caregivers (7%). Overall, 73% of patients were women, 57% were aged 50 to 69 years, 85% were White, and 56% lived in a large city or a suburb of a large city. Patients who reported more than one condition (e.g. AP and CP) were classified under the more chronic condition (e.g. CP) for the purpose of understanding the underlying condition associated with EPI. As such, 67% had CP, 19% had PC, and 73% indicated receiving a diagnosis of EPI more than one year ago. Eighty percent (n = 60) were taking PERT, and 20% (n = 15) had previously taken PERT.

### Phenylketonuria scientific review conference: State of the science and future research needs [^112Tfawj]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

New developments in the treatment and management of phenylketonuria (PKU), as well as advances in molecular testing, have emerged since the National Institutes of Health 2000 PKU Consensus Statement was released. An NIH State-of-the-Science Conference was convened in 2012 to address new findings, particularly the use of the medication sapropterin to treat some individuals with PKU, and to develop a research agenda.

Prior to the 2012 conference, five working groups of experts and public members met over a one-year period. The working groups addressed the following areas: long-term outcomes and management across the lifespan; PKU and pregnancy; diet control and management; pharmacologic interventions; and molecular testing, new technologies, and epidemiologic considerations.

In a parallel and independent activity, an Evidence-based Practice Center, supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, conducted a systematic review of adjuvant treatments for PKU; its conclusions were presented at the conference. The conference included the findings of the working groups, panel discussions from industry and international perspectives, and presentations on topics such as emerging treatments for PKU, transitioning to adult care, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulatory perspective.

Over 85 experts participated in the conference through information gathering and/or as presenters, and they reached several important conclusions. The most serious neurological impairments in PKU are preventable with dietary treatment approaches. However, a variety of strategies are necessary to address the comprehensive management of PKU.

### Practical guide to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency - Breaking the myths [^115oMeSD]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy aims to eliminate malabsorption, reduce maldigestion-related symptoms, and prevent malnutrition-related morbidity and mortality. This is particularly evident in cystic fibrosis (CF), where, prior to the availability of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), infants often died within the first year of life. Before 2010, pancreatic enzymes were not FDA regulated, leading to variability in their consistency and activity. Consequently, in 2010, the FDA required approval for all prescribed formulations of PERT.

It is important to note that clinical trials were relatively small (less than 40 subjects) and conducted on subjects known to respond to PERTs. All pancreatic enzyme preparations derive from porcine pancreas (pancrelipase) and are available in formulations encapsulated in mini-microspheres or microtablets, which vary in particle size and pH-related release kinetics. Enteric-coated pancreatic microspheres are designed to resist acid and are pH-sensitive to protect lipase from denaturation by gastric acid. However, confusion has arisen due to the many different dosage strengths of PERTs.

Enteric-coated pancreatic enzymes are most effective at a pH greater than 6. In CF patients, duodenal pH is often less than 6. The use of acid-suppression medications can increase gastric pH levels, potentially improving PERT efficacy and reducing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) symptoms. Data suggests considering a trial of acid blockers in CF patients who have refractory steatorrhea.

### European guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency: UEG, EPC, EDS, ESPEN, ESPGHAN, ESDO, and ESPCG evidence-based recommendations [^115RHE1r]. United European Gastroenterology Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, more specifically with respect to patients after acute pancreatitis, EDS/EPC/ESDO/ESPCG/ESPEN/ESPGHAN/UEG 2025 guidelines recommend initiating pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy to relieve symptoms of maldigestion and prevent nutritional deficiencies in patients with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency after acute pancreatitis. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency during admission for acute pancreatitis.

### AGA clinical practice update on the epidemiology, evaluation, and management of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: Expert review [^112MQHfb]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic pancreatitis, specifically concerning pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, the AGA 2023 guidelines recommend initiating treatment with at least 40,000 USP units of lipase to be taken with each meal in adult patients and one-half of that with snacks. It is advisable to adjust the subsequent dosage based on the meal size and fat content.

### Human pancreatic tissue dissociation enzymes for islet isolation: Advances and clinical perspectives [^113qs5jc]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Low credibility.

Successful clinical human allo or auto-islet transplantation requires the recovery of a sufficient number of functional islets from either brain-dead or chronic pancreatitis pancreases, respectively.

- **Methods**: In the last two decades (2000–2019), significant progress has been made in improving human islet isolation procedures and in standardizing the use of different tissue dissociation enzyme (TDE; a mixture of collagenase and protease enzymes) blends to recover higher islet yields.

- **Results and conclusions**: This review presents information focusing on the properties and role of TDE blends during the islet isolation process, particularly emphasizing developments, associated challenges, and future perspectives within the field.

### Patient-reported use of pancreatic enzyme replacement treatment (PERT) in pancreatic cancer in New Zealand and Australia: a cross-sectional survey study [^115W5CmY]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Low credibility.

This study investigated pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) use in people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in New Zealand (NZ) and Australia (AU).

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted using a mixed-media campaign to recruit people with pancreatic cancer and collect information about PERT use. The questionnaire gathered data on participant demographics, awareness of PERT, prescribing practices, and efficacy of enzyme replacement.

- **Results**: Over 300 people with pancreatic cancer were recruited, 135 from New Zealand and 199 from Australia. Every region, state, and territory was represented except for the West Coast (NZ) and the Northern Territory (AU), the lowest populated areas in both countries. In New Zealand, 60% of participants had heard about PERT, compared to 69.3% in Australia. Dosing regimens were inconsistent in both countries, with 18% and 27% of participants being prescribed PERT considered best practice in New Zealand and Australia, respectively. Before PERT commencement, 70% of participants experienced symptoms of malabsorption, with all symptoms improving after therapy was established. The majority of participants were compliant with their medication.

- **Conclusion**: PERT use in pancreatic cancer in New Zealand and Australia was highly variable and not compliant with international guidelines in which PERT is recommended as standard therapy. Enzyme replacement is effective for improving the symptoms of malabsorption in patients with pancreatic cancer. Clinician education may be needed to help improve the use of PERT in people.

### The effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy for juvenile-onset Pompe disease: A systematic review [^117KhDqe]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this research was to determine the effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy for juvenile-onset Pompe disease (patients aged 2 to 18 years at symptom onset) by systematic review.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was conducted according to a protocol designed a priori of bibliographic databases and search engines. Studies selected according to pre-specified criteria were assessed for quality and risk of bias using standardized appraisal tools. Data were reported according to PRISMA conventions [Liberati et al. in PLoS Med 6:e1000100, 2009] and synthesized using GRADE [Guyatt et al. in J Clin Epidemiol 64:380–382, 2011].

- **Results**: Of 2537 titles screened, 1 case series and 16 case reports met the inclusion criteria. No studies reported on the impact of enzyme replacement therapy on the survival of juvenile-onset patients. Low-level evidence found that respiratory function may improve or be maintained in the early months of therapy. Improved muscle function in the first 6 to 12 months was also suggested, but results may be confounded by natural development. Patients with less severe baseline status and treated at a younger age showed more response than patients with more severe baseline status, treated as adults.

- **Conclusions**: Interpretation of the findings was hindered by the lack of good quality evidence. The available data suggest that some JOPD patients may benefit in the short term from ERT through improved muscle strength and a reduced need for assisted ventilation. A focus by clinicians on improved and more consistent evidence collection and use of standardized methodologies is recommended.

### Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in subjects with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and diabetes mellitus: A real-life, case-control study [^114p53Ro]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). High credibility.

Gastro-intestinal disorders were common in both groups. This was expected since FEC dosage is often performed because of gastro-intestinal symptoms. Gastro-intestinal disorders improved more often after PERT initiation than in the control group. Gastro-intestinal disorders also tended to improve more often in patients with the recommended dosage of PERT than in patients who were under-dosed, even though the difference was non-significant, probably because of a lack of power in this subgroup analysis. Thus, we reckon that PERT has beneficial effects on gastro-intestinal disorders in subjects with diabetes.

BMI was globally stable over the period of study. PERT initiation has previously been associated with an increase in weight, mostly in subjects with pancreatogenic diabetes. Our study does not confirm this, but BMI should be interpreted with caution in our population: GLP1 treatment was initiated at T 0 in 5 subjects in the PERT group and 2 subjects in the control group. These subjects all lost or stabilized weight, as expected. Moreover, 3 subjects in the PERT group had pancreatic adenocarcinoma and lost weight progressively. Conversely, the BMI of subjects with CP and with T1D tended to increase after PERT initiation.

On another note, international guidelines recommend using 40,000–80,000 lipase units during main meals. These guidelines were redacted for subjects with EPI and CP only, so there are no clear recommendations for subjects with more common types of diabetes and EPI. In the present study, a third of the subjects from the PERT group were not prescribed the recommended dosage.

### Elevated lipase in an infant with altered mental status [^111AvxKY]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The pancreatic enzymes lipase and amylase serve important functions in the digestion and absorption of fats and polysaccharides. Measurement of these enzymes is often used in the emergency department to rule out acute pancreatitis in patients with nonspecific abdominal pain. In acute pancreatitis, serial measurements of plasma lipase and amylase typically follow a predictable temporal pattern of rise-and-fall kinetics: lipase levels rise within 4 to 8 hours, crest at 2× to 50× the upper reference limit at 24 hours, and decline to normal concentrations in 7 to 14 days.

In situations where the duration and magnitude of pancreatic enzyme elevation are more transient, clinicians should consider alternative causes for enzyme elevation. In this case report, an incidental discovery of elevated lipase in an African American baby girl who ingested oxycodone resulted in additional laboratory and radiological work-up. Stronger awareness of exogenous influences on gastrointestinal motility may have prevented the need for further testing in this patient.

### Practical guide to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency - Breaking the myths [^115WuogX]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In a patient with suspected exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) with a known history of pancreatic disease, empiric therapy with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapies (PERTs) may be indicated without formal testing. A clear response would be both diagnostic for EPI as well as therapeutic. In addition, if there is a poor response to PERT, one should consider gastrointestinal comorbidities such as lactose intolerance, enteric bacterial infection, parasites (especially giardia), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, biliary disease (cholestasis), colitis, celiac disease, short bowel syndrome, and Crohn's disease. Other reasons could be insufficient dosing, lack of compliance, inadequate timing of PERT administration, and poor diet.

- **Treatment strategies for lack of response to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT)**: PERT should be taken with the first bite of a meal, and consider adding extra enzymes during or towards the end of the meal. Thus, if the consumption of a meal is less than 15 minutes, all enzymes can be taken at the beginning of the meal. For a 15- to 30-minute meal, we suggest taking half the enzyme capsules with the first bite and the other half in the middle of the meal. For more than 30 minutes, we recommend taking one third at the beginning, one third in the middle, and one third at the end. The rationale for taking pancreatic enzymes throughout the meal is to mimic the action of our own endogenous pancreatic enzymes, where secretion from the gland occurs throughout a meal. Specifically, the more food that is ingested and/or the greater the amount of fat in the diet, the higher the amount of endogenous pancreatic enzyme secretion required.

### Real-world patient experience with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^114aP1Qp]. Pancreas (2024). Low credibility.

This study aimed to provide patients insights on the management of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT).

- **Materials and methods**: A survey of 75 members of Inspire's Pancreatitis or Pancreatic Cancer Support communities was conducted. Eligibility included having EPI secondary to chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, pancreatic surgery, or acute pancreatitis, and current or past PERT experience.

- **Results**: Patients were 73% female, 57% aged 50 to 69 years, and 85% White, with PERT prescribed by a gastroenterologist or pancreatologist for 64%. Only approximately half of respondents agreed that their healthcare provider provided detailed information about EPI (54%) or how PERT works to treat EPI (56%). Most respondents (83%) reported searching for information about EPI, 56% were taking PERT solely before or after eating, 36% reported taking suboptimal PERT doses, and 39% reported no follow-up. In addition, 24% decreased their PERT dosage without consulting their physician, and 21% reported purposely skipping PERT.

- **Conclusions**: This study reveals potential barriers to effective treatment of EPI with PERT, including lack of patient education, mainly about how and when to take PERT, gaps in appropriate dosing, and lack of patient follow-up. Continued focus on patient and provider education is essential to address these gaps and optimize the treatment of EPI.

### The impact of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy on patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma: A systematic review and narrative synthesis [^1145YVcc]. Pancreas (2022). High credibility.

Advanced pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis globally. Patients often develop pancreatic exocrine insufficiency leading to malabsorption. This systematic literature review explores the impact of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) on patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Data sources include MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane (CENTRAL), PsychINFO, and Joanna Briggs Institute databases from inception to January 14, 2022, with reference list checking on Google Scholar. Narrative synthesis was used as the eligible studies were likely to be heterogeneous and hard to compare. This synthesis approach uses four steps: theory development, preliminary synthesis, exploration of relationships, and assessment of the robustness of the synthesis.

- **Themes: Four themes arose from analyzing the study outcomes**: PERT education, efficacy of PERT, the patient experience, and lack of awareness regarding enzyme replacement. The included studies did not use validated tools or standardized measurements, which made it difficult to compare or draw conclusions.

Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy shows the potential to improve symptoms, nutrition, weight loss, and survival. However, high-quality studies with standardized outcomes have not been completed. Patient and health professional education is required because there seems to be a general lack of awareness about the use of PERT in pancreatic cancer.

The objective of this conference statement is to provide health care providers, patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data regarding the screening for and management of phenylketonuria (PKU).

- **Participants**: A nonfederal, nonadvocate, 14-member panel representing the fields of pediatrics, genetics, human development, public policy, nursing, and molecular physiology, including patient representatives, was convened. Additionally, 19 experts in pediatrics, medical genetics, psychology, pediatric neurology, biochemical and molecular genetics, and gene therapy presented data to the panel and a conference audience of 312.

- **Evidence**: The literature was searched using Medline for January 1980 through July 2000, resulting in an extensive bibliography of 3394 references provided to the panel. Experts prepared abstracts for their presentations with relevant citations from the literature. Scientific evidence was prioritized over clinical anecdotal experience.

- **Consensus process**: The panel answered predefined questions and developed conclusions based on the scientific evidence presented in the open forum and the scientific literature. A draft statement was composed, read in its entirety, and circulated to the experts and audience for feedback. Conflicting recommendations were resolved, and a revised statement was released at the end of the conference. Final revisions were completed within a few weeks, and the draft statement was made available on the World Wide Web immediately after its release and was updated accordingly.

### Effects of enzyme replacement therapy in Fabry disease — a comprehensive review of the medical literature [^115oYGvV]. Genetics in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Enzyme replacement therapy with α-galactosidase A has been used to treat Fabry disease since 2001. This article reviews the published evidence for the clinical efficacy of the two available enzyme preparations. The focus is on heart, kidney, and nervous system manifestations, which impact both quality of life and overall prognosis.

A literature search was undertaken to identify prospective open or randomized controlled trials of enzyme replacement therapy in patients with Fabry disease published since 2001. At the time of writing, no definitive conclusion can be drawn from studies that have directly compared therapeutic responses between the two commercially available enzyme preparations. Significant clinical benefits of enzyme replacement therapy have been demonstrated, mainly in patients at an early phase of the disease, with beneficial effects on heart, kidneys, pain, and quality of life in treated patients. The incidence of antibodies against agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta observed during major clinical studies suggests a greater antigenic response to agalsidase beta.

Further studies are required to confirm the long-term clinical benefits of enzyme replacement therapy. More studies with female patients are needed, as are investigations of early initiation of enzyme replacement therapy to determine the optimal time to start treatment to prevent irreversible organ damage. The value of adjunctive and supportive therapies should also be rigorously analyzed.

### Practical guide to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency - Breaking the myths [^112KFCQ3]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is characterized by a deficiency of exocrine pancreatic enzymes, resulting in malabsorption. Numerous conditions account for the etiology of EPI, with the most common being diseases of the pancreatic parenchyma, including chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, and a history of extensive necrotizing acute pancreatitis. Treatment for EPI includes dietary management, lifestyle changes (i.e. decreased alcohol consumption and smoking cessation), and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.

- **Discussion**: Many diagnostic tests are available to diagnose EPI; however, the criteria of choice remain unclear and the causes for a false-positive test are not yet understood. Despite multiple studies on the treatment of EPI using exogenous pancreatic enzymes, there remains confusion amongst medical practitioners regarding the best approach to diagnose EPI, as well as dosing and administration of pancreatic enzymes. Appropriate use of diagnostics and treatment approaches using pancreatic enzymes in EPI is essential for patients. This opinion piece aims to address the existing myths, remove the confusion, and function as a practical guide to the diagnosis and treatment of EPI.

### Novel ciliate lipases for enzyme replacement during exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^117EyEdv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, caused by inflammation or pancreatic tumors, results in nutrient malfunction due to a lack of digestive enzymes and neutralization compounds. Despite satisfactory clinical results with enzyme therapies, normalization of fat absorption in patients is rare. An individualized therapy is required, including a high dosage of enzymatic units, usage of enteric coating, and addition of gastric proton pump inhibitors. The key goal to improve this therapy is to identify digestive enzymes with high activity and stability in the gastrointestinal tract.

- **Methods**: We cloned and analyzed three novel ciliate lipases derived from *Tetrahymena thermophila*. Using highly precise pH-STAT-titration and colorimetric methods, we determined stability and lipolytic activity under physiological conditions in comparison with commercially available porcine and fungal digestive enzyme preparations. We measured from pH 2.0 to 9.0, with different bile salts concentrations, and substrates such as olive oil and fat derived from pig diet.

- **Results**: Ciliate lipases CL-120, CL-130, and CL-230 showed activities up to 220-fold higher than Creon, pancreatin standard, and rizolipase Nortase within a pH range from pH 2.0 to 9.0. They are highly active in the presence of bile salts and complex pig diet substrate and more stable after incubation in human gastric juice compared with porcine pancreatic lipase and rizolipase.

- **Conclusions**: The newly cloned and characterized lipases fulfilled all requirements for high activity under physiological conditions.

### Real-world patient experience with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^115HKFaZ]. Pancreas (2024). High credibility.

Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy was prescribed by a gastroenterologist for 57% of respondents. Other prescribers included oncologists (17%), surgeons (11%), pancreatologists (7%), primary care physicians (5%), nurse practitioners (1%), and other (2%).

- **Survey data for patients with EPI**: Fifty-four percent of respondents agreed that their healthcare providers (HCPs) provided detailed information about exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), 56% agreed on receiving information from their HCPs on how pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) works to treat EPI, and 71% of respondents agreed that their HCPs provided information on why to take PERT to treat EPI. The remaining respondents were neutral or disagreed.

- **Respondents' assessment of information their HCPs provided on EPI, the role of PERT in EPI, and how to take PERT**: Seventy-three percent of patients agreed that their HCP provided information on how to take PERT. However, 11% reported receiving no instructions on how or when to take PERT. Seventy-nine percent of respondents were instructed to take PERT with meals and snacks, and notably, 21% reported not being instructed to take PERT with snacks.

- **Timing of PERT ingestion**: Respondents were instructed to take PERT as follows: before eating (56%), while eating food (24%), before and while eating food (17%), and after eating food (1.5%); 1.5% of respondents chose none of the above options.

### Enzyme replacement therapy for infantile-onset Pompe disease [^113yeHz5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Infantile-onset Pompe disease is a rare and progressive autosomal-recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Treatment involves enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human alglucosidase alfa and symptomatic therapies, such as controlling secretions. Children who are cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM)-negative require immunomodulation prior to commencing enzyme replacement therapy. Enzyme replacement therapy was developed as the most promising therapeutic approach for Pompe disease; however, evidence is lacking, especially regarding the optimal dose and dose frequency.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness, safety, and appropriate dose regimen of enzyme replacement therapy for treating infantile-onset Pompe disease.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, which is compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase (Ovid), PubMed, and LILACS, as well as CBM, CNKI, VIP, and WANFANG for literature published in Chinese. In addition, we searched three online registers: WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and www.genzymeclinicalresearch.com. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 24 November 2016.

### Efficacy of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in chronic pancreatitis: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115rdfR5]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Pancreatic lipase is the principal enzyme in fat digestion, accounting for 90% of total lipase activity. Typically, steatorrhea is unlikely until pancreatic lipase output falls to less than 10% of normal, although subclinical exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) exists in many individuals with chronic pancreatitis (CP). Large-scale Northern European studies suggest that the majority of patients with EPI secondary to CP or pancreatic surgery are undertreated. This is likely due to insufficient use of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), suboptimal scheduling in relation to meals, or insufficient control of gastric acid output.

The European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 2006 guidelines suggest the improvement of steatorrhea and maintenance of body weight as primary markers of treatment success. However, these endpoints do not detect subtler signs of malnutrition; nor do these guidelines suggest formal measures to assess improvements in steatorrhea. Furthermore, these endpoints are unsuitable as primary outcome measures for studies of PERT for EPI, particularly short-term studies. For these, accurate measures that detect alterations and/or improvements in absorption are necessary.

In practice, licensed enzyme replacement therapies differ greatly: granules, tablets, microspheres, mini-microspheres, or capsules with enteric coating make comparisons challenging. While the European Medicines Agency has delegated regulation of PERT to national authorities, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) addressed these differences in 2004 (updated in 2006), issuing requirements for new drug applications, specifying amount, stability, and efficacy.

### Ravicti [^113mY6EX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Exocrine pancreatic enzymes hydrolyze Ravicti in the small intestine, separating the active moiety, phenylbutyrate, from glycerol. This process allows phenylbutyrate to be absorbed into the circulation. Low or absent pancreatic enzymes, or intestinal disease resulting in fat malabsorption, may result in reduced or absent digestion of Ravicti and/or absorption of phenylbutyrate, leading to reduced control of plasma ammonia. Monitor ammonia levels closely in patients with pancreatic insufficiency or intestinal malabsorption.

### Dojolvi [^1113riHq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Regularly monitor the feeding tube to ensure proper functioning and integrity in patients using DOJOLVI.

- **Feeding tube dysfunction**: Feeding tube performance and functionality can degrade over time depending on usage and environmental conditions. In clinical trials, feeding tube dysfunction was reported in patients receiving triheptanoin. The contribution of DOJOLVI cannot be ruled out. Do not administer DOJOLVI in feeding tubes manufactured of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Regular monitoring is advised to maintain tube functionality and integrity.

- **Intestinal malabsorption in patients with pancreatic insufficiency**: Pancreatic enzymes hydrolyze triheptanoin and release heptanoate as medium-chain fatty acids in the small intestine. Low or absent pancreatic enzymes may result in reduced absorption of heptanoate, subsequently leading to insufficient supplementation of medium-chain fatty acids. Avoid administration of DOJOLVI in patients with pancreatic insufficiency.

### Real-world patient experience with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^112JeFQg]. Pancreas (2024). Low credibility.

Appropriate dosing of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is crucial for its physiological action to improve maldigestion. The American College of Gastroenterology recommends a minimum starting dose for adults with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) of 40,000 to 50,000 lipase units (LU) per meal, with international guidelines suggesting similar or higher benchmarks. In our study, 36% of patients were taking PERT doses of less than 40,000 LU per meal at the time of the survey.

The intake of an increased number of pills, known as pill burden, negatively affects patient compliance. In the United States, PERT capsule strengths range from infant to full adult dosing, with the highest range being 36,000 to 40,000 LU. Only 42% of adult patients in our study received individual PERT capsule strengths in this range, with many patients receiving lower LU capsule strengths, requiring additional pills to achieve the appropriate minimum dosing levels. This increases the pill burden and potentially decreases compliance. The prescribing healthcare providers (HCPs) were primarily specialists — gastroenterologists (57%), pancreatologists (7%), oncologists (17%), and surgeons (11%) — with 8% being other HCP types. Thus, further education regarding PERT dosing should be focused on HCPs.

Patient follow-up after starting PERT is important to evaluate the need for dose adjustment, assess patient adherence to dosing and administration instructions (timing of PERT ingestion in relation to food, number of pills taken), and address any gaps in the provision of these instructions.

### Intravenous secretin for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [^116AFKBV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

In 1998, secretin, a gastrointestinal hormone, was suggested as an effective treatment for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) based on anecdotal evidence.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether intravenous secretin improves the core features of ASD, other aspects of behavior or function such as self-injurious behavior, and the quality of life of affected individuals and their carers. We also assessed whether secretin causes harm. This is an updated version of our review of this topic originally published in 2005.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (2010 Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to January 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010 Week 2), PsycINFO (1806 to 2010 Week 2), CINAHL (1938 to January 2010), ERIC (1966 to January 2010), and Sociological Abstracts (1952 to January 2010). Sociofile and HealthStar were searched in March 2005 when this review was first published, but were not available for this update. Records were limited to studies published since 1998 as this is when secretin was first proposed as a possible treatment for ASD. We searched reference lists of trials and reviews; we also contacted experts and trialists to find unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of intravenous secretin compared to a placebo treatment in children or adults diagnosed with ASD, where at least one standardized outcome measure was reported.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria but for two of these, conducted by Repligen, the only available multisite data were reported in press releases. All outcome data from the other 14 trials were…

### Pertzye [^112JEQd1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important dosing information**: Pertzye is a mixture of enzymes, including lipases, proteases, and amylases. The dosing of Pertzye is based on lipase units, using either an actual body weight or a fat ingestion-based dosing scheme. Start at the lowest recommended dosage and individualize the dosage based on clinical symptoms, the degree of steatorrhea present, and the fat content of the diet. Changes in dosage may require an adjustment period of several days. Do not exceed 2,500 lipase units/kg/meal, 10,000 lipase units/kg/day, or 4,000 lipase units/g fat ingested/day in adult and pediatric patients greater than 12 months of age without further investigation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The total daily dosage in adult and pediatric patients greater than 12 months of age should reflect approximately three meals plus two or three snacks per day. With each snack, administer approximately half the prescribed Pertzye dose for a meal. Do not substitute other pancreatic enzyme products for Pertzye. When switching from another pancreatic enzyme product to Pertzye, monitor patients for clinical symptoms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and titrate the dosage as needed.

- **Recommended dosage**: For adults and pediatric patients greater than 12 months of age, the recommended oral initial starting dosage is 500 lipase units/kg/meal for adults and pediatric patients 4 years of age and older, and 1,000 lipase units/kg/meal for pediatric patients greater than 12 months to less than 4 years of age. If signs and symptoms of malabsorption persist, increase the dosage.

### Enzyme content and acid stability of enteric-coated pancreatic enzyme products in vitro [^111StqVu]. Pancreas (2005). Low credibility.

Pancreatic enzymes are prescribed routinely for pancreatic insufficiency. In the healthcare environment, drug substitution is common; however, there is no proof of therapeutic or bioequivalence for these products. The purpose of this in vitro, prospective study was to evaluate the enzyme contents and dissolution of various capsules of pancreatic enzymes using United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) methodology.

Nine different pancreatic enzyme products were purchased on the market and supplied to Irvine Analytical Laboratories (IAL) in Irvine, CA. All test products were maintained in a laboratory environment, at room temperature, throughout the testing period by IAL. USP procedures for assay and dissolution testing of pancrelipase delayed-release capsules, as described in the latest USP supplement, were observed during product testing. This included determination of amylase, lipase, and protease activity. Additionally, a point assay with measurement of lipase after dissolution in simulated gastric fluid at a pH of 1.0 for 1 hour, followed by dissolution in a pH 6 phosphate buffer for 30 minutes, was performed in accordance with USP guidelines.

Assay results of amylase, protease, and lipase from the nine tested products were within USP specified limits. The percentage of label claim for these enzymes was higher than depicted on their labels, except for one drug batch. However, the percentage of lipase activity after dissolution varied with two out of three batches of one drug not dissolving, and one batch of another drug revealing only 8% lipase activity.

### Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas improved overall survival: a retrospective, single institution study [^112U8kVX]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Weight loss is endemic to pancreatic cancer and is a matter of immense importance to both patients and caregivers. The approach to this problem requires multidimensional thought. One useful construct is to consider this problem according to three major components:

- **Decreased caloric intake/anorexia**: Associated with a host of gastrointestinal and other symptoms.
- **Caloric malabsorption/exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI)**.
- **Cancer cachexia/sarcopenia**: Involves consideration of the cancer treatment itself, mitigation of its metabolic and inflammatory consequences, and optimum physical activity and exercise.

Along with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) itself, both treatment and non-treatment-related morbidities often influence this problem. It is noteworthy that these factors affect a wide range of organ systems, producing immunological, endocrinological, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neuropsychiatric pathophysiology. As such, patients with advanced PDAC typically require a complicated and largely individualized approach to weight loss.

### Pancreatic insufficiency, digestive enzyme supplementation, and postnatal growth in preterm babies [^115Kb7Do]. Neonatology (2024). Low credibility.

Optimizing postnatal growth facilitates better long-term neonatal neurodevelopmental outcomes. Early postnatal growth is often hindered by a variety of factors unique to the extrauterine environment and digestive immaturity, both contributing to reduced enteral feed tolerance during the first few days and weeks after birth. Preterm infants display varying levels of pancreatic insufficiency that are related to gestational age, and providing digestive enzyme supplementation may be one way to improve postnatal growth in enterally fed preterm babies.

In this review, we explore which exocrine pancreatic enzymes are deficient in preterm babies, the methods by which exocrine pancreatic function is measured, potential avenues through which digestive enzyme replacement might improve postnatal growth failure, and which babies might benefit most from this intervention.

- **Key messages**: Pancreatic exocrine function exhibits developmental immaturity in extremely preterm infants and may contribute to postnatal growth failure. Stool elastase is a simple, non-invasive method of assessing pancreatic function in preterm infants. Available evidence does not currently support the routine use of digestive enzyme supplementation in preterm infants.

### Neurological features and enzyme therapy in patients with endocrine and exocrine pancreas dysfunction due to CEL mutations [^113zJxX1]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Results are presented as follows: Baseline characteristics of the nine patients are provided in Supplementary Table 1, while the outcomes post-treatment are shown in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3. Notably, two patients exited the study after 1 and 6 months, respectively, due to side effects.

- **Symptoms and treatment response**: Six patients identified loose stools as a major complaint. While seven patients reported immediate alleviation of abdominal symptoms with treatment, the treatment was largely unsatisfactory for most, necessitating increased dosages.

- **Fecal elastase and nutritional indicators**: Baseline fecal elastase values were below 10 μg/g for all patients, indicating severe exocrine deficiency, and these values remained unchanged throughout the treatment. Baseline A1C levels were moderately elevated and showed no change with treatment. Pretreatment BMI was normal, with a median value of 24.0 kg/m² (range: 18–32 kg/m²). A mean body weight increase of 3 kg was noted after 12 months of treatment (P = 0.01).

- **Fat excretion and vitamin levels**: Seven patients exhibited steatorrhea at baseline. After 30 months, all four patients who continued the study showed reduced fat excretion (from 35 [25–43] to 22 [12–37] g/day; P = 0.01). Vitamin E levels, initially low in all patients, improved during treatment (from 7.6 [2.8–10.1] to 13.2 [5.5–14.1] μmol/l; P = 0.03), normalizing in five out of seven patients after 12 months. While vitamins D and A were initially at the lower normal range, vitamin D levels remained stable, and vitamin A levels rose with PEST (from 1.1 [0.5–1.4] to 1.6 [1.3–1.7] μmol/l; P = 0.03).

- **Cholesterol and bone density**: A minor yet significant increase in total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol was observed with no alteration in triglyceride levels. Osteoporosis was present in three patients and osteopenia in two at baseline. Bone mass data at the end of the study are not available due to truncation of study data.

### Pertzye [^112o8L9c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy**:

Published data from case reports of pancrelipase use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Pancrelipase is minimally absorbed systemically; therefore, its maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with pancrelipase. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

- **Lactation**:

There are no data on the presence of pancrelipase in either human or animal milk, its effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Pancrelipase is minimally absorbed systemically following oral administration; therefore, maternal use is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of breastfed infants to the drug. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Pertzye and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Pertzye or from the underlying maternal condition.

### Coefficient of fat absorption to measure the efficacy of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in people with cystic fibrosis: gold standard or coal standard [^1125GHp1]. Pancreas (2022). Low credibility.

Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is an essential part of treatment for individuals with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). However, other than more precise manufacturing standards and the addition of bicarbonate to one PERT brand, there have been no novel advancements in PERT since the late 1970s. Methods to determine the efficacy of PERTs and ways to adjust dosage are needed. It has been said that "If you oppose, you must propose". Investigators and clinicians have long sought alternatives to fecal fat balance studies, exploring stool, breath, blood, and imaging studies.

Although information about the validity, reliability, responsiveness, and clinical relevance of these methods is limited, we will review potential alternatives that minimize subject discomfort, time, and cost.

### Real-world patient experience with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^114bo97K]. Pancreas (2024). Low credibility.

This study aimed to provide patients with insights on managing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) using pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). A survey of 75 members from Inspire's Pancreatitis or Pancreatic Cancer Support communities was conducted. Eligibility required having EPI secondary to chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, pancreatic surgery, or acute pancreatitis, and current or past PERT experience.

Patients were 73% female, 57% aged between 50 to 69 years, and 85% White, with 64% having PERT prescribed by a gastroenterologist or pancreatologist. Only approximately half of the respondents agreed that their healthcare provider provided detailed information about EPI (54%) or how PERT works to treat EPI (56%). Most respondents (83%) reported searching for information about EPI. Fifty-six percent were taking PERT solely before or after eating, 36% reported taking suboptimal PERT doses, and 39% reported no follow-up. Additionally, 24% decreased their PERT dosage without consulting their physician, and 21% reported purposely skipping PERT.

This study reveals potential barriers to the effective treatment of EPI with PERT, including a lack of patient education, mainly regarding how and when to take PERT, gaps in appropriate dosing, and lack of patient follow-up. Continued focus on patient and provider education is essential to address these gaps and optimize the treatment of EPI.

### European guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency: UEG, EPC, EDS, ESPEN, ESPGHAN, ESDO, and ESPCG evidence-based recommendations [^1135cB4F]. United European Gastroenterology Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, particularly in relation to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, the EDS/EPC/ESDO/ESPCG/ESPEN/ESPGHAN/UEG 2025 guidelines recommend initiating pancreatic enzyme preparations, specifically pancreatin, as the first-line treatment for EPI.

### Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in subjects with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and diabetes mellitus: a real-life, case-control study [^117HKW9n]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Low credibility.

In this retrospective monocentric study, we compared subjects with diabetes and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) who were prescribed pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) for the first time with control subjects who also presented with diabetes, had a fecal elastase (FEC) dosage, and were not treated with PERT. Frequent and/or severe hypoglycemia was a common occurrence in both groups and was more common in subjects treated with insulin. Over the study period, hypoglycemia symptoms improved in about half of the subjects, both in the PERT and the control groups. Thus, we reckon that in this study, PERT was probably not the main reason why hypoglycemia symptoms improved.

PERT initiation and FEC dosage were mainly performed during hospitalization for educational purposes. The decrease in hypoglycemia frequency and severity might have resulted from improvement in diabetes management and in subjects' autonomy. The decrease in HbA1c in both groups over the study period was probably due to the same hospitalization effect. Our results are in accordance with Ewald et al.'s study, which did not show any difference in severe hypoglycemia rate after PERT initiation either. It must, however, be noted that in the present study, relevant hypoglycemia symptoms improved in 80% of subjects with pancreatogenic diabetes. PERT might thus have a direct effect on hypoglycemia rate in subjects with pancreatogenic diabetes, but there were too few subjects to conclude definitively.

Conversely, the risk of severe hyperglycemia is often mentioned when PERT initiation is considered in subjects with diabetes. We did not confirm this risk, as we did not report any.

### Mucopolysaccharidosis i: management and treatment guidelines [^113mNQBD]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Disease management for mucopolysaccharidosis type I has been inconsistent because of its rarity (approximately 1 case per 100,000 live births), phenotypic heterogeneity, and limited therapeutic options. The availability of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and the recent introduction of enzyme replacement therapy for mucopolysaccharidosis I necessitate the establishment of system-specific management guidelines for this condition.

Twelve international experts on mucopolysaccharidosis I met in January 2003 to draft management and treatment guidelines. Initial guidelines were revised and updated in 2008, based on additional clinical data and therapeutic advances. Recommendations are grounded in extensive clinical experience and a review of the literature.

All patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I should receive a comprehensive baseline evaluation, including neurologic, ophthalmologic, auditory, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal assessments. They should be monitored every 6 to 12 months with individualized specialty assessments to track disease progression and effects of intervention. Patients are best treated by a multidisciplinary team. Treatments consist of palliative/supportive care, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and enzyme replacement therapy. The patient's age (> 2 years or ≤ 2 years), predicted phenotype, and developmental quotient help define the risk/benefit profile for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which carries a higher risk but can preserve central nervous system function.

### Patient-reported use of pancreatic enzyme replacement treatment (PERT) in pancreatic cancer in New Zealand and Australia: A cross-sectional survey study [^115VVCD5]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Low credibility.

This study investigated pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) use in people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in New Zealand (NZ) and Australia (AU).

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted using a mixed-media campaign to recruit people with pancreatic cancer and collect information about PERT use. The questionnaire gathered data on participant demographics, awareness of PERT, prescribing practices, and efficacy of enzyme replacement.

- **Results**: Over 300 people with pancreatic cancer were recruited, 135 from New Zealand and 199 from Australia. Every region, state, and territory was represented except for the West Coast (NZ) and the Northern Territory (AU), the lowest populated areas in both countries. In New Zealand, 60% of participants had heard about PERT, compared to 69.3% in Australia. Dosing regimens were inconsistent in both countries, with 18% and 27% of participants being prescribed PERT considered best practice in New Zealand and Australia, respectively. Before PERT commencement, 70% of participants experienced symptoms of malabsorption, with all symptoms improving after therapy was established. The majority of participants were compliant with their medication.

- **Conclusion**: PERT use in pancreatic cancer in New Zealand and Australia was highly variable and not compliant with international guidelines, in which PERT is recommended as standard therapy. Enzyme replacement is effective for improving the symptoms of malabsorption in patients with pancreatic cancer. Clinician education may be needed to help improve the use of PERT in people.

### Persistent recovery of pancreatic function in patients with cystic fibrosis after ivacaftor [^114KxNYR]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Low credibility.

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), which leads to malabsorption and poor weight gain, is seen in 85% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). EPI is treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy taken with each meal. The highly effective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator, ivacaftor, restores CFTR function in patients with responsive mutations. It is a widely held view that EPI in CF is irreversible due to the complete destruction of pancreatic ducts and acinar cells. We describe three pediatric CF patients with EPI who were started on ivacaftor and subsequently showed evidence of restored exocrine pancreatic function with clinical and biochemical parameters.

### AGA clinical practice update on the epidemiology, evaluation, and management of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: Expert review [^114mJDtk]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, specifically concerning pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy preparations, the AGA 2023 guidelines recommend initiating treatment in adult patients with at least 40,000 USP units of lipase taken with each meal and half of that amount with snacks. Consider adjusting the subsequent dosage based on the meal size and fat content.

### European guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency: UEG, EPC, EDS, ESPEN, ESPGHAN, ESDO, and ESPCG evidence-based recommendations [^112BHB2r]. United European Gastroenterology Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, more specifically with respect to the assessment of treatment response, EDS/EPC/ESDO/ESPCG/ESPEN/ESPGHAN/UEG 2025 guidelines recommend defining successful pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy as the resolution of nutritional deficiencies and relief of symptoms and signs associated with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Partial success is defined as the resolution or improvement of some symptoms, signs, or nutritional deficiencies.

### Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase (Aldurazyme) for treating mucopolysaccharidosis type I [^112M8PPS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Mucopolysaccharidosis type I can be classified into three clinical sub-types: Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome, and Scheie syndrome, with Hurler syndrome being the most severe and Scheie syndrome the least severe. It is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase. This enzyme deficiency results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans within the tissues. The clinical manifestations include facial dysmorphism, hepatosplenomegaly, upper airway obstruction, skeletal deformity, and cardiomyopathy. If Hurler syndrome is left untreated, death typically occurs by adolescence. Attenuated variants, termed Hurler-Scheie and Scheie syndrome, may not present until adulthood. Enzyme replacement therapy has been used for several years in treating Hurler syndrome, although the gold standard is a haemopoietic stem cell transplant when diagnosed by 2.5 years of age. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2013 and previously updated in 2015.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treating mucopolysaccharidosis type I with laronidase enzyme replacement therapy as compared to placebo.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, MEDLINE via OVID, and Embase. Date of most recent search: 30 January 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled studies of laronidase enzyme replacement therapy.

### Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders in individuals with ASDs: A consensus report [^117ELN9b]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are common and clinically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders. Gastrointestinal disorders and associated symptoms are commonly reported in individuals with ASDs; however, key issues such as the prevalence and best treatment of these conditions are incompletely understood. A central difficulty in recognizing and characterizing gastrointestinal dysfunction with ASDs is the communication difficulties experienced by many affected individuals.

A multidisciplinary panel reviewed the medical literature aiming to generate evidence-based recommendations for the diagnostic evaluation and management of gastrointestinal problems in this patient population. The panel concluded that evidence-based recommendations are not yet available. The consensus expert opinion of the panel was that individuals with ASDs deserve the same thoroughness and standard of care in the diagnostic workup and treatment of gastrointestinal concerns as should occur for patients without ASDs. Care providers should be aware that problem behavior in patients with ASDs may be the primary or sole symptom of an underlying medical condition, including some gastrointestinal disorders. For these patients, integration of behavioral and medical care may be most beneficial.

Priorities for future research are identified to advance our understanding and management of gastrointestinal disorders in persons with ASDs.

### Pancreatic enzyme replacement leads to increased vitamin D uptake in patients undergoing sleeve-gastrectomy - A prospective, monocentric trial [^111Yj91u]. Obesity Surgery (2024). High credibility.

A total of 204 patients were enrolled in the study. Only 21 patients underwent gastric bypass, the majority of whom missed follow-up examinations or dropped out due to intolerance to PERT medication. Consequently, these cases were removed, and all remaining patients analyzed underwent laparoscopic sleeve resection. Due to missing follow-ups, surgical complications, and/or side effects from pancreatic enzyme replacement, the participants were further reduced to 139.

- **Patient characteristics**: The mean age was 42.6 years, the population was predominantly female (67.62%), and the mean BMI at baseline was 49.35 kg/m². Descriptive statistics are provided in Tables 1 and 2.

No significant differences in BMI, FM, weight, and waist size were found at baseline. However, despite randomization, the control group had significantly larger phase angle values at baseline, as compared to Table 1. This is also highlighted in the lower left boxplot in Fig. 2. Table 4 shows that there were no significant differences in albumin or vitamin D levels. This is important because significant differences at 12 months post-surgery in vitamin D or albumin levels can be attributed to the application of pancreatic enzyme replacement, and are not due to systematic differences between treatment and control at baseline.

### Viokace [^112Vzx1X]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Fibrosing colonopathy**: Fibrosing colonopathy has been reported following treatment with pancreatic enzyme products. It is a rare and serious adverse reaction, initially described with the use of high-dose pancreatic enzyme products, typically over prolonged periods, and most commonly reported in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis. Pancreatic enzyme products exceeding 6,000 lipase units/kg/meal have been associated with colonic stricture, a complication of fibrosing colonopathy, in pediatric patients under 12 years of age. The underlying mechanism remains unknown. If there is a history of fibrosing colonopathy, monitor patients during treatment with Viokace, as some patients may be at risk of progressing to colonic stricture formation. It is uncertain whether regression of fibrosing colonopathy occurs. Do not exceed the recommended dosage of either 2,500 lipase units/kg/meal, 10,000 lipase units/kg/day, or 4,000 lipase units/g fat ingested/day without further investigation. Higher dosages may be administered if documented to be effective by fecal fat measures or improvement in signs or symptoms of malabsorption, including measures of nutritional status. Patients receiving dosages higher than 6,000 lipase units/kg/meal should be frequently monitored for symptoms of fibrosing colonopathy. The dosage should be decreased or titrated downward to a lower range if clinically appropriate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

- **Irritation of the oral mucosa**: Crushing or chewing Viokace tablets can result in irritation.
