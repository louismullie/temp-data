## Question

What about pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define pneumonia and classify it by setting and severity. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and burden. Next, I will examine etiologies and the role of viruses. After that, I need to review diagnostic strategies, including imaging and biomarkers. Then, I will appraise site-of-care decisions and severity tools. Next, I should analyze empiric treatment by setting and special populations, including stewardship and duration. I will then consider non-responding pneumonia and how to approach it. Finally, I should integrate prevention, special scenarios like COVID-19 and immunocompromised hosts, and close with a concise synthesis and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't anchor incorrectly. Pneumonia is an infection of the lung parenchyma involving the alveoli and distal airways, and it is broadly categorized as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with CAP being the most common in ambulatory and emergency settings and HAP/VAP carrying higher risks of multidrug-resistant pathogens and worse outcomes [^112UZsAi].

> I need to check the epidemiology and burden to frame risk and urgency. CAP results in roughly 1.4 million ED visits, 740,000 hospitalizations, and 41,000 deaths annually in the US, with older adults and those with chronic lung disease, smoking, or immunosuppression at highest risk; globally, pneumonia remains the leading infectious cause of death in children under 5, underscoring the need for early recognition and treatment [^117J4ouG] [^113xsbio].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causes without verifying etiologies. Bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, atypicals like Mycoplasma and Chlamydia, and Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) are common CAP pathogens, but viruses account for a substantial and growing proportion, with up to 40% of identified cases in some series being viral, including influenza, RSV, hMPV, and SARS-CoV-2; this viral burden complicates empiric decisions and reinforces the need for viral testing in season [^117J4ouG] [^1133nRGS].

> Next, I should review diagnostic confirmation because clinical signs alone are unreliable. Diagnosis requires compatible symptoms and signs plus radiographic evidence of new infiltrate, typically by chest radiography; in ambulatory settings where imaging is not feasible, clinical judgment guides empiric therapy, but imaging improves diagnostic accuracy and should be obtained when possible [^117J4ouG] [^112FFUZj]. Wait, let me verify the role of ultrasound and CT; lung ultrasound is increasingly used at the bedside, particularly in critical care, and can aid detection of consolidation and pleural effusion, while CT is more sensitive but not routinely indicated initially unless the course is atypical or complications are suspected [^1159tetS].

> I will now examine biomarkers, and I should double-check their limitations. CRP can support diagnosis and exclusion of pneumonia in outpatients, whereas procalcitonin has limited standalone utility for initiating antibiotics in suspected CAP; in HAP, procalcitonin and CRP should not be used to decide whether to start antibiotics, reinforcing that biomarkers supplement, not replace, clinical judgment [^112FFUZj] [^117Psfs2]. But wait, what if I initially thought procalcitonin could reliably distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia? That would be an overstatement; current evidence does not support using procalcitonin alone to withhold antibiotics in suspected CAP, especially early in disease or with viral-bacterial co-infection risk [^112FFUZj].

> Let me consider site-of-care decisions carefully because undertriage increases mortality and overtriage increases costs. The Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) is preferred over CURB-65 to predict 30-day mortality and guide hospitalization decisions, with randomized data showing PSI safely increases outpatient care without worsening outcomes; CURB-65 is simpler but less discriminative, and either tool should be applied with clinical judgment, particularly in younger patients where PSI may underestimate severity [^112irMwM]. I should confirm ICU criteria: direct ICU admission is recommended for septic shock requiring vasopressors or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, with additional severity features guiding step-down or telemetry decisions [^116P1eFg].

> Now, I need to ensure empiric therapy aligns with guideline-concordant, stewardship-minded choices. For healthy adult outpatients without comorbidities, first-line options include amoxicillin, doxycycline, or a macrolide only if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is low; macrolide monotherapy is discouraged where resistance exceeds about 25–30% [^113g1GAS] [^116R7qqa]. For outpatients with comorbidities, a beta-lactam plus doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone is recommended, balancing efficacy and stewardship [^117KRFW6]. For hospitalized nonsevere CAP, a beta-lactam plus macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy are both acceptable, with beta-lactam monotherapy not routinely recommended over these regimens [^117DLH1Y]. For severe CAP, combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus macrolide or beta-lactam plus respiratory fluoroquinolone is recommended; fluoroquinolone monotherapy and beta-lactam plus doxycycline are not recommended for severe disease [^111VxjWa].

> Hold on, I should verify duration and de-escalation principles to avoid overtreatment. A minimum of 5 days is recommended for most CAP, with therapy individualized if there is slow clinical response or MRSA/Pseudomonas involvement; switching to oral therapy is appropriate once the patient is clinically stable, afebrile for 48–72 hours, and able to tolerate oral intake, using the same class when possible to maintain continuity [^11422hz5]. I need to ensure we also address viral-bacterial co-infection: in influenza-positive CAP, start standard antibacterial therapy because bacterial co-infection is common, but consider early discontinuation at 48–72 hours if the patient is clinically stable, has no bacterial pathogen identified, and has low procalcitonin, recognizing the evidence base is limited and evolving [^113tR9LR].

> Next, I should review non-responding pneumonia, and I must be precise about timing and triggers for re-evaluation. Nonresponse is generally defined as lack of clinical improvement after 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy or clinical deterioration at any time; in such cases, I should broaden the differential to include resistant or atypical pathogens, obstructed airways, empyema or abscess, ARDS, pulmonary embolism, or a noninfectious process, and escalate diagnostics with repeat imaging, targeted cultures, and consideration of bronchoscopy or CT as indicated [^114h8CLW] [^116ErqJ6]. Wait, let me verify biomarker use here: persistently elevated or rising CRP or procalcitonin after 3–4 days correlates with treatment failure, but PCT-guided escalation has been associated with harm without survival benefit, so I should not use PCT alone to drive intensification of antibiotics [^114h8CLW].

> I should confirm prevention strategies because they materially change risk. Vaccination is foundational: pneumococcal vaccines, annual influenza vaccination, and COVID-19 vaccination reduce CAP incidence and severity; in older adults, especially nursing home residents, vaccination and early recognition of atypical presentations are critical given blunted fever and cough responses [^117J4ouG] [^115s7PtL]. Let me reconsider other modifiable risks: smoking cessation, hand hygiene, and chronic disease optimization further reduce pneumonia risk and should be emphasized in counseling [^113xsbio].

> But wait, what if the patient has COVID-19 pneumonia or is immunocompromised? I need to ensure I tailor diagnostics and therapy. In COVID-19, test for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza when prevalent, maintain a high index for bacterial co-infection, and apply oxygenation-guided supportive care; antivirals like nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are indicated in eligible patients, while antibiotics should be used when bacterial infection is suspected or confirmed, with de-escalation when cultures are negative and the patient stabilizes [^117J4ouG]. For immunocompromised hosts, broaden the microbiologic workup to include atypicals, fungi, and opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii, and consider early bronchoscopy with BAL; consensus statements provide pathogen-specific guidance and emphasize timely empiric therapy aligned with host risk and local epidemiology [^117F8r49] [^114U5h7i].

> Let me synthesize the key principles so I don't miss anything critical. Early recognition with appropriate imaging, risk-stratified site-of-care decisions, guideline-concordant empiric therapy with stewardship, and vigilant reassessment at 48–72 hours are the cornerstones of CAP management; viral testing in season, attention to non-responding phenotypes, and prevention through vaccination and risk-factor modification meaningfully improve outcomes and should be embedded in routine care [^117J4ouG] [^112hi12x].

Pneumonia is an **infection of the lungs** with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide [^117J4ouG]. It is classified as community-acquired (CAP), hospital-acquired (HAP), or ventilator-associated (VAP) [^112UZsAi], with CAP being the most common [^117J4ouG]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical features plus chest imaging** [^117J4ouG]; in outpatients, CRP can help confirm or exclude pneumonia when imaging is unavailable [^112FFUZj]. Empiric antibiotics are guided by severity and local resistance patterns [^117DLH1Y]; for severe CAP, combination therapy is recommended [^111VxjWa], and therapy should be narrowed to 5–7 days once stable [^11422hz5]. Early recognition, appropriate site-of-care decisions, and adherence to guidelines improve outcomes [^112irMwM] [^117CFqhd].

---

## Classification and etiology

Pneumonia is classified by **setting of acquisition** [^113JQDfQ]:

| **Category** | **Definition** | **Common pathogens** |
|-|-|-|
| Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) | Infection occurring outside healthcare settings | - Streptococcus pneumoniae <br/> - Haemophilus influenzae <br/> - Atypicals (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Legionella) <br/> - Viruses (influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2) [^117J4ouG] |
| Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) | Infection occurring ≥ 48 hours after hospitalization | - Gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae) <br/> - MRSA [^notfound] |
| Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) | Infection occurring ≥ 48 hours after mechanical ventilation | - Similar to HAP, with higher risk of multidrug-resistant organisms [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include cough, fever, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and sputum production [^1155ipN1]; older adults may present with **atypical features** such as confusion or functional decline [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Clinical assessment**: History and exam to assess severity and comorbidities [^117J4ouG].
- **Imaging**: Chest radiography is standard; lung ultrasound or CT may be used when radiography is inconclusive or complications are suspected [^116N8vas].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, CMP, and oxygenation assessment; CRP can aid diagnosis in outpatients when imaging is unavailable [^112FFUZj].
- **Microbiology**: Sputum culture, blood cultures, and urinary antigens for Legionella and pneumococcus in severe cases; viral testing (influenza, SARS-CoV-2) when indicated [^117J4ouG].

---

## Severity assessment

Severity tools guide site-of-care and therapy: **PSI and CURB-65** predict mortality and help decide hospitalization; ICU admission is indicated for septic shock or respiratory failure [^116P1eFg].

---

## Management

### General principles

General principles include **early recognition** with prompt initiation of appropriate therapy [^117CFqhd] and supportive care with oxygen, fluids, and ventilatory support as needed [^notfound]. Antimicrobial stewardship emphasizes narrowing therapy based on cultures and clinical response [^113JD73m].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy is guided by severity, comorbidities, and local resistance patterns [^117DLH1Y]:

| **Setting** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Outpatient, no comorbidities | - Amoxicillin <br/> - Doxycycline <br/> - Macrolide (if resistance < 25%) [^113g1GAS] |
| Outpatient, comorbidities | - Beta-lactam + macrolide <br/> - Beta-lactam + doxycycline <br/> - Respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy [^117KRFW6] |
| Inpatient, non-severe | - Beta-lactam + macrolide <br/> - Respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy [^117DLH1Y] |
| Severe CAP | - Beta-lactam + macrolide <br/> - Beta-lactam + respiratory fluoroquinolone [^111VxjWa] |

---

Duration is typically **5–7 days**, with 7 days for MRSA or Pseudomonas [^11422hz5].

---

## Complications

Complications include **respiratory failure**, sepsis, ARDS, pleural effusion/empyema, and lung abscess; long-term sequelae may include chronic lung disease and increased cardiovascular risk [^115zXsJX].

---

## Prevention

Prevention centers on **vaccination** — pneumococcal, influenza, and COVID-19 — plus smoking cessation, hand hygiene, and infection control in healthcare settings [^113xsbio].

---

## Special populations

- **Immunocompromised**: Broader microbiologic workup and empiric coverage for atypicals, fungi, and opportunistic pathogens [^117F8r49].
- **Elderly**: Higher risk of severe disease, atypical presentations, and complications [^117J4ouG].
- **Pediatrics**: Viral etiologies are common; amoxicillin is first-line for bacterial CAP [^notfound].

---

## Emerging trends

Emerging trends include **increased recognition of viral pneumonia** and the role of rapid molecular diagnostics [^115zXsJX], as well as exploration of shorter antibiotic courses and novel agents under stewardship frameworks [^115ZzQTE].

---

Pneumonia is a major global health burden with substantial morbidity and mortality [^117J4ouG]. Early recognition, accurate diagnosis, severity-based management, and prevention are essential to improve outcomes [^11287jfv].

### COVID-19 pneumonia and immune-related pneumonitis: critical issues on differential diagnosis, potential interactions, and management [^114vBSQc]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic occurred amid the cancer immunotherapy revolution. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become the standard of care for several solid cancers and are associated with peculiar toxicities, including pneumonitis which has similar features to COVID-19 pneumonia.

Areas Covered

We summarize the main hallmarks of lung injury induced by ICIs and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and discuss the critical aspects for differential diagnosis and management. Symptoms and radiological findings are often similar; conversely, treatments are quite different. Furthermore, we focus on potential interactions generating hypotheses that need confirmatory studies.

Expert Opinion

All cancer patients treated with immunotherapy should receive screening for SARS-CoV-2. This would improve the diagnosis and management of pneumonia and guide therapeutic choices. Furthermore, clinicians could estimate the risk/benefit of continuing ICI treatment in COVID-19 positive patients. Temporary withdrawal of the immunotherapy treatment pending resolution of viral infection may be a reasonable option in long-responders patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116xYNzB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with CAP who test positive for influenza — antiviral therapy: We recommend that antiinfluenza treatment, such as oseltamivir, be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest that antiinfluenza treatment be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the outpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Timing data indicate that treatment within 2 days of symptom onset or hospitalization may result in the best outcomes, although there may be benefits up to 4 or 5 days after symptoms begin, and in outpatients most benefit if therapy is received within 48 hours after onset of symptoms.

### Early identification and treatment of pneumonia: a call to action [^112x99DC]. The Lancet: Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

On the seventh World Pneumonia Day on Nov 12, 2015, we call for action to improve the early identification and treatment of childhood pneumonia at community and outpatient level to reduce deaths.

Of the estimated 5.9 million deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2015, pneumonia was one of the leading killers, causing 16% of deaths. Most of these deaths are readily preventable or treatable with proven, cost-effective interventions. Yet treatment is received by half of sick children, and only 54% with symptoms of pneumonia are taken outside the home for care. Therefore, action must be taken immediately to save children's lives by expanding services that allow early identification of symptoms and appropriate treatment.

The case–fatality rate in untreated children with pneumonia is high, sometimes reaching 20%, and death can occur as early as 3 days after illness onset. Early identification of pneumonia and appropriate treatment saves lives. By initiating antibiotic therapy soon after onset of symptoms such as fast breathing in a child with cough, the progression of a pneumonia infection is blunted. In the absence of early intervention, pneumonia progresses to a state where even intravenous antibiotics have limited impact, leading to the high hospital case–fatality rates for children. Of an estimated 15 million hospital admissions for severe and very severe pneumonia globally in 2010, 0.3 million died, approximately 19% in a hospital. Delayed care-seeking behaviour or poor access to hospital care, or both, explained the high number of severe pneumonia cases observed in hospitals.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^114xWhbT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This manuscript brings to light an understudied, underrecognized, and underappreciated clinical challenge: the hospitalized patient with severe pneumonia who is not responding to initial treatment. Clinical studies are needed to bring more robust evidence and to hopefully identify different non-response phenotypes.

We propose a common criterion that spans from sCAP to HAP/VAP, identify the most relevant risk factors, and provide a clinical pathway to investigate these patients in a timely manner to facilitate optimizing care.

The decision-making process consists of two key-components: the comprehensive search for an accurate diagnosis and treatment modification as needed to match the revised diagnosis. The former will ensure that clinicians are not missing an important diagnosis responsible for the initial treatment failure, and the later will offer a concrete approach to make the treatment successful.

In summary, there is an urgent need for better data on the epidemiology of pneumonia non-responders and how best to optimize the therapeutic approach in order to secure the best outcomes for all patients.

### Human metapneumovirus: a review of its epidemiology, clinical features, public health implications and treatment options [^1133nRGS]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance Of The Field

Significant complications arise from Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), especially in susceptible groups. hMPV infection is highly prevalent in children, accounting for about 10% hospitalizations for acute respiratory infections, often resulting in pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Hence, there is need for new knowledge to understand the structure, the clinical features, diagnostics, treatment options and the complications of the hMPV.

Areas Covered In This Review

This review covered the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostics, treatment options and public health implications of hMPV.

What The Reader Will Gain

Knowledge of the clinical manifestation, implications and the methods currently available for diagnosing and treating human metapneumovirus.

Take Home Message

hMPV is a major cause of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), affecting children, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals globally. Symptoms include rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, cough, fever, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Laboratory findings include leucocytosis, leucopenia, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and elevated inflammatory markers. In adults, they often mimic influenza and potentially exacerbate chronic conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. Hospitalisation is often required for infants with significant respiratory distress. The genetic variability and antigenic diversity of the virus complicate vaccine design. Hence, advanced research tailored towards producing effective vaccines treatments for the hMPV viral disease is relevant to contain the complications associated with the virus.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^11421XKj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

### Emergence of novel coronavirus and progress toward treatment and vaccine [^116gRbUU]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

In late December 2019, a group of patients was observed with pneumonia-like symptoms that were linked with a wet market in Wuhan, China. The patients were found to have a novel coronavirus genetically related to a bat coronavirus that was termed SARS-CoV-2. The virus gradually spread worldwide and was declared a pandemic by WHO. Scientists have started trials on potential preventive and treatment options. Currently, there is no specific approved treatment for SARS-CoV-2, and various clinical trials are underway to explore better treatments. Some previously approved antiviral and other drugs have shown some in vitro activity. Here we summarize the fight against this novel coronavirus with particular focus on the different treatment options and clinical trials exploring treatment as well as work done toward development of vaccines.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^1168F72y]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia constitutes one of the most frequent causes of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and it is the most frequent infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions.

After the administration of supportive care and antibiotic therapy, the clinical response of pneumonia is not immediate. Clinicians recognize that the first 48–72h of treatment are crucial for determining the course of the illness. Most hospitalized patients with pneumonia recover with timely and appropriate antibiotic therapy and generally follow an uncomplicated course. However, a sizable proportion of patients may experience non-response and treatment failure, leading to an increased risk of mortality, which can be greater than 40%. There is a lack of epidemiologic data on non-responders and little to no evidence concerning the best clinical approach for this situation. Currently available guidelines do not provide recommendations on how to manage these patients.

There are numerous arbitrary definitions for the critically ill patient with severe pneumonia who is not improving or who is deteriorating despite receiving presumed appropriate antibiotic therapy. The nuances associated with the definitions of "not resolving", "non-responding", or "progressive" pneumonia along with "treatment failure", are largely inconsequential to the clinician who is taking care of a critically ill patient with a diagnosis of pneumonia who is not improving or worsening.

This narrative review aims to give to the clinicians a structured approach on the management of non-responding pneumonia, namely the criteria to define a non-responder and its expected frequency, the differential diagnosis, the optimal diagnostic steps and treatment strategies.

Approach to the patient with unresponsive pneumonia – differential diagnosis

When faced with a non-responding patient with pneumonia, the critical care team must consider three broad possibilities (Fig. 2): 1) their prognostication regarding the expected time to improvement is unrealistic; 2) the antimicrobial treatment is inappropriate due to antimicrobial resistance, the presence of an unexpected infectious agent including a nosocomial pathogen or insufficient source control (e.g. empyema); 3) the patient is suffering from a viral or non-infectious process.

Expected recovery time

Determining the expected recovery time for critically ill patients with pneumonia is not a precise science; nonetheless, it is dependent upon a multitude of factors previously detailed. Delay in initiating appropriate empiric antibiotics or under resuscitation are modifiable risk factors that could result in delayed recovery time or adverse outcomes. While failure of a patient with sCAP to clinically stabilize after 72h of antibiotic therapy has been previously defined as "treatment failure", this time frame may be too long to wait before initiating a re-evaluation of the diagnosis in a critically ill patient. Since appropriate recovery time cannot be accurately estimated, clinicians caring for critically ill patients diagnosed with pneumonia who fail to respond within 72h of antibiotic therapy or who are clinically worsening prior to 72h should reconsider the initial diagnosis and seek both infectious and non-infectious explanations for the patients' unanticipated clinical course (Table 1 and Fig. 2).

### Management of pneumonia in critically ill patients [^117CFqhd]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Severe pneumonia is associated with high mortality (short and long term), as well as pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. Appropriate diagnosis and early initiation of adequate antimicrobial treatment for severe pneumonia are crucial in improving survival among critically ill patients. Identifying the underlying causative pathogen is also critical for antimicrobial stewardship. However, establishing an etiological diagnosis is challenging in most patients, especially in those with chronic underlying disease; those who received previous antibiotic treatment; and those treated with mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, as antimicrobial therapy must be empiric, national and international guidelines recommend initial antimicrobial treatment according to the location's epidemiology; for patients admitted to the intensive care unit, specific recommendations on disease management are available. Adherence to pneumonia guidelines is associated with better outcomes in severe pneumonia. Yet, the continuing and necessary research on severe pneumonia is expansive, inviting different perspectives on host immunological responses, assessment of illness severity, microbial causes, risk factors for multidrug resistant pathogens, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic options.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115TSttT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

In those patients who are hospitalized with pneumonia, mortality is 15%. Close to 90% of deaths attributed to pneumonia are in patients older than 65 years. This article provides the emergency physician with an understanding of how to make the diagnosis, initiate early and appropriate antibiotic therapy, risk stratify patients with respect to the severity of illness, and recognize indications for admission. The discussion is balanced with an emphasis on cost-effective management, an understanding of the changing spectrum of pathogenesis, and a cognizance toward variable and less common presentations.

### Approaches to treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department and the appropriate role of fluoroquinolones [^115rmUvX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The Emergency Department is a critical point of care for patients presenting with signs and symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The initial diagnosis, the decision to admit or discharge, the timing of initiating treatment, and appropriateness of the empirical therapy are key factors in successful management. Rising resistance rates to commonly used CAP antibiotics has complicated empirical treatment. Respiratory fluoroquinolones represent an important therapeutic option for patients with co-morbidities and risk factors for penicillin-, macrolide-, and multi-drug-resistant S. pneumoniae infections. Ensuring appropriate use is required to maintain their high level of effectiveness in key respiratory pathogens. Treatment guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Thoracic Society, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are available to assist emergency physicians in developing clinical pathways to ensure appropriate use of available therapies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113tR9LR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who test positive for influenza — initial antibacterial therapy and potential early discontinuation. We recommend that standard antibacterial treatment be initially prescribed for adults with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient and outpatient settings (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Bacterial pneumonia can occur concurrently with influenza virus infection or present later as a worsening of symptoms in patients who were recovering from their primary influenza virus infection. However in patients with CAP, a positive influenza test, no evidence of a bacterial pathogen (including a low procalcitonin level), and early clinical stability, consideration could be given to earlier discontinuation of antibiotic treatment at 48 to 72 hours; randomized controlled studies are needed to establish whether antibacterial therapy can be stopped at 48 hours in such patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^1155ipN1]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with community-acquired pneumonia often present with cough, fever, chills, fatigue, dyspnea, rigors, and pleuritic chest pain. When a patient presents with suspected community-acquired pneumonia, the physician should first assess the need for hospitalization using a mortality prediction tool, such as the Pneumonia Severity Index, combined with clinical judgment. Consensus guidelines from several organizations recommend empiric therapy with macrolides, fluoroquinolones, or doxycycline. Patients who are hospitalized should be switched from parenteral antibiotics to oral antibiotics after their symptoms improve, they are afebrile, and they are able to tolerate oral medications. Clinical pathways are important tools to improve care and maximize cost-effectiveness in hospitalized patients.

Adult outpatients with acute cough — scope and key clinical questions focus on suspected pneumonia or influenza in nonimmunocompromised patients and frame eight PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome) questions across diagnosis and treatment. The guideline states it "do[es] not include acute bronchitis and other upper respiratory tract infections" and "exclude[s] patients who are immunocompromised". It reports "Eight PICO questions were formulated", addressing diagnostic confirmation (chest radiography plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone; C-reactive protein [CRP] or procalcitonin rather than symptoms alone to predict pneumonia; diagnostic algorithm/clinical prediction rule/diagnostic score plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone to confirm pneumonia; microbiological testing plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone to confirm pneumonia) and therapeutic strategies (antibiotics vs no antibiotics; nonantibiotic therapy vs none; antibiotics with atypical coverage vs without atypical coverage; antiviral therapy vs no antiviral therapy with outcomes including antibiotic prescriptions, visits, hospitalizations, or mortality).

### Managing CAP patients at risk of clinical failure [^115LsUQR]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a curable disease. Both the European and American clinical practice guidelines provide algorithms how to manage patients with CAP. However, as populations worldwide are ageing and bacteria are becoming multidrug resistant, it is necessary to address the major factors that put patients at risk of poor outcome. These may include age, comorbidities, the settings where pneumonia was acquired or treated, the need for hospitalisation or ICU admission, likely causative pathogen (bacteria or virus) in a certain region and their local susceptibility pattern. One complicating fact is the lack of definite causative pathogen in approximately 50% of patients making it difficult to choose the most appropriate antibiotic treatment. When risk factors are present simultaneously in patients, fewer treatment options could be rather challenging for physicians. For example, the presence of comorbidities (renal, cardiac, hepatic) may exclude certain antibiotics due to potential adverse events. Assessing the severity of the disease and monitoring biomarkers, however, could help physicians to estimate patient prognosis once diagnosis is confirmed and treatment has been initiated. This review article addresses the most important risk factors of poor outcome in CAP patients.

Antifungal treatment options — uncomplicated coccidioidal pneumonia: For early uncomplicated coccidioidal infection, the usual adult fluconazole dose is 400 mg daily, and some experts would recommend 800 mg daily. Many experts would recommend a treatment duration ranging from 3 to 6 months or longer, and treatment can be discontinued when signs, symptoms, and inflammatory markers have resolved and serologies and radiographs have stabilized; complete serological resolution is not necessary to discontinue medications. Whether or not antifungal therapy is initiated, all patients will benefit from other elements of a management plan, and no clinical studies exist to guide the optimal dose or duration for primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis.

### Common questions about pneumonia in nursing home residents [^115s7PtL]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Pneumonia in older adults residing in nursing homes can be challenging to diagnose and treat. Pneumococcal and influenza immunizations decrease the risk of pneumonia and are recommended for all nursing home patients. Older adults with pneumonia may not display classic signs and symptoms of infection, although most have at least one respiratory symptom. Suspicion of pneumonia is heightened if pulse oximetry measurements are low. The diagnosis of pneumonia is confirmed by chest radiography. To determine whether treatment is necessary and where treatment should occur, the patient's overall prognosis should be considered. If treatment is to occur, antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible for a duration of five to eight days; however, treatment may be extended in the absence of clinical resolution or in the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Oral antibiotics may be administered in the nursing home, whereas hospitalized patients should initially receive intravenous antibiotics and transition to oral antibiotics after clinical improvement. Antibiotic regimens for patients treated in the nursing home include a respiratory fluoroquinolone, or a beta-lactam antibiotic with a macrolide. Hospitalized patients may receive the same regimens, although several other oral and intravenous options are acceptable. Patients' prognosis can be accurately estimated using the SOAR score (which uses systolic blood pressure, oxygenation, age, and respiratory rate).

### Early clinical response in community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: from clinical endpoint to clinical practice [^116mob4D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

METHODS

OPTIC was a global, phase III, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, noninferiority CABP study (Figure 1). It compared 7–14 days of omadacycline at 100 mg IV every 24 hours (q24h; initial 2 doses were every 12 hours [q12h]), including an option to transition to 300 mg orally q24h after 3 days of treatment, or moxifloxacin at 400 mg IV q24h, including an option to transition to 400 mg orally q24h after 3 days of treatment. Adults aged ≥ 18 years of age with ≥ 3 protocol-specified CABP symptoms (cough, production of purulent sputum, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain); abnormal vital signs; laboratory abnormalities associated with CABP; disease categorized as being Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class II, III, or IV at screening; and radiographically confirmed pneumonia were enrolled. Full entry criteria for this study and an overview of causative pathogens have been published previously.

OPTIC study design. Abbreviations: CABP, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia; IV, intravenous; OPTIC, Omadacycline for Pneumonia Treatment In the Community.

The ECR primary efficacy endpoint was programmatically defined as symptom improvement at 72–120 hours after the first dose of study drug, no use of rescue antibiotics, and patient survival. CABP symptoms were characterized using a 4-point scale (absent, mild, moderate, or severe) by the investigator. Symptom improvement was defined as ≥ 1 level improvement (eg, severe to moderate) in ≥ 2 CABP symptoms, with no worsening by ≥ 1 level in other CABP symptoms.

Investigator assessment of clinical response was determined at the PTE (5–10 days after the last dose of study drug). Clinical success at PTE was defined as survival with resolution or improvement in signs and symptoms of infection and with no need for further antibacterial therapy.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^113TVViM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic cavitary coccidioidal pneumonia — indications for surgical resection (Recommendation 9): We recommend that surgical options be explored when the cavities are persistently symptomatic despite antifungal treatment. We recommend that surgical options be considered when cavities have been present for more than 2 years and if symptoms recur whenever antifungal treatment is stopped (strong, very low). Early literature indicates that approximately half of coccidioidal cavities close within 2 years of the initial infection, so it is therefore recommended that surgical resection be avoided for this period; after a cavity has been documented to be present for > 2 years, surgical options seem more appropriate with persistent or recurrent symptoms, often when cavities are large, near the pleural surface, and cause pleuritic pain, chronic symptomatic infection, or frequent or severe hemoptysis.

### How would you treat this patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^111p1VTX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, leading to 1.5 million hospitalizations and at least 200 000 deaths annually. The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia provides an evidence-based overview of this common illness. Here, 2 experts, a general internist who served as the co-primary author of the guidelines and a pulmonary and critical care physician, debate the management of a patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. They discuss disease severity stratification methods, whether to use adjunctive corticosteroids, and when to prescribe empirical treatment for multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Pneumonia [^113JQDfQ]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Pneumonia is a common acute respiratory infection that affects the alveoli and distal airways; it is a major health problem and associated with high morbidity and short-term and long-term mortality in all age groups worldwide. Pneumonia is broadly divided into community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. A large variety of microorganisms can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, respiratory viruses and fungi, and there are great geographical variations in their prevalence. Pneumonia occurs more commonly in susceptible individuals, including children of < 5 years of age and older adults with prior chronic conditions. Development of the disease largely depends on the host immune response, with pathogen characteristics having a less prominent role. Individuals with pneumonia often present with respiratory and systemic symptoms, and diagnosis is based on both clinical presentation and radiological findings. It is crucial to identify the causative pathogens, as delayed and inadequate antimicrobial therapy can lead to poor outcomes. New antibiotic and non-antibiotic therapies, in addition to rapid and accurate diagnostic tests that can detect pathogens and antibiotic resistance will improve the management of pneumonia.

### Does empiric therapy for atypical pathogens improve outcomes for patients with CAP? [^116gfmsu]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The present controversy regarding the need to cover atypical pathogens in the empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia is related to several issues, including the relevance of terminology, imprecise diagnostic methods, and perceived contradictory results of published evidence. Studies evaluating the time to clinical recovery and the use of earlier endpoints for evaluation suggest that appropriate therapy provides a benefit if an atypical pathogen is a pathogen. Because recent surveillance studies suggest these pathogens are common and until there is the availability of accurate, cost-effective, and easily interpreted laboratory tests to provide the etiologic diagnosis at the time of point of care, empiric therapy of atypical pathogens is supported.

Defining health care-associated pneumonia, which includes both hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), is problematic and controversial. Aspiration pneumonia is often included as a subtype of HAP but may be related to community-acquired aspiration events. Scoring systems exist and new surveillance guidelines have been implemented to make early recognition of pneumonia more precise and objective. Management and prevention should follow recommendations, including early empirical therapy, targeted therapy, and limited duration of treatment. Patients with trauma present a challenge to the diagnosis and management of pneumonia, because of increased risk for aspiration and underlying chest and pulmonary injury.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^11287jfv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi and can be prevented through vaccination with pneumococcal, influenza, and COVID-19 vaccines. Diagnosis requires suggestive history and physical findings in conjunction with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. Laboratory testing can help guide therapy. Important issues in treatment include choosing the proper venue, timely initiation of the appropriate antibiotic or antiviral, appropriate respiratory support, deescalation after negative culture results, switching to oral therapy, and short treatment duration.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — follow-up chest imaging after clinical improvement: In adults with CAP whose symptoms have resolved within 5 to 7 days, we suggest not routinely obtaining follow-up chest imaging (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Reported rates of malignancy after CAP range from 1.3% to 4%, with abnormal findings reaching 5% when nonmalignant pathology is included; one longer-term study found 9.2% developed new cancer with a mean time to diagnosis of 297 days, and only 27% were diagnosed within 90 days of discharge, while the positive yield from repeat imaging ranges from 0.2% to 5%.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: what is relevant and what is not? [^116LA8Eg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in North America. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for community-acquired pneumonia management.

Recent Findings

All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other atypical organisms, but clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens.

Summary

The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of community-acquired pneumonia prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^117D5zA2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia, based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the current guideline recommendations.

Recent Findings

Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

Summary

The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

### Advances in the causes and management of community acquired pneumonia in adults [^115zXsJX]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Community acquired pneumonia remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Usually, the causal organism is not identified and treatment remains empiric. Recent computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies have challenged the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, and epidemiologic studies are changing our perspective of what causes community acquired pneumonia, especially the role of viral pathogens and the frequent finding of multiple pathogens. The past decade has seen increasing overuse of empiric coverage of meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic resistant Gram negative pathogens owing to inappropriate application of guidelines for healthcare associated pneumonia. Optimal treatment remains a matter for debate, especially in very sick patients, including the role of combination antibiotic therapy and corticosteroids. Pneumonia care bundles are being defined to improve outcomes. Increased recognition of both acute and long term cardiac complications is shifting our concept of pneumonia from an acute lung disease to a multisystem problem with adverse chronic health consequences.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a consensus statement regarding initial strategies [^117F8r49]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines have improved the treatment and outcomes of patients with CAP, primarily by standardization of initial empirical therapy. But current society-published guidelines exclude immunocompromised patients.

Research Question

There is no consensus regarding the initial treatment of immunocompromised patients with suspected CAP.

Study Design and Methods

This consensus document was created by a multidisciplinary panel of 45 physicians with experience in the treatment of CAP in immunocompromised patients. The Delphi survey methodology was used to reach consensus.

Results

The panel focused on 21 questions addressing initial management strategies. The panel achieved consensus in defining the population, site of care, likely pathogens, microbiologic workup, general principles of empirical therapy, and empirical therapy for specific pathogens.

Interpretation

This document offers general suggestions for the initial treatment of the immunocompromised patient who arrives at the hospital with pneumonia.

### Community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization: rational decision making and interpretation of guidelines [^1143zzhv]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on the evidence base for guideline recommendations on the diagnosis, the optimal choice, timing and duration of empirical antibiotic therapy, and the use of microbiological tests for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): issues for which guidelines are frequently used as a quick reference. Furthermore, we will discuss possibilities for future research in these topics.

Recent Findings

Many national and international guideline recommendations, even on critical elements of CAP management, are based on low-to-moderate quality evidence.

Summary

The diagnosis and management of CAP has hardly changed for decades. The recommendation to cover atypical pathogens in all hospitalized CAP patients is based on observational studies only and is challenged by two recent trials. The following years, improved diagnostic testing, radiologically by low-dose Computed Tomography or ultrasound and/or microbiologically by point-of-care multiplex PCR, has the potential to largely influence the choice and start of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized CAP patients. Rapid microbiological testing will hopefully improve antibiotic de-escalation or early pathogen-directed therapy, both potent ways of reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Current guideline recommendations on the timing and duration of antibiotic therapy are based on limited evidence, but will be hard to improve.

### Combination of clinical symptoms and blood biomarkers can improve discrimination between bacterial or viral community-acquired pneumonia in children [^1176wMLR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Empiric use of antibiotics remains as cornerstone of treating pneumonia in the absence of effective point-of-care diagnostics for differentiating bacterial from viral infection. Many children who have viral pneumonia will continue to receive antibiotics without benefit. Early reliable detection of viral pneumonia, or early exclusion of bacterial pneumonia, could reduce unnecessary antibiotic therapy, thereby mitigating the risk of emerging antibiotic resistance. While we have been unable to identify a single biomarker or clinical feature that could be used to confidently distinguish bacterial from viral pneumonia, our findings suggest there may be utility in more sophisticated algorithms that integrate a number of clinical, microbiological, inflammatory biomarker, or radiological factors to improve pneumonia diagnostics and better targeting therapies.

### Delay in seeking healthcare for pneumonia and associated factors among mothers / caregivers of children aged 2–59 months in public health facilities in nekemte town, Ethiopia [^1113PXcY]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Study variables

Dependent variable

Delay in healthcare seeking for pneumonia in children aged 2–59 months.

Independent variables

The independent variables included socio-demographic factors (caregivers' age, gender, monthly income, place of residence, family size, occupation, religion, and marital status, as well as the age and gender of the children), facility-related factors (type of health facility, mode of transportation, and distance to the nearest health facility for mothers, cost for treatment, and waiting time), and caregivers' knowledge (previous knowledge of seeking medical attention, warning signs, symptoms, and signs of pneumonia, among other things).

Operational definitions

Delay in seeking healthcare for pneumonia: seeking healthcare at the public health facility after 24 hours from when the caregiver recognized the signs and symptoms of pneumonia, including cough and fast breathing.

Promptness in seeking healthcare: seeking healthcare for pneumonia at a public health facility within 24 hours from when the mother/caregiver recognized the signs and symptoms of pneumonia, including cough and fast breathing.

Healthcare: treatment provided by a recognized public health facility that offers services for promotion, prevention, and healing.

Self-medication: is when mothers identify their children's illness, initiate all treatment options, and use them without a medical prescription.

Traditional medicine: Patients who appear to be ill or sick are treated using spiritual, religious, and practice-based knowledge.

Good knowledge: Mothers or caregivers who correctly answer ≥ 80% of knowledge assessing questions.

Poor knowledge: Mothers or caregivers who correctly answer < 80% of knowledge assessing questions.

Severe pneumonia: Severe respiratory distress (e.g. grunting, extremely severe chest pain), central cyanosis (oxygen saturation 90%), or indicators of pneumonia with a general danger sign (inability to breastfeed or drink, lethargy or lowered level of consciousness, convulsions) are all indications of severe pneumonia.

Non-severe pneumonia: Cough and rapid breathing (if it is less than 50 breaths per minute in children aged 2 to 11 months and < 40 breaths per minute in children aged 1 to 5 years) or cough and chest in a drawing without danger indications are symptoms of non-severe pneumonia.

### New guidelines for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^116nZujz]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We highlight the recent advances in the guidelines for treating patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP).

Recent Findings

sCAP is a significant cause of hospital admissions. We performed an extensive review of the literature, covering studies from the last several years, to summarise the most important points in the diagnosis and treatment of patients hospitalised with sCAP.

Summary

sCAP is associated with a high clinical burden. Therefore, deep knowledge is necessary for its management. In general, diagnosis, treatment and management are based on many published guidelines. However, the mortality rate is still unacceptably high, indicating the need for clear recommendations in the management of patients with sCAP. The choice of empirical antibiotic therapy for sCAP depends on multiple factors, such as national and local antimicrobial susceptibility data and the characteristics of the patients, including their risk factors for acquiring infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. Currently, there are several published international guidelines. The aim of this review is to explore the areas that require further knowledge and new recommendations for current clinical practice.

### Health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP): a critical appraisal to improve identification, management, and outcomes – proceedings of the HCAP summit [^113ratEg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Increasingly, patients are receiving treatment at facilities other than hospitals, including long-term-health care facilities, assisted-living environments, rehabilitation facilities, and dialysis centers. As with hospital environments, nonhospital settings present their own unique risks of pneumonia. Traditionally, pneumonia in these facilities has been categorized as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, the new designation for pneumonias acquired in these settings is health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP), which covers pneumonias acquired in health care environments outside of the traditional hospital setting and excludes hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and CAP. Although HCAP is currently treated with the same protocols as CAP, recent evidence indicates that HCAP differs from CAP with respect to pathogens and prognosis and, in fact, more closely resembles HAP and VAP. The HCAP Summit convened national infectious disease opinion leaders for the purpose of analyzing current literature, clinical trial data, diagnostic considerations, therapeutic options, and treatment guidelines related to HCAP. After an in-depth analysis of these areas, the infectious disease investigators participating in the summit were surveyed with regard to 10 clinical practice statements. The results were then compared with results of the same survey as completed by 744 Infectious Diseases Society of America members. The similarities and differences between those survey results are the basis of this publication.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: the evolving challenge [^11314Sjb]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that has been the focus of a major international research effort to define its epidemiology, etiology and management. The microbial etiology of CAP is complex and severity assessment is important in identifying at-risk populations as well as defining therapeutic strategies. Laboratory investigations rarely influence initial therapy, which remains empirical. Guidelines have been developed in many countries in response to the need to optimize management and outcomes. However, many of these guidelines have been based on expert opinion rather than robust evidence. New evidence-based guidelines have been developed that take into account disease severity, the local distribution of pathogens and their likely susceptibility to antimicrobials, and that include newer treatment options. Macrolide and fluoroquinolone antimicrobials feature heavily in these new treatment recommendations. Promising new therapies continue to emerge that may offer advantages over fluoroquinolones and macrolides, in particular with regard to the problem of resistance. Of these, the ketolides are of special interest. Telithromycin, the first ketolide antibacterial, has been evaluated in the treatment of > 700 patients with CAP. A once-daily oral dose of telithromycin 800 mg for 7–10 days produces clinical and bacteriological success rates > 90% and equivalent to standard comparator agents, whilst maintaining efficacy against resistant pathogens.

### Update of the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the ICU [^11326oRW]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

This point of view article summarizes the recently published literature on the management of nosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill patients that require invasive respiratory support, both those arising from hospital wards that ultimately require ICU admission and those associated with mechanical ventilation. Experts were selected on the basis of their contrasted experience in the field of nosocomial infections, including specialists in anaesthesia and in intensive care medicine. An extensive search of the literature was performed by the authors using the MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane library databases, from 2009 to October 2019, aimed to retrieve relevant studies on diagnosis and treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in ICU patients especially randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT), systematic reviews, meta-analysis and expert consensus articles. Priorities have been established in regard to the management, agreed by the group and based on risk factors for their development and prognostic factors. Moreover, the most important clinical entities, methods of rapid diagnostics in clinical microbiological available and new antibiotic treatments recently added to the therapeutic options have been reviewed and updated. After the analysis of the priorities outlined, recommendations that can be applied have been included. An algorithm that takes into account the priorities analysed to update empirical and targeted treatment in ICUs has also been designed.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia: current outcomes, epidemiology, etiology, and therapy [^113MzA3i]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia is a clinical diagnosis with a significant impact on healthcare management around the world, with the highest morbidity and mortality of all of the forms of community-acquired pneumonia. Patients with severe pneumonia usually require intensive care unit management, including vasopressors or mechanical ventilation. Early clinical suspicion and prompt empiric antimicrobial therapies are mandatory in patients with severe pneumonia. A number of recent studies and guidelines addressing these issues have been published, and they will be reviewed in this article.

### Evaluation of antiviral therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in shanghai, China [^116segtw]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of antiviral drugs on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled and divided into seven groups according to the treatment option. Information including age, sex, and duration from illness onset to admission, clinical manifestations, and laboratory data at admission, and length of hospital stay were evaluated. The chest computed tomography (CT) imaging obtained at admission and after a 5-day treatment cycle were assessed. The clinical symptoms and laboratory tests at discharge were also assessed. At admission, no significant differences were found among the groups, including the duration from illness onset to admission, clinical symptoms, and main laboratory results. No significant differences were found among the groups in terms of the proportion of patients with pneumonia resolution (P = 0.151) after treatment or the length of hospital stay (P = 0.116). At discharge, 7 of 184 (4%) patients had a mild cough while their other symptoms had disappeared, and the proportion of patients with abnormal liver function and with increased leukocytes, neutrophils or erythrocyte sedimentation rate among the 184 patients were close to those at admission. According to the results, the inclusion of antiviral drugs in therapeutic regimens based on symptomatic treatment had no significant additional impact on the improvement in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the results of chest CT imaging, clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests at discharge were not completely consistent.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable from an antibiotic stewardship perspective. Amoxicillin, which is the first-choice treatment for CAP based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and is also listed as a first-choice option in many guidelines outside the United States, is only recommended in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, together with doxycycline and macrolides as equivalent options, for patients without comorbidities (very broadly stated as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia").

### Healthcare-associated pneumonia: the state of evidence to date [^111K4bVL]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As evidence about the importance of correct choice of empiric therapy in the setting of pneumonia accumulates, balancing antibiotic spectrum against the risk of selecting for resistant organisms gains importance. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) defines a set of risk factors to underscore the probability of a resistant etiologic pathogen, requiring broader spectrum treatment than is generally needed in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Controversies persist as to whether HCAP is a useful designation for diagnosis, treatment and outcome prediction.

Recent Findings

HCAP represents a discrete syndrome, where offending organisms and outcomes differ from those for CAP. However, HCAP designation is neither a sensitive nor a specific system to predict the presence of a resistant organism. Several other instruments have been developed that require prospective validation. Recent findings that CAP guideline-concordant antibiotic treatment among HCAP patients does not alter outcomes is confounded by the emerging understanding that culture-negative HCAP may be successfully treated with therapy targeted at CAP pathogens.

Summary

Because HCAP is an important emerging syndrome, a systematic approach to its study is critical. As evidence in this area evolves, it remains important for investigators and clinicians to identify knowledge gaps and to set the research agenda to resolve multiple unanswered questions.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: a review [^117J4ouG]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) results in approximately 1.4 million emergency department visits, 740 000 hospitalizations, and 41 000 deaths in the US annually.

Observations

Community-acquired pneumonia can be diagnosed in a patient with 2 or more signs (eg, temperature > 38 °C or ≤ 36 °C; leukocyte count < 4000/μL or > 10 000/μL) or symptoms (eg, new or increased cough or dyspnea) of pneumonia in conjunction with consistent radiographic findings (eg, air space density) without an alternative explanation. Up to 10% of patients with CAP are hospitalized; of those, up to 1 in 5 require intensive care. Older adults (≥ 65 years) and those with underlying lung disease, smoking, or immune suppression are at highest risk for CAP and complications of CAP, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Only 38% of patients hospitalized with CAP have a pathogen identified. Of those patients, up to 40% have viruses identified as the likely cause of CAP, with Streptococcus pneumoniae identified in approximately 15% of patients with an identified etiology of the pneumonia. All patients with CAP should be tested for COVID-19 and influenza when these viruses are common in the community because their diagnosis may affect treatment (eg, antiviral therapy) and infection prevention strategies. If test results for influenza and COVID-19 are negative or when the pathogens are not likely etiologies, patients can be treated empirically to cover the most likely bacterial pathogens. When selecting empirical antibacterial therapy, clinicians should consider disease severity and evaluate the likelihood of a bacterial infection-or resistant infection-and risk of harm from overuse of antibacterial drugs. Hospitalized patients without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days. Systemic corticosteroid administration within 24 hours of development of severe CAP may reduce 28-day mortality.

Conclusions

Community-acquired pneumonia is common and may result in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or death. First-line therapy varies by disease severity and etiology. Hospitalized patients with suspected bacterial CAP and without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117DLH1Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The panel suggests that β-lactam monotherapy should not be routinely used for inpatients with CAP over fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112FFUZj]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Adult outpatients with acute cough — conclusions and practice suggestions emphasize that there should be an assessment of clinical symptoms and signs, and those suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to improve diagnostic accuracy. Measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels strengthens both the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumonia, whereas there was no added benefit of measuring procalcitonin levels in this setting. Microbiological diagnostic testing should be considered when the results may indicate a change in therapy. For outpatient adults with acute cough, we suggest the use of empiric antibiotics when pneumonia is suspected based on epidemiologic and clinical features in settings in which imaging cannot be performed, but where there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, we do not suggest the routine use of antibiotics. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for or against specific nonantibiotic, symptomatic therapies. For suspected influenza, we suggest that initiating antiviral treatment within 48 hours of symptoms could be associated with decreased antibiotic use and hospitalization and improved outcomes.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for Pneumocystis pneumonia, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ECIL 2016 guidelines recommend to use composite criteria to assess the need for diagnostic bronchoscopy and empiric treatment for PCP, as single clinical diagnostic criteria are insufficient to prove the diagnosis:

- patient at risk

- clinical signs and symptoms, such as dyspnea and/or cough, fever, hypoxemia, chest pain

- imaging findings compatible with PCP, preferably chest CT

- with or without unexplained serum LDH elevation.

### Applying the lessons learned from coronavirus disease 2019 to improve pneumonia management [^1145T8Ea]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has produced an extraordinary amount of literature in a short time period. This review focuses on what the new literature has provided in terms of more general information about the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Recent Findings

Measures taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have caused a significant drop in influenza worldwide. Improvements in imaging, especially ultrasound, and especially in the application of rapid molecular diagnosis are likely to have significant impact on the management of CAP. Therapeutic advances are so far limited.

Summary

COVID-19 has taught us that we can do far more to prevent seasonal influenza and its associated mortality, morbidity and economic cost. Improvements in imaging and pathogen diagnosis are welcome, as is the potential for secondary benefits of anti-COVID-19 therapies that may have reach effect on respiratory viruses other than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. As community-transmission is likely to persist for many years, recognition and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will need to be incorporated into CAP guidelines moving forward.

### Biomarkers: what is their benefit in the identification of infection, severity assessment, and management of community-acquired pneumonia? [^114ubyXL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Biomarkers have been proposed as tools that can guide the management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, providing information that supplements the usually available clinical data. Among the available biomarkers, procalcitonin has been studied extensively and seems promising for several purposes. The use of biomarkers needs further study, to validate their utility in daily practice, especially given the limitations of the current tools for identifying the need for antibiotic therapy in patients with influenza and secondary bacterial pneumonia, in patients with aspiration syndromes, and in those infected with atypical pathogens.

Background

The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and its clinical manifestation as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents an unparalleled worldwide public health problem. As reported on July 14, 2020, the pandemic of COVID-19 has already infected 12,964,809 patients and provoked 570,288 deaths (mortality of 4.39%). The disease introduces a unique pathophysiology and clinical course that puzzles the efficacy of the currently existing therapeutic approaches. This editorial presents an overview of the clinical experience gathered thus far from different centers around the world, and is not meant to constitute a guideline nor a standard of care for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, given that the level of evidence behind the clinical approach to these patients is rapidly evolving.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^114h8CLW]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
How and when to define a non-responding pneumonia; a patient is considered a non-responder after at least 48-72h of appropriate antibiotic therapy; the identification of non-response results from an integrated re-evaluation of clinical signs and symptoms, lab results namely biomarkers, microbiologic results and no improvement or further progression of imaging infiltrates (see manuscript)

Table 1
Approach to non-responding pneumonia

ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome; CRP C-reactive protein; PCT procalcitonin; WBC white blood cell count

The natural history of non-responder ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is similar to sCAP, that is no clinical improvement within the first 72h of receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy (Fig. 1). The most reliable clinical indicator that a patient with VAP is not responding is lack of improvement in the PaO2:FiO2 within the first 3 days (Table 1). Sustained fever is less specific but does indicate an unresolved inflammatory process, one cause of which could be inadequately treated pneumonia. Persistently elevated and/or rising CRP or PCT values after 3–4 days of treatment are also associated with treatment failure. However, a non-decreasing or increasing PCT during antibiotic therapy should not be used to guide antibiotic escalation or intensify diagnostics. A RCT of antimicrobial spectrum escalation in patients with persistently elevated or rising PCT values versus routine care reported that PCT-guided intensification led to more organ-related harm and prolonged ICU length of stay compared to routine care, without improvement in survival rates. Sustained leukocytosis and radiographic infiltrates are features of non-responding pneumonia but are not specific for pneumonia.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in an ambulatory setting [^113aEzsS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and advances in critical care. Frequently, the diagnosis is confounded by coexisting cardiac or pulmonary conditions. Recognition of patients at risk for complications from pneumonia is critical when making the decision of how and where to treat. This review summarizes the diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia with oral antibiotics in an outpatient setting. Specific pathogens and clinical presentations in certain at-risk populations are highlighted. Also presented are validated algorithms for evaluating and identifying patients who may be at risk for serious complications of pneumonia and require treatment in an inpatient setting.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112irMwM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — site-of-care decision support recommends a validated clinical prediction rule for prognosis, preferentially the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) over the CURB-65 (tool based on confusion, urea level, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age ≥ 65) (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence), to determine the need for hospitalization in adults diagnosed with CAP; both the PSI and CURB-65 were developed to predict 30-day mortality, and when compared with CURB-65, PSI identifies larger proportions of patients at low risk and has a higher discriminative power in predicting mortality; two multicenter, cluster-randomized trials demonstrated that use of the PSI safely increases the proportion of patients who can be treated in the outpatient setting, and these trials and one additional randomized controlled trial (RCT) support the safety of using the PSI to guide the initial site of treatment without worsening mortality or other clinically relevant outcomes; when used as a decision aid, the PSI should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment; in comparison to the PSI, there is less evidence that CURB-65 is effective as a decision aid, with one pre–post, controlled before–after study using an electronically calculated version of CURB-65, PaO2/FiO2 < 300, absence of pleural effusion, and fewer than three minor ATS severity criteria observing no significant increase in the use of outpatient treatment of adults with CAP; providing a conditional recommendation to use CURB-65 considers its greater simplicity of use relative to the PSI, and the PSI may underestimate illness severity among younger patients because, for example, all systolic blood pressures < 90 mm Hg are considered abnormal regardless of baseline and actual measurement.

### Atypical pneumonia: definition, causes, and imaging features [^111Dk6Ny]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is among the most common causes of death worldwide. The epidemiologic and clinical heterogeneity of pneumonia results in challenges in diagnosis and treatment. There is inconsistency in the definition of the group of microorganisms that cause "atypical pneumonia". Nevertheless, the use of this term in the medical and radiologic literature is common. Among the causes of community-acquired pneumonia, atypical bacteria are responsible for approximately 15% of cases. Zoonotic and nonzoonotic bacteria, as well as viruses, have been considered among the causes of atypical pneumonia in a patient who is immunocompetent and have been associated with major community outbreaks of respiratory infection, with relevant implications in public health policies. Considering the difficulty of isolating atypical microorganisms and the significant overlap in clinical manifestations, a targeted empirical therapy is not possible. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of atypical pneumonia, as in many cases its findings may first suggest the possibility of an atypical infection. Clarifying and unifying the definition of atypical pneumonia among the medical community, including radiologists, are of extreme importance. The prompt diagnosis and prevention of community spread of some atypical microorganisms can have a relevant impact on local, regional, and global health policies. © RSNA, 2021.

3.3 COVID‐19

There are no reported in vitro studies of COVID‐19. Four patients with COVID‐19 were given antiviral treatment including LPV/r. After treatment, three patients showed significant improvement in pneumonia‐associated symptoms, two of whom were confirmed to be COVID‐19 negative and discharged, and one of whom was negative for the virus at the first test. This study shows the positive effects of LPV/r therapy. Two reviews, including a Chinese review and communication showed that LPV may be drug treatment option for COVID‐19. However, a retrospective study enrolled 134 NCP patients revealed that there is no significant difference between LPV/r‐treated group (n = 52), Abidol‐treated group (n = 34), and control group (n = 48) in improving symptom or in reducing viral loads. The negative rate of COVID‐19 nucleic acid on the 7 day was 71.8%, 82.6%, and 77.1%, respectively (P = 0.79). The efficacy of LPV/r antiviral treatment warrants further verification in future studies. Nine randomized controlled trials of LPV/r in patients with COVID‐19 have been registered in China up to February 22 (Table 4). Currently, the combination of LPV/r is a recommended antiviral regimen in the latest version of the Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID‐19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.

Regarding medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to initiation of treatment, ATS/IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend to do not use procalcitonin measurement,
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sTREM-1 determination,
or CRP,
in addition to clinical criteria, to decide whether or not to initiate antibiotic therapy in patients with suspected HAP.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1159tetS]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in individuals with HIV — diagnosis general approach indicates that patients with clinical symptoms and signs suggestive of CAP should have posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs; evidence of pneumonia can also be found on chest computed tomography (CT) scan, but routine use of chest CT scan for this purpose is not recommended; lung ultrasound can also be used to aid in the diagnosis pneumonia; if previous radiographs are available, they should be reviewed; the clinical diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia requires a demonstrable infiltrate by chest radiograph or other imaging technique with compatible clinical symptoms and signs; the differential diagnosis is broad and a confirmed microbiologic diagnosis should be pursued, with microbial identification allowing clinicians to target the specific pathogen(s) and discontinue broad spectrum antibiotic therapy and/or empiric therapy that targets non-bacterial pathogens; microbiologic testing should include evaluation of the upper respiratory tract for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza in the appropriate season and may include testing other respiratory viruses; given the increased incidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) in individuals with HIV, a tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis should always be considered.

### Pneumonia prevention and… [^113xsbio]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs.
- Pneumonia affects millions of people worldwide each year.
- Pneumonia can often be prevented and can usually be treated.
- You can lower your risk of pneumonia with immunizations and other healthy living practices. Overview Immunizations and appropriate treatment could prevent many deaths from pneumonia each year. Who is at risk Some people are at increased risk for pneumonia due to age, other health conditions, and certain behaviors. Keep Reading: Risk Factors. Prevention steps and strategies Vaccination and immunization Vaccines against bacterial infections Vaccines can help prevent infection by some of the bacteria that can cause pneumonia.

Learn more about vaccines for each of the following bacterial infections, including who should get them: Immunizations against viral infections Vaccines, antibody products, or both can help prevent infection by some of the viruses that can cause pneumonia. Learn more about the immunization strategy for each of the following viral infections, including who should get them: See Also: Safety Information by Vaccine. Healthy living practices Avoid people who are sick. If you are sick, stay away from others as much as possible to keep from getting them sick. You can also help prevent respiratory infections by:

- Washing your hands regularly
- Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that are touched a lot
- Coughing or sneezing into a tissue or into your elbow or sleeve
- Limiting contact with cigarette smoke or quitting smoking
- Taking good care of chronic medical conditions.

Pneumonia around the world Globally, pneumonia killed more than 740, 000 children younger than 5 years old in 2019. This is greater than the number of deaths from any infectious disease, such as HIV infection, malaria, or tuberculosis. Annual observance day World Pneumonia Day is observed each year on November 12 to highlight this global crisis.

### Empiric antibiotic therapy for Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children: a pro / con discussion [^112LWS1z]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common respiratory pathogen of increasing clinical interest as cases have recently risen in the United States and worldwide following a period of reduced activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. While most cases are mild, Mycoplasma pneumoniae can cause severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and cannot be reliably distinguished from other common causes of CAP based solely on features of clinical presentation or imaging. However, testing to confirm a diagnosis of M. pneumoniae, when it is suspected, can be logistically challenging in some clinical settings. It also remains unclear which patients with M. pneumoniae CAP benefit from antibiotic treatment, raising the question of whether treatment should be offered, particularly when the diagnosis is not confirmed. This pro/con discussion explores the available data to support or refute routine testing and empiric antibiotic treatment for M. pneumoniae.

### Factors associated with treatment failure in moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^117XVXpo]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the risk factors for treatment failure in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who reached clinical stability after 3 days of β-lactam treatment?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial that included 291 adults, only male sex and age were associated with failure in the multivariable analysis. These results were independent of antibiotic treatment duration and biomarker levels.

Meaning

In this study, among patients with CAP who reached clinical stability after 3 days of antibiotic treatment, male sex and age were associated with higher risk of failure, suggesting that these factors should be taken in account in the treatment of patients with the condition.
