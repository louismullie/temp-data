## Question

Aspirin overdose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about aspirin overdose management, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and airway/ventilation priorities. Then, I should verify the indications for gastric decontamination and the timing of activated charcoal. Next, I will review acid–base management and urine alkalinization. After that, I need to check indications for extracorporeal therapy and the preferred modality. I will then examine special populations and delayed absorption scenarios. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, disposition, and follow-up, and reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and neurologic status, because salicylate toxicity can rapidly progress from hyperventilation to respiratory failure and altered mental status, and I need to ensure we do not suppress the patient's respiratory drive prematurely since compensatory hyperventilation maintains alkalemia and delays acidosis; I should avoid intubation unless absolutely necessary, and if intubated, I must match minute ventilation to pre-intubation levels to prevent precipitous acidemia and worsening salicylate distribution into the brain [^113MawgG].

> Wait, let me verify the decontamination strategy before I jump ahead; I initially thought gastric lavage might be broadly indicated, but hold on, that's outdated for routine use, and current guidance favors activated charcoal when available, safe, and timely, ideally within 1 hour and up to 3–4 hours for enteric-coated or massive ingestions, while avoiding ipecac-induced emesis and not delaying transport to give charcoal; I should double-check that enteric-coated aspirin can have erratic absorption and justify later charcoal or even multidose charcoal in select cases, and I need to ensure the airway is protected before any GI intervention [^116GkZ5z] [^113Vtkxd] [^114QkYyJ] [^114tXp9h].

> I need to check the acid–base plan next; serial ABGs and serum electrolytes are essential because salicylates uncouple oxidative phosphorylation and shift from early respiratory alkalosis to mixed or predominant metabolic acidosis, and I should correct volume deficits with isotonic fluids while initiating urine alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate to enhance renal clearance, targeting urine pH above 7.5 if feasible and monitoring for hypokalemia and fluid overload; let me reconsider the bicarbonate dosing — often 1–2 mEq/kg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion with dextrose-containing fluids is used, titrating to urine pH and clinical response, and I should confirm that alkalinization shortens salicylate half-life and improves elimination [^112eknoZ] [^115LVftT].

> Hold on, I should verify the indications for extracorporeal treatment; EXTRIP recommends intermittent hemodialysis as the preferred modality in severe cases, including salicylate concentration greater than about 6.5–7.2 mmol/L (90–100 mg/dL), altered mental status, refractory acidemia with pH ≤ 7.20, new hypoxemia requiring oxygen, or renal failure, and I should also consider ECTR earlier in patients with impaired kidney function or when standard therapy fails; I need to ensure I continue IV bicarbonate between dialysis sessions and stop ECTR when clinical improvement occurs and salicylate falls below about 1.4 mmol/L (19 mg/dL) or after 4–6 hours if levels are unavailable [^114jjbqG] [^115Bo2mc] [^114VTAA6] [^115AZV4s] [^1145rBt2] [^115dh4td] [^116SNjKt] [^116Sof1v] [^115R22hG].

> Let me think about special populations and delayed absorption; in pediatrics, I should confirm that the traditional 150 mg/kg referral threshold may be too high for some outcomes, and lower thresholds around 100–150 mg/kg may warrant evaluation, with particular caution for oil of wintergreen (methyl salicylate) where small volumes are highly toxic; in pregnancy, I should balance maternal–fetal risks and generally manage similarly with early involvement of maternal–fetal medicine; for delayed or erratic absorption, especially with enteric-coated tablets, I need to repeat salicylate levels every 2–4 hours until they demonstrate a consistent downward trend and the patient remains asymptomatic, watching for late rises due to pharmacobezoars or pylorospasm [^113si5nb] [^116reim9] [^117FSDnL] [^114tXp9h].

> I should confirm the monitoring cadence and disposition; frequent clinical checks of mental status, respiratory pattern, temperature, and volume status are critical, with serial salicylate levels, ABGs, electrolytes, renal function, and glucose guiding therapy, and I need to ensure observation is extended for at least 12–24 hours depending on formulation because of delayed absorption; disposition should be to a monitored setting for any symptomatic patient, those with elevated salicylate levels, acid–base disturbance, or co-ingestants, and I should arrange poison center follow-up for asymptomatic exposures to track evolving symptoms [^116Jqke1].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the history is unclear; I should maintain a high index of suspicion when there is tinnitus with hyperventilation, mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, or an unexplained anion gap metabolic acidosis, and I must remember that co-formulations with opioids or barbiturates can mask or complicate the salicylate picture, requiring naloxone readiness and tailored airway and sedation strategies while still prioritizing salicylate-specific management principles [^1115VzK9] [^115zT6mF] [^117LfUuj] [^11768rF6].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I recall conflicting statements about gastric emptying; some older FDA labeling suggests considering gastric emptying or lavage soon after ingestion, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — contemporary toxicology guidance emphasizes that routine lavage is not recommended and that activated charcoal is preferred when appropriate, so I should reconcile this by stating that while historical labels mention lavage, current best practice prioritizes early charcoal without ipecac and reserves lavage for select scenarios under specialist direction, not as a routine measure [^11492gk5] [^116GkZ5z] [^113Vtkxd].

> I should double-check the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency: stabilize and preserve compensatory ventilation, give activated charcoal early when safe and do not delay transport, aggressively correct acid–base disturbances with fluids and urine alkalinization, escalate to intermittent hemodialysis for severe toxicity or refractory cases, anticipate delayed absorption with enteric-coated formulations, and use serial monitoring to guide safe discharge decisions, aligning with EXTRIP and NEJM frameworks [^112eknoZ] [^114jjbqG] [^116SNjKt] [^114QkYyJ].

---

Aspirin overdose is a medical emergency characterized by **early tinnitus, nausea, and hyperventilation** [^113MawgG], progressing to metabolic acidosis, seizures, and multi-organ failure [^114Q7W7u]. Immediate management includes **activated charcoal within 1 hour** [^116GkZ5z] [^114QkYyJ], aggressive IV fluids, and sodium bicarbonate for alkalinization [^113Uvffm] [^112eknoZ]; hemodialysis is indicated for severe toxicity or renal failure [^113QaeUr] [^115tyZb6]. Mortality is **5% in severe cases** [^113MawgG], so **early recognition and treatment are critical** [^113Uvffm].

---

## Clinical presentation

Aspirin overdose presents with a characteristic progression of symptoms, categorized by severity [^113MawgG]:

| **Severity** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Mild (300–500 mg/L) | - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Tinnitus <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - Lethargy [^113MawgG] |
| Moderate (500–700 mg/L) | - Tachypnea <br/> - Hyperpnea <br/> - Sweating <br/> - Dehydration <br/> - Confusion <br/> - Coagulopathy [^113MawgG] |
| Severe (> 750 mg/L) | - Hallucinations <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Cerebral edema <br/> - Renal failure <br/> - Cardiovascular collapse <br/> - Coma [^113MawgG] |

---

## Pathophysiology

Aspirin rapidly hydrolyzes to salicylic acid, which uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, increases metabolic rate, and causes a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis [^117XExwh]. Initially, hyperventilation produces respiratory alkalosis; with continued exposure, metabolic acidosis predominates, worsening salicylate distribution into the CNS and other tissues [^115tyZb6].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **History**: Dose, time, formulation (especially enteric-coated), co-ingestants [^116reim9].
- **Physical exam**: Vital signs, neurologic status, acid-base status [^113MawgG].
- **Laboratory tests**: Serum salicylate level, ABG, electrolytes, renal function, glucose, coagulation profile [^11492gk5].
- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray if respiratory symptoms; CT head if altered mental status [^notfound].

---

## Management

### Initial stabilization

Initial stabilization focuses on **ABCs** — airway, breathing, and circulation — with airway protection and oxygen as needed [^notfound]. Avoid intubation unless absolutely necessary, as it can worsen acidosis; if intubated, maintain hyperventilation [^114QkYyJ]. Start isotonic IV fluids for dehydration and to prepare for alkalinization [^115tyZb6].

---

### Gastric decontamination

Administer **activated charcoal within 1 hour** of ingestion if the airway is protected and no contraindications exist; do not delay transport to give charcoal [^116GkZ5z] [^114QkYyJ]. Do not induce emesis [^113Vtkxd].

---

### Alkalinization and enhanced elimination

Alkalinize with **sodium bicarbonate** to a target urine pH ≥ 7.5, which increases salicylate renal clearance [^117XExwh]. Provide **potassium replacement** as needed to maintain alkalinization [^117FSDnL].

---

### Hemodialysis

Hemodialysis is indicated for:

- Salicylate level > 7.2 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) [^115Bo2mc]
- Severe acid-base disturbance (pH ≤ 7.20) [^115AZV4s]
- Renal failure [^115tyZb6]
- Altered mental status or seizures [^114VTAA6]
- Refractory symptoms despite medical therapy [^115dh4td]

Intermittent hemodialysis is the **preferred modality** [^116SNjKt].

---

## Complications

- **Metabolic acidosis**: Common and potentially life-threatening [^113MawgG].
- **Renal failure**: From direct toxicity and hypoperfusion [^113MawgG].
- **Pulmonary edema**: Non-cardiogenic, especially in chronic toxicity [^notfound].
- **Seizures and cerebral edema**: Severe CNS toxicity [^113MawgG].
- **Bleeding**: Due to platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy [^113nhQre].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **dose dependent** and varies with the salicylate level and time to treatment [^113MawgG]. Mortality is approximately 5% in severe cases, and early recognition and aggressive management significantly improve outcomes [^113MawgG].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **patient education** on safe dosing and storage, use of child-resistant packaging, and prompt disposal of unused medication. Clinicians should monitor chronic aspirin use for signs of toxicity, especially in older adults [^113A7V4L].

---

Aspirin overdose is a potentially fatal poisoning with a characteristic clinical course; **early recognition, activated charcoal, alkalinization, and hemodialysis when indicated** are the cornerstones of management [^113MawgG].

The following constitutes key background information on aspirin overdose:

- **Definition**: Aspirin overdose is the plasma salicylate concentration of 300–500 mg/L in mild toxicity, 500–700 mg/L in moderate toxicity, and > 750 mg/L in severity toxicity.
- **Pathophysiology**: Aspirin overdose is caused by accidental ingestions in children, suicidal or intentional overdoses in adults.
- **Disease course**: Acute aspirin overdose results in salicylate poisoning resulting in either mild, moderate, or severe toxicity depending on the plasma salicylate concentration. Mild toxicity presents with burning in the mouth, lethargy, nausea and vomiting, tinnitus, or dizziness. Moderate toxicity includes additional symptoms of tachypnea, hyperpyrexia, sweating, dehydration, loss of coordination, and restlessness. Severe toxicity causes hallucinations, stupor, convulsions, cerebral edema, oliguria, renal failure, cardiovascular failure, metabolic acidosis, and coma.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Severe salicylate poisoning results in 5% mortality.

Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss with the patient and caregiver the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Aspirin Tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing regulations (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program) [see WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION; Initial Dosage].

Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose.

Explain to patients and caregivers that naloxone's effects are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see OVERDOSAGE].

If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers:

How to treat with naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose
To tell family and friends about their naloxone and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency
To read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their naloxone Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do.

### Medical outcomes of acute aspirin single substance poisoning in pediatric patients [^113si5nb]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A consensus guideline on salicylate poisoning recommends referring patients to the emergency department if they ingested 150 mg/kg of aspirin. The dose of aspirin associated with severe poisoning in pediatric patients has not been investigated.

Objective

This study aims to associate medical outcomes with aspirin overdoses in patients 5 years old and younger.

Methods

A retrospective review of data on pediatric patients with single substance aspirin exposures reported from poison centers across the country was conducted. The primary endpoint was to associate aspirin doses with medical outcomes. Secondary endpoints included evaluation of the signs, symptoms, and treatments of ingestion and their association with medical outcomes.

Results

There were 26488 included exposures with aspirin exposures resulting in no effect (92.5%), minor effect (6.0%), moderate effect (1.4%), major effect (0.2%), and death (0.02%). There were 8921 cases with available weight-based dosing information. Median doses associated with no effect, minor effects, moderate effects, major effects, and death ranged between 28.4 and 40.9 mg/kg, 52.5 and 82.3 mg/kg, 132.1 and 182.3 mg/kg, 132.3 and 172.8 mg/kg, and 142.2 and 284.4 mg/kg, respectively. Minor effect and moderate effect exposures were more likely to have alkalinization documented compared to no effect exposures (odds ratio [OR] = 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.41–2.17; OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.12–2.86). There was no difference in rates of alkalinization between minor and moderate exposures (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.61–1.7).

Conclusions and Relevance

Reevaluation of the current recommendation of 150 mg/kg for referral to a healthcare facility is necessary for pediatric acute salicylate overdoses.

### Aspirin and dipyridamole [^11492gk5]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential.

Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed.

Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 grams.

Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia.

Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^114QkYyJ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO EMS clinical guidelines — Aspirin overdose directs: Consider activated charcoal without sorbitol (1 gm/kg) PO only if within the first hour of ingestion. As ASA is erratically absorbed, charcoal is highly recommended to be administered early. If altered mental status or risk of rapid decreasing mental status from polypharmacy, do not administer oral agents including activated charcoal. In salicylate poisonings, let the patient breathe on their own, even if tachypneic, until there is evidence of decompensation or dropping oxygen saturation; acid/base disturbances and outcomes worsen when the patient is manually ventilated.

### Meprobamate and aspirin (equagesic) [^111yG8sS]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Overdosage

Treatment of overdose with Equagesic is essentially symptomatic and supportive. In cases where excessive doses of Equagesic have been taken, sleep ensues rapidly and blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rates are reduced to basal levels. Any drug remaining in the stomach should be removed and symptomatic treatment given. After emesis and/or lavage, activated charcoal may reduce absorption of both aspirin and meprobamate. Should respiration or blood pressure become compromised, respiratory assistance, central nervous system stimulants, and pressor agents should be administered cautiously as indicated. Diuresis, osmotic (mannitol) diuresis, peritoneal dialysis, and hemodialysis have been used successfully in removing both aspirin and meprobamate. Alkalinization of the urine increases the excretion of salicylates. Careful monitoring of urinary output is necessary, and caution should be taken to avoid overhydration. Relapse and death, after initial recovery, have been attributed to incomplete gastric emptying and delayed absorption. Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, acid-base disturbances with development of metabolic acidosis, convulsions, delirium, hyperpnea, hyperthermia, hypoprothrombinemia, restlessness, Tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and vomiting. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus, occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 μg/mL. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 μg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 μg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. For real or suspected overdose, a Poison Control Center should be contacted immediately. Careful medical management is essential. In acute aspirin overdose, severe acid-base and electrolyte disturbances may occur and are complicated by hyperthermia and dehydration. Respiratory alkalosis occurs early while hyperventilation is present, but is quickly followed by metabolic acidosis. Treatment of aspirin overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing salicylate elimination, and correcting the acid-base disturbance. Gastric emptying and/or lavage is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis administration of activated charcoal, as a slurry, is beneficial, if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal adsorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage.

and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or
lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has
vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration
of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3
hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not
be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely
with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and
electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and
augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use
of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia.

Administration of xanthine derivatives
(e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole
overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially
to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal.
In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening
intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose;
however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not
likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated
in infants and young children.

Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss with the patient and caregiver the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with BUTALBITAL, ASPIRIN, CAFFEINE and CODEINE PHOSPHATE Capsules. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose.

Explain to patients and caregivers that naloxone's effects are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see Overdosage (10)].

If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers:

How to treat with naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose
To tell family and friends about their naloxone and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency
To read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their naloxone. Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do.

Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Other Risk Factors for Life-threatening Respiratory Depression in Children

Advise caregivers that BUTALBITAL, ASPIRIN, CAFFEINE and CODEINE PHOSPHATE is contraindicated in all children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Advise caregivers of children 12–18 years of age receiving BUTALBITAL, ASPIRIN, CAFFEINE and CODEINE PHOSPHATE to monitor for signs of respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Inform patients and caregivers not to increase opioid dosage without first consulting a clinician. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of hyperalgesia, including worsening pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8); Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

10 OVERDOSAGE

Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential.

Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed.

Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g.

### Methocarbamol and aspirin [^111Wisj2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Limited information is available on the acute toxicity of methocarbamol. Overdose of methocarbamol is frequently in conjunction with alcohol or other CNS depressants and includes the following symptoms: nausea, drowsiness, blurred vision, hypotension, seizures, and coma.

In post-marketing experience, deaths have been reported with an overdose of methocarbamol alone or in the presence of other CNS depressants, alcohol or psychotropic drugs.

Early signs of acute aspirin (salicylate) overdose including tinnitus occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. For real or suspected overdose, a Poison Control Center should be contacted immediately.

In acute salicylate overdose, severe acid-base and electrolyte disturbances may occur and are complicated by hyperthermia and dehydration, and coma. Respiratory alkalosis occurs early while hyperventilation is present, but is quickly followed by metabolic acidosis. Serious symptoms such as depression, coma, and respiratory failure progress rapidly.

Salicylism (chronic salicylate toxicity) may be noted by symptoms such as dizziness, tinnitus, difficulty hearing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mental confusion. More severe salicylism may result in respiratory alkalosis.

Treatment of Overdosage: Supportive therapy for 24 hours, as methocarbamol is excreted within that time. If salicylate intoxication occurs, especially in children, the hyperpnea may be controlled with sodium bicarbonate. Judicious use of 5% CO2with 95% O2may be of benefit. Abnormal electrolyte patterns should be corrected with appropriate fluid therapy.

### Butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine [^117LfUuj]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

The toxic effects of acute overdosage of butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules are attributable mainly to its barbiturate component, and, to a lesser extent, aspirin. Because toxic effects of caffeine occur in very high dosages only, the possibility of significant caffeine toxicity from butalbital, aspirin, and caffeine capsules overdosage is unlikely.

Signs and Symptoms

Symptoms attributable to acute barbiturate poisoning include drowsiness, confusion, and coma; respiratory depression; hypotension; hypovolemic shock. Symptoms attributable to acute aspirin poisoning include hyperpnea; acid-base disturbances with development of metabolic acidosis; vomiting and abdominal pain; tinnitus; hyperthermia; hypoprothrombinemia; restlessness; delirium; convulsions. Acute caffeine poisoning may cause insomnia, restlessness, tremor, and delirium; tachycardia and extrasystoles.

Treatment

Treatment consists primarily of management of barbiturate intoxication and the correction of the acid-base imbalance due to salicylism. Vomiting should be induced mechanically or with emetics in the conscious patient. Gastric lavage may be used if the pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes are present and if less than 4 hours have elapsed since ingestion. A cuffed endotracheal tube should be inserted before gastric lavage of the unconscious patient and when necessary to provide assisted respiration. Diuresis, alkalinization of the urine, and correction of electrolyte disturbances should be accomplished through administration of intravenous fluids such as 1% sodium bicarbonate in 5% dextrose in water. Meticulous attention should be given to maintaining adequate pulmonary ventilation. The value of vasopressor agents such as Norepinephrine or Phenylephrine Hydrochloride in treating hypotension is questionable since they increase vasoconstriction and decrease blood flow. However, if prolonged support of blood pressure is required, Norepinephrine Bitartrate (Levophed®) may be given I.V. with the usual precautions and serial blood pressure monitoring. In severe cases of intoxication, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or exchange transfusion may be lifesaving. Hypoprothrombinemia should be treated with Vitamin K, intravenously.

Up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose can often be obtained from a Certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of Certified Regional Poison Control Centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference®.

Toxic and Lethal Doses (for adults)

Butalbital: toxic dose 1 g (20 capsules)

Aspirin: toxic blood level greater than 30 mg/100 mL; lethal dose 10 to 30 g

Caffeine: toxic dose 1 g (25 capsules)

Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are some of the most common culprits of drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions, and can lead to a wide array of adverse effects. The accurate and timely diagnosis of aspirin and NSAID-induced hypersensitivity reactions is important for both patient safety and for the initiation of appropriate disease-specific management and treatment. Because there are no reliably validated in vitro tests available, aspirin and NSAID challenges are considered to be the criterion standard for the diagnosis of these hypersensitivity reactions, though in some patients the diagnosis can be made on the basis of a clear clinical history.

### Questions regarding future research on aspirin and the gastrointestinal tract [^114pjVus]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Despite great proven and potential benefits, aspirin also has adverse side effects on all parts of the gastrointestinal tract including ulceration, bleeding, perforation, and stenosis. Because of widespread and growing use, there is a need to understand and, if possible, prevent the adverse effects of aspirin while maintaining its benefits. This article is part of a report from a consensus meeting in 1999 on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and examines possible mechanisms of each of the risks of normal and low-dose aspirin use including areas of uncertainty. Based on these issues, we recommend studies that would further clarify the actions of aspirin. We also examine various strategies that might be used to prevent or mitigate adverse effects. Finally, we propose future research prospects in the search for a safer aspirin.

### Self-administration of aspirin after chest pain for the prevention of premature cardiovascular mortality in the United States: a population-based analysis [^111rsf2a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Encouraging patients to carry and self‐administer a therapeutic is not a novel prevention strategy. Individuals with severe allergies are told to carry epinephrine to reduce the risk of death from anaphylaxis. A recent advisory from the US Surgeon General calls for individuals taking opioids to keep naloxone on hand to prevent overdose deaths. Even within the field of cardiovascular disease, a new injectable antiplatelet is in development, intended for patients with a history of AMI to self‐administer at the onset of AMI symptoms. Efforts needed to scale‐up the use and advertise benefits of aspirin could draw from previous work encouraging self‐administration of these other therapeutics. We anticipate that uptake of aspirin self‐administration may be high given the low‐cost and oral route of administration.

There are a few assumptions and limitations to note. We assumed that the benefits of early aspirin use would also apply to individuals taking daily low‐dose aspirin for primary prevention. This is supported by pharmacodynamic studies examining different dosing regimens, which found that high‐risk patients with cardiovascular disease had greater inhibition of platelet reactivity when given higher doses of aspirin. Limited data availability prevented us from calculating age‐ and sex‐specific PPV of severe chest pain for AMI as well as mortality RR reduction for aspirin; thus, we assumed these parameters apply to all age‐sex groups. Moreover, we focused on chest pain alone, rather than considering shortness of breath, diaphoresis or other pain, because this is the most reliable sign of an AMI. We only examined the net benefits of aspirin on mortality, ignoring nonfatal bleeding risks, which may similarly be negligible in comparison to nonfatal benefits. Lastly, we did not include the cost of an education dissemination campaign to encourage aspirin use at severe chest pain onset in our cost‐effectiveness analysis, though we expect additional costs of such campaign would be unlikely to exceed the threshold for cost‐effectiveness based on past research (ie, $50 000/YOLS).

### Activated charcoal and bicarbonate for aspirin toxicity: a retrospective series [^112eknoZ]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin overdose causes acid-base disturbances and organ dysfunction. Management is guided by research reported over 50 years ago when chronic aspirin toxicity was common and accounted for significant morbidity. We investigate our experience of aspirin overdose and the effectiveness of charcoal and bicarbonate administration over 20 years.

Methods

This is a retrospective series of acute aspirin overdose from two toxicology units from January 2000 to September 2019. Acute aspirin ingestions > 3000 mg were identified in each unit's database. Excluded were cases of chronic exposure, hospital presentation > 24 hours after ingestion, and cases without a salicylate concentration. Included in our analysis was demographic data, clinical effects, investigations, complications, and treatment.

Results

There were 132 presentations in 108 patients (79 females (73%)). The median age was 28 years (range: 13–93 years). The median dose ingested was 7750 mg (IQR: 6000–14,400 mg). There were 44 aspirin-only ingestions. Mild toxicity (nausea, vomiting, tinnitus or hyperventilation) occurred in 22 with a median dose of 160 mg/kg. Moderate toxicity (acid-base disturbance, confusion) occurred in 16 with a median ingested dose of 297 mg/kg. There were no cases of severe toxicity (coma or seizures) due to aspirin alone. The median peak salicylate concentration was 276 mg/L (IQR: 175–400 mg/L, range: 14–814 mg/L). There was a moderate association between dose ingested and peak concentration (Pearson r = 0.58; 95% CI 0.45–0.68). Activated charcoal was administered in 36 (27%) cases, which decreased the median peak salicylate concentration (34.2 to 24.8 mg/L/g (difference: 9.4, 95% CI: 1.0–13.1)). Bicarbonate was administered in 34 (26%) presentations, decreasing the median apparent elimination half-life from 13.4 to 9.3 h (difference: 4.2 h, 95% CI: 1.0–6.5 h).

Conclusions

Acute aspirin overdose caused only mild to moderate effects in this series. Early administration of activated charcoal decreased absorption and use of bicarbonate enhanced elimination.

Analgesics, including opioids, steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, acetaminophen, antiepileptics, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, are medications commonly used to treat many forms of pain. However, all of these agents may have significant adverse side effects. Adverse effects may occasionally be inseparable from desired effects. Side effects are often dose dependent and time dependent. It is critical that the prescribing practitioner and the dispensing pharmacist provide a thorough, understandable review of the potential side effects to all patients before these drugs are administered. Proper monitoring and follow-up during therapy are crucial.

A 14-year-old white female was evaluated after a single ingestion of 120 tablets of aspirin 81 mg/tablet hours before arrival to the emergency department. She denied nausea, abdominal pain, tinnitus, or shortness of breath. She received one dose of activated charcoal. The first salicylate concentration (4 h after ingestion) was 1 mg/dL. At 35 hours, the patient became symptomatic (dizziness, tinnitus, epigastric discomfort). Her salicylate concentration at that time was 46 mg/dL. A second dose of activated charcoal was administered, and intravenous bicarbonate with potassium was started as a continuous infusion for 30 hours.

Discussion

While delayed salicylate toxicity is well reported in the literature, no report was found regarding concentrations increasing to toxicity 35 hours after ingestion. The delayed aspirin absorption may be due to salicylate-induced pylorospasm or the formation of pharmacobezoars.

Conclusions

In cases with known salicylate ingestion, it is important to follow salicylate concentrations every 4 hours until they are steadily decreasing according to a 4-hour half-life and the patient shows no symptoms of salicylate intoxication.

First aid for adults experiencing chest pain — In adults with acute chest pain, the emergency response system should be activated to initiate transport to the closest ED by EMS. While awaiting the arrival of EMS, first aid providers may encourage adult(s) experiencing nontraumatic chest pain to chew and swallow aspirin (162–325 mg), unless the person experiencing pain has a known aspirin allergy or has been advised by a health care professional not to take aspirin. If there is any uncertainty that aspirin should be taken, it is reasonable to wait for EMS arrival without administration of aspirin.

### Oxycodone and aspirin (Endodan) [^11557uQ1]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Gastric emptying and/or lavage may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug.
This procedure is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the
patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of
activated charcoal, as a slurry, is beneficial, if less than three hours have
passed since ingestion. Charcoal adsorption should not be employed prior to
lavage and emesis.

In severe cases of salicylate overdose, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the
major immediate threats to life. Children should be sponged with tepid water.
Replacement fluid should be administered intravenously and augmented with
correction of acidosis. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored to
promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. Infusion of
glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia. With more severe acute toxicity
respiratory alkalosis may occur.

Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can be performed to reduce the body
content of aspirin. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of
life-threatening salicylate intoxication dialysis is usually required. Exchange
transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children.

In case of real or suspected overdose, a poison control center should be
consulted for the treatment of salicylism.

The toxicity of oxycodone and aspirin in combination is unknown.

2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of the opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)].

Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

2.3 Dosing Information

One or two capsules every 4 hours as needed for pain. Total daily dosage should not exceed 6 capsules. Use the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP.

### Absorption of salicylate powders versus tablets following overdose: a poison center observational study [^114tXp9h]. Clinical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Salicylate absorption following overdose of aspirin (ASA) tablet formulations can be prolonged for greater than 24h. Accordingly, serial serum concentrations are typically recommended to guide treatment. However, there are little published data on absorption following ingestion of powder ASA formulations, and it is not known if delayed ASA absorption occurs following overdose of powder formulations. The objective of this study is to compare the absorption characteristics of powder and tablet formulations of ASA in patients reported to a single poison center.

Methods

Electronic records from an accredited poison center were searched for single substance acute or acute on chronic ingestions of ASA in powder form between 1 January 2002 and 31 January 2014. An identical search for ingestions of ASA tablet products between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013 was undertaken as the comparator group. Other inclusion criteria were age > 12 years, documented time of ingestion, treatment in a health care facility within nine hours of ingestion and at least two detectable serum salicylate concentrations.

Results

16 of 25 powder and 22 of 49 tablet cases met inclusion criteria for analysis. Repeat serum salicylate concentrations following ingestion of tablets increased or insignificantly changed in 11 of 22 (50%) cases, and median serum salicylate concentrations in followed cases remained elevated for up to 12h in some cases. In comparison, serum salicylate concentrations following powder ingestions declined in 15 of 16 (94%) cases. One patient, who ingested a powder product, underwent hemodialysis pursuant to an initial serum salicylate concentration of 96mg/dL.

Conclusions

In contrast to persistent concentrations following overdose of tablets, the majority of serum salicylate concentrations declined following ingestion of powder formulations. In this small study population, these findings suggest that prolonged absorption is unlikely following ingestions of ASA powders.

Notes/Educational Pearls — key considerations for opioid overdose in emergency medical services (EMS): The essential feature of opioid overdose requiring EMS intervention is respiratory depression or apnea, managed by ventilation followed by naloxone. Some opioids have additional toxic effects (i.e., methadone can produce QT prolongation and tramadol can produce seizures). Overuse and abuse of prescribed and illegal opioids has led to an increase in accidental and intentional opioid overdoses. Some opioids are manufactured as a combination of analgesics with acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), or other substances, with examples including Vicodin, Percocet, Percodan, and Suboxone combination products. High-potency opioids include fentanyl, which is 50–100 times more potent than morphine with legally manufactured injectable, oral liquid, tablet, and transdermal (worn as a patch) forms but often appears as illegal fentanyl analogs such as acetyl fentanyl, and carfentanil, which is 10,000 times more potent than morphine.

### Salicylate poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^116reim9]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

A review of U.S. poison center data for 2004 showed over 40,000 exposures to salicylate-containing products. A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and pre-hospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial out-of-hospital management of patients with a suspected exposure to salicylates by 1) describing the process by which a specialist in poison information should evaluate an exposure to salicylates, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of salicylate exposure, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses: 1) Patients with stated or suspected self-harm or who are the victims of a potentially malicious administration of a salicylate, should be referred to an emergency department immediately. This referral should be guided by local poison center procedures. In general, this should occur regardless of the dose reported (Grade D). 2) The presence of typical symptoms of salicylate toxicity such as hematemesis, tachypnea, hyperpnea, dyspnea, tinnitus, deafness, lethargy, seizures, unexplained lethargy, or confusion warrants referral to an emergency department for evaluation (Grade C). 3) Patients who exhibit typical symptoms of salicylate toxicity or nonspecific symptoms such as unexplained lethargy, confusion, or dyspnea, which could indicate the development of chronic salicylate toxicity, should be referred to an emergency department (Grade C). 4) Patients without evidence of self-harm should have further evaluation, including determination of the dose, time of ingestion, presence of symptoms, history of other medical conditions, and the presence of co-ingestants. The acute ingestion of more than 150 mg/kg or 6.5 g of aspirin equivalent, whichever is less, warrants referral to an emergency department. Ingestion of greater than a lick or taste of oil of wintergreen (98% methyl salicylate) by children under 6 years of age and more than 4 mL of oil of wintergreen by patients 6 years of age and older could cause systemic salicylate toxicity and warrants referral to an emergency department (Grade C). 5) Do not induce emesis for ingestions of salicylates (Grade D). 6) Consider the out-of-hospital administration of activated charcoal for acute ingestions of a toxic dose if it is immediately available, no contraindications are present, the patient is not vomiting, and local guidelines for its out-of-hospital use are observed. However, do not delay transportation in order to administer activated charcoal (Grade D). 7) Women in the last trimester of pregnancy who ingest below the dose for emergency department referral and do not have other referral conditions should be directed to their primary care physician, obstetrician, or a non-emergent health care facility for evaluation of maternal and fetal risk. Routine referral to an emergency department for immediate care is not required (Grade C). 8) For asymptomatic patients with dermal exposures to methyl salicylate or salicylic acid, the skin should be thoroughly washed with soap and water and the patient can be observed at home for development of symptoms (Grade C). 9) For patients with an ocular exposure of methyl salicylate or salicylic acid, the eye(s) should be irrigated with room-temperature tap water for 15 minutes. If after irrigation the patient is having pain, decreased visual acuity, or persistent irritation, referral for an ophthalmological examination is indicated (Grade D). 10) Poison centers should monitor the onset of symptoms whenever possible by conducting follow-up calls at periodic intervals for approximately 12 hours after ingestion of non-enteric-coated salicylate products, and for approximately 24 hours after the ingestion of enteric-coated aspirin (Grade C).

Introduction

Aspirin and its relatives are some of the oldest and most widely used drugs, dating back thousands of years and treating aches, pains, and fevers. Since the 1980s, aspirin has been regularly used to prevent and treat heart disease and stroke. Unlike the robust data supporting the use of aspirin in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, uncertainty remains regarding its role in primary prevention. The uncertainty behind aspirin use in primary prevention is mainly due to imprecision underlying the relative size of the risk and benefit of aspirin use in a low‐risk, otherwise healthy population. 1 Despite this, nearly every major cardiovascular health organization has published guidelines and statements on the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Controversy and complexity of the available research combined with the over‐the‐counter accessibility of aspirin make translation of the evidence into practice particularly challenging for both clinicians and patients alike.

In 2009, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) assigned grade‐A recommendations for the use of aspirin in men ages 45 to 79 years for the prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) and in women ages 55 to 79 years for the prevention of ischemic stroke, in both cases where the prevention risks outweigh the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. 2 These recommendations are echoed to varying degrees in multiple cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines, including those of the American Heart Association (AHA). 3 Conversely, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014 declared that the available evidence does not support the general use of aspirin for primary prevention. These conflicting statements can be confusing for both healthcare providers and patients to digest, potentially leading to underutilization of aspirin for primary prevention. 4 The key for appropriate use of aspirin in primary prevention lies in the identification of the correct candidate for whom aspirin use is truly beneficial. This can be a complex task as consensus on assessment of cardiovascular risk remains elusive, and integrating bleeding risk with cardiovascular risk further complicates the decision‐making process.

Aspirin is one of the most commonly used medications. We report a patient who presented with severe weakness, altered mental status and complete heart block requiring temporary pacing. Despite the patient's family denying that the patient used aspirin, an arterial blood gas that revealed a respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis suggested the diagnosis of salicylate toxicity. The salicylate level was extremely elevated and the patient was successfully treated with haemodialysis. Our case illustrates that salicylate toxicity should be considered in a patient with a combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. A prompt salicylate level should be obtained. This is also the first case of salicylate toxicity causing complete heart block in an adult. The heart block resolved with treatment of the salicylate toxicity.

Self‐Administration of Aspirin Scenario

We examined the effect of full coverage of starting self‐administration of aspirin within 4 hours of severe chest pain onset using 325 mg aspirin tablets (which is the standard high‐dose formulation in the United States) and continuing treatment for 28 days if an AMI was diagnosed, regardless of need for emergent surgical procedures. This is consistent with guidelines that indicate aspirin may be continued throughout the perioperative period before cardiac surgery, without major risks. If severe chest pain did not lead to a diagnosis of AMI, patients would of course discontinue taking aspirin after the first dose. We applied the benefit only to individuals experiencing severe chest pain under the "usual care" scenario to receive aspirin either late or never (Figure S1). We approximated this target population by combining 2 different estimates. First, as a proxy for access to care after AMI, we used the proportion of AMI deaths occurring in a health care facility (defined as hospice facility, inpatient medical facility, outpatient medical facility, and nursing home/long‐term care) versus those occurring outside health care facilities. Data on this proportion were derived from the vital statistics report analyzed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention for 2019 by age and sex. Almost all individuals who accessed care (97.4%) received aspirin within 24 hours of arrival, based on quality of care metric data from the American College of Cardiology Chest Pain‐MI Registry reported in the Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Report for 2022. Disaggregated data by age and sex were not reported. Second, we used evidence on the proportion of patients receiving aspirin late (ie, > 4 hours after symptom onset) from an analysis of hospital discharge data from almost half a million AMI patients enrolled in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction, which found that 55.5% of all patients received aspirin > 4 hours after the event.

### The approach to the patient with an unknown overdose [^117RzUvk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Toxic overdose can present with various clinical signs and symptoms. These may be the only clues to diagnosis when the cause of toxicity is unknown at the time of initial assessment. The prognosis and clinical course of recovery of a patient poisoned by a specific agent depends largely on the quality of care delivered within the first few hours in the emergency setting. Usually the drug or toxin can be quickly identified by a careful history, a directed physical examination, and commonly available laboratory tests. Once the patient has been stabilized, the physician must consider how to minimize the bioavailability of toxin not yet absorbed, which antidotes (if any) to administer, and if other measures to enhance elimination are necessary.

Aspirin — gastrointestinal (GI) side effects and bleeding are dose dependent, supporting a low-dose strategy: there is evidence that the GI side effects of aspirin are dose dependent, with aspirin doses of ~300 mg/d associated with fewer GI side effects than ~1,200 mg/d and doses ≤ 100 mg/d associated with fewer side effects than 300 mg/d. In acute coronary syndromes (ACS), aspirin ≤ 100 mg/d alone or with clopidogrel was associated with lower rates of major or life-threatening bleeding than aspirin alone at ≥ 200 mg/d, and in CURRENT–OASIS 7, aspirin 75 to 100 mg/d produced less GI bleeding than 300 to 325 mg/d, with no difference in other major bleeding. In summary, these findings support the use of lowest proven effective doses of aspirin as the most appropriate strategy to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity.

### Diltiazem overdose: a role for high-dose insulin [^1177idXv]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old man presented 6h after a mixed intentional overdose of dilatizem (Adizem-SR), atorvastatin, aspirin and isosorbide mononitrate. He was symptomatic, with vomiting, blurred vision and unsteady gait. Despite initial fluid resuscitation and calcium chloride, glucagon, and high-dose ionotropic therapy, his hypotension remained refractory to treatment. A bolus of high-dose insulin (Actrapid) was administered, followed by a continuous infusion. Glucose was administered to maintain a state of euglycaemia. Over the following 24h, the patient was given 1140 units of accumulative insulin. This resulted in a significant improvement in arterial blood pressure values and metabolic indices, allowing contiguous weaning off inotropes. This case supports the use of rescue hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemia in patients with an overdose of calcium channel blockers who remain hypotensive despite standard pharmacological measures.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

3.4.2 Treatment‐emergent AEs

Treatment‐emergent AEs (TEAEs) are summarized in Table 3. The proportion of participants with any TEAE was 50.7% with acarbose versus 33.3% with alogliptin, and the proportions of those with treatment‐related TEAEs were 32.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Thus, most TEAEs in participants receiving alogliptin were not treatment‐related. The most commonly reported TEAEs were overdose (9.5%), hyperlipidaemia (3.9%) and constipation (2.9%) with alogliptin, and flatulence (22.3%), overdose (15.5%) and abdominal distension (10.7%) with acarbose. With the exception of constipation, which occurred more commonly with alogliptin (2.9% vs. 1.9%), individual gastrointestinal TEAEs were at least twice as common with acarbose versus alogliptin. In both treatment groups, the incidence of gastrointestinal TEAEs peaked in the first week of the study, and subsequently decreased; however, these effects occurred more frequently with acarbose than with alogliptin in most study weeks, and a difference was still apparent at Week 16.

TABLE 3
Treatment‐emergent adverse events

Significantly more participants discontinued treatment due to a treatment‐related TEAE with acarbose compared with alogliptin (2.5% vs. 0.3%; P = 0.0006). No new safety signals were identified during the study, and there were no deaths from treatment‐related TEAEs in either treatment arm.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114ssyJV]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — clinical features, diagnosis, and management — The clinical picture starts with nasal congestion and anosmia, progressing to chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; asthma and hypersensitivity to aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) develop subsequently, and following ingestion of aspirin or NSAIDs, an acute asthma attack develops within minutes to 1–2 hours, sometimes progressing to severe bronchospasm, shock, loss of consciousness, and respiratory arrest. AERD is more likely to be associated with low lung function and severe asthma, and the prevalence of AERD is 7% in general adult asthma populations and 15% in severe asthma. For diagnosis, a history of exacerbation following ingestion of aspirin or other NSAIDs is highly suggestive, and aspirin challenge (oral, bronchial or nasal) is the gold standard as there are no reliable in vitro tests; oral aspirin challenge tests must only be conducted in a specialized center with cardiopulmonary resuscitation capabilities because of the high risk of severe reactions, while bronchial and nasal challenges with lysine aspirin are safer than oral challenges and may be safely performed in allergy centers. For management, patients with AERD should avoid aspirin or NSAID-containing products and other medications that inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1); when an NSAID is indicated for other conditions, a COX-2 inhibitor or paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be considered with supervision and observation for at least 2 hours after administration, and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of asthma therapy in AERD, but oral corticosteroids (OCS) are sometimes required and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) may also be useful.

### Aspirin and dipyridamole [^115LVftT]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Aspirin

Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 grams), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours.

The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from < 5% to > 80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [see Overdosage (10)]. Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine.

Aspirin:

Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours.

### Death due to acute salicylate intoxication despite dialysis [^115iKLNJ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Salicylate poisoning is a common problem with appreciable morbidity and mortality. We present a case of a patient with a large aspirin ingestion who expired despite aggressive hemodialysis (HD).

Case Report

A 35-year-old man arrived at the Emergency Department 7.5 h after ingesting 400 tablets of 325-mg aspirin. He was afebrile, the respiratory rate (RR) was 30 breaths/min, heart rate (HR) 120 beats/min, blood pressure (BP) 125/76 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. His salicylate concentration was 89.6 mg/dL. His initial arterial blood gas: pH 7.48, pCO(2) 21 mm Hg, PaO(2) 97 mm Hg, and bicarbonate 15.8 mmol/L. His initial serum chemistry panel was normal. He received activated charcoal and intravenous hydration with sodium bicarbonate. Two hours after arrival, salicylate concentration was 91.6 mg/dL. The patient became agitated and HD was initiated; 22 h after presentation, repeat salicylate concentration was 88.4 mg/dL and his creatinine was 3.9 mg/dL. A second run of HD was performed. After this, his temperature had risen to 39.06°C (102.3°F), BP 122/64 mm Hg, HR 168 beats/min, RR 43 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 95% (2 L nasal cannula). His confusion increased, and he died 40 h after his ingestion.

Conclusion

HD is widely advocated in managing severe salicylate intoxications, however, no consensus exists for the duration and best mode of therapy. Patients with severe salicylate poisonings may require extended durations of HD to effectively mitigate toxicity. Additional study is warranted to determine optimal therapy in severe salicylate intoxications.

### Acute and chronic effects of aspirin toxicity and their treatment… [^113Uvffm]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Salicylate poisoning remains a major clinical hazard, usually resulting from accidental ingestions in preschool children, suicidal overdoses in adults and teenagers, and therapeutically acquired intoxication in all ages. Alkalemia or acidemia, alkaluria or aciduria, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, and water and electrolyte imbalances may occur; nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, hyperpnea, hyperpyrexia, disorientation, coma, and/or convulsions are common. With chronic, therapeutically induced salicylism, these symptoms may be mistaken for symptoms resulting from the illness for which the salicylates were administered. For acute ingestions, the magnitude of the poisoning is clearly dose related. Blood level determinations are good prognostic indicators for acute ingestions but are of limited value in chronic, therapeutically induced salicylism. Fluid and electrolyte management is the mainstay of therapy.

Diuresis, hemodialysis, and hemoperfusion are effective, but the latter two rarely are necessary. Temple AR. Acute and Chronic Effects of Aspirin Toxicity and Their Treatment. Arch Intern Med. 1981; 141: 364–369.

### Acute effects of aspirin and acetaminophen on renal function… [^116Cv82y]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The renal effects of aspirin and acetaminophen are minor. With a major overdose of acetaminophen, uncommonly renal failure may occur that cannot be ascribed to hepatic failure; its mechanism is unknown. Aspirin may cause a transient shedding of renal tubular cells, alterations in urate excretion, inhibition of spironolactone action, and, in certain clinical settings, a reversible decline in renal function manifested as a fall in glomerular filtration that may be accompanied by mild water, sodium, and potassium retention. Active systemic lupus erythematosus, advanced cirrhosis, and chronic renal insufficiency seem to predispose patients to the effects on renal function, and there is direct or indirect evidence in those conditions that prostaglandin synthesis is an important part of the body's attempt to preserve renal blood flow. Study of these effects has provided new insight into the way in which the kidneys may use prostaglandins to preserve renal function when it is threatened.
