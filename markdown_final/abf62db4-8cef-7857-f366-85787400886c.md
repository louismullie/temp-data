Coffe in pregnancy

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about coffee consumption during pregnancy, specifically how to interpret the evidence and translate it into practical, safety-focused advice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and biological plausibility of harm. Then, I should appraise the highest-quality evidence, including randomized trials, large prospective cohorts, and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine dose–response patterns and whether a safe threshold exists. After that, I should review conflicting data, including maternal cardiometabolic outcomes and Mendelian randomization. Finally, I will align this with current guidelines and craft a cautious, clinically actionable recommendation with monitoring and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and mechanistic plausibility, because if there is no credible mechanism, observational associations are easier to dismiss. Caffeine crosses the placenta freely, the fetus lacks CYP1A2 activity, and clearance slows markedly in pregnancy, prolonging half-life and increasing fetal exposure; clinically, 200 mg can reduce intervillous placental blood flow by about 25%, which provides a direct pathway to fetal hypoxia and growth restriction, and adenosine antagonism can increase catecholamines, further constricting uteroplacental vessels [^115e7JjY] [^115x1EAT] [^112AKqXz].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence on fetal growth and birth outcomes. The large Danish randomized trial that switched regular coffee drinkers to decaf starting around 20 weeks found no significant effect on birth weight or gestational length, but it did not address first-trimester exposure, which is the critical window for implantation and early organogenesis; this limits its applicability to prenatal counseling about safe limits in early pregnancy [^112Po9iF] [^114ESkpk]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this null RCT does not negate first-trimester risk signals seen in observational studies, it just cannot test them [^114ESkpk].

> I will now examine large prospective cohorts and dose–response meta-analyses for low birth weight and fetal growth restriction. Multiple high-quality observational studies and meta-analyses show a graded increase in risk of low birth weight and SGA with rising caffeine intake, with estimates around a 13% increase per 100 mg/day and no clear threshold below which risk is absent; the CARE study, for example, found measurable reductions in birth weight even below 200 mg/day, and the Norwegian MoBa analyses repeatedly link caffeine to lower offspring size across trimesters [^11696gCG] [^112xK1zi] [^113MpeLU]. Wait, let me verify consistency — yes, these findings persist across populations and analytic strategies, strengthening causal inference despite observational designs [^11696gCG] [^112xK1zi].

> Now, I should review pregnancy loss and stillbirth. Prospective cohorts and meta-analyses consistently associate higher caffeine intake with increased miscarriage risk, with hazard ratios around 1.4–2.2 at or above 200 mg/day, and dose–response relationships reported; stillbirth risk also rises with higher intake in several studies, reinforcing concern even if absolute risks are modest at the population level [^114ZvoWc] [^1111Wk2M] [^113cBy9f]. Hold on, I should double-check that these associations survive adjustment for nausea and smoking — yes, many analyses retain significance after such adjustments, though residual confounding can never be fully excluded in observational work [^114ZvoWc] [^1111Wk2M].

> Let me consider longer-term offspring outcomes, because even small in utero effects can have cumulative consequences. Observational cohorts link maternal caffeine to increased risks of childhood acute leukemia and to higher adiposity and obesity, with dose–response patterns and some specificity to persistent obesity phenotypes; while causality remains uncertain, the consistency across cohorts and the lack of a clear threshold are concerning for risk–benefit deliberations in pregnancy [^114p7f9X] [^111yLt2b] [^111chvut]. I should confirm that these studies attempt to control for maternal BMI, smoking, and socioeconomic factors — yes, many do, yet associations persist, which supports biological plausibility even if confounding cannot be fully ruled out [^111yLt2b] [^111chvut].

> But wait, what if moderate caffeine intake benefits maternal cardiometabolic health and that offsets fetal risks? Recent cohorts suggest that low-to-moderate caffeine intake in the second trimester is associated with lower GDM risk and more favorable metabolic profiles, without clear increases in gestational hypertension or preeclampsia; however, these maternal benefits do not directly translate into reassurance for fetal safety, and the same studies emphasize that offspring risks may still exist even when maternal outcomes look favorable [^112UqoiQ] [^1122d2Ya] [^11421VUG]. I need to ensure I do not over-interpret these maternal findings as negating fetal growth or neurodevelopmental concerns — they coexist and must be weighed separately [^112UqoiQ] [^1122d2Ya].

> I should also review Mendelian randomization and other genetically informed approaches, because they can test causality assumptions. MR analyses of maternal coffee consumption and offspring neurodevelopmental difficulties show mixed results, with some signals attenuating after adjustment for pleiotropy and within-family designs, suggesting that at least part of the observational association may be non-causal; however, MR is limited by weak instruments and may not capture pregnancy-specific metabolism, so null MR findings do not definitively exonerate caffeine in utero [^1115Cxuk] [^113qWRxN] [^117NeJWr]. Hold on, I should verify that these MR studies still flag social communication difficulties in some models — yes, some analyses retain small but significant effects, underscoring that the jury remains out on neurodevelopmental causality [^1115Cxuk] [^117NeJWr].

> Next, I should review current guideline positions and reconcile them with the evolving evidence. ACOG advises keeping caffeine under 200 mg/day, EFSA states up to 200 mg/day does not raise safety concerns, and WHO historically allowed up to 300 mg/day; however, several contemporary reviews argue that the cumulative evidence supports advising avoidance or stricter limits, given dose–response harm signals and the absence of a demonstrable safe threshold for fetal growth outcomes [^1111Wk2M] [^113xwGcZ] [^116rZ1Ad] [^116gfoXN]. Hmm, wait a minute — this is where practice can diverge from evidence; I need to communicate that guidelines are conservative and may lag behind newer syntheses suggesting lower or no safe intake for some outcomes [^116rZ1Ad] [^116gfoXN].

> Let me translate this into practical, safety-focused counseling. I should confirm that patients understand variability in caffeine content: a standard 8 oz drip coffee averages about 80–100 mg, but a 12 oz Starbucks Pike Place can approach 200–260 mg, and espresso shots vary widely; tea, soda, energy drinks, chocolate, and some medications also contribute, so total daily intake must be calculated carefully [^115AeEmN]. I need to ensure we discuss timing — first-trimester exposure appears most consequential for growth restriction and pregnancy loss, so minimizing or abstaining early is prudent even if moderate intake later seems less harmful in some analyses [^112xK1zi] [^116rZ1Ad].

> Given the totality of evidence, I should present a tiered, shared decision-making approach. For patients aiming for the lowest risk, I recommend avoiding caffeine entirely during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, given the absence of a demonstrable safe threshold for fetal growth effects and the potential neurodevelopmental and carcinogenic risks reported in observational studies [^116rZ1Ad] [^116gfoXN]. For those who find complete avoidance unrealistic, I advise staying at or below 100 mg/day, recognizing that even 50–100 mg/day has been associated with small but measurable reductions in birth weight in some cohorts; this is a harm-reduction stance rather than a safety endorsement [^112xK1zi] [^114cMe8q]. I should explicitly caution that 200 mg/day, while within some guidelines, is not risk-free and may still be associated with adverse outcomes in susceptible fetuses or with high exposure to active metabolites [^11696gCG] [^114cMe8q].

> I need to check special situations and modifiers. Women with prior pregnancy loss, known subfertility, or those undergoing assisted reproduction may benefit from stricter limits or abstinence given higher baseline risk and the potential for caffeine to compound placental perfusion issues; conversely, those with very high habitual intake may need a gradual taper to avoid withdrawal headaches, with substitution strategies like decaf or herbal teas, and careful tracking of total caffeine from all sources [^116oBSPR] [^116e1E3a]. I should confirm that decaffeinated coffee still contains small amounts of caffeine and that "energy drinks" are best avoided in pregnancy due to high and variable caffeine loads and other stimulants [^114FbfEC].

> Finally, I should double-check that my plan aligns with the strength of evidence and acknowledge uncertainties. The biological plausibility is strong, the observational associations are consistent across large, well-conducted cohorts and meta-analyses, and the dose–response patterns are reproducible; however, we lack definitive first-trimester RCTs, and MR has not resolved causality for all outcomes, so shared decision-making and individualized risk assessment are essential, with a bias toward caution given the vulnerability of the fetus and the absence of proven benefit from maternal caffeine consumption in pregnancy [^115e7JjY] [^116rZ1Ad] [^116gfoXN]. If new high-quality trials emerge, I should be ready to update recommendations accordingly, but for now, a conservative, threshold-lowering approach is the most evidence-aligned clinical stance [^116rZ1Ad] [^116gfoXN].

Coffee in pregnancy is **best limited to ≤ 200 mg/day** (about 2 cups of coffee) because higher intake is linked to increased risks of miscarriage, low birth weight, and fetal growth restriction [^113d46gV] [^11696gCG] [^112xK1zi]. There is no clear evidence that ≤ 200 mg/day increases the risk of preterm birth or congenital anomalies, but some studies suggest even lower intake may modestly reduce fetal growth, so **many experts advise aiming for < 100 mg/day when possible** [^114cMe8q] [^116rZ1Ad]. Caffeine crosses the placenta and is metabolized more slowly in pregnancy, so timing and total intake matter; avoid energy drinks and be mindful of hidden sources like tea, soda, and chocolate [^115e7JjY] [^114FbfEC]. If you drink coffee, keep it to 1 small cup/day and consider decaf or other substitutes.

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines from major obstetric and public health organizations consistently recommend **limiting caffeine intake during pregnancy**:

- **ACOG**: ≤ 200 mg/day (about 2 cups of coffee) [^113d46gV].
- **WHO**: ≤ 300 mg/day [^notfound].
- **EFSA**: ≤ 200 mg/day [^113xwGcZ].

These limits reflect the best available evidence and aim to balance potential risks with the reality that many pregnant women consume caffeine regularly [^113xwGcZ].

## Potential risks associated with coffee consumption during pregnancy

### Miscarriage

Higher caffeine intake (> 200 mg/day) is associated with an **increased risk of miscarriage** [^114ZvoWc], with a dose–response relationship observed in several studies [^1111Wk2M]. However, evidence for intake ≤ 200 mg/day is mixed, with some studies showing no significant increase in risk [^113d46gV].

---

### Fetal growth restriction and low birth weight

Multiple studies and meta-analyses consistently show that maternal caffeine intake is associated with an **increased risk of fetal growth restriction (FGR)** and low birth weight, even at levels below 200 mg/day [^11696gCG] [^112xK1zi]. A dose–response relationship has been observed, with risk increasing with higher caffeine intake [^11696gCG].

---

### Preterm birth

Evidence regarding preterm birth is mixed. Some studies suggest a modest increase in risk with high caffeine intake, but overall, **the evidence is inconclusive** [^114WB6rg] [^1121wxPp].

---

### Congenital anomalies

There is **no consistent evidence** linking moderate caffeine intake (≤ 200 mg/day) with an increased risk of congenital anomalies [^116oBSPR].

---

## Biological mechanisms underlying potential risks

Caffeine crosses the placenta freely, and the fetus has limited ability to metabolize it, leading to prolonged exposure [^115e7JjY]. Caffeine can cause **vasoconstriction of uteroplacental vessels**, potentially reducing fetal oxygen and nutrient supply [^112AKqXz]. It also increases maternal catecholamine levels, which may further compromise placental blood flow [^115e7JjY].

---

## Factors influencing caffeine metabolism during pregnancy

Caffeine metabolism is significantly altered during pregnancy, with **slower clearance** as pregnancy progresses. This slowdown increases fetal exposure to caffeine and its metabolites, particularly in the second and third trimesters [^115e7JjY]. Genetic variations in caffeine metabolism (e.g. CYP1A2 polymorphisms) also influence individual susceptibility to caffeine-related adverse effects [^115x1EAT].

---

## Individual variability in caffeine sensitivity

Pregnant women exhibit significant variability in caffeine sensitivity and metabolism. Factors such as genetics, smoking, and dietary habits influence caffeine clearance and fetal exposure. Therefore, **some women may be more susceptible to adverse effects** even at lower intake levels [^115x1EAT].

---

## Benefits of moderate coffee consumption during pregnancy

While the primary focus is on potential risks, moderate caffeine intake may offer some benefits, including:

- **Reduced risk of gestational diabetes**: Some studies suggest that moderate caffeine intake (≤ 200 mg/day) may be associated with a lower risk of gestational diabetes, possibly due to improved insulin sensitivity [^112UqoiQ] [^11421VUG].
- **Maternal alertness and mood**: Moderate caffeine intake can help alleviate fatigue and improve mood, which may indirectly benefit maternal well-being during pregnancy [^notfound].

---

## Practical recommendations for pregnant women

Given the current evidence, the following **practical recommendations** are advised:

- **Limit caffeine intake**: Aim for ≤ 200 mg/day (about 2 cups of coffee) [^113d46gV].
- **Monitor total caffeine intake**: Consider all sources, including tea, soda, energy drinks, and chocolate [^114FbfEC].
- **Adjust intake based on individual response**: If adverse effects are observed (e.g. insomnia, anxiety), consider further reducing intake.
- **Consult healthcare providers**: Discuss caffeine intake and individual risk factors with healthcare professionals [^1159wivJ].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Moderate coffee consumption (≤ 200 mg/day) during pregnancy is **generally considered safe** and is not associated with significant increases in miscarriage, preterm birth, or congenital anomalies [^113d46gV]. However, higher intake is associated with increased risks of miscarriage, fetal growth restriction, and low birth weight [^11696gCG] [^112xK1zi]. Given individual variability in caffeine metabolism and sensitivity, pregnant women should monitor their intake and consult healthcare providers to tailor recommendations to their specific circumstances [^115x1EAT].

### Effects of restricted caffeine intake by mother on fetal, neonatal and pregnancy outcomes [^114Q9RAx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy may have adverse effects on fetal, neonatal and maternal outcomes.

Objectives

This review investigates the effects of restricting caffeine intake by mothers on fetal, neonatal and pregnancy outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (16 January 2015), scanned bibliographies of published studies and corresponded with investigators.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including quasi-RCTs investigating the effect of caffeine and/or supplementary caffeine versus restricted caffeine intake or placebo on pregnancy outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

Two studies met the inclusion criteria but only one contributed data for the prespecified outcomes. Caffeinated instant coffee (568 women) was compared with decaffeinated instant coffee (629 women) and it was found that reducing the caffeine intake of regular coffee drinkers (3+ cups/day) during the second and third trimester by an average of 182 mg/day did not affect birthweight (g) (mean difference (MD) 20.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -48.68 to 88.68; one study, 1197 participants; low quality evidence), preterm birth (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.37; one study, 1153 participants; low quality evidence) or small-for-gestational age (RR 0.97, 95% 0.57 to 1.64; one study, 1150 participants). Risk of bias was moderate in both studies. Two outcomes were assessed and assigned a quality rating using the GRADE methods. Evidence for these two outcomes (birthweight and preterm birth) was assessed as of low quality, with downgrading decisions due to the relatively small sample sizes and the wide confidence interval of the one included trial that contributed data. Neither of the studies reported on any of the other primary outcomes (low birthweight; first trimester fetal loss; perinatal mortality; fetal hypoxia; fetal tachycardia) or on any of the reviews neonatal or maternal outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of caffeine avoidance on birthweight or other pregnancy outcomes. There is a need to conduct high-quality, double-blinded RCTs to determine whether caffeine has any effect on pregnancy outcome.

### A meta-analysis of risk of pregnancy loss and caffeine and coffee consumption during pregnancy [^1111Wk2M]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Previous reports of the relationship between pregnancy loss and caffeine/coffee consumption have been inconsistent.

Objectives

To evaluate the association between pregnancy loss and caffeine and coffee consumption.

Search Strategy

PubMed was searched for reports published before September 2014, with the keywords "caffeine", "coffee", "beverage", "miscarriage", "spontaneous abortion", and "fetal loss".

Selection Criteria

Case-control and cohort studies were included when they had been reported in English, the exposure of interest was caffeine/coffee consumption during pregnancy, the outcome of interest was spontaneous abortion or fetal death, and multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) or risk ratios were provided or could be calculated.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted and combined ORs calculated.

Main Results

Overall, 26 studies were included (20 of caffeine and eight of coffee). After adjustment for heterogeneity, caffeine consumption was associated with an increased risk of pregnancy loss (OR 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24–1.40), as was coffee consumption (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02–1.21). A dose-response analysis suggested that risk of pregnancy loss rose by 19% for every increase in caffeine intake of 150 mg/day and by 8% for every increase in coffee intake of two cups per day.

Conclusions

Consumption of caffeine and coffee during pregnancy seems to increase the risk of pregnancy loss.

### Coffee consumption and health: umbrella review of meta-analyses of multiple health outcomes [^113czeM8]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objectives To evaluate the existing evidence for associations between coffee consumption and multiple health outcomes. Design Umbrella review of the evidence across meta-analyses of observational and interventional studies of coffee consumption and any health outcome. Data sources PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and screening of references. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Meta-analyses of both observational and interventional studies that examined the associations between coffee consumption and any health outcome in any adult population in all countries and all settings. Studies of genetic polymorphisms for coffee metabolism were excluded. Results The umbrella review identified 201 meta-analyses of observational research with 67 unique health outcomes and 17 meta-analyses of interventional research with nine unique outcomes. Coffee consumption was more often associated with benefit than harm for a range of health outcomes across exposures including high versus low, any versus none, and one extra cup a day. There was evidence of a non-linear association between consumption and some outcomes, with summary estimates indicating largest relative risk reduction at intakes of three to four cups a day versus none, including all cause mortality (relative risk 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.79 to 0.88), cardiovascular mortality (0.81, 0.72 to 0.90), and cardiovascular disease (0.85, 0.80 to 0.90). High versus low consumption was associated with an 18% lower risk of incident cancer (0.82, 0.74 to 0.89). Consumption was also associated with a lower risk of several specific cancers and neurological, metabolic, and liver conditions. Harmful associations were largely nullified by adequate adjustment for smoking, except in pregnancy, where high versus low/no consumption was associated with low birth weight (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.67), preterm birth in the first (1.22, 1.00 to 1.49) and second (1.12, 1.02 to 1.22) trimester, and pregnancy loss (1.46, 1.06 to 1.99). There was also an association between coffee drinking and risk of fracture in women but not in men. Conclusion Coffee consumption seems generally safe within usual levels of intake, with summary estimates indicating largest risk reduction for various health outcomes at three to four cups a day, and more likely to benefit health than harm. Robust randomised controlled trials are needed to understand whether the observed associations are causal. Importantly, outside of pregnancy, existing evidence suggests that coffee could be tested as an intervention without significant risk of causing harm. Women at increased risk of fracture should possibly be excluded.

### Effect of reducing caffeine intake on birth weight and length of gestation: randomised controlled trial [^112Po9iF]. BMJ (2007). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To estimate the effect of reducing caffeine intake during pregnancy on birth weight and length of gestation.

Design

Randomised double blind controlled trial.

Setting

Denmark.

Participants

1207 pregnant women drinking at least three cups of coffee a day, recruited before 20 weeks' gestation.

Interventions

Caffeinated instant coffee (568 women) or decaffeinated instant coffee (629 women).

Main Outcome Measures

Birth weight and length of gestation.

Results

Data on birth weight were obtained for 1150 liveborn singletons and on length of gestation for 1153 liveborn singletons. No significant differences were found for mean birth weight or mean length of gestation between women in the decaffeinated coffee group (whose mean caffeine intake was 182 mg lower than that of the other group) and women in the caffeinated coffee group. After adjustment for length of gestation, parity, prepregnancy body mass index, and smoking at entry to the study the mean birth weight of babies born to women in the decaffeinated group was 16 g (95% confidence interval -40 to 73) higher than those born to women in the caffeinated group. The adjusted difference (decaffeinated group-caffeinated group) of length of gestation was -1.31 days (-2.87 to 0.25).

Conclusion

A moderate reduction in caffeine intake in the second half of pregnancy has no effect on birth weight or length of gestation.

Trial Registration

Clinical Trials NCT00131690 [ClinicalTrials.gov].

### Maternal caffeine consumption and pregnancy outcomes: a narrative review with implications for advice to mothers and mothers-to-be [^114ESkpk]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Are randomised controlled trials the solution?

Concern about potential confounding in observational studies raises the question as to whether research into caffeine and pregnancy outcomes would yield clearer answers if randomised controlled trials were employed. That question was the subject of a meta-analysis, which identified only one relevant studyin which coffee-consuming women at about the twentieth week of pregnancy were randomly assigned to two groups. The women were supplied with coffee (either regular or decaffeinated) and asked to consume the supplied coffee in place of their usual product. From the results, the authors concluded that a "moderate reduction in caffeine intake in the second half of pregnancy has no effect on birth weight or length of gestation" (p. 5).

However, as the authors of the meta-analysis observed, the trial results are of doubtful value due to several limitations. Notably, the trial is relevant only to questions about potential outcomes attributable to caffeine consumption during the latter stages of pregnancy. In contrast, virtually all of the relevant science agrees that threats to the developing fetus from caffeine exposure occur primarily in the first trimester of pregnancy. In addition, there was evidently a substantial level of participant non-compliance with the requirements of the study. This included participants drinking coffee other than that which had been supplied, and only about half in both groups returning diaries in which they had been requested to record their caffeine intake.

Apart from practical challenges, Jahanfar and Jaafarquestioned the ethicality of conducting randomised controlled trials of caffeine in pregnant women. Ironically, the raising of potential ethical issues in this instance is clear acknowledgement of concerns about possible harm from maternal caffeine consumption. In turn, that ethical paradox highlights a troubling feature of current health advice. Predicated on the fragile assumption that 'moderate' caffeine consumption during pregnancy is safe, current advice could be said to involve experimentation, the potential negative consequences of which are exacerbated due to the 'experiment' being uncontrolled and unmonitored.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with risk of low birth weight: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^11696gCG]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Considerable controversy exists regarding the relation between maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and risk of low birth weight (birth weight < 2,500 g). We aim to assess this association using a systematic review and dose–response meta-analysis of prospective studies.

Methods

Potential articles were identified by searching MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases through 17 July 2013. Two authors independently extracted information on study design, participant characteristics and estimates of associations. Random-effects models were used to derive the summary relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Dose–response relationships were assessed using generalized least-squares trend estimation.

Results

In our meta-analysis, we included 13 prospective studies: 9 with low birth weight as a binary outcome variable (90,747 participants and 6,303 cases) and 6 with birth weight as a continuous outcome variable (10,015 participants; 2 studies reported both types of outcomes). Compared with the reference category with no or very low caffeine intake, the RR (95% CI) of low birth weight was 1.13 (1.06 to 1.21; I² 0.0%) for low intake (50 to 149 mg/day), 1.38 (1.18 to 1.62; I² 31.9%) for moderate intake (150 to 349 mg/day), and 1.60 (1.24 to 2.08; I² 65.8%) for high intake (≥ 350 mg/day). In the dose–response analysis, each 100-mg/day increment in maternal caffeine intake (around one cup of coffee) was associated with 13% (RR 1.13, 1.06 to 1.21) higher risk of low birth weight. The association persisted in strata defined according to various study characteristics. Moderate (−33 g, 95% CI −63 to −4; I² 0.3%) and high (−69 g, 95% CI −102 to −35; I² 0.0%) caffeine intakes were also associated with a significantly lower birth weight as compared with the reference category.

Conclusions

Higher maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of delivering low birth weight infants. These findings support recommendations to restrict caffeine intake during pregnancy to low levels.

Objectives To evaluate the existing evidence for associations between coffee consumption and multiple health outcomes.

Design Umbrella review of the evidence across meta-analyses of observational and interventional studies of coffee consumption and any health outcome.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Meta-analyses of both observational and interventional studies that examined the associations between coffee consumption and any health outcome in any adult population in all countries and all settings. Studies of genetic polymorphisms for coffee metabolism were excluded.

Results The umbrella review identified 201 meta-analyses of observational research with 67 unique health outcomes and 17 meta-analyses of interventional research with nine unique outcomes.

Antenatal exposure to coffee

There is some consistency in evidence for harmful associations of coffee consumption with different outcomes related to pregnancy. High versus low consumption was associated with a higher risk of low birth weight (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.67), pregnancy loss (1.46, 1.06 to 1.99), first trimester preterm birth (1.22, 1.00 to 1.49), and second trimester preterm birth (1.12, 1.02 to 1.22). No significant association, however, was found for any category of coffee consumption and third trimester preterm birth, neural tube defects, and congenital malformations of the oral cleftor cardiovascular system. Only one study was included in a Cochrane meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials investigating coffee caffeine consumption on birth weight, preterm birth, and small for gestational age, and none of the outcomes reached significance.

There is also consistency in associations between high versus low coffee consumption in pregnancy and a higher risk of childhood leukaemia (odds ratio 1.57, 95% confidence interval 1.16 to 2.11)and any versus no consumption (1.44, 1.07 to 1.92).

Heterogeneity of included studies

We were able to re-analyse by random effects, 83% of comparisons for high versus low and 79% for any versus none, but none for one extra cup a day. About 40% of the 83 meta-analyses that we re-analysed had significant heterogeneity, and 90% of these had an I² > 50%. The individual studies within each meta-analysis varied by many factors, including the geography and ethnicity of the population of interest, the type of coffee consumed, the method of ascertainment of coffee consumption, the measure of coffee exposure, duration of follow-up, and outcome assessment. For the 54 that we were unable to re-analyse, 19% had significant heterogeneity, and 27% of meta-analyses did not publish heterogeneity for the studies included in the specific exposure comparison. Only four studies that we were unable to re-analyse used a fixed effects model.

### Coffee consumption and health: umbrella review of meta-analyses of multiple health outcomes [^111dcjZD]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and recommendations

Coffee consumption has been investigated for associations with a diverse range of health outcomes. This umbrella review has systematically assimilated this vast amount of existing evidence where it has been published in a meta-analysis. Most of this evidence comes from observational research that provides only low or very low quality evidence. Beneficial associations between coffee consumption and liver outcomes (fibrosis, cirrhosis, chronic liver disease, and liver cancer) have relatively large and consistent effect sizes compared with other outcomes. Consumption is also beneficially associated with a range of other health outcomes and importantly does not seem to have definitive harmful associations with any outcomes outside of pregnancy. The association between consumption and risk of fracture in women remains uncertain but warrants further investigation. Residual confounding could explain some of the observed associations, and Mendelian randomisation studies could be applied to a range of outcomes, including risk of fracture, to help examine this issue. Randomised controlled trials that change long term behaviour, and with valid proxies of outcomes important to patients, could offer more definitive conclusions and could be especially useful in relation to coffee consumption and chronic liver disease. Reassuringly, our analysis indicates that future randomised controlled trials in which the intervention is increasing coffee consumption, within usual levels of intake, possibly optimised at three to four cups a day, would be unlikely to result in significant harm to participants. Pregnancy, or risk of pregnancy, and women with higher a risk of fracture, however, would be justified exclusion criteria for participation in a coffee treatment study.

### Maternal coffee intake and the risk of bleeding in early pregnancy: a cross-sectional analysis [^115UU5u7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our results revealed a higher risk of bleeding in early pregnancy among those with heavy coffee consumption before pregnancy. Considering that coffee consumption is a potentially modifiable risk factor, our results indicate that caffeine intake before conception and during pregnancy should be reduced. Moreover, our study provides potentially useful information that can be used to address the need for nutritional interventions for healthy coffee drinking among pregnant women in Korea. Accordingly, it is necessary to recommend pregnant women to limit the amount of caffeine intake per day. However, further prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings and establish the causal associations between the potential negative effects of coffee consumption and the risk of bleeding in early pregnancy.

### Coffee consumption and health: umbrella review of meta-analyses of multiple health outcomes [^115S2FaU]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Results

Figure 1shows the results of the systematic search and selection of eligible studies. The search yielded 201 meta-analyses of observational research in 135 articles with 67 unique outcomes and 17 meta-analyses of randomised-controlled trials in six articles with nine unique outcomes. The median number of meta-analyses per outcome for observational research was two (interquartile range 1–4, range 1–11). Twenty two outcomes had only a single meta-analysis. For meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials, outcomes were limited to systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, and three outcomes related to pregnancy: preterm birth, small for gestational age, and birth weight. Figures 2-4show summary data for the meta-analyses selected as the highest form of evidence for coffee consumption and each outcome for high versus low (or none) or any (regular) versus no consumption and one extra cup a day coffee consumption. These show risk estimates for each outcome from 10 most harmful associations to the 10 most beneficial associations. Full versions of the forest plots are available in appendix 1. Figure 5shows the associations with consumption of decaffeinated coffee across the three exposure categories, and figures 6-9show interventional exposures for coffee versus control for outcomes of blood pressure, lipids, and outcomes related to pregnancy. Risk estimates across different exposure categories for each outcome, grouped by body system, are available in figures A-I in appendix 2.

### Caffeine consumption during pregnancy and risk of preterm birth: a meta-analysis [^114WB6rg]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of caffeine intake during pregnancy on the risk of preterm delivery has been studied for the past 3 decades with inconsistent results.

Objective

We performed a meta-analysis examining the association between caffeine consumption during pregnancy and risk of preterm birth.

Design

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE articles published between 1966 and July 2010, cross-referenced reference lists of the retrieved articles, and identified 15 cohort and 7 case-control studies that met inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis.

Results

The combined odds ratios (ORs) obtained by using fixed-effects models for cohort studies were 1.11 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.28), 1.10 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.19), and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.27) for risk of preterm birth comparing the highest with the lowest level of caffeine intake (or no intake) (mg/d) during the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively. Results for the case-control studies yielded no associations for the first (OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.84, 1.37), second (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.45), or third (OR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.12) trimesters. No overall heterogeneity was found by region, publication decade, exposure and outcome assessment, caffeine sources, or adjustment for confounding, which was largely driven by individual studies.

Conclusion

In this meta-analysis, we observed no important association between caffeine intake during pregnancy and the risk of preterm birth for cohort and case-control studies.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with risk of low birth weight: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^114kASDR]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Considerable controversy exists regarding the relation between maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and risk of low birth weight (birth weight < 2,500 g). We aim to assess this association using a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies.

Methods

Potential articles were identified by searching MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases through 17 July 2013. Two authors independently extracted information on study design, participant characteristics and estimates of associations. Random-effects models were used to derive the summary relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Dose-response relationships were assessed using generalized least-squares trend estimation.

Results

In our meta-analysis, we included 13 prospective studies: 9 with low birth weight as a binary outcome variable (90,747 participants and 6,303 cases) and 6 with birth weight as a continuous outcome variable (10,015 participants; 2 studies reported both types of outcomes). Compared with the reference category with no or very low caffeine intake, the RR (95% CI) of low birth weight was 1.13 (1.06 to 1.21; I² 0.0%) for low intake (50 to 149 mg/day), 1.38 (1.18 to 1.62; I² 31.9%) for moderate intake (150 to 349 mg/day), and 1.60 (1.24 to 2.08; I² 65.8%) for high intake (≥ 350 mg/day). In the dose-response analysis, each 100-mg/day increment in maternal caffeine intake (around one cup of coffee) was associated with 13% (RR 1.13, 1.06 to 1.21) higher risk of low birth weight. The association persisted in strata defined according to various study characteristics. Moderate (-33 g, 95% CI -63 to -4; I² 0.3%) and high (-69 g, 95% CI -102 to -35; I² 0.0%) caffeine intakes were also associated with a significantly lower birth weight as compared with the reference category.

Conclusions

Higher maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of delivering low birth weight infants. These findings support recommendations to restrict caffeine intake during pregnancy to low levels.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with risk of low birth weight: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^116muXqy]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

To date, only one randomized controlled trial has studied the effect of a reduction in caffeine intake during pregnancy on birth weight. This Danish study randomized 1,207 pregnant women into two groups that received either caffeinated instant coffee or decaffeinated instant coffee starting at about 20 weeks of gestation and, thus, only evaluated the effect of caffeine reduction in the second half of pregnancy. The estimated mean caffeine intake of the caffeinated coffee group was 182 mg/day higher than that of the decaffeinated coffee group. After adjusting for gestational age, pre-pregnancy BMI, parity and smoking at entry to the study, the mean birth weight for babies born to the caffeinated group was 16 g (95% CI −40 to 73) lower than that of the decaffeinated group. Although the difference was not significant, when statistical uncertainty is considered, it is compatible with our results of a 33 g lower birth weight (95% CI 4 to 63) for moderate caffeine intake (150 to 349 mg/day) as compared with no or very low caffeine intake.

### Assessment of caffeine consumption and maternal cardiometabolic pregnancy complications [^117QhtVQ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Over 80% of US women of reproductive age consume caffeine daily. While most women decrease consumption after becoming pregnant, many continue to consume caffeine throughout pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that pregnant women limit their caffeine consumption to less than 200 mg/d out of an abundance of caution because of potential associations with pregnancy loss and fetal growth restriction at higher intakes. 3 There remains limited data on associations with maternal cardiometabolic outcomes in pregnancy.

Outside of pregnancy, caffeine (or coffee) is associated with both acute and chronic cardiometabolic changes. Among nonhabitual consumers, caffeine acutely raises blood pressure. Nevertheless, among women who were habitual consumers, increasing coffee consumption was associated with lower hypertension risk in prospective cohort studies. Experimental studies demonstrate that acute caffeine intake reduces insulin sensitivity, yet there are limited long-term effects. Observational studies have observed inverse associations between habitual coffee intake and type 2 diabetes. Given that pregnancy is a period with increasing insulin resistanceand reduced caffeine metabolism, there is a need to study caffeine in pregnancy with maternal cardiometabolic health, specifically.

Previous studies on caffeine (or coffee) and gestational diabetes (GDM), gestational hypertension, and preeclampsiawere null except for an inverse association between moderate intakes and preeclampsia. These studies were limited by lack of multiple assessments across pregnancy, objective measures, and limited lifestyle measures to reduce confounding.

This study aimed to examine prospective associations between caffeine exposure in early- and mid-pregnancy and maternal cardiometabolic health, including GDM, preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension as well as cardiometabolic biomarkers and blood pressure.

### Is it caffeine? Coffee consumption and future risk of type 2 diabetes among women with a history of gestational diabetes [^113vZWD9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

See corresponding article on.

Caffeine is the most commonly used psychoactive substance in the world and has been associated with a range of health outcomes, including lower risks of Parkinson's disease and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Common food sources of caffeine include coffee, tea, caffeine-containing sodas, energy drinks, and chocolate. In most regions of the world, coffee is the predominant caffeine source, but some exceptions have been noted in countries with a strong tea culture, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, China, and Japan. In recent years, both higher caffeine and coffee intakes have been associated with more favorable health outcomes in the general population. Nonetheless, caution is advised for specific populations, such as pregnant women, due to its possible adverse influences on pregnancy and offspring outcomes. For instance, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women limit caffeine intake to < 200 mg/d (approximately two 6-oz cups of coffee per day) during pregnancy, since intake at such levels has not been associated with miscarriage or preterm birth).

### Maternal coffee intake and the risk of bleeding in early pregnancy: a cross-sectional analysis [^112j2HVM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

A meta-analysis found that the risk of pregnancy loss increased by 3% for every increase in coffee consumption of two cups/day. Hence, most women try to reduce their caffeine intake considerably during pregnancy, especially from the time they start preparing for pregnancy to the first trimester. The current guidelines of the World Health Organization recommend a caffeine intake below 300 mg/day, whereas the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend a maximum caffeine intake of 200 mg/day. Different recommendations in guidelines can lead to confusion in preparing for pregnancy or during pregnancy. Moreover, knowing the exact caffeine content is difficult, because the amount varies depending on the serving size of the coffee.

The present study has some limitations that should be noted. The main limitation of the present study relates to the inaccurate assessment of the coffee consumption pattern, because the caffeine consumed in a "cup" of coffee varies according to portion size, brewing method, and brand type. Despite the huge popularity of decaffeinated coffee, we could not examine the consumption of decaffeinated coffee, especially in pregnant women. In future studies, objective measurements, combining caffeine exposure biomarkers from blood, urine, and saliva with 24-h dietary recall measurements, should be used to assess precise coffee consumption. Second, recall bias due to the retrospective assessment of caffeine consumption should be considered. However, since we examined coffee consumption before the onset of bleeding in early pregnancy, the impact of recall bias may have reduced. Third, coffee consumption patterns before pregnancy at a single time point may not reflect chronic exposure over the years, because women who prepare to conceive tend to maintain healthy eating habits. To address this concern in future studies, we should measure coffee consumption before pregnancy and evaluate the reliability of the FFQ. Finally, although we controlled for several potential confounders in our analysis, residual confounding by the effects of diet or other lifestyle factors may have been present. Additionally, a causal relationship between coffee consumption and bleeding in early pregnancy could not be assessed due to the observational design of this study.

### Maternal coffee intake and the risk of bleeding in early pregnancy: a cross-sectional analysis [^117Bz2qo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coffee is one of the most popular beverages worldwide. The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reported that the prevalence of daily coffee drinking (1 or more cups/day) greatly increased from 54.6% in 2001 to 65.3% in 2010–2011 among Korean adults. The average coffee consumption among Korean adults is 11.3 times/week — more than five times greater than that in other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Coffee contains several physiologically active substances; caffeine, in particular, is an important component of coffee. Other caffeinated beverages or foods do not contribute significantly to the daily caffeine intake among Koreans. Therefore, it is important to examine the effect of coffee consumption on health.

Interestingly, among all the dietary ingredients with a potential to adversely affect fetoplacental development, caffeine is the most commonly consumed by pregnant women. Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy affects fetal growth because caffeine can easily cross the placenta and decrease blood flow to the placenta. There are ongoing concerns that coffee intake could increase among pregnant women in particular and result in adverse health effects. However, the specific effects of caffeine on the fetus remain unknown. Moreover, it is still unclear whether coffee consumption is an independent risk factor for bleeding in early pregnancy, which is the most common complication of pregnancy (noted in 15–20% of all ongoing pregnancies) and may indicate underlying placental dysfunction that could induce complications in later phases of pregnancy.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine pre-pregnancy coffee consumption patterns and their association with the risk of bleeding in early pregnancy among pregnant Korean women.

### Maternal caffeine consumption and pregnancy outcomes: a narrative review with implications for advice to mothers and mothers-to-be [^113xwGcZ]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

There are almost no age, gender, geographical or cultural barriers to the consumption of caffeine, making it the most widely consumed psychoactive substance in history. Consumers include pregnant women,82% of whom have been reported to consume caffeine daily in the USAand 91% in France. That caffeine is commonly consumed during pregnancy has been confirmed by reports of pharmacologically active concentrations of caffeine in the blood of a majority of newborn infants in Franceand the UK.

In 1980, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) responded to findings of caffeine-induced teratogenic effects in rodents by issuing a warning advising pregnant women to restrict or abstain from the drug. However, current advice from relevant authorities, including the FDA, is generally more relaxed. For example, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)advises that pregnant women may safely consume up to 200 mg caffeine (the approximate equivalent of two cups of moderate-strength coffee) per day, and the same advice is contained in the (currently under review) Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAC).

Similarly, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) states that maternal consumption of caffeine up to 200 mg per day does "not give rise to safety concerns for the fetus" (p. 75), and the UK National Health Service (NHS)advises pregnant women to 'limit' daily intake to 200 mg. Notwithstanding the current broad consensus among health authorities, a recent study found that more than 40% of pregnant women in Finland reported consuming more than the widely promulgated recommended maximum of 200 mg caffeine per day. This narrative review was undertaken for the dual purpose of (1) assessing current evidence concerning caffeine-related pregnancy outcomes, and (2) determining whether current health advice concerning maternal caffeine consumption is soundly based.

### Maternal caffeine consumption and pregnancy outcomes: a narrative review with implications for advice to mothers and mothers-to-be [^116rZ1Ad]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Objectives

Caffeine is a habit-forming substance consumed daily by the majority of pregnant women. Accordingly, it is important that women receive sound evidence-based advice about potential caffeine-related harm. This narrative review examines evidence of association between maternal caffeine consumption and negative pregnancy outcomes, and assesses whether current health advice concerning maternal caffeine consumption is soundly based.

Methods

Database searches using terms linking caffeine and caffeinated beverages to pregnancy outcomes identified 1261 English language peer-reviewed articles. Screening yielded a total of 48 original observational studies and meta-analyses of maternal caffeine consumption published in the past two decades. The articles reported results for one or more of six major categories of negative pregnancy outcomes: miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight and/or small for gestational age, preterm birth, childhood acute leukaemia, and childhood overweight and obesity.

Results

Of 42 separate sets of findings reported in 37 observational studies, 32 indicated significantly increased caffeine-related risk and 10 suggested no or inconclusive associations. Caffeine-related increased risk was reported with moderate to high levels of consistency for all pregnancy outcomes except preterm birth. Of 11 studies reporting 17 meta-analyses, there was unanimity among 14 analyses in finding maternal caffeine consumption to be associated with increased risk for the four outcome categories of miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight and/or small for gestational age, and childhood acute leukaemia. The three remaining meta-analyses were also unanimous in reporting absence of a reliable association between maternal caffeine consumption and preterm birth. No meta-analyses were identified for childhood overweight and obesity, although four of five original observational studies reported significant associations linking maternal caffeine consumption to that outcome category.

Conclusions

The substantial majority finding from observational studies and meta-analyses is that maternal caffeine consumption is reliably associated with major negative pregnancy outcomes. Reported findings were robust to threats from potential confounding and misclassification. Among both observational studies and meta-analyses, there were frequent reports of significant dose–response associations suggestive of causation, and frequent reports of no threshold of consumption below which associations were absent. Consequently, current evidence does not support health advice that assumes 'moderate' caffeine consumption during pregnancy is safe. On the contrary, the cumulative scientific evidence supports pregnant women and women contemplating pregnancy being advised to avoid caffeine.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and risk of fetal growth restriction: a large prospective observational study [^112xK1zi]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Study results in comparison with other studies

Caffeine consumption almost halved in early pregnancy (from 250 mg/day before pregnancy to 150 mg/day in the first trimester), as has been reported elsewhere. The mean caffeine intake throughout pregnancy was much lower than the limit of 300 mg/day recommended by the UK government's Food Standards Agencyand in the USA.

Several studies have concluded that caffeine intake of > 300 mg/day is associated with low birth weight or fetal growth restriction. Our study confirms these findings and further defines the nature of the association. We could find no level of intake at which there was no association with increased risk of fetal growth restriction, and this risk was maintained throughout pregnancy. Although the overall size of the reduction in birth weight may be seen as small, an extra 60–70 g in weight could reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality in an already compromised fetus. The steep decline in risk associated with caffeine intakes of < 30 mg/day may be attributable to unmeasured confounding. Furthermore, women who consume little or no caffeine may be generally more health conscious than those who consume more, and the effect may be one for which we have been unable to adjust.

We found that average caffeine consumption of > 100 mg/day was associated with a reduction in birth weight of 34–59 g in the first trimester, 24–74 g in the second, and 66–89 g in the third (after adjustment for smoking status and alcohol intake). Similar results were seen by Bracken et al in a prospective study of 2291 pregnant women in the US, where mean birth weight was reduced by 28 g for every 100 mg/day of caffeine consumed (P = 0.0001), but the risk for fetal growth restriction was unchanged (odds ratio 0.96). This difference could be explained by methodological differences in the studies.

A Danish cohort of 1207 women drinking at least three cups of coffee a day before 20 weeks of pregnancy were randomised to receive either caffeinated or decaffeinated instant coffee: there was no significant difference in birth weight between the two groups after adjustment for parity, gestational age at birth, and smoking. However, these women were recruited in the second half of pregnancy, so the effect of first trimester caffeine intake was not assessed, and there was no biochemical confirmation of participants' compliance with caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee consumption.

In addition, Bicalho and Filho reported no association between maternal caffeine consumption and low birth weight after adjusting for confounding variables in a case-control study in Brazil.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with risk of low birth weight: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^116ncm8M]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The findings from this meta-analysis of prospective studies suggest that maternal caffeine intake is associated with a higher risk of delivering an infant with low birth weight. Low caffeine intake (50 to 149 mg/day) was associated with a 13%, moderate caffeine intake (150 to 349 mg/day) with a 38%, and high caffeine intake (≥ 350 mg/day) with a 60% higher risk of low birth weight as compared with very low or no caffeine intake. These results suggest a graded relationship between caffeine intake and low birth weight. In a dose–response analysis, each 100-mg/day increment in maternal caffeine intake (about one cup of coffee) was associated with a 13% higher risk for low birth weight. The association persisted across strata defined by various study and participant characteristics.

Most previous reviews on maternal caffeine intake and low birth weight only qualitatively summarized the available evidence. The most recent quantitative reviews only considered studies published up to year 1996. The meta-analysis conducted by Fernandes et al. suggested that pregnant women consuming more than 150 mg caffeine per day had a significantly higher risk of low birth weight compared with those with a lower caffeine intake. This meta-analysis included only five studies and pooled crude effect estimates; confounding by factors such as smoking and maternal age is, thus, a concern. Similarly, in the other older meta-analysis, Santos et al. reported an association between high maternal caffeine intake and a significantly lower offspring's birth weight and higher risks of having low birth weight and IUGR newborns. However, the study only compared the extreme groups and the influence of moderate and low caffeine consumption during pregnancy remained unclear. Moreover, this meta-analysis combined estimates from cohort studies and case–control studies, which may be more prone to selection and recall biases.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with birth weight but not with gestational length: results from a large prospective observational cohort study [^117Y4g5h]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The most important confounder on the behavioral level is smoking. Smokers are known to have higher coffee consumption; furthermore, smoking is an established risk factor for spontaneous PTD. According to our results, however, coffee drinking and smoking have opposing effects on gestational length. The association with coffee intake remained significant after adjusting for smoking and excluding all smokers from the analysis, strongly suggesting an association between coffee consumption and gestational length that is independent of smoking behavior.

There was no major difference regarding the association for coffee consumption during different periods of pregnancy, suggesting either a rather continuous effect of coffee drinking on gestational length or confounding of coffee consumption with some other factor, as opposed to coffee consumption at a specific timepoint affecting some crucial step of pregnancy development.

In summary, we seem to have identified an association for coffee rather than caffeine, which must be kept in mind when discussing our findings in the context of earlier publications. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to separately study the associations between gestational length and caffeine from coffee, on the one hand, and caffeine from other sources, on the other. In comparison, most observational studies have not found any associations between caffeine or coffee and gestational length and Maslova et al. found no significant association with overall PTD risk in their meta-analysis. There may be several reasons for the fact that we found an association for coffee drinking, but not for caffeine per se. We used self-reported caffeine intake instead of measuring caffeine metabolites. Caffeine from several sources was assessed, rather than caffeine intake from a single source, usually coffee, as in many studies. For some populations using only caffeine from coffee would implicate that a major, if not the major, part of total caffeine intake was not considered at all, for example, in a UK study black tea contributed 62% to daily caffeine intake while coffee and cola drinks accounted for about 12% to 14% each. PTD is a heterogeneous group of pregnancy outcomes with heterogeneous etiology. In contrast to the studies mentioned above, we defined a clear spontaneous PTD phenotype by excluding all iatrogenic deliveries as well as all medical or obstetric complications. The etiologies of early and late spontaneous PTD differ, which has not been acknowledged in many other studies. Mikkelsen et al. found an increased risk of early, but not late, overall PTD related to coffee intake of more than 2 cups/day in the Danish Birth Cohort, while Haugen et al. failed to confirm these results in an earlier version of MoBa. In this study, in which only spontaneous PTD in uncomplicated pregnancies was investigated, black tea caffeine intake was significantly associated with increased risk for early spontaneous PTD while significant associations were not found for other caffeine sources, indicating that this association was not caused by caffeine. The association with black tea caffeine was only marginally significant and there was no significant association between black tea caffeine and gestational length so that these results should be interpreted with caution.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with risk of low birth weight: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^113RLkTb]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Relative risks of low birth weight/IUGR/SGA according to maternal caffeine intake. Low caffeine intake: 50 to 149 mg/day; moderate caffeine intake: 150 to 349 mg/day; high caffeine intake: ≥ 350 mg/day. Black dots indicate study-specific effect estimates, sizes of the grey squares correspond to the weights of the studies, horizontal lines indicate 95% CIs, and diamonds indicate the summary estimates with their corresponding 95% CIs. CI, confidence interval; IUGR, intrauterine growth restriction; SGA, small for gestational age.

The dose–response relationship between maternal caffeine intake and low birth weight is shown in Figure 3. Because there was no evidence of departure from linearity (P = 0.89), we assumed a linear relationship. The summary RR was 1.13 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.21; Table 2) per 100-mg/day (equivalent to around one cup of coffee) and 1.45 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.76) per 300-mg/day increment of maternal caffeine intake. The overall heterogeneity was higher (I² 82.4%) than for the categorical comparisons. However, the summary RRs did not substantially differ by various study characteristics including age of the mothers, region, year of publication, size of the study population, exposure assessment (total caffeine intake versus only coffee), questionnaire administration for exposure assessment (self-administered or interviewer-administered), assessed period of exposure during pregnancy, outcome definition (low birth weight, IUGR or SGA) and adjustment for smoking (a few or multiple categories) (Table 2). In a sensitivity analysis, the summary RRs ranged from 1.11 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.17) to 1.16 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.24) per 100-mg/day increment in maternal caffeine intake when we omitted one study at a time.

### Coffee drinking and risk of preterm birth [^1151iZzo]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

We analysed the association between coffee drinking before and during the three trimesters of pregnancy and the risk of preterm birth of babies normal for gestational age (NGA) or small for gestational age (SGA).

Methods

Case-control study conducted in University clinics of North Italy. Cases were 502 women who delivered at < 37 weeks of gestation. The controls included 1966 women who gave birth at term (≥ 37 weeks of gestation) to healthy infants on randomly selected days at the hospitals where cases had been identified.

Results

There was inverse association for coffee consumption in the third trimester of pregnancy in SGA cases compared to NGA (heterogeneity test between OR: chi1(2) = 5.6811 P < 0.05). In comparison with not drinkers, all the ORs of overall intake of caffeine were closed near the unity for both SGA and NGA preterm birth.

Conclusion

Compared with no consumption, a low consumption of coffee during pregnancy may not have significant effects on preterm birth.

### Maternal caffeine consumption and pregnancy outcomes: a narrative review with implications for advice to mothers and mothers-to-be [^116gfoXN]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

It is generally accepted that chronic exposure to chemicals during pregnancy is cause for concern. When the chemical of interest is caffeine, a near universally consumed habit-forming substance of no nutritional value, the need for caution is compelling. There is substantial cumulative evidence of an association between maternal caffeine consumption and diverse negative pregnancy outcomes. Indicative of causation, observational studies and meta-analyses alike have reported dose–response associations with some studies also finding no threshold of consumption below which associations with negative outcomes are absent. Crucially, the evidence has proved to be decidedly robust to threats from potential confounding and misclassification.

An extensive body of scientific evidence from original observational studies and meta-analyses provides persuasive confirmation of increased risk from maternal caffeine consumption for at least five major negative pregnancy outcomes: miscarriage, stillbirth, lower birth weight and/or small for gestational age, childhood acute leukaemia and childhood overweight and obesity. Of the outcomes reviewed, the risk of preterm birth is the only one not found to be reliably associated with maternal caffeine consumption. Hence, current advice such as that issued by ACOG, the DGAC, EFSAand the NHSis not consistent with the level of threat indicated by biological plausibility of harm and extensive empirical evidence of actual harm. Accordingly, current health recommendations concerning caffeine consumption during pregnancy are in need of radical revision. Specifically, the cumulative scientific evidence supports pregnant women and women contemplating pregnancy being advised to avoid caffeine.

### Maternal coffee intake and the risk of bleeding in early pregnancy: a cross-sectional analysis [^113CXa1m]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Recently, some epidemiologic studies have found a significant association between a caffeine intake of 300 mg or more/day and the risk of early pregnancy loss. Consistent with previous reports, in the present study, we found that pregnant women who were heavy coffee drinkers had a significantly higher risk of bleeding in early pregnancy. In a Chinese prospective study, caffeine intake before pregnancy was not found to increase the risk of early pregnancy loss, but caffeine intake of more than 300 mg/day during the first trimester appeared to significantly increase this risk. A UK case-control study showed that caffeine consumption of more than 300 mg/day during pregnancy approximately doubles the risk of miscarriage, and this effect is driven by coffee consumption. Similarly, a study found that the adjusted risk of early pregnancy loss among Danish women who consumed more than 375 mg of caffeine/day was 2.21.

### Maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy and risk of childhood acute leukemia: a metaanalysis [^114p7f9X]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to explore the association between maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy and childhood acute leukemia (AL).

Study Design

The PubMed database was used to search studies up to May 5, 2013, and the lists of references of retrieved articles were also screened to identify additional relevant studies. Studies were included if they reported the odds ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of childhood AL, including childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with respect to maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy.

Results

Compared with non/lowest drinkers, the combined odds ratio regarding the relationship of maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy and childhood AL was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.04–1.43) for ever drinkers, 1.16 (95% CI, 1.00–1.34) for low to moderate-level drinkers, and 1.72 (95% CI, 1.37–2.16) for high-level drinkers. When analysis was conducted by subtypes of childhood AL, maternal coffee consumption (high-level drinkers vs non/lowest drinkers) was statistically significantly associated with childhood ALL (1.65; 95% CI, 1.28–2.12) and childhood AML (1.58; 95% CI, 1.20–2.08). We observed the linear dose-response relationship of coffee consumption and childhood AL (P for nonlinearity = .68), including childhood ALL and childhood AML; with increased coffee consumption, the risk of childhood AL increased.

Conclusion

The findings of the metaanalysis suggest that maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy may increase the risk of childhood AL. Because of limited studies, further prospective studies are urgently needed to explore the adverse effect of coffee consumption on childhood AL.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with birth weight but not with gestational length: results from a large prospective observational cohort study [^113MpeLU]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Caffeine from coffee, but not from other sources, was associated with slightly increased gestational length. Total caffeine and caffeine from all different sources studied was associated with decreased BW. When discussing these results, the caffeine intake pattern in this Norwegian subpopulation must be kept in mind: the dominant caffeine source varied with increasing total caffeine intake, from chocolate in the low consumption group, to black tea in the medium consumption group, and coffee in the high consumption group. Thus, findings attributed to increasing total caffeine intake might be due to a changing distribution of caffeine sources. These results emphasize what Peck et al. and the CARE Study Group pointed out: if the aim of an epidemiologic study is to assess the effect of caffeine, it is not correct to study only coffee caffeine.

Many, but not all, women decreased their caffeine consumption considerably during the first trimester but increased it again during the second trimester, a motive for repeated caffeine intake measurements during pregnancy in studies examining exposure in relation to pregnancy outcome.

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^116oBSPR]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Caffeine and fertility — High caffeine intake has been associated with decreased fertility, with high levels defined as 500 mg (> 5 cups of coffee per day or its equivalent) and linked to OR 1.45 (95% CI, 1.03–2.04); during pregnancy, consumption over 200 to 300 mg per day (2–3 cups per day) may increase the risk of miscarriage but does not affect congenital anomalies, whereas overall moderate intake (1–2 cups of coffee per day or its equivalent) before or during pregnancy has no apparent adverse effects on fertility or pregnancy outcomes, and caffeine consumption has no effect on semen parameters in men.

### Maternal caffeine intake from coffee and tea, fetal growth, and the risks of adverse birth outcomes: the generation R study [^11717Z7W]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Caffeine is a widely used and accepted pharmacologically active substance. The effect of caffeine intake during pregnancy on fetal growth and development is still unclear.

Objective

We examined the associations of maternal caffeine intake, on the basis of coffee and tea consumption, with fetal growth characteristics measured in each trimester of pregnancy and the risks of adverse birth outcomes.

Design

Associations were studied in 7346 pregnant women participating in a population-based prospective cohort study from early pregnancy onward in the Netherlands (2001–2005). Caffeine intake in the first, second, and third trimesters was on the basis of coffee and tea consumption and was assessed by questionnaires. Fetal growth characteristics were repeatedly measured by ultrasound. Information about birth outcomes was obtained from hospital records.

Results

We observed no consistent associations of caffeine intake with fetal head circumference or estimated fetal weight in any trimester. Higher caffeine intake was associated with smaller first-trimester crown-rump length, second- and third-trimester femur length, and birth length (P for trend < 0.05). Offspring of mothers who consumed ≥ 6 caffeine units/d tended to have increased risks of small-for-gestational-age infants at birth.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that caffeine intake of ≥ 6 units/d during pregnancy is associated with impaired fetal length growth. Caffeine exposure might preferentially adversely affect fetal skeletal growth. Further studies are needed to assess these associations in non-European populations and to assess the postnatal consequences.

### Caffeine consumption and miscarriage: a prospective cohort study [^112yRWYT]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Caffeine consumption has been equivocally associated with miscarriage, despite an absence of prospective longitudinal measurement of caffeine intake during sensitive windows of human development. In response to this critical data gap, we analyzed daily caffeine consumption while attempting pregnancy through 12 menstrual cycles at risk for pregnancy and found that caffeine consumption did not increase the risk or hazard of miscarriage, even after adjusting for relevant covariates.

### Assessment of caffeine consumption and maternal cardiometabolic pregnancy complications [^112UqoiQ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is caffeine intake associated with major cardiometabolic complications during pregnancy (ie, gestational diabetes [GDM], preeclampsia, gestational hypertension)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 2802 pregnant women, low and moderate caffeinated beverage intake early in second trimester within current guidelines of less than 200 mg per day were associated with a lower risk for GDM, lower glucose levels at GDM screening, and more favorable cardiometabolic profile compared with no consumption. Caffeine was not associated with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.

Meaning

The findings of this study may be reassuring for pregnant women with moderate caffeine intake and should be considered in the context of published data on associations with offspring health.

### Maternal caffeine consumption and pregnancy outcomes: a narrative review with implications for advice to mothers and mothers-to-be [^117HWnaM]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

In light of relevant theoretical considerations and abundant empirical evidence, it is pertinent to consider the role of industry in the caffeine and pregnancy narrative, especially with regard to questions of causation. In the late 1970s the FDA announced possible removal of caffeine from its list of food additives 'generally recognised as safe'. That threat prompted soft drink manufacturers to fund the establishment of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). Headquartered in Washington, DC, ILSI expanded rapidly to include a broad global alliance of corporate members whose worldwide influence on public health policy, including food and food additives, cigarette smoking and the use of agrochemicals, has been for many years the subject of analysis and criticism from authoritative international sources.

Mobilised to counter public concern about the general safety of caffeine, ILSI was well positioned to respond to more specific concerns highlighted in the 1980 FDA warning about caffeine and pregnancy. Through its Caffeine Working Group and affiliated industry organisations, including the American Beverage Association and the National Coffee Association, ILSI has supported the production of a body of published articles depicting caffeine as a benign substance posing little or no threat to fetal health and development. Scientific evidence to the contrary has been portrayed in that literature as methodologically flawed due to confounding from uncontrolled variables.

Spurious conclusions have been a recurring feature of industry-affiliated commentary. For example, one review concluded that the "evidence does not support a positive relationship between caffeine consumption and adverse reproductive or perinatal outcomes" (p. 2573, emphasis added), while another concluded that daily consumption of caffeine is " not associated with adverse reproductive and developmental effects" (p. 637, emphasis added). Yet, in reality, even industry-affiliated commentaries agree with independent opinion that maternal caffeine consumption is associated with (ie, has a 'positive relationship' with) negative pregnancy outcomes. Notwithstanding universal agreement that relevant associations have been established as undeniable fact, ILSI-affiliated literaturehas promulgated an opportunistic deception by conflating association and causation, wherein legitimate questions about causation have been used to make false claimsabout absence of evidence of association.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with birth weight but not with gestational length: results from a large prospective observational cohort study [^115pS1xY]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately half of all studies report an adverse effect of caffeine intake on BW, while others have not found any significant associations. Comparability among these studies is problematic due to the use of different standard growth curves or to incomplete or inaccurate assessment of caffeine exposure. Peck et al. concluded in their review that the evidence for an association between caffeine intake and reproductive health and fetal development is limited by measurement errors as well as by the impossibility of ruling out confounding by pregnancy symptoms such as nausea or environmental factors such as smoking. Caffeine consumption is strongly correlated with smoking, which is known to increase the risk for both PTD and SGA. As mentioned above, there are methodological challenges in the assessment of caffeine intake, both from coffee and other sources. This also applies to preparation and processing, which may change the caffeine content of a beverage considerably. Pregnancy is a time of rapid development and differentiation, therefore there might be a certain time window for a caffeine effect; repeated measurements during pregnancy may thus be desirable.

In summary, caffeine is consumed daily by many pregnant women, spontaneous PTD and SGA incur high medical and economic costs and studies on associations between caffeine and pregnancy outcomes are contradictory due to a number of challenges in study design. The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) can meet many of these challenges: with about 108,000 included pregnancies, common complex pregnancy outcomes like PTD and SGA can be studied. With detailed reporting of caffeine intake from various sources and different coffee preparations, assessed at three different timepoints during pregnancy, as well as comprehensive information on lifestyle habits, health and socioeconomic status, MoBa provides a unique chance to study the association between caffeine intake and pregnancy outcomes. By taking caffeine intake from different sources into account, it might be possible to separate caffeine effects from other effects related to the respective sources.

The aim of the present study therefore was to examine the association between maternal caffeine intake from different sources and (a) gestational length, particularly the risk for spontaneous PTD with a subanalysis of early and late spontaneous PTD, and (b) BW and the risk for SGA.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and risk of fetal growth restriction: a large prospective observational study [^115x1EAT]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Caffeine is the most widely consumed xenobiotic in pregnancy, with the potential to adversely affect the developing fetoplacental unit. Maternal caffeine intake has been reported to be associated with a reduction in birth weight, but the precise level of intake above which the risk is increased remains unknown. Caffeine intake of ≥ 300 mg/day has been associated with fetal growth restriction, but Vlajinac et al found a significant reduction in infant birth weight of 114 g with maternal caffeine consumption of as little as 141 mg/day. More controversially, others have shown that maternal caffeine concentration has an inverse association with birth weight when confounders such as smoking were taken into account. In 2001 the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, UK, after a thorough review of the literature, concluded that, although caffeine intake > 300 mg/day might be associated with low birth weight and spontaneous miscarriage, the evidence was inconclusive.

Possible reasons for these inconsistent outcomes include inaccurate estimation of caffeine consumption, including an assumption that tea and coffee are the only sources of caffeine, retrospective assessment of caffeine intake, assessment of association based on consumption in individual trimesters rather than throughout pregnancy, failure to allow for individual variations in caffeine metabolism, inadequate control for confounding factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption, and non-uniformity in defining the primary outcome measures.

Caffeine is rapidly absorbed and crosses the placenta freely. After ingestion of 200 mg caffeine, intervillous blood flow in the placenta was found to be reduced by 25%. Cytochrome P450 1A2, the principal enzyme involved in caffeine metabolism, is absent in the placenta and the fetus. The amount of caffeine and metabolites available to the fetoplacental unit therefore depends on the maternal caffeine metabolism, which shows marked variation between individuals because of genetic and environmental factors such as nicotine. Variations in caffeine metabolic activity have been found to be more closely associated with fetal growth restriction than have blood caffeine concentrations. Therefore, any comprehensive study of the effects of caffeine on fetal growth must include an assessment of caffeine metabolism.

In order to examine the association of maternal caffeine intake on fetal growth, we used a validated, robust caffeine assessment tool to quantify total caffeine intake, from all possible sources, throughout pregnancy. Using these data, and taking into account individual variation in caffeine metabolism, we aimed to establish the safe upper limit of caffeine consumption with respect to adverse pregnancy outcome (specifically fetal growth restriction).

### Maternal caffeine consumption and pregnancy outcomes: a narrative review with implications for advice to mothers and mothers-to-be [^117KCrJf]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Bearing in mind occasional discrepant findings, a substantial level of consistency was found among the 42 sets of observational findings summarised in online supplementary table 1. Overall, 32 studies reported a significantly increased risk of negative pregnancy outcomes associated with maternal caffeine consumption and 10 reported no or equivocal association. On the other hand, relevant meta-analyses were unanimous in their main findings. Excluding the outcome of childhood overweight and obesity (for which no meta-analysis was identified), table 1 shows 14 meta-analyses were unanimous in reporting a significant caffeine-related increased risk of harm. Specifically, maternal caffeine consumption was reported to be associated with increased risk by all four meta-analyses of miscarriage, both of two meta-analyses of stillbirth, all five meta-analyses of LBW and/or SGA and all three meta-analyses of childhood acute leukaemia. Only preterm birth differed in pattern, where all three relevant meta-analyses found maternal caffeine consumption not to be reliably associated with increased risk.

Are caffeine-related negative pregnancy outcomes merely unexplained associations?

Rational health advice about caffeine exposure during pregnancy depends crucially on the extent to which the evidence of association is thought to be indicative of causation. Therefore, despite extensive consistency in the reporting of increased risk of harm associated with maternal caffeine consumption, it is reasonable to ask: Do methodological shortcomings limit inferences of causation within the large body of evidence of association? In reply, apart from specific potential limitations examined below, it may be said that the likelihood of causation (rather than mere association) is supported by the many reports of observed dose–response relationships between the amount of caffeine consumed during pregnancy and the risk of negative pregnancy outcomes. Implication of causation is also rendered more salient by reports of no threshold of consumption below which associations are absent. Overall, then, likely causation is supported by a compelling body of evidence, both theoretical (ie, biological plausibility) and empirical, including a strong consensus among observational studies and particularly meta-analyses, dose–response relationships and reported absence of threshold effects.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with risk of low birth weight: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^111tRKAW]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs), hazard ratios (HRs) or relative risks (RRs) have been used in different studies, and we chose RRs as measures of risk estimates in the meta-analysis because the incident rate was low and OR and HR thus approximated RR. For studies that reported birth weight as a continuous variable, the multivariable-adjusted birth weight differences (exposed minus unexposed) were used. Low birth weight, SGA and IUGR were treated as a single outcome in our primary analysis as they are closely related, but we also conducted stratified analysis based on different outcomes. For studies that reported results for more than one outcome, results for low birth weight were used in the main analysis due to simplicity and uniformity of its definition.

Different studies used different cutoff points for the caffeine intake categories. To combine the risk estimates from different categories in different studies, we assigned the median value for each category of caffeine intake. When lower and upper boundaries were presented for the category, we assigned the midpoint as an estimate of the median caffeine intake. If the upper boundary of the highest category was not provided, we assumed that the boundary had the same amplitude as the second-highest category. If the lower boundary of the lowest category was not provided, we assumed the lower boundary to be zero. Two European studies only reported coffee consumption in cups but not total caffeine intake and we estimated caffeine intake based on the commonly cited conversion method (107 mg caffeine per cup of coffee). Several studies reported results for more than one period of maternal caffeine exposure (Table 1). We used the results for average caffeine intake during the whole pregnancy period if available. Subsequently, we used the results for the assessment period most frequently used (first to second trimesters) in studies with only one exposure period. Nonetheless, we also included results from the other assessment periods in stratified analyses where possible.

### Maternal coffee intake and the risk of bleeding in early pregnancy: a cross-sectional analysis [^115AeEmN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Coffee consumption is one possible risk factor for bleeding in early pregnancy in the first trimester. Even though the market for caffeinated beverages has increased in the past decades, coffee remains the most frequently consumed caffeinated beverage. A standard cup of coffee is generally expected to provide 100 mg of caffeine; however, this varies according to portion size, brewing method, and brand. Although other beverages have some caffeine content (one cup of tea, 64.0 mg of caffeine; 12 oz. of coke, 46.0 mg of caffeine; one cup of hot chocolate, 16.0 mg of caffeine; and caffeinated soda, 46.0 mg of caffeine), these caffeinated beverages do not significantly affect daily caffeine consumption among Koreans. Nisenblat et al. reported that caffeine intake is not associated with an increased risk of bleeding in early pregnancy, with the possible exception of very high levels of caffeine intake. However, caffeine and its metabolites easily cross the placenta and may be present in considerable quantities in the amniotic fluid and fetal blood. Moreover, the fetus metabolizes caffeine very slowly, and even extremely small amounts of maternal caffeine intake could lead to long-term fetal caffeine exposure. Experimental and human studies have shown that caffeine exposure induces angiotensin II by stimulating the generation of reactive oxygen species, which ultimately inhibit angiogenesis and negatively affect the developing embryo. In addition, caffeine consumption could increase the generation of circulating catecholamines, which could cause uteroplacental vasoconstriction, leading to fetal hypoxia. Moreover, although a threshold for the adverse effects of caffeine on pregnant women was not well established, a few studies showed that high levels of caffeine intake could have adverse effects, such as miscarriage, fetal growth restriction, and long-term behavioral effects in offspring.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with risk of low birth weight: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^116R5NQb]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Our meta-analysis has several strengths. We searched databases with no language restriction to increase the completeness of studies identification. In addition, we included only prospective studies and, thus, reduced the influence of selection bias, recall bias and reverse causation in our results. Lastly, we not only compared the highest category with the lowest categories but divided maternal caffeine intake into four levels and also conducted a dose–response analysis.

However, our study also has several limitations that have to be considered in the interpretation of our findings. Measurement error in the assessment of caffeine intake may have affected the results. The included studies relied on questionnaires for caffeine assessment. However, in most studies an interviewer-administered questionnaire was used, which may have improved the completeness of their data collection. Furthermore, validation studies have shown that self-reports of major sources of caffeine such as coffee and tea are, in general, reasonably accurate and reliable. Another potential limitation was that two of the included studies (conducted in Italy and Denmark) used coffee consumption as the proxy of total caffeine intake. However, in these European populations coffee consumption is high and in a similar Swedish study coffee was the predominant source (accounting for 76%) of all caffeine ingested by pregnant women. In our stratified analysis, the summary estimates did not differ substantially by assessment of coffee versus total caffeine intake. The caffeine assessments in the remaining studies were reasonably comprehensive. Most studies considered at least the intakes of coffee, tea and caffeinated-soft drinks, while many also additionally considered other sources such as cocoa products and caffeine-containing medication. Consumption of energy drinks containing a relatively high amount of caffeine has been becoming more common, especially since the mid-2000s. However, most included studies in this meta-analysis were conducted before that period. Furthermore, the contribution of energy drinks to total caffeine intakes was found to be small in two recently published studies included in this meta-analysis — 1% of caffeine intake in the CARE study and 7% ('sugar sweetened caffeinated-soft drinks including energy drinks') in Sengpiel et al.'s study as well as other studies in pregnant women or women of child-bearing age. Another issue is that three of the included studies had a relatively high median caffeine level for reference category, probably reflecting the high caffeine intake in these populations. However, this should have resulted in more conservative pooled effect estimates as it would reduce the contrast in caffeine intake between the compared groups.

### Assessment of caffeine consumption and maternal cardiometabolic pregnancy complications [^1122d2Ya]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Women are recommended to limit caffeine consumption to less than 200 mg per day based on risks to fetal health. Impacts of caffeine on maternal health remain unclear.

Objective

To determine whether caffeinated-beverage intake and plasma caffeine and paraxanthine are associated with cardiometabolic complications in pregnancy (ie, gestational diabetes [GDM], preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension [GH]).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used data from a longitudinal pregnancy cohort study from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Fetal Growth Studies-Singletons (2009–2013). This post hoc secondary analysis of 2802 pregnant women without major chronic conditions enrolled at 12 US clinical sites was completed in 2021. The final sample for caffeinated beverage analyses included 2583 women. After excluding women who did not consent to have their biospecimens stored for future research (n = 54), plasma caffeine analyses included 2529 women. Analyses of caffeine consumption and fasting cardiometabolic profiles included 319 women.

Exposures

Daily total caffeine intake was estimated at 10 to 13 gestational weeks and 16 to 22 gestational weeks based on self-reported past week intake of caffeinated coffee, tea, soda, and energy drinks. Plasma caffeine and paraxanthine were measured in specimens collected at 10 to 13 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Clinical diagnoses of GDM, preeclampsia, GH, glucose concentrations from GDM screening, and blood pressure were extracted from medical records.

Results

Participants had a mean (SD) age of 28.1 (5.5) years and 422 participants (16.3%) were Asian/Pacific Islander women, 741 (28.9%) were Hispanic women, 717 (27.8%) were non-Hispanic Black women, and 703 (27.2%) were non-Hispanic White women. At 10 to 13 weeks, 1073 women (41.5%) reported consuming no caffeinated beverages, 1317 (51.0%) reported consuming 1 mg/d to 100 mg/d, 173 (6.7%) reported consuming 101 mg/d to 200 mg/d, and 20 (0.8%) reported consuming more than 200 mg/d. At 16 to 22 weeks, 599 women (23.6%) reported consuming no caffeinated beverages, 1734 (68.3%) reported consuming 1 mg/d to 100 mg/d, 186 (7.3%) reported consuming 101 mg/d to 200 mg/d, and 20 (0.8%) reported consuming more than 200 mg/d caffeinated beverages. Intake at 16 to 22 weeks was associated with lower GDM risk and lower glucose concentrations (1 mg/d to 100 mg/d vs none: relative risk, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.80]; β, -2.7 mg/dL [95% CI, -5.4 mg/dL to 0 mg/dL]) and lower C-reactive protein and C-peptide concentrations and favorable lipid profiles. Total plasma caffeine and paraxanthine at 10 to 13 weeks was inversely associated with glucose (quartile 4 vs quartile 1: β = -3.8 mg/dL [95% CI, -7.0 mg/dL to -0.5 mg/dL]; trend of P = 0.01). No associations were observed with preeclampsia or GH.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, second trimester caffeinated beverage intake within current recommendations was associated with lower GDM risk, but not preeclampsia or GH. These findings may be reassuring for women with moderate caffeine intake.

### Maternal coffee intake and the risk of bleeding in early pregnancy: a cross-sectional analysis [^112mdQi9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As younger women continue to partake in the western coffee culture and demand high-quality coffee beans, the current trends of coffee consumption are expected to continue. The properties of coffee make it a double-edged sword, and the balance between its beneficial and harmful health impacts should be considered. In this study, we examined coffee consumption patterns before pregnancy and their association with the risk of bleeding in early pregnancy among pregnant Korean women. Our study showed that women who were habitual coffee drinkers before pregnancy constituted a larger fraction of those experiencing bleeding in early pregnancy than women who were seldom coffee drinkers. We found that habitual coffee consumption of one or more cup/day before pregnancy was significantly associated with an increased risk of bleeding in early pregnancy, even after adjustment for cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. However, the type of coffee consumed did not significantly affect the risk of bleeding in early pregnancy.

In the present study, among 3510 pregnant women, the overall prevalence of bleeding in early pregnancy was 18.1%, even though the average maternal age of participants was relatively high, which is consistent with previous results. Bleeding in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of poor fetal and maternal outcomes, and perinatal mortality was observed to be more than twice as frequent in women who experienced bleeding in early pregnancy in the meta-analysis than in those who did not. First trimester bleeding could indicate an underlying placental dysfunction, which may be related to later pregnancy complications. Therefore, thorough prevention and management with healthy behavior from preconception to early pregnancy may help to prevent future fetal mortalities and morbidities. However, information on risk factors for bleeding in early pregnancy in the first trimester is insufficient and it is still unclear whether specific effects of caffeine is an independent risk factor for bleeding in early pregnancy.

### Effect of coffee intake on blood flow and maternal stress during the third trimester of pregnancy [^115HR2DM]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effects of maternal ingestion of an ordinary dose of coffee on maternal stress and placental and fetal blood circulation during the third trimester of pregnancy.

Methods

We performed a Doppler blood flow analysis for 10 women in the third trimester of pregnancy before and after they drank a cup of coffee. Salivary samples were collected from the 10 pregnant women and 14 nonpregnant controls just before coffee intake and 30 min later. Salivary cortisol levels and chromogranin A titers were determined.

Results

Coffee intake had no effect on maternal or fetal blood flow. Among the pregnant women, Salivary cortisol levels were significantly reduced after coffee intake but salivary chromogranin A concentration was not significantly different before and after coffee intake.

Conclusion

The reduced salivary cortisol levels suggest that coffee intake decreases maternal stress during pregnancy.

### Mendelian randomization analysis of maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy on offspring neurodevelopmental difficulties in the Norwegian mother, father and child cohort study (MoBa) [^117NeJWr]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In presence of a true causal effect of maternal coffee consumption on offspring NDs, we expected our GxE MR analyses to detect an effect only amongst coffee consumers, and not in the non-consumers. Our analyses found a causal effect of similar magnitude in both the consumers and non-consumers, suggesting that pleiotropy may be driving the association between maternal coffee consumption and social communication difficulties at age 8 years. It is worth noting that the proportion of mothers abstaining from coffee within the MoBa dataset is small, consistent with Norway's high coffee consumption rates (International Coffee Council; Lukic et al.), leading to larger standard errors and reduced statistical power in the 'never consuming' analysis, possibly explaining why the effect (of similar magnitude) was non-significant in this group. Furthermore, coffee consumption may be a collider (Cornelis & Munafo,) and conditioning upon consumption in the GxE MR analyses may have introduced a path between the genetic instrumental variables and confounders of the exposure outcome relationship (online Supplementary Materials 6). We attempted to minimize this effect by excluding SNPs associated with ever/never consuming coffee during pregnancy in MoBa, however it is possible that the remaining variants could also be associated with ever/never consuming coffee. In addition, it is possible that mothers who drink coffee may be systematically different from mothers who don't in terms of how they report symptoms in their children, and the GxE MR framework is not robust to this.

### Coffee for cardioprotection and longevity [^115pUgXh]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Coffee, a complex brew containing hundreds of biologically active compounds, exerts potent effects on long-term human health. Recently, a plethora of studies have been published focusing on health outcomes associated with coffee intake. An inverse association between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality has been seen consistently in large prospective studies. Habitual coffee consumption is also associated with lower risks for cardiovascular (CV) death and a variety of adverse CV outcomes, including coronary heart disease (CHD), congestive heart failure (HF), and stroke; coffee's effects on arrhythmias and hypertension are neutral. Coffee consumption is associated with improvements in some CV risk factors, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), depression, and obesity. Chronic coffee consumption also appears to protect against some neurodegenerative diseases, and is associated with improved asthma control, and lower risks for liver disease and cancer. Habitual intake of 3 to 4 cups of coffee appears to be safe and is associated with the most robust beneficial effects. However, most of the studies regarding coffee's health effects are based on observational data, with very few randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, the possible benefits of coffee drinking must be weighed against potential risks, which are generally due to its high caffeine content, including anxiety, insomnia, headaches, tremulousness, and palpitations. Coffee may also increase risk of fracture in women, and when consumed in pregnancy coffee increases risk for low birth weight and preterm labor.

### Maternal caffeine consumption and infant nighttime waking: prospective cohort study [^117Q7ZBL]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Coffee and other caffeinated beverages are commonly consumed in pregnancy. In adults, caffeine may interfere with sleep onset and have a dose-response effect similar to those seen during insomnia. In infancy, nighttime waking is a common event. With this study, we aimed to investigate if maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy and lactation leads to frequent nocturnal awakening among infants at 3 months of age.

Methods

All children born in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, during 2004 were enrolled on a cohort study. Mothers were interviewed at delivery and after 3 months to obtain information on caffeine drinking consumption, sociodemographic, reproductive, and behavioral characteristics. Infant sleeping pattern in the previous 15 days was obtained from a subsample. Night waking was defined as an episode of infant arousal that woke the parents during nighttime. Multivariable analysis was performed by using Poisson regression.

Results

The subsample included 885 of the 4231 infants born in 2004. All but 1 mother consumed caffeine in pregnancy. Nearly 20% were heavy consumers (≥ 300 mg/day) during pregnancy and 14.3% at 3 months postpartum. Prevalence of frequent nighttime awakeners (> 3 episodes per night) was 13.8% (95% confidence interval: 11.5%-16.0%). The highest prevalence ratio was observed among breastfed infants from mothers consuming ≥ 300 mg/day during the whole pregnancy and in the postpartum period (1.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.86–3.17) but at a nonsignificant level.

Conclusions

Caffeine consumption during pregnancy and by nursing mothers seems not to have consequences on sleep of infants at the age of 3 months.

Caffeine pharmacology: main mechanisms of action

Knowledge of caffeine pharmacology suggests high biological plausibility for potential fetal harm from maternal consumption. When consumed during pregnancy, caffeine readily crosses the placenta, exposing the fetus to concentrations of the drug similar to systemic levels in the mother. The extent of diffusion of caffeine from maternal to fetal circulation is indicated by the presence of caffeine in fetal hair, with concentrations in the hair of newborns being found to correlate well with maternal caffeine consumption during the third trimester. In adults, caffeine is metabolised principally by cytochrome P450 enzymes (mono-oxygenase and xanthine oxidase enzymes) in the liver. However, because the P450 enzyme system remains undeveloped until infancy, the kidneys are the main route of excretion in newborns with more than 80% of the drug passing unchanged in urine compared with only 2–4% of unchanged caffeine in adults.

As such, fetal caffeine clearance depends on maternal metabolism, the rate of which changes during pregnancy. Whereas clearance of caffeine in the first trimester is comparable to the non-pregnant state, the rate slows to one-half and then to about one-third during the second and third trimesters, respectively. Consequently, caffeine half-life increases from the usual adult rate of about 5 hours in the first trimester to about 18 hours by the 38th week of pregnancy. The symptoms of nausea and vomiting that frequently accompany pregnancy-related changes in hormonal milieu and associated reduced rate of caffeine clearance help to explain the observation that women often spontaneously reduce their intake of caffeine when pregnant. Reduced intake means that plasma caffeine concentrations tend to be maintained at levels comparable to the pre-pregnant state instead of reaching the appreciably higher levels that would occur if intake remained unchanged.

Once ingested, caffeine is readily distributed throughout the body, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within about 40–60 min. Thereafter, caffeine exerts a variety of pharmacological actions at diverse sites, both centrally and peripherally. These actions are due mostly to competitive blockade of the neuromodulator adenosine, with A₁ and A₂A receptors appearing to be the primary targets. Effects include maintenance of transmitter release in the CNS (anti-somnolent effect), constriction of cerebral and coronary blood vessels, renal diuresis, respiratory bronchodilation and gastrointestinal acid secretion. A₁ and A₂A receptors also interact in functionally important ways with dopamine receptors, and caffeine stimulates secretion of the catecholamine stress hormones of epinephrine and norepinephrine. In turn, elevated catecholamine levels have the potential to increase placental vasoconstriction and increase fetal heart rateleading to impaired fetal oxygenation.

### Mendelian randomization analysis of maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy on offspring neurodevelopmental difficulties in the Norwegian mother, father and child cohort study (MoBa) [^1115Cxuk]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous observational epidemiological studies have suggested that coffee consumption during pregnancy may affect fetal neurodevelopment. However, results are inconsistent and may represent correlational rather than causal relationships. The present study investigated whether maternal coffee consumption was observationally associated and causally related to offspring childhood neurodevelopmental difficulties (NDs) in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study.

Methods

The observational relationships between maternal/paternal coffee consumption (before and during pregnancy) and offspring NDs were assessed using linear regression analyses (N = 58694 mother-child duos; N = 22 576 father-child duos). To investigate potential causal relationships, individual-level (N = 46 245 mother-child duos) and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted using genetic variants previously associated with coffee consumption as instrumental variables.

Results

We observed positive associations between maternal coffee consumption and offspring difficulties with social-communication/behavioral flexibility, and inattention/hyperactive-impulsive behavior (multiple testing corrected p < 0.005). Paternal coffee consumption (negative control) was not observationally associated with the outcomes. After adjusting for potential confounders (smoking, alcohol, education and income), the maternal associations attenuated to the null. MR analyses suggested that increased maternal coffee consumption was causally associated with social-communication difficulties (individual-level: beta = 0.128, se = 0.043, p = 0.003; two-sample: beta = 0.348, se = 0.141, p = 0.010). However, individual-level MR analyses that modelled potential pleiotropic pathways found the effect diminished (beta = 0.088, se = 0.049, p = 0.071). Individual-level MR analyses yielded similar estimates (heterogeneity p = 0.619) for the causal effect of coffee consumption on social communication difficulties in maternal coffee consumers (beta = 0.153, se = 0.071, p = 0.032) and non-consumers (beta = 0.107, se = 0.134, p = 0.424).

Conclusions

Together, our results provide little evidence for a causal effect of maternal coffee consumption on offspring NDs.

### Maternal coffee intake and the risk of bleeding in early pregnancy: a cross-sectional analysis [^111cHuuR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Caffeine can easily cross the placenta, and maternal caffeine intake, thus, has an effect on fetal growth. However, it is still unclear whether coffee consumption is an independent risk factor for bleeding in early pregnancy. The objective of this study was to examine the association between pre-pregnancy coffee consumption patterns and the risk of bleeding in early pregnancy.

Methods

A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 3510 pregnant women from the Korean Pregnancy Outcome Study who underwent baseline examination and for whom the results of the pregnancy were available. Coffee consumption patterns before pregnancy were examined using a questionnaire. The participants were classified according to the frequency of coffee consumption into seldom (< 1 cup/week), light (< 1 cup/day), moderate (1 cup/day), and heavy coffee drinker (≥ 2 cups/day) groups. Bleeding in early pregnancy was defined as the occurrence of vaginal bleeding in the first 20weeks of pregnancy. Multiple logistic regression models were applied to examine the association between pre-pregnancy coffee consumption and the risk of bleeding in early pregnancy, after adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption behavior, previous and current physical activity levels, stress levels, history of depression, antenatal depressive symptoms during the first trimester, type of emesis, parity, and the number of livebirths, stillbirths, miscarriages, and abortions.

Results

Women who were light, moderate, and heavy coffee drinkers before pregnancy had adjusted ORs of 1.086, 1.225, and 1.358, respectively, for bleeding in early pregnancy. In a fully adjusted model, heavy coffee drinkers showed a significantly higher risk of bleeding in early pregnancy, even in women aged 35years and younger (OR 1.680) and in those with a normal body mass index (OR 1.389), who were at relatively low risk for pregnancy-related complications.

Conclusions

Our results showed that heavy coffee drinking was independently associated with a higher risk of bleeding in early pregnancy among pregnant Korean women, suggesting that caffeine intake before conception and during pregnancy should be reduced. Our study highlights the need for nutritional interventions for healthy coffee drinking among pregnant women in Korea.

### Assessment of caffeine consumption and maternal cardiometabolic pregnancy complications [^116LuNtj]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, caffeinated beverage intake within the currently recommended range in the second trimester of pregnancy was associated with a lower GDM risk than with no intake, but not with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. These findings based on self-reported information and biomarkers should be reassuring for pregnant women with moderate caffeine intake, but translation into public health recommendations should be considered in the context of published data on offspring outcomes.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with risk of low birth weight: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^116fR9DM]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that higher maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of delivering low birth weight infants. In our meta-analysis based on categories of caffeine consumption, the risk for low birth weight increased with increasing levels of caffeine intake. The risk for low birth weight was significantly higher even in the low (50 to 149 mg/day) and moderate (150 to 349 mg/day) caffeine intake groups, as compared with the reference group with no or very low caffeine intake. Our dose–response analysis also suggested a linear association with low birth weight across the range of caffeine intakes. This seems relevant for public health recommendations as it indicates that the risk of low birth weight may be elevated even for caffeine intakes below the recommended maximum limit of the current guidelines for pregnant women (300 mg/day by the World Health Organization and 200 mg/day by the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists). Nonetheless, although our meta-analysis summarizes the best evidence available to date, we cannot exclude the possibility that potential biases, such as reverse causation and residual confounding by smoking or pregnancy symptoms, affected the observed association between caffeine intake and risk of low birth weight. Results from previous studies have highlighted the adverse impact of smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy on birth weight and other birth outcomes. Although abstaining from smoking and alcohol consumption should be the mainstay of recommendations to lower risk of low birth weight, reducing caffeine intake during pregnancy may represent an additional strategy to optimize fetal growth. In conclusion, while a confirmation in large randomized controlled trials would be desirable, our results do provide further support for recommendations to limit caffeine intake during pregnancy to low levels.

### Associations of maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy with abdominal and liver fat deposition in childhood [^115beV5A]. Pediatric Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Our results are consistent with those of previous studies and further highlight the importance of limiting maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy with respect to its potential adverse effects on long‐term body fat development in the offspring. The current recommendations for maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy range between 200 and 300 mg per day and are based on the risks of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. 46, 47, 48 The most pronounced effects observed in our study were for caffeine intakes above these guidelines. However, the dose‐response relationship in our and previous studies 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 suggest that the adverse effects of maternal caffeine intake with respect to both pregnancy outcomes and long‐term body fat development are not restricted to high caffeine intakes, but increase across the range of maternal caffeine intake. A review of randomized controlled trials had insufficient evidence to confirm that avoiding caffeine consumption during pregnancy is beneficial with respect to adverse pregnancy outcomes. 49 Based on our findings and findings from other observational studies, further adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to assess whether avoiding caffeine consumption during pregnancy improves both pregnancy and long‐term offspring health outcomes, as compared with current recommendations. Our findings and findings from other observational studies need to be incorporated in future guidelines regarding maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy, and these guidelines need to further emphasize potential beneficial effects on offspring health outcomes by further reducing caffeine intake during pregnancy below the current recommendations.

### Mendelian randomization analysis of maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy on offspring neurodevelopmental difficulties in the Norwegian mother, father and child cohort study (MoBa) [^113qWRxN]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Unlike traditional observational approaches, our within-family MR is robust to some forms of genetic confounding. For example, if a SNP relates to maternal coffee consumption, maternal ADHD and offspring NDs, the effect of an offspring inheriting that SNP is accounted for through inclusion of offspring genotype in the same model (i.e. essentially blocking the path from maternal to offspring genome). Indeed, a study has shown that pregnant individuals with high ADHD genetic liability are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy-related exposures (such as smoking during pregnancy), which have been linked to offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes (Havdahl et al.), necessitating genetically informative methods to disentangle the complicated relationships between variables.

Importantly, we note that the weightings used in the MR analyses were derived from a GWAS of non-pregnant individuals, and consequently may not accurately reflect effect sizes in pregnant women. Our benchmarking analyses found that the SNPs and PGS were generally positively associated with coffee consumption during pregnancy in MoBa. This mirrors results from a previous study that found the same PGS were positively associated with coffee consumption at week 32 of gestation in the ALSPAC cohort (Brito Nunes et al.). While this shows our instruments can proxy coffee consumption during pregnancy, the weightings may not be accurate. Therefore, rather than focusing on the magnitude of the causal effect estimates, we suggest that the presence/absence and direction of the effect may be more informative.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with birth weight but not with gestational length: results from a large prospective observational cohort study [^1139B9yL]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is increasing epidemiological evidence that maternal nutrition influences the course of pregnancy as well as fetal growth and development and the risk of disease later in life. Maternal diet should ideally supply all vital nutrients but does also, irrespective of composition, contribute contaminants and compounds with pharmacological activity that may have adverse effects. Caffeine is a xanthine alkaloid found primarily in coffee, tea, cocoa, energy drinks and some soft drinks, and is thus consumed on a daily basis all over the world. Caffeine passes the placental barrier freely; the fetus does not express the main enzymes that inactivate it, and caffeine metabolites have been found to accumulate in the fetal brain. In 2005, a Scandinavian expert committee concluded that high caffeine intake may harm the fetus. The current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend a caffeine intake below 300 mg/day during pregnancy, while the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority concur with the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR), recommending a maximum caffeine intake of 200 mg/day.

Human studies on adverse effects of caffeine have investigated spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery (PTD), fetal death, congenital malformations and fetal growth restriction, with conflicting results for all outcomes. PTD and small for gestational age (SGA) at birth are the pregnancy outcomes accounting for most of all neonatal mortality, as well as short-term and long-term morbidity. Both are common, complex conditions; the respective prevalences in the Norwegian population are around 7% and 5%. Despite these prevalences, the complexity makes it difficult to measure the effect of a single environmental factor, except in large studies. While some studies have found a higher risk for PTD or early PTD with increasing caffeine intake, most studies on caffeine intake have found no significant association with gestational length as summarized in the meta-analysis by Maslova et al. and in the comprehensive review by Peck et al. Although PTD is a heterogeneous pregnancy outcome with different etiologies (for example, for early versus late PTD or for iatrogenic versus spontaneous PTD) it has mostly been studied as one entity, which may obscure associations with subtypes of PTD.

### Mendelian randomization analysis of maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy on offspring neurodevelopmental difficulties in the Norwegian mother, father and child cohort study (MoBa) [^111b4M2e]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Traditional epidemiological analyses

Linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between the exposure, maternal coffee consumption at three time points (before pregnancy, week 15, week 22), and offspring NDs. The relationship between paternal coffee consumption and offspring NDs was also assessed, as a negative control (i.e. if the negative effects of coffee consumption are mediated by maternal/intrauterine effects then similar associations should not be seen in fathers). Offspring birth year and parental ages at birth were included as covariates in both analyses. All linear regression analyses were conducted using R version 4.1.1.

We ran additional linear regression analyses where we also included additional potential confounders. These were maternal and paternal education, maternal and paternal income, maternal smoking before pregnancy, at week 15 and week 30, maternal alcohol consumption before pregnancy, at week 12, week 15, week 24, and week 30. By including smoking and alcohol related variables, this model attempts to remove any direct confounding effect of those variables as well as the potential confounding effect of maternal impulsivity (i.e.g.enetic confounding) (Havdahl et al.). We also included binary (yes/no) variables for maternal smoking and alcohol consumption at each time point.

In a separate model, we attempted to isolate the effect of maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy (i.e. the intrauterine effect) by controlling for maternal coffee consumption before pregnancy. This model included the covariates maternal coffee consumption before pregnancy, offspring birth year, maternal age at birth, paternal age at birth, maternal smoking before pregnancy, at week 15, and week 30, maternal alcohol before pregnancy, at week 15, week 24, and week 30, maternal and paternal income, maternal and paternal education, and offspring genotyping batch. We also included binary variables for maternal smoking and alcohol consumption at each timepoint.

Similar analyses were conducted in the genotyped subset of MoBa using a genetic linear mixed model approach that is more robust to the effects of cryptic relatedness and population structure (see online Supplementary Materials 2).

Mendelian randomization analyses

Individual-level and Two-Sample MR analyses were performed to assess the causal nature of the relationship between maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy and offspring NDs. Power calculations for these analyses are presented in online Supplementary Materials 3.

### Assessment of caffeine consumption and maternal cardiometabolic pregnancy complications [^11421VUG]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective cohort study, pregnant women who consumed low and moderate levels of caffeinated beverages early in the second trimester within current ACOG guidelines of less than 200 mg/d was associated with lower risk for GDM and lower glucose levels at GDM screening, compared with women who did not drink caffeinated beverages. These observations were substantiated by findings that second trimester caffeinated beverage intake was associated with lower CRP and C-peptide concentrations and more favorable lipid profiles. Additionally, increasing first trimester plasma caffeine and paraxanthine concentrations were associated with lower glucose concentrations at GDM screening. However, caffeine was not associated with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia risk nor blood pressure levels across pregnancy. These findings address critical data gaps on the health implications of caffeine consumption in pregnancy for maternal health.

Prior US and Danish cohort studies, reported nonsignificant inverse associations between self-reported caffeinated coffee before and during the first trimester of pregnancyor the first trimester coffee and tea intakewith GDM risk. The current study uniquely included second trimester measures and continuous measures of glucose and cardiometabolic markers. No significant association was observed with first trimester self-reported intake, but estimates for caffeinated beverage intake of less than 200 mg/d were consistent in magnitude, although imprecise. First trimester plasma caffeine and paraxanthine were associated with lower glucose levels on the GCT, but not GDM risk, although estimates were in a similar direction. This imprecision could be due to only a single observation in time or variations in caffeine metabolism, or it could be that associations are also driven by other beverage components besides caffeine. Coffee and tea contain phytochemicals that may affect inflammation and insulin resistance. Nevertheless, caffeine in itself has been associated with improved energy balanceand decreased fat mass, which could play a role in the biological mechanism for the observed associations. Findings with reduced GDM risk are supported by improvements in fasting cardiometabolic profile. Additional research is needed to understand underlying molecular mechanisms for these findings and identify relevant components.

### Exploring maternal patterns of dietary caffeine consumption before… [^115ycADv]. stacks.cdc.gov (2014). Low credibility.

Exploring Maternal Patterns of Dietary Caffeine Consumption Before Conception and During Pregnancy Supporting Files Dec 2014 By Chen, Lei; Bell, Erin M.; Browne, Marilyn L. ;. Details Alternative Title: Matern Child Health J Personal Author: Corporate Authors: Description: We describe patterns of dietary caffeine consumption before and after pregnancy recognition in a cohort of women who recently gave birth. This study included 8, 347 mothers of non-malformed liveborn control infants who participated in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study during 1997–2007. Maternal self-reported consumption of beverages and chocolate the year before pregnancy was used to estimate caffeine intake. The proportions of prepregnancy caffeine consumption stratified by maternal characteristics are reported. In addition, patterns of reported change in consumption before and after pregnancy were examined by maternal and pregnancy characteristics.

Adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated to assess factors most associated with change in consumption. About 97% of mothers reported any caffeine consumption and soda was the primary source of caffeine. The proportion of mothers reporting dietary caffeine intake of more than 300 mg/day was significantly increased among those who smoked cigarettes or drank alcohol. Most mothers stopped or decreased their caffeinated beverage consumption during pregnancy. Young maternal age and unintended pregnancy were associated with increases in consumption during pregnancy. Dietary caffeine consumption during pregnancy is still common in the US. A high level of caffeine intake was associated with known risk factors for adverse reproductive outcomes.

Future studies may improve the maternal caffeine exposure assessment by acquiring additional information regarding the timing and amount of change in caffeine consumption after pregnancy recognition.

### Negative lifestyle is associated with a significant reduction in fecundity [^11196jJh]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the association patterns and quantify the effects of lifestyle on time to pregnancy (TTP).

Design

Observational study.

Setting

Teaching hospitals in Hull, United Kingdom.

Patient(S)

Two thousand and one hundred twelve consecutive pregnant women.

Intervention(S)

A questionnaire inquiring about TTP, contraceptive use, pregnancy planning, previous subfertility/pregnancies, age, and lifestyle characteristics of either partner.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

We compared TTP, conception rates, and relative risk of subfecundity between subgroups with different lifestyle characteristics.

Result(S)

We found that TTP was significantly longer if the woman or partner smoked > 15 cigarettes/day (P < .001 and.04, respectively), the partner consumed > 20 alcohol units/week (P < .001), the woman's body mass index was > 25 kg/m² (P < .001), their coffee and/or tea intake was > 6 cups/day (P = 0.04), or if they were socially deprived (P < .001). Each of these effects remained unchanged after adjusting for the potential confounders. The relative-risks of subfecundity with each of these variables ranged between 1.4 to 1.9 (1.4 to 3.6 after adjustment). The effects of coital frequency and recreational drug use were insignificant. Couples who had > 4 negative lifestyle variables had a sevenfold longer TTP; their conception probabilities fell by 60%, and they were 7.3-fold more likely to be subfecund than those without negative variables.

Conclusion(S)

Lifestyle has a significant and cumulative impact on fecundity. Dose-dependent effects occur with smoking, alcohol, and tea/coffee consumption. Appropriate counseling could result in substantial reductions in the referrals for fertility investigations and treatments.

### How much caffeine is harmful in pregnancy?… [^114JYyFv]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Background: Caffeine is consumed in coffee, tea, soft drinks, and chocolate, and is the most commonly ingested chemical during pregnancy. Data on its effect on pregnancy outcomes are mixed; consuming more than 300 mg of caffeine daily seems to be associated with fetal growth restriction and spontaneous miscarriage, but the evidence for adverse effects with smaller amounts is inconclusive. Previous studies may be confounded by significant variations in mothers' rates of caffeine metabolism and incomplete measurement of caffeine consumption. Konje and colleagues measured comprehensive caffeine intake, estimated variations in caffeine metabolism, and reported pregnancy outcomes to establish a safe upper limit of caffeine consumption. The prevalence of fetal growth restriction was 13 percent in this population and rose with increasing caffeine consumption. Women who consumed less than 50 mg per day by the end of the first trimester had babies weighing on average 161 g more than those of women who maintained a caffeine consumption of more than 300 mg per day throughout the pregnancy. Similarly, women who consumed more than 200 mg per day had babies who weighed 60 to 70 g less than those of women with minimal caffeine intake. This relationship persisted across all trimesters. When measured as a continuous variable, the risk of fetal growth restriction increased sharply from baseline up to 30 mg of daily caffeine consumption, and continued to increase in an almost linear fashion. At no point did the estimated risk stop increasing as caffeine intake increased. Conclusion: Caffeine intake is directly correlated with small but notable fetal growth restriction. Although a safe threshold cannot be determined, maternal caffeine intake of less than 100 mg per day minimizes the risk of fetal growth restriction.

editor's note: This study provides additional support for limiting caffeine during pregnancy beyond current recommendations; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggests a maximum of 300 mg per day, and the U. K. government's Food Standards Agency recommends no more than 200 mg per day. In an accompanying editorial, Olsen and Bech highlight the complexities of measuring caffeine intake and caffeine's potential fetotoxic effects. 1 Several earlier studies used coffee use as a prime measure of caffeine intake, whereas this study carefully included caffeine from all sources, and found tea to provide the majority of caffeine. Additionally, the authors measured each participant's individual caffeine metabolism and found some evidence that those with faster caffeine metabolism were at higher risk of fetal growth restriction, suggesting that a metabolite may prove more harmful than caffeine itself.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and risk of obesity in offspring: a prospective cohort study [^111yLt2b]. International Journal of Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective cohort study of the effect of in-utero caffeine exposure on childhood obesity with up to 15 years of follow-up, we observed an overall increased risk of childhood obesity associated with high maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy. This association was further supported by (1) a dose–response relationship between amount of maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and further increased obesity risk in offspring (Table 2), and (2) consistent findings regardless of the sources of caffeine, reducing the likelihood of other substances in beverages as the explanation. In addition, the observed dose–response relationship appears to be stronger among those with persistent obesity than those with transitory obesity (Table 4), and among girls than boys (Table 5). These results from a long-term prospectively conducted study provide the first piece of evidence that caffeine intake during pregnancy may impact childhood obesity risk in offspring.

Given the prospective design (that is, maternal caffeine intake in pregnancy as the exposure and obesity in offspring as the outcome), the potential for some common biases (for example, selection and recall biases) is likely reduced. In addition, we controlled for important known perinatal risk factors for childhood obesity (for example, maternal prepregnancy BMI, race/ethnicity, education, prenatal smoking, diabetes, small-for-gestational-age or birthweight, and breastfeeding). Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy was not related to other risk factors for childhood obesity (for example, a lack of physical activity and unbalanced diet) in this study population (Table 1). Nevertheless, no single study can completely rule out all potential confounders. For example, sugar sometimes added to coffee may be argued as a possible alternative explanation. Although we do not have information on added sugar for this study, in another study of the same KPNC study population, only about one-third of pregnant women reported adding sugar to their coffee or tea drinks. In addition, it has been reported that about 5% of total daily calories come from added sugar in beverages among women aged 20–39 years. Finally, we controlled for the factors related to maternal obesity and metabolic disorders including maternal prepregnancy BMI, preexisting diabetes and gestational diabetes in the analysis and they did not change the results. Thus, although it cannot be completely ruled out, added sugar in caffeinated beverages is unlikely to explain the observed association.

### ACOG committeeOpinion no. 462: moderate caffeine consumption during pregnancy [^113d46gV]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Moderate caffeine consumption (less than 200 mg per day) does not appear to be a major contributing factor in miscarriage or preterm birth. The relationship of caffeine to growth restriction remains undetermined. A final conclusion cannot be made at this time as to whether there is a correlation between high caffeine intake and miscarriage.

### Maternal caffeine consumption and pregnancy outcomes: a narrative review with implications for advice to mothers and mothers-to-be [^113X5vh6]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The main threats to causal inference of harm from maternal caffeine consumption are generally recognised to be potential confounding from extraneous variables and possible misclassification of exposure and outcome variables. However, contrary to ILSI-affiliated representations of the research literature, caffeine and pregnancy as a field of research is noteworthy for the effort that has been invested in the search for and control of potential confounders, and the frequent use of objective measurement to minimise risk of misclassification. With regard to potential confounding, diverse demographic variables, behaviour patterns and living environment have been repeatedly examined, including age at conception, health status, pregnancy history, use of oral contraceptives, alcohol and other substance use, exposure to pollutants, maternal body mass, physical activity, religion, education and occupation. In addition to these and other variables that have been examined, the accepted main potential confounders, and the ones highlighted in ILSI-affiliated publications, are pregnancy symptoms (also referred to as pregnancy signal symptoms), potential recall bias and maternal cigarette smoking.

Pregnancy symptoms such as nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy are predictive of a healthy pregnancy and, as alluded to above, are often accompanied by a spontaneous reduction in caffeine intake. Accordingly, it was long ago hypothesised that the association between negative pregnancy outcomes and maternal caffeine consumption could be due to a tendency among women who experience few symptoms of pregnancy and are at higher risk of experiencing negative pregnancy outcomes to also consume more caffeine. However, that hypothesis has been extensively examined and has been repeatedly disconfirmed in diverse studies spanning nearly three decades. Notably, disconfirmation has been decisive in the many studies in which potential confounding was controlled by measuring pregnancy symptoms and caffeine consumption prospectively prior to any knowledge of subsequent pregnancy outcomes.

Recall bias has also been shown not to be a sustainable challenge for the straightforward reason that a large proportion of the extant research consists of prospective cohort studies in which caffeine exposure was measured, often confirmed by objective biomarkers, before conception or during early pregnancy, prior to knowledge of pregnancy outcomes. Similarly, prospective measurement, including use of biomarkers, has shown that cigarette smoking is an unlikely source of serious confounding. Indeed, concerns about smoking as a source of confounding have been conclusively disconfirmed by frequent reports of significant caffeine-related negative pregnancy outcomes in nonsmokers and never smokers.

### Maternal caffeine consumption and pregnancy outcomes: a narrative review with implications for advice to mothers and mothers-to-be [^115ycpbg]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Implications for advice guidelines

Much current advice about maternal caffeine consumption is guided by belief that 'moderate' caffeine consumption during pregnancy is safe. Yet, in some instances at least, that belief is based on incomplete analysis. For example, the DGACused a meta-analysis by Greenwood et al as its main source for concluding that the "risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, and SGA births is minimal" (p. 303). However, that claim is essentially untenable even in the context of the evidence reviewed by both groups. Notably, neither Greenwood et al nor the DGACattempted to estimate the potential burden of disease implied by the risk estimates they themselves reported. In reality, aside from the suffering of individuals, the cumulative population impact of the outcomes reported by Greenwood et al and accepted by the DGACare demonstrably neither 'modest' nor 'minimal'

Obviously, not all pregnant women consume the reputedly safe level of 200 mg caffeine per day. Whereas many consume less or none, a sizeable proportion regularly consumes more. In that regard, the dose-response estimates of caffeine-related harm reported by Greenwood et almay be used to gauge the potential population impact assuming a uniform maximum 'safe' level of consumption by all pregnant women. Under those circumstances, the minimum impact, by any reckoning, would be of the order of tens of thousands of avoidable negative pregnancy outcomes per year in the USA alone. Moreover, that number may be assumed to be less than a larger total of potential harm, because it relates only to miscarriage, stillbirth, LBW and SGA while ignoring the negative outcomes of childhood leukaemia and childhood overweight/obesity for which there is good evidence of caffeine-related harm.

### Foetal response to maternal coffee intake: role of habitual versus non-habitual caffeine consumption [^116ks5Ra]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Little is known about the effect on the human foetus of long-term and acute exposure to caffeine. We studied the organisation of foetal sleep-wake states in 13 healthy near-term foetuses over a wide range of maternal plasma caffeine concentrations (0–13 μg/mL) reflecting normal lifestyle conditions (day 0) and again following intake of two cups of regular coffee (~300 mg of caffeine) intermitted by 50 h of abstinence (day 2; acute effects). On either day, 2 h simultaneous recordings were made of foetal heart rate, general-, eye-, and breathing-movements. The recordings were analysed for the presence of each of four foetal behavioural states: quiet- and active-sleep, quiet- and active-wakefulness. There was a linear relationship between maternal caffeine content and the incidence of foetal general movements during active sleep on day 0 (R = 0.74; P < 0.02). After coffee loading on day 2, foetuses of non- or low-caffeine consumers showed increases in active wakefulness (P < 0.001), general movements (P < 0.05) and heart rate variation (P < 0.01) but lower basal heart rate (P < 0.01) compared with their day 0 values. The changes in foetal heart rate (variation) and behaviour occurred between 90 and 180 min post-consumption. In contrast, foetuses of habitual caffeine consumers remained unaffected suggestive of foetal tolerance to caffeine. The results indicate differential performance between foetuses regularly exposed to caffeine and those caffeine-naive, both under normal maternal lifestyle conditions and in response to maternal coffee ingestion.

### Maternal caffeine consumption and pregnancy outcomes: a narrative review with implications for advice to mothers and mothers-to-be [^1121wxPp]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Notwithstanding occasional null results, the substantial consistency in findings from original observational studies of caffeine and LBW/SGA is reflected in meta-analyses. Of the five relevant meta-analyses listed in table 1, all reported results for LBW 80–82 and two reported results for SGA. All five meta-analyses for LBW reported a caffeine-related increased risk. Dose–response analyses found that every additional 100 mg per day of maternal caffeine was associated with an increased risk for LBW of 7% (95% CI 1.01 to 1.12) in one of two meta-analysesand 13% (95% CI 1.06 to 1.21) in the second.

One of the two meta-analyses for SGA reported an aggregated increased risk of 24% (95% CI 1.05 to 1.43) for high caffeine-consuming mothers, and the second reported an increased risk of 10% (95% CI 1.06 to 1.14) for each additional intake of 100 mg caffeine. Notably, similar and higher estimates of risk for SGA were reported in recent observational studies not included in the meta-analyses. Of three such studies, two reported good agreement for increased risk associated with moderate caffeine intake of 16% (95% CI 1.10 to 1.23)and 18% (95% CI 1.10 to 1.27), and the third reported an increased risk of 57% (95% CI 1.16 to 2.13) associated with higher intake.

Preterm birth

Online supplementary table 1 shows that, of four observational studies published since 2000, two reported maternal caffeine consumption to be associated with increased risk of preterm birthand two reported no association. Of three meta-analyses listed in table 1, one reported that high heterogeneity within the published data prevented computation of reliable pooled estimatesand two concluded that maternal caffeine consumption is unrelated to risk of preterm birth, Thus, available meta-analyses suggest that maternal caffeine consumption is not associated with increased risk of preterm birth. On the other hand, it might be noted that publication of all three meta-analyses preceded the two observational studies that reported significant associations. One of those two studies reported an increased risk of preterm birth of 28% (95% CI 1.03 to 1.58) for each increment of 100 mg caffeine consumed per day during pregnancy, and the second reported a 94% (95% CI 1.12 to 3.37) increased risk for the highest quartile of maternal caffeine consumption compared with the lowest quartile.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with birth weight but not with gestational length: results from a large prospective observational cohort study [^116dVTQb]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Caffeine intake from different sources (FFQ data)

Total caffeine intake was associated with slightly increased gestational length, that is, 5 h/100 mg/day (95% CI 3 to 8 h, P < 10⁻⁴) (Table 3). However, linear regression with all different caffeine sources included in the same model revealed that only coffee caffeine was significantly associated with gestational length. When the different caffeine sources were studied individually, it emerged that the association for total caffeine intake resembled that for coffee caffeine intake (8 h/100 mg coffee caffeine/day, 95% CI 5 to 10 h, P < 10⁻⁷). If all sources were studied individually without mutual adjustment, only coffee caffeine remained significantly associated with gestational length (8 h/100 mg coffee caffeine/day; 95% CI 5 to 10 h, P < 10⁻⁶). As we found that coffee is the dominant source of caffeine in high-caffeine consumers, these findings could be explained by a threshold model implying that only coffee drinkers reach the threshold associated with altered gestational length. To rule out this possibility, we compared the coffee caffeine intake categorized into five groups (no intake and for the remaining subjects quartiles 0 to 8.38, 8.39 to 40.71, 40.72 to 110.52, > 110.52 mg/day) finding that compared to the fifth group even group one and two had a significantly shorter gestational length (first group: regression coefficient β = -3.2, P = 0.04, second group: β = -4.2, P = 0.02). After excluding all coffee consumers from the analysis, black tea and chocolate were still not associated with gestational length while caffeinated soft drinks were associated with a 13 h decreased gestational length/100 mg additional caffeine/day (95% CI 1 to 24 h, P = 0.032) in the remaining 17,491 women. In the subgroup of non-coffee consumers, total caffeine intake was significantly associated with 10 h decreased gestational length/100 mg additional caffeine/day (95% CI 1 to 18 h, P = 0.017, adjusted models). When performing the linear regression in only non-smokers (n = 45,053), coffee caffeine was still the only caffeine source significantly associated with gestational length (total caffeine intake 7 h/100 mg caffeine/day, 95% CI 4 to 10 h, P < 10⁻⁵, coffee caffeine 10 h/100 mg caffeine/day, 95% CI 7 to 13 h, P < 10⁻⁹, adjusted models).

### Association between maternal caffeine consumption and metabolism and neonatal anthropometry: a secondary analysis of the NICHD fetal growth studies-singletons [^113ZDfpX]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Caffeine consumption during pregnancy has been an ongoing topic of debate. As of 2010, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women limit caffeine consumption to less than 200 mg per day. However, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported that maternal caffeine consumption, even in doses lower than 200 mg, is associated with a higher risk for low birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), and fetal growth restriction, suggesting there may be no safe amount of caffeine during pregnancy. However, in 1 meta-analysis,4 of 9 studies reported null or contrary results. These inconsistent associations may have been owing to the reliance of most studies on self-reported measures of caffeine intake. Coffee varies in its caffeine content based on preparation method, and serving size of caffeinated beverages may vary across respondents. Additionally, some studies of caffeine consumption did not control for important confounders such as smoking. Further, there are variations in individual caffeine metabolism, such that people with fast metabolism, those with a genetic variant leading to more rapid caffeine metabolism, may be at higher risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, potentially because of higher exposure to paraxanthine, the primary metabolite in caffeine.

To our knowledge, no studies have examined the association between caffeine intake and neonatal anthropometric measures beyond weight, length, and head circumference, and few have analyzed plasma concentrations of caffeine and its metabolites or genetic variations in the rate of metabolism associated with neonatal size. Our aim was to examine associations of caffeine consumption, based on both plasma concentrations of caffeine and its metabolites and self-reported caffeinated beverage intake, with multiple measures of neonatal anthropometry. Our secondary aim was to evaluate whether the association between caffeine consumption and neonatal anthropometry may be moderated by genetic variations in fast vs slow caffeine metabolism.

Gene by environment interaction MR

One genetic variant (rs78000944; MLXIPL) was significantly associated with ever/never consuming coffee during pregnancy (ST22; OR = 1.009, se = 0.003, p = 0.002), and was therefore excluded from the PGS used in the GxE MR. The GxE MR analyses found weak evidence for a positive association between coffee consumption and social communication difficulties at age 8 years amongst mothers who consumed coffee during pregnancy (beta = 0.153, se = 0.071, p = 0.032, N = 16 471). Although not statistically significant, we also detected a positive effect of similar magnitude amongst mothers who did not consume coffee during pregnancy (beta = 0.107, se = 0.134, p = 0.424, N = 4304). There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the consumer and non-consumer GxE MR effect estimates (p = 0.619).

### Maternal caffeine consumption and pregnancy outcomes: a narrative review with implications for advice to mothers and mothers-to-be [^111chvut]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Childhood overweight and obesity

Animal studies have shown that maternal caffeine exposure is associated with long-term changes in metabolic functions under the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Such changes affect regulation by adenosine and/or its receptors involved in development, while also influencing placental expression and transport of leptins essential for regulating appetite. Consequently, the role of maternal caffeine in childhood obesity has emerged as an area of focus in recent human research.

Online supplementary table 1 summarises the findings of four cohort studiesand one case–control study, all published since 2015. With one exception, the studies reported significant associations between maternal caffeine consumption and increased risk of childhood overweight, adiposity and/or obesity. The inconsistent finding was reported in the case–control study, which used data collected more than 50 years ago. A dose–response association was reported in one study, with children of mothers whose caffeine consumption was highest (≥ 150 mg of caffeine per day) experiencing a greater than twofold overall increased risk of obesity (OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.24 to 4.52) at age 5 years compared with children of mothers who consumed no caffeine during pregnancy.

There appear to be no published meta-analyses of maternal caffeine consumption and childhood overweight and obesity, although a recent systematic review concluded that there may be a significant association. Indeed, the authors suggested that maternal caffeine consumption could be a contributing factor in the recent rise in population prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity, and advised that consideration be given to revising current consumption guidelines.

### Assessment of caffeine consumption and maternal cardiometabolic pregnancy complications [^116y3Kzc]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Neither low or moderate caffeinated beverage intake or plasma caffeine and paraxanthine were associated with risk for preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, or blood pressure across pregnancy. Very few women consumed high levels of caffeine, and thus it is difficult to make inferences about risk across the spectrum of potential intake. Null findings between caffeine and preeclampsia are somewhat surprising given that better lipid profiles were observed among women who drank caffeinated beverages in the second trimester and dyslipidemia has been associated with preeclampsia riskand could be due to a lack of statistical power. Prior studies on caffeine or coffee intake in pregnancy and gestational hypertension and preeclampsia risk have been inconsistent. One small study reported no association between second trimester paraxanthine and preecalmpsia. Another study found that mean intake across pregnancy of self-reported caffeinated coffee and tea was not associated with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia risk, although there was an inverse association between intakes of 180 mg/d to 351 mg/d and preeclampsia, which was reported as unexpected and needing replication. The latter study also observed a positive association between third trimester caffeine intake of 360 mg/d to 531 mg/d and systolic blood pressure. Further research about caffeine and gestational hypertension or preeclampsia risk in large cohorts are needed.

Currently ACOG recommends that pregnant women do not consume more than 200 mg/d of caffeine. This recommendation was based on findings that no associations for miscarriage, preterm delivery, or intrauterine growth restriction were observed at levels less than 200 mg/d, but that associations, although inconsistent, were observed between higher caffeine, miscarriage, and growth restriction. While this study could not make a determination for risks associated with caffeine consumption above current recommendations, findings of a lower GDM risk with low and moderate second trimester caffeine consumption do not conflict with current recommendations. Nevertheless, these findings are based on observational data, and therefore, residual confounding cannot be completely ruled out even though major known confounders were adjusted for in this study. Notably, recent systematic reviews, concluded that there was no safe level of caffeine intake in pregnancy based on impacts on offspring outcomes. Similarly, we previously found that caffeine consumption during pregnancy, even in amounts less than the recommended 200 mg per day, was associated with smaller neonatal anthropometric measurements. Therefore, it would not be prudent for women do not drink caffeinated beverages to initiate consumption for the purpose of lowering GDM risk and improving glucose metabolism.

### Association of maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy with child growth [^116ueAnk]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this retrospective cohort analysis of caffeine consumption during pregnancy and longitudinal child growth, maternal caffeine consumption even in amounts lower than currently recommended guidelines of less than 200 mg per day during pregnancy was associated with smaller child height beginning at age 4 years and persisting to age 8 years. The clinical implication of this height difference is unclear and warrants future investigation.

### Preconception caffeine metabolites, caffeinated beverage intake, and fecundability [^113vhozc]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Caffeine is the most frequently used psychoactive substance in the United States and > 90% of reproductive-age women report some amount of intake daily. Despite biological plausibility, previous studies on caffeine and fecundability report conflicting results. Importantly, prior studies measured caffeine exposure exclusively by self-report, which is subject to measurement error and does not account for factors that influence caffeine metabolism.

Objectives

Our objective was to examine associations between preconception serum caffeine metabolites, caffeinated beverage intake, and fecundability.

Methods

Participants included 1228 women aged 18–40 y with a history of 1–2 pregnancy losses in the EAGeR (Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction) trial. We prospectively evaluated associations of preconception caffeine metabolites (i.e., caffeine, paraxanthine, and theobromine) measured from 1191 serum samples untimed to a specific time of day, self-reported usual caffeinated beverage intakes at baseline, and time-varying cycle-average caffeinated beverage intake, with fecundability. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we estimated fecundability odds ratios (FORs) and 95% CIs according to each metabolite. Follow-up was complete for 89% (n = 1088) of participants.

Results

At baseline, 85%, 73%, and 91% of women had detectable serum caffeine, paraxanthine, and theobromine, respectively. A total of 797 women became pregnant during ≤ 6 cycles of preconception follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, neither serum caffeine [tertile (T)3 compared with T1 FOR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.08], paraxanthine (T3 compared with T1 FOR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.75, 1.14), nor theobromine (T3 compared with T1 FOR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.40) were associated with fecundability. Baseline intake of total caffeinated beverages was not associated with fecundability (> 3 compared with 0 servings/d adjusted FOR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.34), nor was caffeinated coffee (> 2 compared with 0 servings/d adjusted FOR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.45, 1.92) or caffeinated soda (> 2 servings/d adjusted FOR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.20).

Conclusions

Our findings are reassuring that caffeine exposure from usual low to moderate caffeinated beverage intake likely does not influence fecundability. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00467363.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and risk of obesity in offspring: a prospective cohort study [^114wsNwS]. International Journal of Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

The observed association between maternal caffeine intake and obesity risk in offspring did not appear to be source specific: caffeine from coffee, soda, tea and other sources were all associated with an increased risk of childhood obesity as long as they contain caffeine (Table 3). The consistent results, regardless of caffeine source, reduce the likelihood that substances other than caffeine may explain the observed association.

To examine whether the observed association between in-utero exposure to high caffeine intake and obesity risk in offspring differed for those with more severe persistent obesity from those with only temporary obesity, we conducted separate analyses for children who were persistently obese, and those who had only transitory obesity. Children with persistent obesity throughout childhood were more likely to have obesity in adulthood, whereas those with occasional measurements reaching obesity level (transitory obesity) were less likely to do so. Results in Table 4 show that the observed dose–response relationship largely existed for persistent obesity only (P = 0.01 for trend test); there was no such a dose–response relationship with transitory obesity (P = 0.10 for trend test).

Similarly, the observed dose–response relationship appeared to differ between girls and boys: the dose–response relationship only existed among girls (P = 0.007 for trend test), but not among boys (P = 0.50 for trend test) (Table 5).

### Maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy and the risk of miscarriage: a prospective cohort study [^114ZvoWc]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to examine whether the risk of miscarriage is associated with caffeine consumption during pregnancy after controlling for pregnancy-related symptoms.

Study Design

This was a population-based prospective cohort study.

Results

An increasing dose of daily caffeine intake during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, compared with no caffeine intake, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.42 (95% confidence interval 0.93 to 2.15) for caffeine intake of less than 200 mg/day, and aHR of 2.23 (1.34 to 3.69) for intake of 200 or more mg/day, respectively. Nausea or vomiting during pregnancy did not materially affect this observed association, nor did the change in intake pattern of caffeine during pregnancy. In addition, the magnitude of the association appeared to be stronger among women without a history of miscarriage (aHR 2.33, 1.48 to 3.67) than that among women with such a history (aHR 0.81, 0.34 to 1.94).

Conclusion

Our results demonstrated that high doses of caffeine intake during pregnancy increase the risk of miscarriage, independent of pregnancy-related symptoms.

### Association of maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy with child growth [^117CLQaT]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Greater caffeine consumption in pregnancy is associated with reduced birth size, but potential associations with childhood growth are unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the associations of pregnancy caffeine and paraxanthine measures with child growth in a contemporary cohort with low caffeine consumption and a historical cohort with high caffeine consumption.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes cohort of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies (ECHO-FGS; 10 sites, 2009–2013) was a pregnancy cohort with 1 child measurement between ages 4 and 8 years (follow-up in 2017–2019). The Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP) was a pregnancy cohort (12 sites, 1959–1965) with child follow-up through 8 years (1960–1974). The current secondary analysis was conducted in 2021 and 2022.

Exposures

Concentrations of caffeine and its primary metabolite, paraxanthine, were quantified from plasma (ECHO-FGS) and serum (CPP) collected in the first trimester. Cut points for analyses were defined by quartiles in ECHO-FGS and quintiles in CPP.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Child z scores for body mass index, weight, and height were evaluated, as well as fat mass index and percentage and obesity risk measured at 1 time between age 4 and 8 years in ECHO-FGS. In a secondary analysis of the CPP cohort, child z scores and obesity risk longitudinally through age 8 years were evaluated.

Results

In ECHO-FGS (median caffeine intake < 50 mg/d), 788 children (mean [SD] age, 6.8 [1.0] years; 411 boys [52.2%]) of women in the fourth vs first quartile of plasma caffeine concentrations had lower height z scores (β = -0.21; 95% CI, -0.41 to -0.02), but differences in weight z scores were only observed in the third quartile (β = -0.27; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.07). In CPP, beginning at age 4 years, 1622 children (805 boys [49.7%]) of women in the highest caffeine quintile group had lower height z scores than their peers from the lowest group, with the gap widening with each successive year of age (β = -0.16 [95% CI, -0.31 to -0.01] at 4 years; β = -0.37 [95% CI, -0.57 to -0.16] at 8 years). There were slight reductions in weight at ages 5 to 8 years for children in the third vs first caffeine quintile (β = -0.16 to -0.22). Results were consistent for paraxanthine concentrations in both cohorts.

Conclusions and Relevance

Intrauterine exposure to increasing levels of caffeine and paraxanthine, even in low amounts, was associated with shorter stature in early childhood. The clinical implication of reductions in height and weight is unclear; however, the reductions were apparent even with levels of caffeine consumption below clinically recommended guidelines of less than 200 mg per day.

### Pregnancy myths and practical tips [^116e1E3a]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

For many patients, pregnancy is a highly anticipated and exciting phase of life, but it can also be anxiety provoking. Family physicians can resolve some of this anxiety and promote maternal and fetal health by making specific recommendations at prenatal visits. A daily prenatal vitamin with at least 400 mcg of folic acid and 30 mg of elemental iron should be recommended to promote neurologic and musculoskeletal fetal development. Weight gain in pregnancy should be guided by preconception body mass index. People who are underweight should gain 28 to 40 lb, those who have a normal weight should gain 25 to 35 lb, and those who are overweight or obese should gain 15 to 25 lb or 11 to 20 lb, respectively. A well-balanced diet including omega-3 fatty acids should be encouraged. Unpasteurized foods should be avoided during pregnancy because of the risk of listeriosis. Caffeine intake should be limited to 200 mg per day (about two small cups of coffee), and artificial sweeteners should be avoided. Pregnant patients should be encouraged to engage in regular cardiovascular activity for at least 150 minutes per week. Bed rest is not recommended. Sex can be continued throughout an uncomplicated pregnancy. Avoidance of alcohol and marijuana is recommended. The effects of hair dye or hair straightening products on fetal development or neonatal outcomes are unclear.

### Sources of dietary recommendations and adherence to clinical guidelines in pregnant women in Germany [^114FbfEC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Caffeine consumption during pregnancy, however, remains controversial. While a daily caffeine intake of 200 mg is considered safe, higher doses have been associated with an increased risk of miscarriages and reduced birth weights. During dietary consultations, it is necessary to educate pregnant women that not only coffee but also black and green tea, mate tea, and energy drinks contain caffeine. For health reasons, the German Nutrition Society (DGE) recommends completely avoiding energy drinks during pregnancy.

However, restrictions should be limited to high-risk foods and substances. Overly restrictive eating behaviors are counterproductive. Contrary to popular belief, the avoidance of specific foods to reduce the child's allergy risk is not backed up by evidence. Instead, expectant mothers should follow a well-balanced diet that contains all essential nutrients.

Overall, evidence indicates that dietary practices during pregnancy profoundly affect fetal development and the child's long-term health outcomes. Despite this, recent studies reveal persistent gaps in adherence to nutritional recommendations. In Germany, pregnant women show a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency compared with nonpregnant women, particularly during the third trimester and in winter months. Furthermore, a majority of pregnant women across Europe do not meet the recommended intake levels for iodine, folic acid, and iron. Collectively, these findings suggest that pregnant women in Germany may not be meeting their nutritional requirements. Therefore, more extensive research is warranted to achieve a thorough understanding of the current dietary patterns of pregnant women in Germany and to develop targeted interventions for enhancing their nutritional status.

Moreover, no recent studies have examined the sources through which pregnant women in Germany acquire nutritional information. Possible sources encompass guidance from healthcare professionals (HCPs), such as gynecologists and midwives, and online resources. In addition, women frequently embrace complementary and alternative medicine for vitamins, herbal supplements, and nutritional counseling, with such services commonly being offered by their HCPs.

Despite the growing awareness of the significance of nutrition during pregnancy, a substantial research gap persists in the comprehension of the sources and quality of information on this critical subject. While previous studies have explored specific nutritional aspects relevant to pregnant women in Germany, comprehensive data on the diverse array of information channels used by pregnant women for dietary guidance are still missing. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the dietary habits and recommendations of pregnant women in Germany through an online survey.

### Associations of maternal caffeine intake with birth outcomes: results from the lifeways cross generation cohort study [^1148Qig9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Maternal caffeine intake is associated with adverse birth outcomes, but in most studies the primary caffeine source is coffee; the influence of tea caffeine remains unclear.

Objective

The aim of the study was to examine the association between maternal caffeine intake and birth outcomes in a population with tea as the predominant caffeine source.

Design

Data from 941 Irish mother-child pairs of the Lifeways Cross Generation Cohort Study were examined. Maternal dietary intakes in early pregnancy were assessed using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Caffeine intake was derived from coffee, tea, soft drinks, and cocoa-containing foods and beverages. Associations of maternal caffeine intake with continuous (birth weight, birth length, and gestational age) and binary [low birth weight (LBW) (< 2500 g) and preterm birth (PB) (< 37 wk gestational age)] birth outcomes were investigated using multiple linear and logistic regressions, respectively, with adjustment for potential confounders.

Results

Tea was the predominant caffeine source (48%), followed by coffee (39%). In the fully adjusted model, maternal caffeine intake was associated with lower birth weight [β (95% CI): -71.9 (-105.4, -38.4) g · 100 mg⁻¹ · d⁻¹ caffeine increment], shorter birth length [-0.30 (-0.49, -0.11) cm], smaller head circumference [-0.12 (-0.24, -0.01) cm], and shorter gestational age [-0.13 (-0.25, -0.02) wk]; higher risks for LBW [OR (95% CI): 1.47 (1.14, 1.90)] and PB [1.36 (1.07, 1.74)] were also observed (all P < 0.05). The associations were robust to the exclusion of participants with pregnancy complications and in never smokers. Similar higher risks of adverse birth outcomes were observed for the highest caffeine intake categories from coffee [ORLBW: 3.10 (1.08, 8.89); ORPB: 2.74 (1.05, 7.16)] and tea [ORLBW: 2.47 (1.02, 6.01); ORPB: 2.56 (1.14, 5.75)], compared with the lowest intake categories (all P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Maternal caffeine intake from both coffee and tea is associated with adverse birth outcomes. This prospective observational study was registered at ISRCTN Registry as ISRCTN16537904.

### Assessment of caffeine consumption and maternal cardiometabolic pregnancy complications [^1178V87P]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Strengths include prospective analysis based on a multicenter diverse cohort with comprehensive confounding factors and repeated assessments of caffeine intake. Availability of first trimester plasma caffeine and paraxanthine was also a strength as it avoids recall bias and also captures additional sources of caffeine such as decaffeinated coffee or chocolate. Additionally, associations with fasting cardiometabolic profiles were assessed to further understand etiology of findings.

Limitations

The sample size was not large enough to separate analyses by beverage type and may have had limited power to detect associations due to small number of women with pregnancy complications. However, inclusion of continuous measures of glucose, blood pressure, and cardiometabolic markers addressed this limitation to some degree. Timing of diagnosis with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia was unknown, and therefore, whether caffeinated beverage intake later in pregnancy is associated with blood pressure, hypertension or preeclampsia risk requires future study. Also, the self-reported exposure represents caffeine from beverages only; notably only 2 women took medications containing caffeine.

### Mendelian randomization analysis of maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy on offspring neurodevelopmental difficulties in the Norwegian mother, father and child cohort study (MoBa) [^1173MZoP]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Several observational epidemiological studies have investigated the relationship between maternal coffee/caffeine consumption during pregnancy and offspring neurodevelopment; however, they have yielded inconsistent results (James). Many have found that increased maternal caffeine consumption is associated with offspring neurodevelopmental difficulties (NDs) (Hvolgaard Mikkelsen, Obel, Olsen, Niclasen, & Bech; Nishihara et al; Patti et al; Zhang, Manza, & Volkow,), and one study reported that the effects differed according to caffeine source (i.e. an effect for soft drink but not tea or coffee) (Bekkhus, Skjøthaug, Nordhagen, & Borge). However, a number of other observational studies have reported no meaningful relationship between maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy and offspring NDs (Berglundh et al; Klebanoff & Keim; Linnet et al; Loomans et al.).

Observational epidemiological studies of maternal coffee/caffeine consumption during pregnancy and offspring neurodevelopment are unlikely to sufficiently control for environmental and genetic confounders. Coffee and caffeine consumption are strongly positively associated with potential confounders such as age, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and negatively with maternal educational attainment (Brice & Smith; Hewlett & Smith; Papadopoulou et al; Torvik et al; Treur et al.). Even when these confounders are accounted for, reporting biases and measurement error can render attempts at adjustment insufficient. For example, it has been proposed that while coffee consumption may be accurately reported, stigmatized behaviors such as smoking and drinking alcohol, especially during pregnancy, may be underreported and therefore adjustment may only partially remove their confounding effect (Cornelis & Munafo). Additionally, genetic confounding may also be an issue for observational studies– where for example, maternal coffee consumption, smoking, and/or alcohol consumption could be linked to maternal neurodevelopmental or psychiatric traits (e.g. ADHD, impulsivity, or anxiety), whose genetic predisposition can then be transmitted to offspring and influence their neurodevelopment (Havdahl et al; Hvolgaard Mikkelsen et al.).

### Caffeine's implications for women's health and survey of obstetrician-gynecologists' caffeine knowledge and assessment practices [^1159wivJ]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Caffeine has relevance for women's health and pregnancy, including significant associations with spontaneous abortion and low birth weight. According to scientific data, pregnant women and women of reproductive age should be advised to limit their caffeine consumption. This article reviews the implications of caffeine for women's psychological and physical health, and presents data on obstetrician-gynecologists' (ob-gyns) knowledge and practices pertaining to caffeine.

Methods

Ob-gyns (N = 386) who are members of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Collaborative Ambulatory Research Network responded to a 21-item survey about caffeine.

Results

Although most knew that caffeine is passed through breast milk, only 24.8% were aware that caffeine metabolism significantly slows as pregnancy progresses. Many respondents were not aware of the caffeine content of commonly used products, such as espresso and Diet Coke, with 14.3% and 57.8% indicating amounts within an accurate range, respectively. Furthermore, ob-gyns did not take into account large differences in caffeine content across different caffeinated beverages with most recommending one to two servings of coffee or tea or soft drinks per day. There was substantial inconsistency in what was considered to be "high levels" of maternal caffeine consumption, with only 31.6% providing a response. When asked to indicate the risk that high levels of caffeine have on various pregnancy outcomes, responses were not consistent with scientific data. For example, respondents overestimated the relative risk of stillbirths and underestimated the relative risk of spontaneous abortion. There was great variability in assessment and advice practices pertaining to caffeine. More than half advise their pregnant patients to consume caffeine under certain circumstances, most commonly to alleviate headache and caffeine withdrawal.

Conclusions

The data suggest that ob-gyns could benefit from information about caffeine and its relevance to their clinical practice. The development of clinical practice guidelines for caffeine may prove to be useful.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with risk of low birth weight: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^112ftSWZ]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

We also conducted a meta-analysis of studies of caffeine intake and birth weight as a continuous outcome variable. As compared with the reference group with no or very low caffeine intake, birth weight was 9 g lower in the low caffeine intake group (95% CI −16 to 35), 33 g lower in the moderate caffeine intake group (95% CI 4 to 63), and 69 g lower in the high caffeine intake group (95% CI 35 to 102) (Figure 4). The heterogeneity in study results was low (I² = 0.0% for low and high caffeine intakes, and 0.3% for moderate caffeine intake). As the results in the study by Brooke et al. were reported separately for smokers and non-smokers, the potential impact of including two data points from the same study was assessed by excluding either of the data points, but the heterogeneity remained low (I² = 0.0% for low and high caffeine intakes, and around 13% for moderate caffeine intake). For studies that were included for qualitative review only [see Additional file 3], higher maternal caffeine intake was consistently associated with lower birth weight and this association was significant in five out of six studies.

### Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with risk of low birth weight: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^112AKqXz]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The exact mechanism through which caffeine may impair fetal growth remains unsettled. One of the hypothesized mechanisms is that caffeine increases the release of catecholamines, which may lead to vasoconstriction in the uteroplacental circulation and fetal hypoxia and eventually affect fetal growth and development. Indeed, a 25% reduction in intervillous placental blood flow after maternal ingestion of just 200 mg of caffeine has been documented. Another hypothesis is that caffeine increases the cellular concentration of cyclic AMP by inhibiting phosphodiesterase, an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of cyclic AMP. A built-up of cyclic AMP may influence cell division or lead to catecholamine-mediated vasoconstriction, thus affecting fetal growth.

### Associations of maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy with abdominal and liver fat deposition in childhood [^1124twxL]. Pediatric Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

4.1 Interpretation of main findings

Caffeine‐containing beverages are frequently consumed during pregnancy. Increasing evidence suggests that maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy might be related to long‐term offspring body fat development. 10, 11, 12, 39 We previously showed among 7857 6‐year‐old children from the same cohort as the current study that maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy of ≥ 4 units per day was associated with a higher body mass index and total body fat mass. Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy of ≥ 6 units per day was also associated with a higher android/gynoid fat mass ratio, reflecting a central body fat accumulation. 10 A study among 272 mother‐child pairs from Brazil observed that any caffeine intake by women with an uncomplicated pregnancy was associated with a higher offspring sum of skinfold thicknesses at age 3 months. 39 A study among 50 943 participants from Norway showed that any caffeine intake during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of childhood overweight at ages 3 and 5, whereas at 8 years, this association was only present for high caffeine intakes. 12 In an Irish study among 558 mother‐child pairs, higher maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy was associated with higher risks of overall and central obesity at the ages of 5 and 9 years. 13 In line with these previous studies, we observed in the current study that higher maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy was associated with higher body mass index, total body fat mass, and android/gynoid fat mass ratio at the age of 10 years, as indicated by significant tests for trend. The strongest effects were present for maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy 4 or more units per day. For instance, as compared with children whose mothers consumed < 2 units of caffeine per day, children whose mothers consumed ≥ 6 units of caffeine per day during their pregnancy had a 0.24 SD higher body mass index, corresponding to a difference of approximately 0.7 kg/m². These effect sizes are comparable with those observed for well‐known determinants of childhood body mass index, such as maternal pre‐pregnancy overweight and smoking during pregnancy. 40, 41, 42 These associations were similar across the trimesters of pregnancy. Mothers with high caffeine intakes during pregnancy also had higher alcohol intakes and smoked more often during their pregnancies. However, associations were present across the full range of maternal caffeine intake, and adjusting the models for these lifestyle‐related factors did not influence the results. We therefore do not consider it likely that the observed associations can be fully explained by differences in these factors. Thus, these findings suggest that maternal caffeine intake throughout pregnancy has long‐term consequences for offspring body fat development, as reflected by higher total body fat mass and a central body fat distribution.

### Association between maternal caffeine consumption and metabolism and neonatal anthropometry: a secondary analysis of the NICHD fetal growth studies-singletons [^114cMe8q]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Higher caffeine consumption during pregnancy has been associated with lower birth weight. However, associations of caffeine consumption, based on both plasma concentrations of caffeine and its metabolites, and self-reported caffeinated beverage intake, with multiple measures of neonatal anthropometry, have yet to be examined.

Objective

To evaluate the association between maternal caffeine intake and neonatal anthropometry, testing effect modification by fast or slow caffeine metabolism genotype.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A longitudinal cohort study, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Singletons, enrolled 2055 nonsmoking women at low risk for fetal growth abnormalities with complete information on caffeine consumption from 12 US clinical sites between 2009 and 2013. Secondary analysis was completed in 2020.

Exposures

Caffeine was evaluated by both plasma concentrations of caffeine and paraxanthine and self-reported caffeinated beverage consumption measured/reported at 10–13 weeks gestation. Caffeine metabolism defined as fast or slow using genotype information from the single nucleotide variant rs762551 (CYP1A2✱1F).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Neonatal anthropometric measures, including birth weight, length, and head, abdominal, arm, and thigh circumferences, skin fold and fat mass measures. The β coefficients represent the change in neonatal anthropometric measure per SD change in exposure.

Results

A total of 2055 participants had a mean (SD) age of 28.3 (5.5) years, mean (SD) body mass index of 23.6 (3.0), and 580 (28.2%) were Hispanic, 562 (27.4%) were White, 518 (25.2%) were Black, and 395 (19.2%) were Asian/Pacific Islander. Delivery occurred at a mean (SD) of 39.2 (1.7) gestational weeks. Compared with the first quartile of plasma caffeine level (≤ 28 ng/mL), neonates of women in the fourth quartile (> 659 ng/mL) had lower birth weight (β = -84.3 g; 95% CI, -145.9 to -22.6 g; P = 0.04 for trend), length (β = -0.44 cm; 95% CI, -0.78 to -0.12 cm; P = 0.04 for trend), and head (β = -0.28 cm; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.09 cm; P < .001 for trend), arm (β = -0.25 cm; 95% CI, -0.41 to -0.09 cm: P = 0.02 for trend), and thigh (β = -0.29 cm; 95% CI, -0.58 to -0.04 cm; P = 0.07 for trend) circumference. Similar reductions were observed for paraxanthine quartiles, and for continuous measures of caffeine and paraxanthine concentrations. Compared with women who reported drinking no caffeinated beverages, women who consumed approximately 50 mg per day (~1/2 cup of coffee) had neonates with lower birth weight (β = -66 g; 95% CI, -121 to -10 g), smaller arm (β = -0.17 cm; 95% CI, -0.31 to -0.02 cm) and thigh (β = -0.32 cm; 95% CI, -0.55 to -0.09 cm) circumference, and smaller anterior flank skin fold (β = -0.24 mm; 95% CI, -0.47 to -0.01 mm). Results did not differ by fast or slow caffeine metabolism genotype.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, small reductions in neonatal anthropometric measurements with increasing caffeine consumption were observed. Findings suggest that caffeine consumption during pregnancy, even at levels much lower than the recommended 200 mg per day of caffeine, are associated with decreased fetal growth.

### Mendelian randomization analysis of maternal coffee consumption during pregnancy on offspring neurodevelopmental difficulties in the Norwegian mother, father and child cohort study (MoBa) [^113pm6UJ]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Three maternal coffee consumption variables were derived from self-reported dietary intake variables in MoBa Questionnaire 1 (administered at gestational week 15; reports of coffee consumption before pregnancy and at week 15) and Questionnaire 2 (week 22). For each timepoint, maternal coffee consumption (cups/day) was calculated from reported intake of filtered, instant and boiled coffees as well as lattes and espressos. Paternal coffee consumption (cups/day) was also derived from self-reports in the Father's Questionnaire (week 15). Maternal and paternal caffeine intake (mg/day) were also calculated using an approach previously described in a MoBa study (Papadopoulou et al.). In short, multiple caffeine intake variables (mg/day; before pregnancy, week 15 and week 22) were derived by aggregating caffeine from all sources available in the questionnaires (several types of coffee, black and herbal tea, soft drink, and energy drinks) (Papadopoulou et al.). Individuals who had consumed greater than 3.5L of coffee per day were excluded from all analyses (Papadopoulou et al.).

Maternal smoking (cigarettes/week) was available at three timepoints (the last 3 months before pregnancy, at week 15 and week 30). Binary smoking (yes/no) variables were also derived for each time point. Maternal alcohol frequency (weekly) was assessed at five timepoints by the question 'How often did you consume alcohol' (i.e. times per week; last 3 months before pregnancy; week 0–12 (referred to as week 12), week 15; week 13–24 (referred to as week 24); and week 25 + (referred to as week 30)). Binary alcohol consumption (yes/no) variables were derived for each time point. Socioeconomic variables were extracted from Questionnaire 1. The highest level of education completed by both mothers and fathers was transformed into years of education according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ST1). Maternal and paternal gross yearly incomes in Norwegian Kroner (NOK) were also obtained, and each income bracket was converted to its respective midpoint (ST1). We note that all analyses involving income also included birth year, to account for some of the differing effects of income over time.

### Maternal caffeine consumption and pregnancy outcomes: a narrative review with implications for advice to mothers and mothers-to-be [^113cBy9f]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Stillbirth

Findings for stillbirth were largely consistent, with four of five observational studies reporting caffeine-related increased risk (online supplementary table 1). Notably, the sole inconsistent study reporting a non-significant result for stillbirth (loss after 20 weeks of pregnancy) reported a significantly increased risk for miscarriage (loss before 20 weeks). In the other studies, the increased risk for high caffeine-consuming women was variously reported to be approximately twofold (95% CI 1.23 to 4.41), threefold (95% CI 1.5 to 5.9)and fivefold (95% CI 1.6 to 16.4)after adjustment for potential confounders.

One study examined polymorphisms of the genes that encode enzymes responsible for caffeine metabolism in order to test the hypothesis that 'slow metabolisers' may be at increased risk. While no single genotype was associated with risk, a combination of three separate genes that contribute to a slower rate of caffeine metabolism was found to be associated with an almost twofold increased risk compared with other genotype combinations. Regarding relevant meta-analyses, table 1 shows that both of two studies reported significant associations, with increased risk of stillbirth per 100 mg caffeine per day estimated in one study to be 9% (95% CI 1.02 to 1.12)and in the other to be 19% (95% CI 1.05 to 1.35).

### Caffeine exposure during pregnancy, small for gestational age birth and neonatal outcome-results from the Norwegian mother and child cohort study [^1146czHi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4
Possible causal structures for the association of maternal caffeine intake, birth weight/SGA, and neonatal intervention. The figure presents four different directed acyclic graphs illustrating possible associations between maternal caffeine intake, birth weight/SGA and neonatal intervention

Results for the different caffeine sources gave the same results except for caffeine from chocolate, which was associated with an increased risk for neonatal intervention in the adjusted analyses. We have no explanation for this and the finding for chocolate is probably due to chance or residual confounding. Habitual intake of coffee and tea is easier to recall than intakes of caffeine-containing soft drinks, chocolate containing foods and plain chocolate as consumption of these items is less regular than coffee and tea. Furthermore, individuals tend to underreport foods perceived as unhealthy more than foods perceived as healthy. Estimated intake of caffeine from chocolate was low, 50% of the women had chocolate caffeine intake lower than 4.3 mg/day (interquartile range: 2.2–9.5 mg/day). Thus, the chocolate caffeine variable is less comparable to the other variables and might capture other qualities of a woman's dietary habits such as having snacks between meals, amount of sweets consumed etc.

To our knowledge, only few studies have evaluated the effect of prenatal caffeine exposure on neonatal health other than birth weight – e.g. neonatal death, sudden infant death and neonatal heart rate. Some studies focused on stillbirth. However, we did not find any studies with comparable outcomes as in this study. A small study from Finland (n = 20) suggests that high caffeine intake during pregnancy (300–600 mg/day, equal to 3–6 cups of coffee/day) may increase catecholamine levels in the fetus and lead to placental vasoconstriction. A study by Resh et al. presented increased contraction rates of surgically isolated fetal hearts when kept in a nutrient solution containing up to 1 mmol/L caffeine. The authors suggested a possible effect of moderate to excessive intake of caffeine during pregnancy on irregular fetal heart rate, leading to impaired fetal oxygenation.

### Maternal food consumption during pregnancy and risk of advanced β-cell autoimmunity in the offspring [^116MraXA]. Pediatric Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence for a putative role of maternal diet during pregnancy in the development of β-cell autoimmunity in the child is scarce. The authors study the association of food consumption during pregnancy and the development of β-cell autoimmunity in the offspring.

Subjects and Methods

A prospective Finnish birth cohort of 4297 infants with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1-conferred susceptibility to type 1 diabetes and their mothers. Blood samples were collected from the children at 3–12 months intervals to measure type 1 diabetes-associated antibodies: antibodies against islet cells (ICA), insulin, glutamate dehydroxylase, and islet antigen 2. The mothers completed a validated food frequency questionnaire. The end-point was repeated positivity for ICA together with at least one of the other three antibodies. Piecewise-exponential survival models were used. The effective sample size was 3723, with 138 end-points. The median follow-up time was 4.4 years.

Results

Maternal consumption of butter, low-fat margarines, berries, and coffee were inversely associated with the development of advanced β-cell autoimmunity in the offspring, adjusted for genetic risk group and familial diabetes. These associations for low-fat margarines (use vs. non-use HR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.38–0.93, p = 0.02), berries (continuous variable HR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83–0.98, p = 0.02) and coffee (highest quarter vs. lowest HR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.40–0.97, p = 0.04), remained significant when adjusting for potential confounding sociodemographic, perinatal, and other dietary factors.

Conclusions

In this study assessing total food consumption of the mother during pregnancy, only few among the 27 food groups tested were weakly related to the development of advanced β-cell autoimmunity in Finnish children.
